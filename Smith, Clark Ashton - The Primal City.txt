the primal city clark ashton smith in these afterdays when all things are touched with insoluble doubt i am not sure of the purpose that had taken us into that littlevisited land i recall however that we had found explicit mention in a volume of which we possessed the one existing copy of certain vast primordial ruins lying amid the bare plateaus and stark pinnacles of the region how we had acquired the volume i do not remember but sebastian polder and i had given our youth and manhood to the quest of hidden knowledge and this book was a compendium of all things that men have forgotten or ignored in their desire to repudiate the inexplicable we being enamoured of mystery and seeking ever for the clues that material science has disregarded pondered much upon these pages written in an antique alphabet the location of the ruins was clearly stated though in terms of an obsolete geography and i remember our excitement when we had marked the position on a terrestrial globe we were consumed by a wild eagerness to visit the alien city perhaps we wished to verify a strange and fearful theory which we had formed regarding the nature of the earths primal inhabitants perhaps we sought to recover the buried records of a lost science or perhaps there was some other and darker objective i recall nothing of the first stages of our journey which must have been long and arduous but i recall distinctly that we travelled for many days amid the bleak treeless uplands that rose like a manytiered embankment towards the range of high pyramidal summits guarding the secret city our guide was a native of the country sodden and taciturn with intelligence little above that of the llamas who carried our supplies but we had been assured that he knew the way to the ruins which had long been forgotten by most of his fellowcountrymen rare and scant was the local legendry regarding the place and its builders and after many queries we could add nothing to the knowledge gained from the immemorial volume the city it seemed was nameless and the region about it was untrodden by man desire and curiosity raged within us like a calenture and we heeded little the hazards and travails of our journey over us stood the eternally vacant heavensmatching the vacant landscape the route steepened and above us now was a wilderness of cragged and chasmed rock where nothing dwelt but the sinister widewinged condors often we lost sight of certain eminent peaks that had served us for landmarks but it seemed that our guide knew the way as if led by an instinct more subtle than memory or intelligence and at no time did he hesitate at intervals we came to the broken fragments of a paved road that had formerly traversed the whole of this rugged region broad cyclopean blocks of gneiss channelled as if by the storms of cycles older than human history and in some of the deeper chasms we saw the eroded piers of great bridges that had spanned them in other time these ruins reassured us for in the primordial volume there was mention of a highway and of mighty bridges leading to the fabulous city polder and i were exultant and yet we both shivered with a curious terror when we tried to read certain inscriptions that were still deeply engraved on the worn stones no living man though erudite in all the tongues of earth could have deciphered those characters and perhaps it was their very alienage that frightened us we had sought diligently during many years for all that transcends the dead level of mortality through age or remoteness or strangeness we had longed for the elder and darker secrets but such longing was not incompatible with fear better than those who had walked always in the common paths we knew the perils that might attend our exorbitant and solitary researches often we had debated with variously fantastic conjectures the enigma of the mountainbuilded city but towards our journeys end when the vestiges of that pristine people multiplied around us we fell into long periods of silence sharing the taciturnity of our stolid guide thoughts came to us that were overly strange for utterance the chill of elder eons entered our hearts from the ruins and did not depart we toiled on between the desolate rocks and the sterile heavens breathing an air that became thin and painful to the lungs as if from some admixture of cosmic ether at high noon we reached an open pass and saw before us at the end of a long and vertiginous perspective the city that had been described as an unnamed ruin in a volmne antedating all other known books the place was built on an inner peak of the range surrounded by snowless summits little sterner and loftier than itself on one side the peak fell in a thousandfoot precipice from the overhanging ramparts on another it was terraced with wild cliffs but the third side flung towards us was no more than a steep and broken acclivity the rock of the whole mountain was strangely ruinous and black but the city walls though equally worn and riven were conspicuous above it at a distance of leagues being plainly of megalithic vastness polder and i beheld the bourn of our worldwide search with unvoiced thoughts and emotions the indian made no comment pointing impassively towards the far summit with its crown of ruins we hurried on wishing to complete our journey by daylight and after plunging into an abysmal valley we began at midafternoon the ascent of the slope towards the city it was like climbing amid the overthrown and fireblasted blocks of a titan citadel everywhere the slope was rent into huge obliquely angled masses often partly vitrified plainly at some former time it had been subjected to the action of intense heat and yet there were no volcanic craters in that vicinity i felt a vague sense of awe and terror as i recalled a passage in the old volume hinting ambiguously at the fate that had long ago destroyed the citys inhabitants for the people of that city had reared its walls and towers too high amid the region of the clouds and the clouds came down in their anger and smote the city with dreadful fires and thereafter the place was peopled no more by those primal giants who had built it but had only the clouds for inhabitants and custodians we had left our three llamas at the slopes bottom merely taking with us provisions for one night thus unhampered we made fair progress in spite of the evervarying obstacles offered by the shattered scarps after a while we came to the hewn steps of a stairway mounting towards the summit but the steps had been wrought for the feet of colossi and in many places were part of the heaved and tilted ruin so they did not greatly facilitate our climbing tbe sun was still high above western pass behind us and i was surprised as we went on by a sudden deepening of the charlike blackness on the rocks turning i saw that several greyish vapoury masses which might have been either clouds or smoke were drifting about the summits that overlooked the pass and one of these masses rearing like a limbless figure upright and colossal had interposed itself between us and the sun i called the attention of my companions to this phenomenon for clouds were almost unheardof amid those arid mountains in summer and the presence of smoke would have been equally hard to explain moreover the grey masses were different from any cloudforms we had ever seen they possessed a peculiar capacity and sharpness of outline a baffling suggestion of weight and solidity moving sluggishly into the heavens above the pass they preserved their original contours and their separateness they seemed to swell and tower coming towards us on the blue air from which as yet no lightest breath of wind had reached us floating thus they maintained the erectness of massive columns or of giants marching on a plain i think we all felt an alarm that was none the less urgent for its vagueness somehow from that instant it seemed that we were penned up by unknown powers and were cut off from all possibility of retreat all at once the dim legends of the ancient volume had assumed a menacing reality we had ventured into a place of hidden peril and the peril was upon us in the movement of the clouds there was something alert deliberate and implacable polder spoke with a sort of horror in his voice uttering the thought that had already occurred to me they are the sentinels who guard this region and they have espied us we heard a harsh cry from the indian who stood gazing and pointing upwards several of the unnatural cloudshapes had appeared on the summit towards which we were climbing above the megalithic ruins some arose halfhidden by the walls as if from behind a breastwork others stood as it were on the topmost towers and battlements bulking in portentous menace like the cumuli of a thunderstorm then with terrifying swiftness many more of the cloudpresences towered from the four quarters emerging from behind the great peaks or assuming sudden visibility in midair with equal and effortless speed as if convoked by an unheard command they gathered in converging lines up the eyrielike ruins we the climbers and the whole slope about us and the valley below were plunged in a twilight cast by the clouds the air was still windless but it weighed upon us as if burdened with the wings of a thousand evil demons we were overwhelmingly conscious of our exposed position for we had paused on a wide landing of the mountainhewn steps we could have concealed ourselves amid the huge fragments on the slope but for the nonce we were too exhausted to be capable of the simplest movement the rarity of the air had left us weak and gasping and the chill of altitude crept into us in a closeranged army the clouds mustered above and around us they rose into the very zenith swelling to insuperable vastness and darkening like tartarean gods the sun had disappeared leaving no faintest beam to prove that it still hung unfallen and undestroyed in the heavens i felt that i was crushed into the very stone by the eyeless regard of that awful assemblage judging and condemning us we had i thought trespassed upon a region conquered long ago by strange elemental entities and forbidden henceforward to man we had approached their very citadel and now we must meet the doom our rashness had invited such thoughts like a black lightning flared in my brain even as my logic tried to analyse the reason for the thoughts now for the first time i became aware of sound if the word can be applied to a sensation so anomalous it was as if the oppression that weighed upon me had become audible as if palpable thunders poured over and past me i felt and heard them in every nerve and they roared through my brain like torrents from the opened floodgates of some tremendous weir in a world of genii downwards upon us with limbless atlantean stridings there swept the cloudy cohorts their swiftness was that of mountainsweeping winds the air was riven as if by the tumult of a thousand tempests was rife with an unmeasured elemental malignity recall but partially the events that ensued but the impression of insufferable darkness of demonic clamour and trampling and the pressure of thunderous onset remains forever indelible also there were voices that called out with the stridour of clarions in a war of gods uttering ominous syllables that mans ear could never seize before those vengeful shapes we could not stand for an instant we hurled ourselves madly down the shadowed steps of the giant stairs polder and the guide were a little ahead of me and i saw them in that baleful twilight through sheets of sudden rain on the verge of a deep chasm which in our ascent had compelled us to much circumambulation i saw than fall together and yet i swear that they did not fall into the chasm for one of the clouds was upon them whirling over them even as they fell there was a fusion as of forms beheld in delirium for an instant the two men were like vapours that swelled and swirled towering high as the cloud that had covered them and the cloud itself was a misty janus with two heads and bodies melting into its column after that i remember nothing more except the sense of vertiginous falling by some miracle i must have reached the edge of the chasm and flung myself into its depths without being overtaken as the others had been how i escaped is forevermore an enigma when i returned to awareness stars were peering down like chill incurious eyes between black and jagged lips of rock the air had turned sharp with nightfall in a mountain land my body ached with a hundred bruises and my right forearm was limp and useless when i tried to raise myself a dark mist of horror stifled my thoughts struggling to my feet with painracked effort i called aloud though i knew that none would answer me then striking match after match i searched the chasm and found myself as i had expected alone nowhere was there any trace of my companions they had vanished utterly as clouds vanish somehow by night with a broken arm i climbed from the steep fissure i must have made my way down the frightful mountainside and out of that namelessly haunted and guarded land i remember that the sky was clear that the stars were undimmed by any semblance of cloud and that somewhere in the valley i found one of our llamas still laden with its stock of provisions plainly i was not pursued by the clouds perhaps they were concerned only with the warding of that mysterious primal city from human intrusion some day i shall learn their true nature and entity and the secret of those ruinous walls and crumbling keeps and the fate of my companions but still through my nightly dreams and diurnal visions the dark shapes move with the tumult and thunder of a thousand storms my soul is crushed into the earth with the burden of fear and they pass over me with the speed and vastness of vengeful gods and i hear their voices calling like clarions in the sky with ominous worldshaking syllables that the ear can never seize
