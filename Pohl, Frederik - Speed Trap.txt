speed trap my reservation was for a window seat up front because on this particular flight they serve from the front back but on the seat next to mine i saw a reservation tag for gordie mackenzie i kept right on going until the hostess hailed me why dr grew nice to have you with us again i stood blocking the aisle can i switch to a seat back here somewhere clara why i thinklet me see how about that one i didnt see a tag on it well its not a window seat but its free well lets look she flipped the seating chart out of her clipboard certainly may i take your bag uhuh work to do and i did have work to do too that was why i didnt want to sit next to mackenzie i slouched down in the seat scowling at the man next to me to indicate that i didnt want to strike up a conversation he scowled back to show that that suited him fine i saw mackenzie come aboard but he didnt see me just before we took off i saw clara bend over him to check his seat belt and in the same motion she palmed the reservation card with my name on it smart girl i decided to buy her a drink the next time i found myself in the motel where her crew stayed between flights i dont want to give you the idea that im a jetset type whos on firstname terms with every airline stewardess around the only ones i see enough of at all are a couple on the new yorkla run and a few operating out of ohare and maybe a couple that i see now and then between huntsville and the capeoh and one air france girl ive flown with once or twice out of orly but only because she gave me a lift in her citroen one time when there was a metro strike and no cabs to be found still come to think of it wellall rightyes i guess i do get around a lot those are the hazards of the trade although my degrees in atmospheric physics my specialty is signaturesyou know the instrument readings or optical observations that we interpret to mean suchandsuch pressure temperature chemical composition and so onand thats a pretty sexy field right now and i get invited to a lot of conferences i said invited i dont mean in the sense that i can say no not if i want to keep enough status in the department to have freedom to do my work and its all plushy and kind of fun at least when i have time to have fun and really ive got pretty good at locating a decent restaurant in cleveland or albuquerque and vetoing an inferior wine thats funny too because i didnt expect it to be this waynot when i was a kid reading willy leys articles and going out to hunt ginseng in the woods around potsdam so i could earn money and go to mit and build spaceships i thought i would be a lean hungryeyed scientist in shabby clothes i thought probably i would never get out of the laboratory and id waste my health on long night hours over the slide rule and as it turns out what im wasting my health on is truite amandine and timezone disorientation but i think i know what to do about that thats why i didnt want to spend the four and a half hours yakking with gordie mackenzie because by god i maybe do know what to do about that its not really my field but ive talked it over with some systems people and they didnt get that polite look people get when youre trying to tell them about their own subject ill see if i can explain it see there are like twenty conferences and symposia and colloquia a month in any decentsized field and youre out of it unless you make a few of them not counting workshops and planning sessions and getthehelldownherecharleyorwelosethegrant meetings and they do have a way of being all over the place i havent slept in my own home all seven nights of any week since christmas before last when i had the flu now question is what do all the meetings accomplish i had a theory once that the whole gestalt was plannedi mean global scatter jet travel and all a sort of psychic energizer designed to keep us all pumped up all the timeafter all if youre going somewhere in a jet at miles an hour you know youve got to be doing something important or else you wouldnt be doing it so fast but who would plan something like that so i gave up that idea and concentrated on ways of doing it better you know there really is no more stupid way of communicating information than flying miles to sit on a gilt chair in a hotel ballroom and listen to twentyfive people read papers at you twentythree of the papers you dont care about anyway and the twentyfourth you cant understand because the speaker has a bad accent and anyway hes rushing it because hes under time pressure to catch his plane to the next conference and that one single twentyfifth paper has cost you four days including travel time when you could have read it in your own office in fifteen minutes and got more out of it too of course theres the interplay when you find yourself sitting in the coffee shop next to somebody who can explain the latest instrumentation to you because his companys doing the telemetry you cant get that from reading but ive noticed theres less and less time for that and less and less interest too maybe because you get pretty tired of making new friends after about the three hundredth and you begin to think about whats waiting for you on your desk when you get back and you remember the time when you got stuck with that damn loudmouthed egyptian at the iau in brussels and had to fight the suez war for an hour and a half all right you can see what i mean waste of time and valuable kerosene jet fuel right because the pity of it is that electronic information handling is so cheap and easy i dont know if youve ever seen the bell labs demo of their picture phonethey had it at a couple of meetingsbut its nearly like face to face better than the telephone you get all the signatures except maybe the smell of whiskey on the breath or something like that and thats only one gadget theres facsimile telemetry remoteaccess computation teletypewell there it is weve got them why dont we use them and go farther too you know about how they can strip down a taped voice messageleave out the unnecessary parts of speech edit out the pauses even drop some of the useless syllables and you can still understand it perfectly only at about four hundred words a minute instead of maybe sixty or seventy well thats the systems part and as i say its not my field but its there for the takingexpert opinion not mine a couple of the fellows were real hot and were going to get together on it as soon as we can find the time maybe you wonder what i have to contribute i do have something i think for example how about problemsolving approaches to discussions ive seen some papers that suggest a way of simplifying and pointing up a conference so you could really confer ive even got a pet idea of my own i call it the quantum of debate the irreducible minimum of argument which each participant in a discussion can use to make one single point and get that understood before he goes on to the next why if half of what i think is so then people like me can get things done inoh be conservativea quarter of the time we spend now leaving three quarters of our time forwhat why for work for doing the things that we know we ought to do but cant find the time for i mean this literally and really and seriously i honestly think that we can do four times as much work as we do and i honestly think that this means we can land on mars in five years instead of twenty cure leukemia in twelve years instead of fifty and so on well thats the picture and thats why i didnt want to waste the time talking with gordie mackenzie id brought all my notes in my briefcase and four and a half hours was just about enough time to try to pull them all together and make some sort of presentation to show my systems friends and a few others who were interested so as soon as we were airborne i had the little table down and i was sorting out little stacks of paper only it didnt work out its funny how often it doesnt work outi mean when youve got something you want to do and you look ahead and see where the times going to be to do it and then all of a sudden the times gone and you didnt do it what it was was that clara worked her way back with the cocktailsshe knew mine an extradry martini with a twist of lemonand i moved the papers out of her way out of politeness and then she showed up with the hors doeuvres and i put them back in my bag out of hunger and then i had to decide how i wanted my tournedos and it took almost two hours for dinner including the wine and the b b and although i didnt really want to watch the movie theres something about seeing all those screens ahead of you with the hero just making his bombing run on your own screen but shot up and falling in flames on the ones you can see out of the corner of your eye in the forward seatsand back in the briefing room or even in the pub the night before on the screens in the other row that the film gets to after it gets to yoursall sort of like a cross section of instants of time a plural now disconcerting it polarized my attention of course the liquor helped and anyway by the time the movie was over it was time for the second round of coffee and mints and then the seatbelt sign was on and we were over the big aluminum dome on mount wilson coming in and i never had found the time to do my sorting well i was used to that id never found any ginseng back in potsdam either i had to get through school on a scholarship i checked in washed my face and went down to the meeting room just in time for a very dull tutorial on clearair turbulence in planetary atmospheres there was quite a good turnout maybe seventy or eighty people in the room but what they thought they were getting out of it i cannot imagine so i picked up a program and ducked out somebody by the coffee machine called to me hi chip i went over and shook his hand a young fellow named resnik from the little college where id got my bachelors looking bored and angry he was with someone i didnt know tall and grayhaired and bankerish dr ramos this is chesley grew chip dr ramos hes with nasai think its nasa no im with a foundation he said its a pleasure to meet you dr grew ive followed your work thank you thank you very much i would have liked a cup of coffee but i didnt particularly want to stand there talking to them while i drank it so i said well id better get checked in so if youll excuse me come off it chip said larry resnik i saw you check in half an hour ago you just want to go up to your room and work that was embarrassing a little i didnt mind it with resnik but i didnt know the other fellow he grinned and said larry tells me youre like that matter of fact when you went by he said youd be back out in thirty seconds and you were well clearair turbulence isnt my subject really oh nobodys blaming you god knows not care for some coffee the only thing to do was to be gracious about it so i said yes please thanks i watched him take a cup and fill it from the big silver urn he looked vaguely familiar but i couldnt place him did we meet at the dallas doublea s sessions im afraid not sugar no ive actually been to very few of these meetings but ive read some of your papers i stirred my coffee thank you dr ramos one of the things ive learned to do is repeat a name as often as i can so i wont forget it about half the time i forget it anyway of course ill be speaking tomorrow morning dr ramos a photometric technique for deriving slopes from planetary flybys nothing much that doesnt follow from what theyve done at langley im afraid yes i saw the abstract but youll get your brownie points for reading it eh said larry he was breathing heavily how many does that make this year well a lot i tried to drink my coffee both rapidly and inconspicuously larry seemed in an unhappy mood thats what we were talking about when you came in he said thirty papers a year and committee reports between times when was the last time you spent a solid month at your desk i know in my own department i could feel myself growing interested and i didnt want to be i wanted to get back to my notes i took another gulp of my coffee you know what fred hoyle said i dont think so larry he said the minute a man does anything anything at all the whole world enters into a conspiracy to keep him from ever doing it again program chairmen invite him to read papers trustees put him onto committees newspaper reporters call him up to interview him television shows ask him to appear with a comic a bandleader and a girl singer to talk about whether theres life on mars and people who sympathize with him buttonhole him on his way out of meetings said dr ramos he chuckled really dr grew well understand if you just keep on going im not even sure its this world said larry he was not only irritable he was hardly making sense for that matter he added i havent even really done anything yet not like you chip but i can someday dont be modest said dr ramos and look were making a lot of noise here why dont we find some place to sit down and talkunless you really do want to get back to your work dr grew but you see i was already more than half convinced that this was my work to talk to larry and dr ramos and what we finally did was go up to my room and then up to larrys where he had a rand corporation report in his bag with some notes id sent him once and we never did get back to the meeting room along about ten we had dinner sent up and that was where we stayed drinking cold coffee off the setup table and sparingly drinking bourbon out of a bottle larry had brought along and i told them everything id ever thought about a systems approach to the transmission of technological information and what it implied and dr ramos was with it at every step the best listener either of us had ever had though most of what he said was yes of course and i see there really was a lot in it id believed it sitting by myself and computing like a child anticipating christmas how much work i could get done for a couple k a year in amortization of systems and overhead and with the two of them i was sure of it it was a giddy kind of evening toward the end we even began to figure out how quickly we could colonize mars and launch a fleet of interstellar space liners with all the working time of the existing people spent working and then there was a pause and larry got up and threw back the glass french window and we looked out on his balcony twenty stories up and los angeles out in front of us and a thunderstorm brewing over the southern hills the fresh air cleared my head for a moment and then made me realize first that i was sleepy and second that i had to read that damned paper in about seven hours wed better call it a day said dr ramos larry started to object then grinned all right for you old fellows he said anyway i want to look at those notes of yours by myself chip if you dont mind just so you dont lose them i said and turned to go back to my room and get into my bed and lie with my eyes wide open smiling to myself before i fell asleep to dream about fifty weeks a year working at my trade even so i woke easily the moment the hotel clock buzzed by my head wed fixed it to have breakfast in larrys room so i could reclaim my notes and maybe chat for a moment before the morning session began and when i got to his floor i saw dr ramos padding toward me morning he said i just woke up two honeymooners who didnt appreciate it wasnt larrys room its the other way he grinned and fell into step and told me a fast and quite funny honeymooner joke timing the punch line just as we reached larrys door he didnt answer my knock still laughing i said you try but there was no answer to dr ramoss knock either i stopped laughing he couldnt have forgotten we were coming could he try the door why dont you and i did and it opened easily but larry wasnt in the room the door to the bath was standing open and so was the balcony window and no larry his bed was rumpled but empty i dont think hes gone out said dr ramos look his shoes are still there the balcony wasnt big enough to hide on but i walked over and looked at it rainslick and narrow all that was on it were a couple of soaked deck chairs and some cigarette butts looks like he was out here i said and then feeling melodramatic i leaned over the rail and looked down and it wasnt actually melodramatic after all because there in the curve of the hotels sweeping front on the rim of a fountain something was sprawled and a man was standing by it shouting at the doorman it was too early for much noise and i could hear his voice faintly coming up the two hundred vertical feet between us and what was left of larry they canceled the morning session but decided to go ahead in the afternoon and i got into a long bruising fight with gordie mackenzie because he wanted to give his paper when it was scheduled at three in the afternoon and id been reshuffled into that time and i just wasnt feeling cheerful enough to let him get away with anything not after spending two hours with the coroners men and the hotel staff trying to help them figure out why larry would have jumped or slipped off the balcony and especially not after finding out that he had had all my notes in his hand when he jumped and they were now in sticky sloppy clusters all over los angeles county so i was about fed up i once heard krafft ehricke give what i would figure to be a twelveminute paper in three minutes and fortyfive seconds and i tried to beat his record and pretty nearly made it then i threw everything i owned into my suitcase and checked out figuring to head right out to the airport and get on the first plane going home but the clerk said i have a message for you mr grew dr ramos asked you not to leave without seeing him thanks i said after a moment of debating whether to do anything about it or not but as it turned out i didnt have to make the decision ramos came hurrying toward me across the lobby his friendly face concerned i thought youd be leaving he said give me twenty minutes of your time first i hesitated and he snapped a finger at a bellboy here let him take care of your bag and lets go down and have a cup of coffee so i let him lead me to the outdoor patio by the coffee shop warm and clean now after the rain i wondered if he recognized the place where larry had hit but im not sensitive about that sort of thing and apparently neither was he he really had a commanding presence when he wanted to he had a waitress beside us before we had quite slid our chairs closer to the table sent her after coffee and sandwiches without consulting me and started in on me without a pause chip he said dont blow it im sorry about your notes but i dont want to see you give up i leaned back in my chair feeling very weary oh that i wont do dr ramos call me laszlo that i wont do laszlo as a matter of fact ive been thinking about it already i knew you would be i figure that by cutting out a couple of meetings next weeki can use larrys death as an excuse some way ill use anything actuallyi can reconstruct most of them from memory well maybe not in a week come to think of it ill have to send for copies of some of the reports but sooner or later right thats what i want to talk to you about the girl brought the coffee and sandwiches and he waved her away briskly as soon as shed set them down you see youre the man i came here to see i looked at him youre interested in photometry no not your paperyour idea what we were talking about all night for gods sake i didnt know it was you i wanted until resnik mentioned you yesterday but after last night i was sure i already have a job drlaszlo and im not offering you a job then what im offering you a chance to make your idea work ive got money chip foundation money looking for something to be spent on not space research or cancer research or higher mathematicstheyre funded well enough now my foundation is looking for projects that dont fit into the usual patterns big ones like yours well of course i was excited it was so good to be taken that seriously i called the board secretary in washington first thingi mean as soon as they were open there of course i couldnt give him enough over the phone for a formal commitment but hes on the hook chip and the board will go along theres a meeting next week and i want you there in washington i suppose well no the foundations international chip and this meetings at lake como but well pick up the tab of course and you can get a lot more done there where your office isnt going to call you but i mean im not sure well back you everything you need a staff a headquarters weve got the beginnings of a facility in ames iowa youll have to go out there of course but it shouldnt be more than oh say a couple days a month andhe grinned a little apologeticallyi know it wont mean anything to you after youve got one medal on your chest the rest arent too exciting but itll look nice in your whos who entry and anyway the secretary has already authorized me to tell you that youre invited to accept appointment to a trusteeship i began to need the coffee and i took a long swallow youre moving too fast for me laszlo i said the trustees meet in flagstaff theyve got a countryclub deal there youll like it of course its only six times a year but its worth it chip i mean we have our politics like everything else and if youre a trustee you swing a lot of weight and he prattled on and i sat there listening and it was all coming true everything id hoped for and the next week in italy in a great shiny room with an enormous window looking out over lake como i found myself a fullfledged project director with status as a trustee honorary membership on the priorities committee and a staff of fortyone next week we dedicate the lawrence resnik memorial building in amesthe name was my idea but everybody agreedand although its been a hell of a year i can see where well really make progress now it still seems a little incongruous that i should be putting in so much time on managerial work and conferences but when i mentioned it to laszlo the other day in montreal he gave me the grin and an approving look i wondered how long it would take you to think of that he chuckled but its best to make haste slowly and you can see for yourself its paying off have i told you what a good impression your lecture tour made thanks yes as a matter of fact you did anyway once we get the resnik installation going therell be a little more time damn right and dont say i told youhe winkedbut remember what i told you about a possible appointment to the presidents commission on interdisciplinary affairs well its not official but its definite weve already taken a suite at the shoreham for you youll be using it a lot weve even fitted up a room as an office you can keep your notes and things there between trips well i told him of course that if he meant the notes i had been trying to reconstruct they didnt require all that much room not by quite a lot since i havent in all truth got very far i think i would have somehow or other with a little luck but i havent actually been very lucky poor honeyman for instanceid already written him for another copy of the report hed made up for me when i heard that his yawl had capsized in a storm they didnt even find his body for a week and nobody seems to know where he kept his copy of the report if he ever made one and well there was that funny thing resnik said the day he died about how the world conspired against anybody whod ever done anything and then he said im not even sure its this world i figured out what the joke wasthat is if it was a joke i mean just for a hypothesis suppose somebody didnt want us to get ahead as fast as we could somebody from another world thats silly that is i think its silly but if that line of thinking isnt silly then it must be something quite the opposite of silly by which i mean it must be dangerous just recently ive almost been run over twice by crazy drivers in front of my own house and then theres the air taxi i missed and saw crash on takeoff before my eyes just for the fun of it there are two things id like to know one is where the foundation gets its money and why the otherand i just might see if i can get an answer to this one next time im in l ais whether there really were a pair of honeymooners in room that morning to be accidentally awakened by laszlo ramos just about the time that larry was on his way down twenty flights
