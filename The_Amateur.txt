the amateur i it was february off the banks and so thick was the weather that on the upper decks one could have driven a sleigh inside the smokingroom austin ford as securely sheltered from the blizzard as though he had been sitting in front of a wood fire at his club ordered hot gin for himself and the ships doctor the ships doctor had gone below on another hurry call from the widow at the first luncheon on board the widow had sat on the right of doctor sparrow with austin ford facing her but since then except to the doctor she had been invisible so at frequent intervals the ill health of the widow had deprived ford of the society of the doctor that it deprived him also of the society of the widow did not concern him her life had not been spent upon ocean liners she could not remember when staterooms were named after the states of the union she could not tell him of shipwrecks and salvage of smugglers and of the modern pirates who found their victims in the smokingroom ford was on his way to england to act as the london correspondent of the new york republic for three years on that most sensational of the new york dailies he had been the star man the chief muckraker the chief sleuth his interest was in crime not in crimes committed in passion or inspired by drink but in such offences against law and society as are perpetrated with nice intelligence the murderer the burglar the strongarm men who in side streets waylay respectable citizens did not appeal to him the man he studied pursued and exposed was the cashier who evolved a new method of covering up his peculations the dishonest president of an insurance company the confidence man who used no concealed weapon other than his wit toward the criminals he pursued young ford felt no personal animosity he harassed them as he would have shot a hawk killing chickens not because he disliked the hawk but because the battle was unequal and because he felt sorry for the chickens had you called austin ford an amateur detective he would have been greatly annoyed he argued that his position was similar to that of the dramatic critic the dramatic critic warned the public against bad plays ford warned it against bad men having done that he left it to the public to determine whether the bad man should thrive or perish when the managing editor told him of his appointment to london ford had protested that his work lay in new york that of london and the english except as a tourist and sightseer he knew nothing thats just why we are sending you explained the managing editor our readers are ignorant to make them read about london youve got to tell them about themselves in london they like to know whos been presented at court about the american girls who have married dukes and which ones opened a bazaar and which one opened a hat shop and which is getting a divorce dont send us anything concerning suffragettes and dreadnaughts just send us stuff about americans if you take your meals in the carlton grillroom and drink at the cecil you can pick up more good stories than we can print you will find lots of your friends over there some of those girls who married dukes he suggested know you dont they not since they married dukes said ford well anyway all your other friends will be there continued the managing editor encouragingly now that they have shut up the tracks here all the con men have gone to london they say an american cant take a drink at the salisbury without his fellowcountrymen having a fight as to which one will sell him a gold brick fords eyes lightened in pleasurable anticipation look them over urged the managing editor and send us a special call it the american invasion dont you see a story in it it will be the first one i send you said ford the ships doctor returned from his visit below decks and sank into the leather cushion close to fords elbow for a few moments the older man sipped doubtfully at his gin and water and as though perplexed rubbed his hand over his bald and shining head i told her to talk to you he said fretfully her who inquired ford oh the widow you were right about that said doctor sparrow she is not a widow the reporter smiled complacently do you know why i thought not he demanded because all the time she was at luncheon she kept turning over her weddingring as though she was not used to it it was a new ring too i told you then she was not a widow do you always notice things like that asked the doctor not on purpose said the amateur detective i cant help it i see ten things where other people see only one just as some men run ten times as fast as other men we have tried it out often at the office put all sorts of junk under a newspaper lifted the newspaper for five seconds and then each man wrote down what he had seen out of twenty things i would remember seventeen the next best guess would be about nine once i saw a man lift his coat collar to hide his face it was in the grand central station i stopped him and told him he was wanted turned out he was wanted it was goldberg making his getaway to canada it is a gift said the doctor no its a nuisance laughed the reporter i see so many things i dont want to see i see that people are wearing clothes that are not made for them i see when women are lying to me i can see when men are on the verge of a nervous breakdown and whether it is drink or debt or morphine the doctor snorted triumphantly you did not see that the widow was on the verge of a breakdown no returned the reporter is she im sorry if youre sorry urged the doctor eagerly youll help her she is going to london alone to find her husband he has disappeared she thinks that he has been murdered or that he is lying ill in some hospital i told her if any one could help her to find him you could i had to say something shes very ill to find her husband in london repeated ford london is a large town she has photographs of him and she knows where he spends his time pleaded the doctor he is a company promoter it should be easy for you maybe he doesnt want her to find him said ford then it wouldnt be so easy for me the old doctor sighed heavily i know he murmured i thought of that too and she is so very pretty that was another thing i noticed said ford the doctor gave no heed she must stop worrying he exclaimed or she will have a mental collapse i have tried sedatives but they dont touch her i want to give her courage she is frightened shes left a baby boy at home and shes fearful that something will happen to him and shes frightened at being at sea frightened at being alone in london its pitiful the old man shook his head pitiful will you talk to her now he asked nonsense exclaimed ford she doesnt want to tell the story of her life to strange young men but it was she suggested it cried the doctor she asked me if you were austin ford the great detective ford snorted scornfully she did not he protested his tone was that of a man who hopes to be contradicted but she did insisted the doctor and i told her your specialty was tracing persons her face lightened at once it gave her hope she will listen to you speak very gently and kindly and confidently say you are sure you can find him where is the lady now asked ford doctor sparrow scrambled eagerly to his feet she cannot leave her cabin he answered the widow as ford and doctor sparrow still thought of her was lying on the sofa that ran the length of the stateroom parallel with the lower berth she was fully dressed except that instead of her bodice she wore a kimono that left her throat and arms bare she had been sleeping and when their entrance awoke her her blue eyes regarded them uncomprehendingly ford hidden from her by the doctor observed that not only was she very pretty but that she was absurdly young and that the drowsy smile she turned upon the old man before she noted the presence of ford was as innocent as that of a baby her cheeks were flushed her eyes brilliant her yellow curls had become loosened and were spread upon the pillow when she saw ford she caught the kimono so closely around her throat that she choked had the doctor not pushed her down she would have stood i thought she stammered he was an old man the doctor misunderstanding hastened to reassure her mr ford is old in experience he said soothingly he has had remarkable success why he found a criminal once just because the man wore a collar and he found walsh the burglar and phillips the forger and a gang of counterfeiters mrs ashton turned upon him her eyes wide with wonder but my husband she protested is not a criminal my dear lady the doctor cried i did not mean that of course not i meant if mr ford can find men who dont wish to be found how easy for him to find a man who he turned helplessly to ford you tell her he begged ford sat down on a steamer trunk that protruded from beneath the berth and turning to the widow gave her the full benefit of his working smile it was confiding helpless appealing it showed a trustfulness in the person to whom it was addressed that caused that individual to believe ford needed protection from a wicked world doctor sparrow tells me began ford timidly you have lost your husbands address that you will let me try to find him if i can help in any way i should be glad the young girl regarded him apparently with disappointment it was as though doctor sparrow had led her to expect a man full of years and authority a man upon whom she could lean not a youth whose smile seemed to beg one not to scold him she gave ford three photographs bound together with a string when doctor sparrow told me you could help me i got out these she said ford jotted down a mental note to the effect that she got them out that is she did not keep them where she could always look at them that she was not used to look at them was evident by the fact that they were bound together the first photograph showed three men standing in an open place and leaning on a railing one of them was smiling toward the photographer he was a goodlooking young man of about thirty years of age well fed well dressed and apparently well satisfied with the world and himself fords own smile had disappeared his eyes were alert and interested the one with the panama hat pulled down over his eyes is your husband he asked yes assented the widow her tone showed slight surprise this was taken about a year ago inquired ford must have been he answered himself they havent raced at the bay since then this was taken in front of the club stand probably for the telegraph he lifted his eyes inquiringly rising on her elbow the young wife bent forward toward the photograph does it say that there she asked doubtfully how did you guess that in his role as chorus the ships doctor exclaimed with enthusiasm didnt i tell you hes wonderful ford cut him off impatiently you never saw a rail as high as that except around a racetrack he muttered and the badge in his buttonhole and the angle of the stand all show he interrupted himself to address the widow this is an owners badge what was the name of his stable i dont know she answered she regarded the young man with sudden uneasiness they only owned one horse but i believe that gave them the privilege of i see exclaimed ford your husband is a bookmaker but in london he is a promoter of companies so my friend tells me said mrs ashton shes just got back from london her husband told her that harry my husband was always at the american bar in the cecil or at the salisbury or the savoy the girl shook her head but a woman cant go looking for a man there she protested thats why i thought you thatll be all right ford assured her hurriedly its a coincidence but it happens that my own work takes me to these hotels and if your husband is there i will find him he returned the photographs hadnt you better keep one she asked i wont forget him said the reporter besides he turned his eyes toward the doctor and as though thinking aloud said he may have grown a beard there was a pause the eyes of the woman grew troubled her lips pressed together as though in a sudden access of pain and he may ford continued have changed his name as though fearful if she spoke the tears would fall the girl nodded her head stiffly having learned what he wanted to know ford applied to the wound a soothing ointment of promises and encouragement hes as good as found he protested you will see him in a day two days after you land the girls eyes opened happily she clasped her hands together and raised them you will try she begged you will find him for me she corrected herself eagerly for me and the baby the loose sleeves of the kimono fell back to her shoulders showing the white arms the eyes raised to ford were glistening with tears of course i will find him growled the reporter he freed himself from the appeal in the eyes of the young mother and left the cabin the doctor followed he was bubbling over with enthusiasm that was fine he cried you said just the right thing there will be no collapse now his satisfaction was swept away in a burst of disgust the blackguard he protested to desert a wife as young as that and as pretty as that so i have been thinking said the reporter i guess he added gravely what is going to happen is that before i find her husband i will have got to know him pretty well apparently young mrs ashton believed everything would come to pass just as ford promised it would and as he chose to order it for the next day with a color not born of fever in her cheeks and courage in her eyes she joined ford and the doctor at the luncheontable her attention was concentrated on the younger man in him she saw the one person who could bring her husband to her she acts growled the doctor later in the smokingroom as though she was afraid you were going to back out of your promise and jump overboard dont think he protested violently its you shes interested in all she sees in you is what you can do for her can you see that any one as clever at seeing things as i am returned the reporter cannot help but see that later as ford was walking on the upper deck mrs ashton came toward him beating her way against the wind without a trace of coquetry or selfconsciousness and with a sigh of content she laid her hand on his arm when i dont see you she exclaimed as simply as a child i feel so frightened when i see you i know all will come right do you mind if i walk with you she asked and do you mind if every now and then i ask you to tell me again it will all come right for the three days following mrs ashton and ford were constantly together or at least mrs ashton was constantly with ford she told him that when she sat in her cabin the old fears returned to her and in these moments of panic she searched the ship for him the doctor protested that he was growing jealous im not so greatly to be envied suggested ford harry at meals three times a day and on deck all the rest of the day becomes monotonous on a closer acquaintance with harry he seems to be a decent sort of a young man at least he seems to have been at one time very much in love with her well sighed the doctor sentimentally she is certainly very much in love with harry ford shook his head noncommittingly i dont know her story he said dont want to know it the ship was in the channel on her way to cherbourg and running as smoothly as a clock from the shore friendly lights told them they were nearing their journeys end that the land was on every side seated on a steamerchair next to his in the semidarkness of the deck mrs ashton began to talk nervously and eagerly now that we are so near she murmured i have got to tell you something if you did not know i would feel i had not been fair you might think that when you were doing so much for me i should have been more honest she drew a long breath its so hard she said wait commanded ford is it going to help me to find him no then dont tell me his tone caused the girl to start she leaned toward him and peered into his face his eyes as he looked back to her were kind and comprehending you mean said the amateur detective that your husband has deserted you that if it were not for the baby you would not try to find him is that it mrs ashton breathed quickly and turned her face away yes she whispered that is it there was a long pause when she faced him again the fact that there was no longer a secret between them seemed to give her courage maybe she said you can understand maybe you can tell me what it means i have thought and thought i have gone over it and over it until when i go back to it my head aches i have done nothing else but think and i cant make it seem better i cant find any excuse i have had no one to talk to no one i could tell i have thought maybe a man could understand she raised her eyes appealingly if you can only make it seem less cruel dont you see she cried miserably i want to believe i want to forgive him i want to think he loves me oh i want so to be able to love him but how can i i cant i cant in the week in which they had been thrown together the girl unconsciously had told ford much about herself and her husband what she now told him was but an amplification of what he had guessed she had met ashton a year and a half before when she had just left school at the convent and had returned to live with her family her home was at far rockaway her father was a cashier in a bank at long island city one night with a party of friends she had been taken to a dance at one of the beach hotels and there met ashton at that time he was one of a firm that was making book at the aqueduct racetrack the girl had met very few men and with them was shy and frightened but with ashton she found herself at once at ease that night he drove her and her friends home in his touringcar and the next day they teased her about her conquest it made her very happy after that she went to hops at the hotel and as the bookmaker did not dance the two young people sat upon the piazza then ashton came to see her at her own house but when her father learned that the young man who had been calling upon her was a bookmaker he told him he could not associate with his daughter but the girl was now deeply in love with ashton and apparently he with her he begged her to marry him they knew that to this partly from prejudice and partly owing to his position in the bank her father would object accordingly they agreed that in august when the racing moved to saratoga they would run away and get married at that place their plan was that ashton would leave for saratoga with the other racing men and that she would join him the next day they had arranged to be married by a magistrate and ashton had shown her a letter from one at saratoga who consented to perform the ceremony he had given her an engagement ring and two thousand dollars which he asked her to keep for him lest tempted at the track he should lose it but she assured ford it was not such material things as a letter a ring or gift of money that had led her to trust ashton his fear of losing her his complete subjection to her wishes his happiness in her presence all seemed to prove that to make her happy was his one wish and that he could do anything to make her unhappy appeared impossible they were married the morning she arrived at saratoga and the same day departed for niagara falls and quebec the honeymoon lasted ten days they were ten days of complete happiness no one so the girl declared could have been more kind more unselfishly considerate than her husband they returned to saratoga and engaged a suite of rooms at one of the big hotels ashton was not satisfied with the rooms shown him and leaving her upstairs returned to the office floor to ask for others since that moment his wife had never seen him nor heard from him on the day of her marriage young mrs ashton had written to her father asking him to give her his good wishes and pardon he refused both as she had feared he did not consider that for a bank clerk a gambler made a desirable soninlaw and the letters he wrote his daughter were so bitter that in reply she informed him he had forced her to choose between her family and her husband and that she chose her husband in consequence when she found herself deserted she felt she could not return to her people she remained in saratoga there she moved into cheap lodgings and in order that the two thousand dollars ashton had left with her might be saved for his child she had learned to typewrite and after four months had been able to support herself within the last month a girl friend who had known both ashton and herself before they were married had written her that her husband was living in london for the sake of her son she had at once determined to make an effort to seek him out the son nonsense exclaimed the doctor when ford retold the story she is not crossing the ocean because she is worried about the future of her son she seeks her own happiness the woman is in love with her husband ford shook his head i dont know he objected shes so extravagant in her praise of harry that it seems unreal it sounds insincere then again when i swear i will find him she shows a delight that you might describe as savage almost vindictive as though if i did find harry the first thing she would do would be to stick a knife in him maybe volunteered the doctor sadly she has heard there is a woman in the case maybe she is the one shes thinking of sticking the knife into well declared the reporter if she doesnt stop looking savage every time i promise to find harry i wont find harry why should i act the part of fate anyway how do i know that harry hasnt got a wife in london and several in the states how do we know he didnt leave his country for his countrys good thats what it looks like to me how can we tell what confronted him the day he went down to the hotel desk to change his rooms and instead got into his touringcar and beat the speed limit to canada whom did he meet in the hotel corridor a woman with a perfectly good marriage certificate or a detective with a perfectly good warrant or did harry find out that his bride had a devil of a temper of her own and that for him marriage was a failure the widow is certainly a very charming young woman but there may be two sides to this you are a cynic sir protested the doctor that may be growled the reporter but i am not a private detective agency or a matrimonial bureau and before i hear myself saying bless you my children both of these young people will have to show me why they should not be kept asunder ii on the afternoon of their arrival in london ford convoyed mrs ashton to an oldestablished private hotel in craven street here he explained you will be within a few hundred yards of the place in which your husband is said to spend his time i will be living in the same hotel if i find him you will know it in ten minutes the widow gave a little gasp whether of excitement or of happiness ford could not determine whatever happens she begged will you let me hear from you sometimes you are the only person i know in london and its so big it frightens me i dont want to be a burden she went on eagerly but if i can feel you are within call what you need said ford heartily is less of the doctors nerve tonic and sleeping draughts and a little innocent diversion tonight i am going to take you to the savoy to supper mrs ashton exclaimed delightedly and then was filled with misgivings i have nothing to wear she protested and over here in the evening the women dress so well i have a dinner gown she exclaimed but its black would that do ford assured her nothing could be better he had a mans vanity in liking a woman with whom he was seen in public to be pretty and smartly dressed and he felt sure that in black the blond beauty of mrs ashton would appear to advantage they arranged to meet at eleven on the promenade leading to the savoy supperroom and parted with mutual satisfaction at the prospect the finding of harry ashton was so simple that in its very simplicity it appeared spectacular on leaving mrs ashton ford engaged rooms at the hotel cecil before visiting his rooms he made his way to the american bar he did not go there seeking harry ashton his object was entirely selfcentred his purpose was to drink to himself and to the lights of london but as though by appointment the man he had promised to find was waiting for him as ford entered the room at a table facing the door sat ashton there was no mistaking him he wore a mustache but it was no disguise he was the same goodnatured goodlooking youth who in the photograph from under a panama hat had smiled upon the world with a glad cry ford rushed toward him fancy meeting you he exclaimed mr ashtons goodnatured smile did not relax he merely shook his head afraid you have made a mistake he said the reporter regarded him blankly his face showed his disappointment arent you charles w garrett of new york he demanded not me said mr ashton but ford insisted in hurt tones as though he were being trifled with you have been told you look like him havent you mr ashtons good nature was unassailable sorry he declared never heard of him ford became garrulous he could not believe two men could look so much alike it was a remarkable coincidence the stranger must certainly have a drink the drink intended for his twin ashton was bored but accepted he was well acquainted with the easy goodfellowship of his countrymen the room in which he sat was a meetingplace for them he considered that they were always giving each other drinks and not only were they always introducing themselves but saying shake hands with my friend mr soandso after five minutes they showed each other photographs of the children this one though as loquacious as the others seemed better dressed more wise he brought to the exile the atmosphere of his beloved broadway so ashton drank to him pleasantly my name is sydney carter he volunteered as a pokerplayer skims over the cards in his hand ford in his minds eye ran over the value of giving or not giving his right name he decided that ashton would not have heard it and that if he gave a false one there was a chance that later ashton might find out that he had done so accordingly he said mine is austin ford and seated himself at ashtons table within ten minutes the man he had promised to pluck from among the eight million inhabitants of london was smiling sympathetically at his jests and buying a drink on the steamer ford had rehearsed the story with which should he meet ashton he would introduce himself it was one arranged to fit with his theory that ashton was a crook if ashton were a crook ford argued that to at once ingratiate himself in his good graces he also must be a crook his plan was to invite ashton to cooperate with him in some scheme that was openly dishonest by so doing he hoped apparently to place himself at ashtons mercy he believed if he could persuade ashton he was more of a rascal than ashton himself and an exceedingly stupid rascal any distrust the bookmaker might feel toward him would disappear he made his advances so openly and apparently showed his hand so carelessly that from being bored ashton became puzzled then interested and when ford insisted he should dine with him he considered it so necessary to find out who the youth might be who was forcing himself upon him that he accepted the invitation they adjourned to dress and an hour later at fords suggestion they met at the carlton there ford ordered a dinner calculated to lull his newly made friend into a mood suited to confidence but which had on ashton exactly the opposite effect merely for the pleasure of his company utter strangers were not in the habit of treating him to strawberries in february and vintage champagne and in consequence in fords hospitality he saw only cause for suspicion if as he had first feared ford was a new york detective it was most important he should know that no one better than ashton understood that at that moment his presence in new york meant for the police unalloyed satisfaction and for himself undisturbed solitude but ford was unlike any detective of his acquaintance and his acquaintance had been extensive it was true ford was familiar with all the habits of broadway and the tenderloin of places with which ashton was intimate and of men with whom ashton had formerly been well acquainted he talked glibly but if he were a detective ashton considered they certainly had improved the class the restaurant into which for the first time ashton had penetrated and in which he felt ill at ease was to ford he observed a matter of course evidently for ford it held no terrors he criticised the service patronized the head waiters and grumbled at the food and when on leaving the restaurant an englishman and his wife stopped at their table to greet him he accepted their welcome to london without embarrassment ashton rolling his cigar between his lips observed the incident with increasing bewilderment youve got some swell friends he growled ill bet you never met them at healeys i meet all kinds of people in my business said ford i once sold that man some mining stock and the joke of it was he added smiling knowingly it turned out to be good ashton decided that the psychological moment had arrived what is your business he asked im a company promoter said ford easily i thought i told you i did not tell you that i was a company promoter too did i demanded ashton no answered ford with apparent surprise are you thats funny ashton watched for the next move but the subject seemed in no way to interest ford instead of following it up he began afresh have you any money lying idle he asked abruptly about a thousand pounds ashton recognized that the mysterious stranger was about to disclose both himself and whatever object he had in seeking him out he cast a quick glance about him i can always find money he said guardedly whats the proposition with pretended nervousness ford leaned forward and began the story he had rehearsed it was a new version of an old swindle and to every selfrespecting confidence man was well known as the sick engineer game the plot is very simple the sick engineer is supposed to be a mining engineer who as an expert has examined a gold mine and reported against it for his services the company paid him partly in stock he falls ill and is at the point of death while he has been ill much gold has been found in the mine he examined and the stock which he considers worthless is now valuable of this owing to his illness he is ignorant one confidence man acts the part of the sick engineer and the other that of a broker who knows the engineer possesses the stock but has no money with which to purchase it from him for a share of the stock he offers to tell the dupe where it and the engineer can be found they visit the man apparently at the point of death and the dupe gives him money for his stock later the dupe finds the stock is worthless and the supposed engineer and the supposed broker divide the money he paid for it in telling the story ford pretended he was the broker and that he thought in ashton he had found a dupe who would buy the stock from the sick engineer as the story unfolded and ashton appreciated the part ford expected him to play in it his emotions were so varied that he was in danger of apoplexy amusement joy chagrin and indignation illuminated his countenance his cigar ceased to burn and with his eyes opened wide he regarded ford in pitying wonder wait he commanded he shook his head uncomprehendingly tell me he asked do i look as easy as that or are you just naturally foolish ford pretended to fall into a state of great alarm i dont understand he stammered why son exclaimed ashton kindly i was taught that story in the public schools i invented it i stopped using it before you cut your teeth gee he exclaimed delightedly i knew i had grown respectablelooking but i didnt think i was so damned respectablelooking as that he began to laugh silently so greatly was he amused that the tears shone in his eyes and his shoulders shook im sorry for you son he protested but thats the funniest thing thats come my way in two years and you buying me hothouse grapes too and fancy water i wish you could see your face he taunted ford pretended to be greatly chagrined all right he declared roughly the laughs on me this time but just because i lost one trick dont think i dont know my business now that im wise to what you are we can work together and the face of young mr ashton became instantly grave his jaws snapped like a trap when he spoke his tone was assured and slightly contemptuous not with me you cant work he said dont think because i fell down on this ford began hotly im not thinking of you at all said ashton youre a nice little fellow all right but you have sized me up wrong i am on the straight and narrow that leads back to little old new york and gods country and i am warranted not to run off my trolley the words were in the vernacular but the tone in which the young man spoke rang so confidently that it brought to ford a pleasant thrill of satisfaction from the first he had found in the personality of the young man something winning and likable a shrewd manliness and tolerant goodhumor his eyes may have shown his sympathy for in sudden confidence ashton leaned nearer its like this he said several years ago i made a bad break and about a year later they got on to me and i had to cut and run in a month the law of limitation lets me loose and i can go back and you can bet im going back i will be on the bowsprit of the first boat ive had all i want of the fugitivefromjustice game thank you and i have taken good care to keep a clean bill of health so that i wont have to play it again theyve been trying to get me for several years especially the pinkertons they have chased me all over europe chased me with all kinds of men sometimes with women theyve tried everything except bloodhounds at first i thought you were a pink thats why i interrupted ford exploding derisively thats good thats one on you he ceased laughing and regarded ashton kindly how do you know im not he asked for an instant the face of the bookmaker grew a shade less red and his eyes searched those of ford in a quick agony of suspicion ford continued to smile steadily at him and ashton breathed with relief ill take a chance with you he said and if you are as bad a detective as you are a sport i neednt worry they both laughed and with sudden mutual liking each raised his glass and nodded but they havent got me yet continued ashton and unless they get me in the next thirty days im free so you neednt think that ill help you its never again for me the first time that was the fault of the crowd i ran with the second time that would be my fault and there aint going to be any second time he shook his head doggedly and with squared shoulders leaned back in his chair if it only breaks right for me he declared ill settle down in one of those ownyour ownhomes fortyfive minutes from broadway and never leave the wife and the baby the words almost brought ford to his feet he had forgotten the wife and the baby he endeavored to explain his surprise by a sudden assumption of incredulity fancy you married he exclaimed married protested ashton im married to the finest little lady that ever wore skirts and in thirtyseven days ill see her again thirtyseven days he repeated impatiently gee thats a hell of a long time ford studied the young man with increased interest that he was speaking sincerely from the heart there seemed no possible doubt ashton frowned and his face clouded ive not been able to treat her just right he volunteered if she wrote me the letters might give them a clew and i dont write her because i dont want her to know all my troubles until theyre over but i know he added that five minutes talk will set it all right that is if she still feels about me the way i feel about her the man crushed his cigar in his fingers and threw the pieces on the floor thats whats been the worst he exclaimed bitterly not hearing not knowing its been hell his eyes as he raised them were filled with suffering deep and genuine ford rose suddenly lets go down to the savoy for supper he said supper growled ashton whats the use of supper do you suppose cold chicken and a sardine can keep me from thinking ford placed his hand on the others shoulder you come with me he said kindly im going to do you a favor im going to bring you a piece of luck dont ask me any questions he commanded hurriedly just take my word for it they had sat so late over their cigars that when they reached the restaurant on the embankment the supperroom was already partly filled and the corridors and lounge were brilliantly lit and gay with welldressed women ashton regarded the scene with gloomy eyes since he had spoken of his wife he had remained silent chewing savagely on a fresh cigar but ford was grandly excited he did not know exactly what he intended to do he was prepared to let events direct themselves but of two things he was assured mrs ashton loved her husband and her husband loved her as the god in the car who was to bring them together he felt a delightful responsibility the young men left the coatroom and came down the short flight of steps that leads to the wide lounge of the restaurant ford slightly in advance searching with his eyes for mrs ashton found her seated alone in the lounge evidently waiting for him at the first glance she was hardly be recognized her lowcut dinner gown of black satin that clung to her like a wet bath robe was the last word of the new fashion and since ford had seen her her blond hair had been arranged by an artist her appearance was smart elegant daring she was easily the prettiest and most strikinglooking woman in the room and for an instant ford stood gazing at her trying to find in the selfpossessed young woman the deserted wife of the steamer she did not see ford her eyes were following the progress down the hall of a woman and her profile was toward him the thought of the happiness he was about to bring to two young people gave ford the sense of a genuine triumph and when he turned to ashton to point out his wife to him he was thrilling with pride and satisfaction his triumph received a bewildering shock already ashton had discovered the presence of mrs ashton he was standing transfixed lost to his surroundings devouring her with his eyes and then to the amazement of ford his eyes filled with fear doubt and anger swiftly with the movement of a man ducking a blow he turned and sprang up the stairs and into the coatroom ford bewildered and more conscious of his surroundings followed him less quickly and was in consequence only in time to see ashton dragging his overcoat behind him disappear into the courtyard he seized his own coat and raced in pursuit as he ran into the courtyard ashton in the strand was just closing the door of a taxicab but before the chauffeur could free it from the surrounding traffic ford had dragged the door open and leaped inside ashton was huddled in the corner
