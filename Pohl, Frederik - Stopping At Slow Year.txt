frederick pohl stopping at slow year chapter one the ship was called the nordvik though no one aboard it remembered why and it was a big one even if you didnt count the thrusters on the outriggers astern or the projectors for the bussard collection cone at the bow it was more than a hundred meters long if just the habitable part of nordvik had set down on any football field on earth it would have lapped over at both ends that would never happen though it had been a good many centuries earth time since nordvikciad been anywhere near its home planet and there was very little chance that it would ever return it also wouldnt happen because nordvik or any ship like it could never set down on any planet anyway all those ancient starships were built in space and lived all their lives in space mostly interstellar space at that and sooner or later they all died in space more likely it would be sooner thought mercy macdonald as she slammed her door in the face of deputy captain hans horeger what macdonald didnt want to do was die when the ship did she had lived aboard nordvik for twentyseven years ships time never mind the time the outside universe went by she didnt want to think about that twentyseven years and eight planetary systems and it was time to find some comfortable place to settle down with some suitable man she hoped but not just any man certainly not with the fat and lecherous unselec tively lecherous which made it worse deputy captain hans horeger the first thing macdonald did was make sure the door was well locked behind her with horeger on the other side the second thing was unwrap the towel she had clutched around her as she dashed out of the shower stall and dab at her sticky body the bastard hadnt even let her rinse before he began grabbing it wasnt much use she moistened a cloth in her washstand but you never could get all the soap off with a cloth she resigned herself to going around sticky until her next turn at the showers it wasnt hard to do that shed had plenty of practice the people who couldnt resign themselves to aggravation didnt last long on a tramp starship and there were always plenty of tranks available in her medicine chest she swallowed one sighed and set to work naked she sat down at her desk to begin keying up the ships tradegoods manifest for the next planetfall concentration came hard horeger had not given up she could hear him scratching at the door she could even hear his voice it was too lowpitched to carry but that didnt matter she knew what he was saying and the occasional words that filtered through bitch and tease and even that word he used as a final argument love were all words she had heard from him before it made her laugh she knew just what he was doing out there she could picture him crouched at her door lips close to the crack hands cupped around his mouth so that the rest of nordviks people wouldnt hear as though any of them failed to observe his unrelenting pursuit especially his wife maureen mercy macdonald stood up and dressed quickly in fresh clothes not because there was anyone to see but because she intended to speak to horeger and ob scurely did not want to do so naked she looked at herself in the mirror while she was pulling on the blue coverall figure still good chin clean eyes clear not bad for fortyfive and a bit she thought the coverall on the other hand needed mending again at the shoulder seams she would have to do a good deal of patching she thought to get herself ready for a planetfall she listened at the door for a moment then called leave me alone hans its over if youre that horny go find maureen but he didnt answer why you bastard macdonald said to the door suddenly angry when she realized he had given up she didnt have any legitimate reason for the anger she had certainly made it clear to him that furtive sex when his wife wasnt looking didnt satisfy her any more especially when she discovered she was sharing him also with her best friendbut why had he given up so easily one of the worst features of life aboard nordvik was that among the fiftysix human beings who lived on the starship adult males were a distinct minority there were only twentytwo of them against thirty one adult women adult enough anyway there were also three children would be four in a week or two macdonald reminded herself as soon as betsy arap dee delivered herself but the ones already born were all girls which would some day make the balance even worse would that is if no one else jumped ship or if they didnt recruit any new people at their next stop but that was for the future meanwhile the oldest child at eight was still too unripe even for hans horegers attention facing odds of that sort was a bad deal for the nine women without regular mates mercy macdonald didnt like being one of them she hadnt always been shed had a husband for a good many years in fact both she and walter were among the handful who were said to own a piece of nordviks keel apart from the doddering old captain there was no one else left aboard who like mercy macdonald had signed on when the ship first launched from earth orbit counting the three children eleven of the ships complement were shipborn all the rest had been picked up at one planetfall or another along the long twisted way that was just one more injustice to swallow seniority should have counted for something even not factoring in the datum that macdonald was proba bly the smartest and most able person aboard even not adding on the intangible fact that she was also just about the most loyal person in the ships complement which she had proved by not jumping ship not even at hades their last port of call when twentythree others were finally sufficiently fed up to pay off including her own husband neither brains nor loyalty had paid off for her though macdonald was still no more than eighth or ninth down in the ships hierarchy as purser whatever that ancient tide meant she was head of the trading section to be sure but that meant nothing when the ship was between planets she thought for a moment about hades she had been tempted to leave with the others there nordvik was running poorer and less hopeful every year and there was certainly no future aboard for anyone but hades had been the wrong place hades didnt have much good land most of the planet was rocky hills and desert and everything good had been nailed down by the first settlers for whom everybody else worked at low pay when they could get any pay at all all the promising planets were well in the past macdonald told herself the longer nordvik traveled the worse the places it visited seemed to get it was even possible that this new one they were coming up on would be even drearier than hades it wasnt the first time that notion had occurred to her she had even thought it during the wretched weeks when they were orbiting hades with her husband and herself snapping at each other whenever they were in earshot she might well have paid off there herself if walter hadnt there had almost been a mutiny after hades a near half of the crew were urging tottering old captain hawkins to give up the whole idea of trading with future planets they wanted either to settle down on one of the colonized worlds or even to find some new one from the old robotprobe reports and start a colony of their own that was when hans horeger had become the actual captain in all but name he was the one who stirred everyone up to go on anyway it wasnt a good idea nobody was settling new worlds right now there were at least a dozen that the robot probes had identified by now and maybe more reports still coming in from stars still farther away but by now everybody knew how hard it was to start a colony in a world where no human being no creature from earth at all had ever lived before the rage for colonizing had worn itself out centuries before oh no doubt the pioneering spirit would blossom back to life again some time some later time maybe a few centuries down the pike when all the new worlds were themselves beginning to bulge at the seams and the adventurers and the malcontents would yearn to move on but not just yet and definitely not with the discouraged tired aging crew of the starship nordvik mercy macdonald shook herself and got back to work maybe slowyear would be better maybe it wouldnt too because tramp starships like nordvik didnt get to the better worlds ships like nordvik didnt have any real reason for being anymore ships like nordvik were fossils the only reason their cooperative had been able to buy it in the first place was that whole class of starships had already been made obsolete by the new gridfunction vessels that could actually land on a planets surface at least when the planet was big enough and prosperous enough to afford a landing system nordwks were a disappearing breed good for nothing but wandering around the poorest and least developed colony worlds in hope of transacting a little business and replenishing their supplies so they could wander a little farther but as she patiently checked over the invoices macdonald wondered whether even a poor world would be poor enough to want to buy any of the things they had to sell some of the appliances and machines aboard nordvikwete ten or fifteen years old ships time and technology had progressed beyond them wherever they had gone their trade goods were almost as obsolete as the ship there were pieces of scrimshaw the novelties the ships crew made for themselves to sell and to pass the time between stars including poems art objects and knitted goods there were eleven thousand almost varieties of flowers fruits ornamental trees vegetables and grasses the most promising of them already setting new seeds in the refresher plots there was a library of nearly old earth books in the datastore assuming anybody on this new planet read books anymore at hades that part of the cargo had been a total loss which was one of the reasons why macdonald thought the planet was so well named but they were good books macdonald had read six or seven thousand of them herself one time or another and theyd made the long travel times endurable for her almost there were machines to sell to be copied if ancient earth machines had any value anymore and most of all the huge store of data that covered every branch of human knowledge from medicine to an thropology to combinatorial mathematics also sadly subject to being deflatingly out of date if you put a cash value on all nordviks wares as macdonald had to do to figure out what to trade for what that had to be easily thirty or forty million dollars worth of goods even after you discounted the holds packed with stuff that probably wasnt ever going to sell to anyone anywhere but the value of a commodity was what it would fetch in the market and who knew what these slowyear people would be willing to pay she was glad to be interrupted by the ships bell less glad when it was hans horegers flabbily hairy face that appeared in the corner of the screen oh shit she said at least it wasnt a personal call it was one of his incessant allship addresses that didnt make it much better she resignedly saved her worksheet and let horeger take over the full screen he had got dressed after their little interlude in the showers anyway now he was wearing his public face calm selfpossessed and not at all like the frantic breastgrabber whose sweaty hands had been all over her twenty minutes before shipmates horeger was saying yellow teeth gleaming between mustache and beard i have just received another communication from our next port of call at the planet of slowyear were still at long range but reception is better now and the news from them is all good they say they havent had a ship call in a long time i dont know how long exactly because they use their own calendar but long and theyre thrilled were coming theyre a good size for us too theyve got a world population of half a million or so thats kind of funny he said in that chatty endearing style that endeared nobody because theyve had twelye or fifteen generations to build up their numbers but it could have been a lot worse of courser could have macdonald thought it could have been zero slowyear wouldnt have been the first planet to die out between visits leaving the next wanderer to arrive that way high and dry anyway thats half a million customers good ones friends theyre farmers farmers and stock raisers and that means they wont have a hell of a lot of industry so im counting on selling a lot of our machine cargo there lets take a look at what slow year is like he waved a hand and under his chin the planets stats appeared an f star a planetary surface gravity very close to earth normal an atmosphere a little denser but with a slightly lower partial pressure of oxygen see what it says about the primary he invited its bright so those worrywarts among you can rest easy we wont have any trouble refueling there meaning worrywarts like me mercy macdonald told the screen since she had been telling horeger for months that if they didnt refuel pretty soon their next stop would be their last she might have said more because talking back to horeger on the screen was one of the habits that had become standard for her and a lot less maddening than talking to horeger when he could hear but it dawned on her that the faint tapping sound she heard was someone at her door for a nasty moment she feared it might be horeger back again impossible of course there he was blithely pontificating away in real time on the screen when she opened the door she was pleased to see that it was little betsy arap dee as close as she had to a best friend on nordvik hi she said welcoming then she got a better look at betsys face whats the matter macdonald asked sharply suddenly afraid betsy was holding her swollen belly the baby she sobbed im spotting and i hurt can you help me get to the sickbay please by the time mercy macdonald got her friend to the room they used for a sickbay sam bagehot the closest thing they had to a nurse had an obstetric bed ready and danny de bride their approximation of a doctor was fretfully studying the obstetric displays from their medical database de bride wasnt a real doctor but he was the best nordvikhud left after the mass desertion on hades and he had at least long since read through all the gynecological section i hope i know what im doing he gritted to macdonald as the nurse guided betsys feet into the stirrups and he played with the fetoscope earphones in his hand i hope so too macdonald said but not out loud out loud she only whispered encouragingly in betsy arap dees ear whether her friend heard her she could not say betsys eyes were closed her forehead was cold and clammy and she was moaning de bride was muttering something to his nurse but macdonald missed it over their heads horeger was still prattling noisily away on the screen what she demanded i said shes hardly dilated at all de bride com plained and im not getting any fetal heartbeat said sam holding the metal disk on betsys belly and watching the readout oh shit said de bride what do you think sam do i have to do a csection ive never even seen one youll see one now his nurse told him mercy give me hand you take care of the instruments while i handle the anesthesia will you the will you part was only politeness there wasnt any real choice if there had been mercy macdonald would have been out of there long before the cutting started but under the circumstances she was present for it all she had never seen anyone deliberately slice into the flesh of another human being before there was less blood than she had expected but still a great deal of blood it went faster than she had imagined but still a long business ofde bride muttering angrily to himself as he inexpertly pushed muscle walls and tissues out of the way and fumbled for the little scarlet gnome curled up inside betsys abdomen macdonald was both horrified and fascinated yes and something else too almost even envious for here was silly little betsy arap dee bringing a whole new person into existence marvelously wonderfully enviably for a moment macdonald almost forgot the gore didnt hear de brides steady muttering to himself or horegers orating from the screen she could do this she told herself she could have done it years earlier when she still had walter to be a father could still do it maybe if she didnt take too long getting it started here said de bride suddenly hold it while i cut the cord macdonald found herself with that purplered little creature in her unpracticed hands she biinked down at it wondering it wasnt until de bride said shamefaced i couldnt save it you saw that maybe it twisted in the womb you know and the cord strangled iff that she realized the baby she was holding was dead she stood frozen until the nurse told her that she might as well put the tiny thing down then she did as she was told and began to clean the bloodstains off the arms of her blue coverall now really ruined she thought regretfully with a dressing she didnt look at betsy arap dee now being sewn glumly back to gether she was watching hans horegers face on the screen listening as intently as if she cared about anything he might say were still about two lightweeks away he was saying call it three thousand au well be there in eight months just about friends i feel in my bones that this is going to be the stop that pays off for all the others theyre going to be crazy about us from behind mercy macdonald sam bagehot said theyd better be chapter two actually the people on slowyear pretty nearly were going crazy over the approaching ship or at least some of them were though it would be many weeks before nordvik entered orbit mostly it was the young ones who were working up steam on the subject though even among them there were quite a few who had too many other things on their minds to get excited over the prospect of a visiting interstellar ship for instance there was blundy blundy had his mind full of other things which not only werent the approaching nordvik but werent even the wife who was waiting for him in the summer city much less the seventeen hundred things he was supposed to keep his mind on namely the long ambling column of sheep he was herding into town for shearing and slaughter hans horeger had been right about that the people of slowyear spent a lot of time farming their fields and tending their livestock stocks but where horeger went wrong was that they didnt stop there to the people aboard nordvik a word like shepherd meant a beardless boy or a doddering old man with a stick not someone riding in a computer guided hydrogenfueled crawler who led his flock with a radio beacon keyed to the receivers implanted in each nose the people of slowyear had their high technology all right they just didnt show it off in that blundy was like his planet because he didnt show off all his strengths either blundy was short and broad with a body that was all muscle and almost no fat the muscle didnt show if you ever picked him up you would be surprised to discover how much he massed if he allowed you to take the liberty of trying to pick him up there wasnt much chance of that trying it would most likely turn out to mean that you were stretched out on the ground in front of him gazing stupidly up as you wondered if anyone else had felt the earthquake what blundy was thinking about on his home bound trip was politics he had plenty of time to think of course because what he was doing took very little of his attention there was hardly any local traffic on the road this far from the city a few tractortrailers on their way to and from the fishing villages on the coast and almost nothing else and anyway the crawlers computer did most of the driving blundy could have been thinking about many things because he was many things not the least of them a celebrated entertainer on the view screens but what drew his imagination just then was his political plan ning because he had been off with the flock for the four seventyday months that were his taxtime he was beginning to feel eager to get back into his political incarnation again he was trying to find a theme for a campaign if he could work out the right subjects to talk about he would then he calculated do well to take the town auditorium for a speech the next night if the auditorium was finished as his helper petoyne had told him it would be when they talked on the radio if petoyne had been efficient enough to reserve it for him there remained the difficult question which was what the speech should be about it had to be important his followers would expect no less but what could he say that would sound important enough to shock them all into life because his mind was far from what he was doing he almost missed the traffic warden standing in the road before him the mans hand was held sternly up and he was scowling blundy slowed the crawler he hadnt noticed that they had just passed the highest point in the pass other roads joined them there and there was a tractor trailer train of construction material waiting to cross before him blundy leaned out of the cab window to give the warden a quizzical look then the warden recognized him he gave blundy an embarrassed salute and waved him on blundy waved his thanks to the warden and his apology to the other driver who would now have a good long wait for the flock to clear the crossing he didnt refuse the courtesy though it was a real nuisance to try to halt a procession of seventeen hundred sheep then as they began their descent into town on impulse blundy opened the cab door and jumped out to stretch his legs the computer would be quite capable of following its programmed route without him and he thought better on his feet blundy landed easily on the packed dirt beside the stock road he stretched and took a deep breath letting the tractor and its trailer crawl past him at their twokilometeranhour trudge the road itself had been repaved since the last time he had come by four months earlier with the much shorter line of sheep heading out to the eastern pastures now there were beginning to be an occasional highspeed vehicle passing by in both directions not at high speed here though not as they squeezed past the shambling line of sheep careful of the occasional willful stray there werent many strays blundy saw with satisfaction the flock was obediently following the bellwether radio in the trailer and the dogs were properly patrolling between sheep and vehicles to keep them off the paved road and on the grassy verge then blundy pressed two fingertips to his lips it was what he did when he got an idea like sheep he said halfvoicing the words past his nearly closed lips like sheep we stray in all directions pointlessly and ignorantly without a real goal wandering until we die no it was the right sort of note to strike but certainly not until we die there was too much dying going on all the time as it was he scowled at the flock and tried again wandering without goal or direction how can we find a goal worth attaining what can lead us as surely as the radio call leads the flock to no again positively no wrong image entirely what the call led the sheep to was the shearers sheds for all and the slaughterhouse for most he was getting back to death again and that was no good still he had the feeling that there was something there that he could use it was just the kind of quick elucidating metaphor that his political audiences loved the radio beacon that guided the sheep standing for the purpose that would carry the voters with him and there was something more there waiting to be ex pressed something about sheep going astray was tickling his mind some phrase he had heard once that had come out of some old book murra would know the hell with it he said meaning for now he would ask murra out of her vast reading in the books that no one else bothered with and then maybe it would all come clear he looked around pleased at the sight pleased to be going home again after taxtime looking down into the valley he thought the broad sometimes river had dropped a good deal since the last time he had passed this way it was still well over its summertime banks a hundred meters of flood rushing furiously downhill but nothing like the raging torrents of first melt he had seen four months before the glacier on the west wall was showing the signs of advancing warmth too it had retreated half a kilometer at least he squinted at it until he thought he had found the spot under its lip where at the end of the summer before he had shared a cabin with the woman who had then been his new and brightest love that had been a long time ago murra wasnt new and bright anymore and the intervening winters ice had planed away all trace of the cabin then an eruption ofyelping behind him made him turn he took a good look at his flock and swore the long line of sheep was breaking up into clots even though the dogs barked and nipped at their rumps the animals were tiring and so they were pausing to nibble at the fresh growth beneath their hooves he touched the talk button on his lapel give them a jolt to wake them up theyre clumping he ordered katiro his replacement helper now drowsing in the trailer and the boy was incompetent too why had petoyne begged to go in early to take care of some undefined business and left him with this idiot a moment later blundy heard a chorus of dismayed baaing from the flock as their radio collars gave them peremptory little electric shocks obediently they picked up their pace but blundy was annoyed the radioman in the back of the tractor should have prevented that if petoyne had been in the trailer it wouldnt have happened petoyne would have kept an eye on the flock without being reminded but petoyne had had that private business that blundy had decided he didnt even want to know about and out of fondness for his chief helper blundy had agreed it occurred to blundy that his fondness for petoyne was likely to become a liability he turned and walked after the trailer trying to remember that glimmering of an idea about sheep wasnt it but just as it was coming back to him he heard his name called hey blundy a tractor pulling a flatbed loaded with protein supplement for the nursing ewes in the field had slowed and the driver was waving to him youve got a welcoming commit tee the man shouted jerking a thumb back down the hill toward the summer city when blundy craned his neck to see past his own tractor already half a kilometer ahead he saw that it was truth and that useful halfformed idea was irretrievably gone there were fifty people waiting for blundy as he stepped aside and let the tractor proceed toward the pens people of all shapes and sizes male and female oldsters of four and even five years and children well semichildren like his quite nearly adult assistant petoyne who was waving violently to catch his eye blundy gave them all a sober salute he didnt smile at them blundy did not mind at all when his partisans made a fuss over him but he didnt like to give the appearance of encouraging it petoyne was hurrying toward him whispering urgently blundy i need a favor and youre my best friend so youre the only one i can ask remember my dog that was getting kind of old well i didnt like the idea of lolling him just because he wasnt a pup anymore so i did a kind of dumb thing blundy shook his head oh hell petoyne another dumb thing talk to me later he said not wanting to hear he turned to the waiting crowd marshalling his thoughts there was a rock at the side of the road thrown there by sometimes river when it had rampaged through at icebreak blundy climbed up it to get a better look at his welcomers were they political or theatrical a little of each he decided and settled on political not on the evidence but because what he really wanted was to convert some of the people who admired him for his theatrical work into the ones who followed his political lead so citizens he said improvising as he went along you know where ive been ive been paying off my taxtime and i ask myself why so much tax time what do the governors do with the taxtime is the winter city any bigger or more comfortable with all the taxtime work we put in are we ever going to start that other city on deep bay theyve been talking about for years do they have a plan he shook his head to indicate the answer and there was a mutter of moderate agreement from the crowd they didnt see quite where he was going but they were willing to follow him far enough to find out then why so much taxtime he demanded why should an ordinary citizen have to spend a twentieth of his life working off his obligations to the state when nothing ever changes for the better im not talking about money taxes we all pay income tax and thats all right no one complains about that but to be required as well to put in long weary hours at the states business and always in the best times of the year when we could be enjoying ourselves why that is slavery louder grunts of approval blundy was beginning to catch the rhythm of his own oratory so he gave them the smile he had withheld but we cant discuss that as fully as it deserves now he said tomorrow night he glanced at petoyne who nodded tomorrow night ill be speaking at the assembly and i hope ill see you all there but now well i havent been home for four months so if youll excuse me and he jumped nimbly off the rock moving through them shaking hands kissing some of the younger women with petoyne tagging grimly behind it all took time when he was well clear of the last of them petoyne tugged imploringly at his blouse please blundy i need a favor he didnt stop because he didnt want any of the fans to catch up with him but he looked down at her she was a small woman small girl really she hadnt yet finished her first full year she was undersized for her age and that made her even shorter than blundy though he was no giant himself well he asked she hesitated remember my dog she said as though she hadnt said it before they were going to put him down because of his age you know but he was a good dog blundy i grew up with him i thought if i could just switch him with one of the others oh god he said knowing what would come next it did they caught me she said simply you keep doing really dumb things he said shaking his head i know she admitted but i need a witness for my sentence now im supposed to be in the ex ecution hall in about half an hour ive been waiting and waiting for you blundy they sentenced you already he asked suddenly fearful for rer she nodded they gave me another poison pill she said i have to take it today it was blundy counted as he glumly accompanied his friend the third time he had gone with petoyne to the execution chamber he was getting really fed up not just with the nasty business of poison pills itself but with petoyne for her dumbness for the demands she made on him when he had more important things to keep him busy but i just got back he complained to her as they walked and i could be seeing murra now instead of wasting my time on this crap and cant you just stay out of trouble for a while petoyne didnt answer not directly anyway she just stretched to look up at him shivering in the wind that came down from the ice her face woebegone with sorrowful eyes and trembling chin she didnt say that the law required her to have a witness for her execution date because everybody knew that or that they had long ago agreed that they were best friends because shed said that already instead she men tioned a fact you know youre getting pretty tired of murra anyway and she complained who did it hurt if i just let barney live a little longer and she mourned a couple of times in different ways but blundy dont you see what this means if i die of this business i could miss the ship ive never seen a ship by the time this one lands i could be dead he didnt respond they walked in silence blundy nodding to people who recognized him while the girl thought hard then an encouraging thought struck her one good thing she said people will see you on the tv he gave her a scowl intending to show that that wasnt the kind of publicity he sought and even more to show that he didnt care what she said because he had one answer for all quit complaining its your own damn fault he told her judgmentally petoyne had known what the price was going to be just as she had known all the other times shed broken the laws the two times shed been caught and the dozens of times she hadnt all the same blundy knew how the kid felt petoyne wasnt just afraid of dying well of course she was afraid of that who wouldnt be but worse than just the normal fear of dying was that nobody not anybody least of all an almostoneyearold like petoyne wanted to be left out of that special oncein alifetime excitement both thrilling and bleak that only happened when some wandering spaceship came along and even once in a lifetime was an exaggeration it wasnt that often ships didnt usually happen along even once in a normal lifetime there was hardly a soul alive on slowyear who remembered the last time a ship had called apart from the tiny and dwindling handful of five and sixyearold dodderers you got to the summer execution chamber by a pebbled walk through a garden ribbonblossoms and roses were in bloom thousands of them already halfway up their twometer trellises though spring was only five months old the flowers didnt quite hide the chamber from people going by on the summer towns streets but they at least kept it decently remote most people didnt look though a child of thirty months or so stopped as they passed leaning his bike against the gate to follow them with his fascinated eyes the marshal at the door nodded respectfully to blundy as they entered the hall inside generic music was playing in the waiting room for the execution chamber the kind of lowpitched whispery strings blundy associated with funerals and his almostwife murra funny at first he had loved murras taste in music the waiting lounge smelled as flowery as the grounds outside there was a pot of babywillows in the center of the room honeysweet and minty greenflowers hung from ceiling baskets blundy and petoyne werent the only ones waiting there were four couples ahead of them sitting quietly on the comfortable benches or pretending to be conversing with each other they would have to wait blundy saw with resignation the waiting was an extra burden because petoyne was getting nervouser and nervouser as she came closer to the deed itself gripping tight blundys hand even though she was still technically short of her first birthday and thus was only going to take from the childrens jar they sat down in the waiting room nodding politely to the ones ahead of them the execution clerk wasnt at his desk but almost as soon as they sat he came back in looking around impatiently petoyne clutched blundys arm and took a quick breath trying to read the mans face there wasnt much on it to read though because the clerk was a hardbitten old guy easily five maybe more had seen everything and was surprised at nothing he did blink in recognition as he saw blundy there and quickly glanced at the monitor on his desk then he called a name and read a sentence mossriker woller duplesset for falsification of taxtime records one in fifty a man not much older than petoyne stood up hanging his head the woman with him was nearly three his mother blundy supposed and she was the one who was weeping as the executioner escorted them out of the chamber he paused in the doorway to give blundy a friendly nod then closed the door behind them there was a moments silence then the ones left began to talk the old man got up from beside the woman who seemed to be a daughter wandering around the room he paused and absently stroked the soft downy pods of the babywillow then he looked more closely and frowned at what he saw he got a cup from the water cooler and carefully moistened the roots of the plant they should take better care of their plants he said severely to no one in particular then his eyes focused on blundy you were just coming in this morning werent you he asked politely i thought so those were nicelooking herds you brought in blundy agreed that for late spring herds the sheep had fattened up nicely another a middleaged woman there with a younger woman who could have been her daughter what crime could she have committed to bring her here said theyve started taking the shuttles out of mothballs and then a couple of them began talking about what their parents or their grandparents had told them about the way it was the last time a ship came to call what they did not talk about was why they were here petoyne didnt join in the conversation but she was obviously beginning to get her nerve back theyre all adults she told blundy looking around at the others in the room i guess theyve really got something to worry about youll be an adult pretty soon blundy reminded her but im not now petoyne said managing a smile for the first time whatlamishungryareyou and then without waiting for an answer i bet you dont want any more lamb chops anyway listen blundy let me tell you what i had last night i made myself a scogger broiled a big one with plenty of melted butter the way you like it and ive got a couple more in the freezer if you want to come over tonight i mean she added glancing at the door if everything uh if everything goes all right here he shook his head well murras expecting you i guess she might have said more but then much sooner than any of them expected the clerk was back for another condemned and escort the charge was assault this time one in forty and surprisingly the convict was the middleaged woman looks like theres life in the old girl yet petoyne whispered almost giggling two other couples were coming in but blundy didnt get a good look at them because the old man was standing up and coming toward them i guess its my turn next he said apologetically i didnt recognize you before but you are arakaho blundy spenotex arent you i thought so i just wanted to say how much i enjoyed your show last winter and well i might not get the chance to tell you later on of course blundy said professionally warm nice of you to say it the old man stood there nodding like any fan who had made the approach and didnt really know what to say my wife really loved it it was about the only thing that kept us going the last couple of months he said well thats what it was supposed to do blundy said politely do you recognize petoyne here she played uv on winter wife the younger daughter remember really the man seemed quite interested as he studied the girl up and down i wouldnt have known her he marveled but then i guess everybody says that dont they the augmentation and all well im sorry to see you here petoyne but youre still under age arent you so it wont be so oh he said in a different voice as the door opened i guess its my turn i hope i see you again and as the door closed behind him the execu tioner and his witness petoyne said hopes to see you again i bet he does did you hear that he got a one in five for murder do you know what i think blundy i think it was probably his wife he murdered dont you think who else would an old guy like that kill so maybe the show didnt keep him going all that long after all then there was another wait the wall screen was showing a musical group which was getting on blundys nerves he got up mind if i try to get some news he asked no one seemed to care though they all looked docilely at the screen when it came on the oilwells on harbor island had been successfully uncapped the pipelines to the refineries on the continent checked and reopened but blundy already knew that because hed seen the smoke on the horizon the warmspring census taken after the first crop of postwinter babies had had a chance to be born showed a planetwide population of the highest for that season in nine years the water temperature in sometime river was up to c and there was an chance of rain and then the woman came back in she was alone she looked very sober as she made a phone call to the crematorium it only took a moment to arrange for the disposition of her fathers remains then long before jhey were ready for it it was their turn inside the room blundy sought out the cameras and found them discreetly inconspicuous in corners of the room the carrying out of sentences was a matter of public record few bothered to watch unless some relative was at risk but blundy squared his shoulders and assumed a properly grave expression the clerk looked directly at petoyne and then looked down at his charge sheet larasissa petoyne marcolli first year for willfully failing to destroy a surplus animal he read sentence is one in a thousand come on and hurry up he said because i want to get home sometime tonight blundy rose with the girl he took her arm firmly though she didnt resist they didnt say anything to the newcomers they had left behind in the waiting room though blundy could almost feel the resentment the adults felt toward a mere oneinathousand the execution room was the one for children with pretty pictures on the walls the room itself was not much bigger than a closet no chairs just a sort of metal bench along one side of it and a low table that contained the urn up on the table petoyne the executioner ordered youve been here before pe toyne climbed up looking woebegone at blundy uncomfortable on the cold metal there were drains around the edge of it to cany off the involuntary excretions an executed criminal often could not help but release and there was a faint shit smell in the room to show that some had the executioner turned to take a jar off its shelf saying chattily over his shoulder i was surprised to see you out there blundy but of course i knew you were just being a witness i would have been sorry if it had been the other way around because i really like your work thank you blundy said automatically he was mildly annoyed though winter wifewas only a minor work in his eyes his social political and philosophi cal contributions were what he really prided himself on and yet it was the video plays that everyone praised him for then he biinked i beg your pardon he asked i said do your job blundy the executioner repeated and obediently blundy bent to check the jar with its thousand little jellybean pills the seals were intact when he said so the execution clerk said fretfully well then break it open man and he then took the lid off the jar and offered it to petoyne who unhesitatingly thrust her little fist in pulled out a pill popped it in her mouth swallowed she looked suddenly lost and fearful for a moment then she gave blundy a broad happy smile open your mouth the executioner commanded and rummaged around inside it with his forefinger thenhenodded sentence carried out he said try not to come back here again will you next time youll be grown up and opened the back door to let them out into the warm spring afternoon sun you know im getting to like the taste of those things bragged petoyne almost skipping along be side blundy what do you want to do now have a drink somewhere go check on the slaughtering get something to eat no she said watching his face youre off to see murra arent you why dont you break it off with her blundy shes such a pain he stopped and glowered down at her leave murra out of it he ordered and listen im not going to this place with you again petoyne youre going to be a oneyearold pretty soon and then you wont be getting any one in a thousand shots anymore so straighten out if you want to live to see that ship come in chapter three when mercy macdonald came looking for betsy arap dee she found her friend in the lesser common room of the starship working with her fingers on a scrimshaw sampler but her eyes on the picture of their next planet that was displayed on the wall screen were getting good pictures now macdonald commented looking for a good way to start a conver sation they were only a couple of lightdays out now four or five more weeks and they would be in orbit and then the frenzy of transshipping and dealing would start macdonald stretched to reach up and trace the outlines of slowyears single great continent with a fingertip it was more or less pearshaped with the widest part of the pear right around the planets equator where do you suppose the landing parties will touch down she asked betsy didnt answer except possibly with the faintest of shrugs so macdonald answered herself probably right near their city here putting her finger on the place the radio signals came from it ought to be nice by the time we get there they say its their springtime betsy finally found some words worth saying that would have been nice for the baby she said bending her head back over her sampler macdonald bit her lip and tried another tack how about giving me a hand she suggested i need to check the specialinterest programs in the store so we can see what weve got to sell betsy glanced up at her why we already did that mercy so i want to do it again to make sure its not good if we suddenly discover something we over looked after weve left is iff betsy sighed and put her sampler down she gave her friend a level gaze i know what youre doing youre just trying to keep me busy so i wont be depressed arent you but you dont have to bother im keeping myself busy cant you see but youre still depressed mercy said reasona bly betsy nodded of course i am im still on this damn ship once i get off ill perk right up i promise macdonald lifted an eyebrow you really think a few weeks on a planet will straighten everything out who said anything about a few weeks im staying macdonald biinked at her in surprise it wasnt really astonishing that betsy arap dee was thinking of jumping ship at slowyearalmost everybody thought such thoughts almost every time they made a plan etfall the unusual thing was that she was talking about it out loud even to her best friend horeger wouldnt like to hear you say that she offered horeger had devoted no less than five of his allhands broadcasts to the reasons why no one should leave the ship on slowyear along with threats of what would happen if anyone tried betsy laughed it was a curiously somber sound do you think i care what hans likes anymore she asked do you when mercy macdonald had a problem that needed talking over her confidant of first choice was of course betsy arap dee but when betsy herself was the problem she had to turn to someone else that somebody else had to be a friend a real one the list of possible candidates was not long the little universe of nordvtkwas far too small to hold any strangers but the bulk of them werent friends either not friends of mercy macdonalds anyway betsy was certainly a friend moody as she was since the loss of her baby another definite friend was the captain of the nordvik by which she certainly didnt mean nasty grabby hans horeger but the real captain arnold hawkins so were the three old navigator astrographers moira glorietti yahouda ben aaron and dicke dettweiler theyd all come aboard early in the voyage like the captain and mercy macdonald herself like them theyd voted against hans horegers takeover also like the captain they were getting a little elderly to be close friends anymore then there was the larger number of those who used to be friends of one degree or another but had voted for horeger and so werent friends anymore that included most of the engineers and the bio people both the medics and the ones that cared for their biological stocks and then there were the handful of those who had never been friends of mercy macdonalds at all that wasnt a long list though most of the time there was only one person on it that person of course being deputy captain hans horeger there had never been a time when macdonald thought of horeger as a friend though she was ashamed of herself to admit for a time she had been feeling low enough to accept him as a lover there were quite a few times when she wished him off the ship if not actually dead because of his crude and meaningless sexual advances because he had unseated old captain hawkins and most of all because of what he had done to betsy arap dee captain hawkins yes macdonald decided he was the one she needed to talk to the problem was to find him he certainly wouldnt be on the bridge that was horegers territory now when she stopped by the lifde suite he shared with his elderly wife she was there but the captain wasnt but marjorie hawkins though not fond of mercy macdonald or of any other single woman on the ship her husbands advanced age notwithstanding somewhat reluctantly told her he could be found in his workshop he wasnt there either when macdonald pushed open the door after a couple of minutes of fruitless knocking she could see though that he wasnt far captain hawkinss scrimshaw work was glass mosaics assembled with painstaking care and a fair number of cut fingers pieces of the work were scattered all over the room piles of glass chips of a hundred colors covering every flat surface in the room for further indication that he was nearby the wallscreen was on confident that he was no farther than the nearest toilet macdonald sat down to wait for his return she saw that the captains screen like betsy arap dees was displaying their next port of call it was a different view though probably it was what was being seen in real time by nordviksbow cameras thousands of stars were visible but there was no doubt which star was slowyears sun norctvikwas still far away from slowyears star much farther than pluto was from its primary all the same slowyears star was by far the brightest thing in that part of the sky she squinted to see if she could make out the planet of slowyear itself but didnt expect success it was still too faint probably lost in its suns glare she knew well enough what slowyear was going to be like like everybody else on nordvik she had pored over its statistics for hour after hour partly out of generalized curiosity partly looking for a reason to make it her home for the rest of her life or for not macdonald knew that the bad thing about slowyear was the very thing it was named after slowyear had a very slow year indeed the planet was a good long way from its sun and took a good long time to circle it nineteen standard years justabout fortunately for the hope of any life on slowyear its orbit was nearly circular nearly circular still wasnt quite the small difference between elliptical and round was critical it meant that the planet had winters and it had summers and when you said winter she thought biting her lip you werent talking about three or four chilly months you were talking about nasty at aphelion the planet was moving slowly like a yoyo at the top of its climb and slowyear stayed at that distant point for nearly five standard years five bittercold earthtime years of hiding underground to stay away from the surface snow and cold and misery mercy macdonald who had not experienced any real winter since she was eighteen years old remembered the data table that said a typical nighttime winter low on slowyear was minus degrees celsius and a typical daytime winter high was only about minus ten and felt herself shivering in anticipation of course luck had been with the visitors on nordvik it wasnt winter on slowyear now the good part was that they would be reaching the planet in its late spring there would be plenty of time to decide whether to stay or not before things got frigid when captain hawkins found her waiting he gave her an apologetic grin its nice to see you mercy he said pleased sorry i missed you but thats what comes with being an old man he made a face to express the annoying problems of being old and male then changed the subject how do you like iff he asked gesturing at the nearly finished scrimshaw wall plaque on his easel it was a mosaic picture of their starship made of thousands of bits of glass carefully cracked and mounted on a plastic board and under it he had assembled bright red letters to spell out a motto ad astra per aspera itll sell macdonald said giving her professional opinion what does it say the captain dreamily traced the words with a fingertip its latin he said with pride it means to the stars through difficulties macdonald snickered and he looked up at her with shrewd humor enjoying the patness of the motto with her then he sighed of course i dont suppose theyll remember latin on slowyear well have to translate for them but that just makes it more interesting dont you think im sure of it she told him glad to be able to say something kind to him that was also true macdonald liked the captain he was old and feeble sure and she hadnt forgiven him for letting the reins of the ship fall into hans horegers hands but he was a nice man if he had been just a little younger but he wasnt younger hed been in his fifties when he took command of the ship back in earth orbit now that he was well past eighty his principal activities were scrimshaw and naps he was already sitting before his scrimshaw sorting through the pile of violet glass for just the right piece to make a background star she cleared her throat captain he looked up with a smile of reluctant resignation you didnt just come here for my company did you i suppose somethings the matter with betsy arap dee she specified i dont know if you know about her problems of course i do captain hawkins said finding the right chip of purple and dabbing it with cement shes miserable she didnt really want to have that baby because hans was the father and wanted to pretend he wasnt and then it died now she hates everybody she doesnt hate me macdonald protested then amended herself not really anyway she hates the whole ship i guess shes talking about jumping on slowyear yes the captain nodded carefully setting his new star in place and so am i she finished he looked up at her kindly of course you are mercy did you want to ask for my blessing youve got it betsy too theres no future for you here he reached out and covered her hand with his lean age spotted one id do it myself he said if i were a little younger if maureen would agree as it is i dont know if ill even go down that startled her never before had the captain failed to touch the soil of a new planet but you have to nonsense mercy you dont need me you can handle all the bargaining yourself and anyway im going to have to stay aboard you mean for the refueling macdonald said trying to understand but horeger can take care of that not just the refueling rebuilding he reached past her to the screen look here mercy he ordered as the schematics of nordvik appeared to replace the starfield the whole ship was outlined skeletally there mostly white lines but with some components in yellow and green and a few flashing red look at the air system its falling apart were going to have to rebuild it if we can or buy one on slowyear if they have anything we can use and water regenerations almost as bad and well maureen tells me were almost out of fabrics for clothes and bedding well have to see what they can offer there too we need a lot of stuff youll have to make some good deals for us mercy and if i cant he considered for a moment studying the engi neering reports you will he said then wearily he flicked the screen off you have to otherwise we dont go anywhere from slowyear he looked at her face and smiled comfortingly it wont be so bad for you down there they eat bugs on slowyear did you know that oh they raise sheep and eat them too but the only native land life forms they can eat are arthropods although theres a lot of native fish or something like fish they dont seem to have any cows or pigs by the way your frozen genetic materials ought to be worth something and the place has a lousy climate and its a pretty backward world i think but you can make a life there mercy she looked at him suddenly apprehensive true she had been toying with the idea of jumping ship there in her own thoughts but that was when she had a choice but if she didnt if slowyear was going to be her last stop ever make a life on a planet with a year nearly twenty years long bitter winters burning summers the only time the place would be bearable at all when freeze was melting toward bum or sweat on its way down to chill what kind of life would that be or for that matter what kind of life did she have now chapter four what blundy knew for sure as he headed toward murras house was that murra would be there waiting for him she always was he had to look around and finally ask directions though because he not only couldnt find murra he couldnt even find their house naturally she wasnt in the house theyd shared all the mean long winter just past that place hadnt even been a house at all actually it was a nasty cramped threeroom flat not much worse than any other winter flat but not much better either it had been in the winter city dug into the caverns under the hill no one would want to go back and live there again for many months now certainly not until summer drove them to it maybe not until the next desolate winter came when the babies born now would be getting close to puberty and just beginning to understand what they were in for when the cold came as it turned out murra wasnt even in the house hed left her in because while blundy was out with the flocks the building boom had reached its peak most of the constructions of the year before that winter ice had crushed and spring floods had washed away entirely had now been replaced now they had a real house he discovered murra had moved their things into it while he was out with the sheep it was smallish but spanking new all their own and of course murra was waiting in it for him because she always was what she was waiting for was to be kissed he obliged her wondering why a kiss seemed so much like a political statement but she had no such reserva tions she pressed herself against him as they kissed confident she was welcomed in a certain sense she was blundy could feel his body confirming it whatever blundy thought about his wife his body found her powerfully attractive murra was a handsome woman tall ten centimeters taller than blundy himself she was bigboned and not exactly pretty but very close to beautiful murra had a kind of oriental cast to her face with short black hair and blue eyes and when she moved it was with studied grace more than any of that she was blundys she proclaimed it in everything she did she was totally supportive of him in everything he chose to do and let that fact be known to everyone she had a soft cultivated wellarticulated voice for blundy it was her best feature and the one that made her the exact right choice to appear in his vid productions all in all she was ideal for him he accepted that fact it was an annoyance that he didnt always enjoy it when they had finished their kiss she didnt release him but comfortably whispered the latest bits of news against his lips to bring him up to date theyre starting up the shuttles she told him tenmonth infant mortality figures are up a little around eleven point three percent but thats still in the normal range i hope you like your new house i only finished moving things in last week and oh yes the fezguth mokoms have broken up hes taken up with some twoyearold and miwa simply cant stand it she sounded proud blundy recognized the tone because he knew what the pride came from both kilowar miwa fezguth and murra were among the few who could call themselves successful winter wives the envied kind who had managed to keep their marriages going all through the cramped every bodyineverybodys pocket months and months of the interminable winter but murras pride was double now because of the two of them it now transpired that only murra had managed to stay married through the spring i feel so sorry for her she added gener ously smug in her own security they say if you can make it as a winter wife you can make it forever but i guess they showed that isnt true for everybody just the lucky ones like us she finished with pride yes he said separating himself from her at last she gazed at him fondly and do you like what ive done with your new house of course are they all in working condition blundy asked and she looked puzzled until she realized he meant the shuttles oh i think so theyve been kept in a good sheltered valley ever since the last ship came of course the ice covered them every year but the roof held she smiled at him affectionately dont worry theyll be ready to go by the time the ship gets here and itll be warmspring by then a good time to come here dont you think are you going to write some thing about iff since blundy was used to his wifes uncanny ability to read his mind though he was certain hed never said anything to her about his plans he didnt blink at that ive been thinking about it yes i thought you might of course you know best dear but isnt that sort of a depressing subject tragic he corrected her thats where real drama is after all and im tired of writing all this light stuff to keep people quiet during the winter i see so youll want to go up to the ship right away wont you dont deny it dear who knows you as well as i do and of course you should he didnt deny it hed already decided to put his application in and with his standing in the community there was every chance the governors council would approve it he had even told murra when hed done it what he hadnt told her was who he proposed to take with him on that first mission to the starship and so he was surprised when without a break she went on and how was petoyne blundy misunderstood her on purpose shes fine she got away with it again no of course she got away with it murra said tolerant and sweet and not in the least interested with the fact that once more petoyne had escaped with her life or you would have said something right away thats not what i mean i mean how was she in bed he glared at her for gods sake murra she isnt even one yet i know murra agreed her tone interested and a little amused isnt it funny how men always like the very young ones is it because theyre so skinny or so ignorant and unexperienced please dont be embarrassed to talk about it with me blundy ive never been jealous have i and you know we always tell each other things like that she smiled inpillow talk she added because do you realize you havent even looked at your new house yet not even at the new bed i just put in and he knew what to do then and wondered when it had begun to be a chore there were times while they were making love when blundys body managed to make blundys mind forget the fact that murra was really a royal pain in the ass at those times he pretty much forgot to think about anything at all because murra in bed was not at all like the murra who let herself be viewed as she sat perfumed enrobed and regal in her reception room in sexual intercourse she was wild she screamed and scratched and she writhed and squeezed she was everything any man dreamed of in the arts of inter course none of it was inadvertent either that had been the most disillusioning of blundys slow discov eries about the woman he had married it was all rehearsed murra made love by script her skills quickly and thoroughly learned a lady in the draw ing room a harlot in bed she said of herself in that pillow talk that meant so much to her and she had herself perfectly right but then when they had sufficiently worn each other out she naturally had to spoil it all by talking i wrote you a poem my love she told him serene again if sweaty would you like to hear iff of course he of course said but hardly listened as she pulled her notebook out of the nightstand and sat naked and crosslegged at the foot of the bed reading the poem was a typically long one it had to do with ancient shepherds and the loving lasses they had left behind them and it was full of graceful little turns of phrase and unexpected rhymes but he didnt really listen he was studying her he observed as though for the first time that his wife had a wide browed face that tapered to the chin with large pale blue eyes and the kind of bobbed hair that is usually seen in pictures of medieval squires she smiled a lot as she read faintly enigmatically frequently it occurred to blundy that murras smiles didnt seem to be related to anything she found humorous only to an inner confidence that whatever happened next was bound to be nice she didnt ask him if he liked the poem when she was done she only sat there regarding him with that smiling selfconfidence so naturally he said its a fine poem murra your poems are always fine she nodded graciously thank you blundy but what about you did you write anything while you were away that was the naked question he had known she would ask so much an offense to hear he shook his head not even a political manifesto he shook his head again resentfully now murra didnt let that put her off she laughed the silvery loving forgiving laugh that he had heard so often oh blundy what am i going to do with you you dont write anything but puppet shows all winter because you need to be alone in order to do anything serious then you dont write anything at all when youre out in the boonies with all the room in the world because well i dont know what the because is there do p maybe then youre not alone enough out there are you with that pretty little petoyne there to distract you good night he said and rolled over and pre tended to be asleep murra was not deceived she snuggled down next to him rubbing the small of his back in the way that he liked or had once told her he liked she was thinking part of her thoughts were about the fact that he hadnt really said anything specifically admiring about her poem but what she was mostly thinking about was petoyne murra would not have described her feelings about petoyne as jealousy murra never felt jealousy she was far above that she would have said that she was simply surprised what surprised her was that blundy hadnt become tired of the girl by now after all hed seen a lot of little petoyne all through the filming of winter wife twenty long months from freeze to new years a show every week for two hundred weeks petoyne hadnt even reached puberty when they started taping that had been the subject of one whole set of shows of course there hadnt been anything sexual between petoyne and blundy then that had hap pened later blundy had not confided a date to her but murra conjectured it had probably been about the time the month of new years changed to firstmelt and with the first touch of coldspring the world began to look interesting again blundy she said softly sweetly inquiringly he didnt answer but she knew he was awake blundy what i dont understand is why she went out with you a young girl like that she should be doing her taxtime in town what does she do about her schooling she studies in the camp blundy said without turning over yes but she can get in trouble there cant she i mean this thing with the dog it wasnt her dog it was just a sheepdog and it was too old to be any good anymore why didnt she let them put the silly thing to sleep the way they were supposed to he was silent for a moment then he said i guess when petoyne loves something she hates to let go of it i see murra said yes i see that and a moment later she heard blundys regular breathing turn into a gentle snore as he really did go to sleep but she lay awake for some time thinking about that although murra was careful to preserve her public image of perfect unstriving selfcontrol she was not at all an idle person on the contrary murra acted with great and speedy force when force was needed she simply used her force in the most economical fashion by pushing where whatever force opposed her was weakest in the present case she was quite confident that that weakest point was young petoyne herself and so murra made it her business to be at the sheep pens the next day knowing that petoyne would be working off another stretch of her taxtime there the sheep pens were not the sort of place murra generally cared to visit the place sounded and smelled and looked like what it was a killing field and when murra arrived the processing of the flock for shearing and slaughter was already well under way these particular herds were all meat animals smaller and more active than the larger breeds kept for milk and so their life expectancy was always short they were milling restlessly in the pens as they waited their turns to be shorn before being slaughtered murra could hear the terrified bieating of the sheep as they filed into the shearing shed and one by one were each rudely caught and cropped by the shearers their wool flopped in great flat tangled mats to the floor sometimes reddened with blood when the shearers giant scissors cut too close to the skin nude and yammering the sheep then ran to the nearest exit where they were sorted out young ewes herded away to be preserved for the next lambing the old ones and the young males on to the slaughterhouse itself that was where the bieating stopped forever what remained of each animal was swiftly dealt with by men and women in bloody coveralls as the carcass was gutted sectioned cleaned wrapped and sent on its way to the freezers against the next winters needs it was all very quick fortyfive minutes tops from the first touch of the shears to the ice the speed made it merciful murra thought but it did not make it any less ugly to watch she looked around for petoyne and found the girl in the wool sheds with a dozen others lugging the mats of raw wool to a flatbed trailer petoyne looked up sweaty and disgruntled when murra called her name oh she said its you you seem to be busy right now murra smiled oh is that the way it looks to you petoyne nodded agreeably it looks that way to me too im supposed to be working now murra saw with satisfaction that the girl was trying to deal with her on her own terms she had never doubted that her will would prevail over this presump tuous child but now it was certain its really fine of you to be so sensible about it she said what i dont see is why you cant be so sensible about other things what particular things petoyne challenged why your recklessness of course you really should stop getting in trouble youre going to be one soon arent you next month the eleventh of green and then you wont be taking from the baby jar anymore will you yes everybody says that petoyne agreed is that what you came here to tell me not exactly no i did want to talk about respon sibility though our responsibility to the world we live in im sure you know how important blundys plays are to the whole world blundys and mine really they arent just entertainments you know people rely on us we help them keep their lives under control she tried to decipher the girls bland expression then nodded i know what youre thinking petoyne you think im not really that important to the plays dont you youre thinking that blundys the one who counts and after all ill be nearly four next winter and maybe a little elderly to still be playing in blundys stories she nodded again a friendly understanding nod yes thats what youre thinking all right but the important thing here is what blundy thinks dont you agree petoyne shrugged murra allowed her one of those silvery laughs oh dont mind what i say child she said goodnaturedly i have this terrible habit of reading other peoples thoughts confess i knew just what was on your mind petoyne turned to face her squarely what i was thinking was that i have to finish here so i can go home and get cleaned up and hear blundy in the stadium tonight arent you going in surprise but my dear i cant go to the stadium i have to work but ill hear all about it from blundy himself when he comes home because he always comes home you know it was true that murra had to work out her labor tax no one avoided that because the community always had jobs that had to be done what was also true was that being murra being blundys murra she had almost the same privileges of picking and choosing as blundy himself she used her privileges a lot more freely than blundy did too of course she wasnt in politics as he was and so she could afford to be less concerned about seeming diligent these were the seasons of the long year when you needed privileges too if you wanted to avoid some such ghastly assignment as petoynes because there was a lot of hard and unpleasant work to be done after the winter construction for instance everything that the kilometersthick glaciers had planed into rubble had to be built over again that was hard physical work of the exact kind that murra would never let herself be trapped into the farms had to be plowed and seeded just as laboriously the fishing fleets had to be repaired or more often replaced with new construc tion even more laborious the roads graded the power lines restrung even the sewers cleared and patched in that sort of taxtime work people sweat a lot and that did not suit murra during the harshest earliest month of slowyears long vernal seasons she had made sure to get work in the hospital at least you were always indoors there besides which the work was not intellectually de manding and most of the time was even fairly easy on the other hand much of it was by murras standards rather ignoble she loathed the bedpans and had been repelled by her first few weeks when she had found herself committed to the obstetrical wards transfer to caring for the newboms was a slight improvement though it involved crying babies and messy diapers then she had worked her way up to the large wards where the dying infants were kept at least those brats were either comatose or heavily sedated which came to the same thing but overseeing a couple of hundred small kids in the process of dying was simply too depressing for murra to put up with then she got the job she wanted a position came open in the utilities section it was murras kind of work checking employment records for the people who did the physical work of keeping the solarpower plants running at maximum efficiency she stayed away from the actual physical labor of course that kind of work was at least dirty since you couldnt stay neat when you were digging down to a leaking pipe in the underground clay beds that stored the summers heat to feed back to the city all winter long some of it was actively dangerous maintaining the high pressure storage tanks where the hydrogen fuel was kept after being electrolyzed out of glacier meltwater by the solar energy there werent many accidents with the hydrogen but when there was one people gener ally died and all of it was hard or at least all of it but murras own part which was spent in the air conditioned accounting office with a pot of tea always beside her safely away from the nastiness of the actual digging and repairing she even had a little vid screen of her own on her desk and when blundy gave his speech she naturally stopped work to watch no one objected everyone she worked with knew very well how important she was to blundy now and then some of her colleagues would even take time from their own work to drift to her desk and look over her shoulder at the screen they were careful not to disturb her concentration of course if they spoke to her at all it was only to say things like hes in good form tonight or blundy really ought to be on the council she didnt even really hear such remarks they were completely expected and she acknowledged them only with an automatic nod or smile the burden of the speech she heard was a challenge to the council to make better plans for the future it was a pity that he hadnt discussed it with her ahead of time she thought regretfully it wasnt a very forceful issue still he made it sound serious enough as he demanded that the pipes be laid farther under ground so that they might not freeze in the next cold to find safer places for the fishing fleet to think ahead he cried so we dont have to start from scratch every spring so we can make things bettereach year instead of working as hard as we can just to stay even unfortunately the audience seemed to share her opinions of themes oh they cheered him all right and hed been given a really satisfactory turnout the cameras showed that there had to be at least a couple of thousand people in the audience with no doubt twenty or thirty times as many watching at home on their screens but the same cameras showed that they werent all staying all through his talk a few were getting up and leaving not many just a handful now and then and they were quite polite and quiet about itbut he was losing them and if the cameras saw that blundy would be seeing it too murra sighed and resigned herself he would not be in a good mood when he got home so her primary job then would have to be reassurance she would be supportive and complimentary rather than critical the little notes she had made to pass on to him his distracting little habit of scratching his nose every few minutes her suggestion that he look directly into the camera more often to allow for closeups they would have to wait for another time all those burdens were easily borne they were exactly the things that made her indispensable to blundy what was harder to bear was that when the speech was over not a single one of her office colleagues came over to congratulate her it almost seemed as though they had been disappointed blundy himself was though that was apparent from the fact that he wasnt home when murra got there when he did show up hours late he shook his head at the dinner she had rushed to prepare for him she smiled to show she didnt mind i suppose youve been ruining your digestion with hawkerfood she said her tone gently humorous to show that it wasnt meant as a reproach although it was he shrugged i was discussing the meeting with some people it got late i was hungry murra do you think i ought to hold off on any more meetings for a while oh no my deari look at the way they applauded you but there wasnt a single question about anything i said he complained flinging himself onto a chair all they wanted to talk about was the ship how i thought we should receive the people how much we should tell them what i thought wed gain from their visit she knelt beside him and said apologetically im afraid i didnt hear any of the discussion period they cut away right after your speech i wish i had he was silent for a moment then his hand reached out absently to stroke her head well what about iff shouldnt i give it up until this ship thing has come and gone some of my friends think so murra who was quite sure which of his friends the advice was coming from said only i think that must be your decision to make my dear would you like to come to bed he shook his head she got up and kissed him good night not failing to notice the faint echo of her own perfume on him that wasnt unexpected murra didnt comment it was a fact though that although she had no intention of quarreling over petoynes attempts to replace her in blundys bed she came very close to complaint when she discovered the girl had switched to wearing her own perfume this part of spring was a joyous time murra did her best to make it joyous for blundy as the days went on though it began to trouble her to observe how little time he chose to spend with her he was always busy yes she understood blundy needed to get away by himself from time to time that was why she had not objected or at least had not objected much when he signed up to escort the flocks of pregnant ewes off to the grazing lands but how incongruous that arakaho blundy spenotex should be a shepherd but that was then this was now she did her best to understand what it was that kept him away from her so much of the time doing such strange and inferior things as helping inseminate the ewes and sod the bare lawns of the new houses anybody could do them it was not of course simply that she longed for his company she wasnt sure she did long for it very much really the certainty that he would always return to her was almost as good as his physical presence and a lot less trouble no what murra jealously wanted was the privilege of making sure that blundys needs were met when she realized that what he needed most was simpleminded recreation nothing that made de mands on him nothing that required thought her task became simple she would arrange a dinner party yes a dinner party would please him her dinner parties always had as soon as she had thought of it she wondered why she hadnt thought of it before and immediately began to plan the guest list was the most important part of course no more than six people blundy mustnt be tired by the company for the same reason nobody serious the party was to relax blundy and give him pleasure not to be work the first couple she chose were delyle and kondi a natural selection because they had appeared as young marrieds in winter wife although they hadnt actually been married then theyd got along with each other so well that now they were more important theyd got along with blundy too and he liked vennit and ginga too who had the additional advantage that ginga macklin ginga spenotex was some sort of distant relative of blundys besides they both were outspokenly loyal to blundys political ideals though murra doubted either of them knew just what they were finally she decided on her sister and her husband though only if they were willing to leave the kids at home she didnt want blundy to have to share his guests attention with children when she had finished her list she regarded it with satisfaction all the guests she chose were young attractive and as close as possible to brainless and the list did not of course include petoyne on the day of the party she sent blundy about his business without asking what that business was and set off on an exhaustive study of the marketplace the salad had to be the crispest the yams the sweetest the butter for her sauces the richest she circled the stalls critically looking for inspiration she had already decided that the main dish would not be scoggers because she had served them to blundy too many times already in the recent past nor would it be anything that came from sheep of which he had had plenty while out with the herd she settled finally on a handsome meterlong fish they called it a salmon though it did not resemble anything on earth which she steamed to a golden yellow chilled and that night served with a rich sauce on a bed of greens and was satisfied almost satisfied the food was firstrate the guests were obligingly cheerful and blundy sat through it patiently he praised the food and carried on polite talk with the guests but he was bored when murra found out what blundy was doing with his time she was mildly vexed he wasnt secretly writing as she had hoped he wasnt even meeting with his political allies or even with petoyne not often anyway what the man was doing was taking flying lessons every day he was climbing the hill to the plateau people called the spaceport where the shabby old shuttles were being checked and demothballed and spending hour after hour sitting at the simulator controls with an instruc tion program running on his screen when she laughed at him he didnt get angry only patient but how can you learn to operate a spaceship out of a training program how else theres nobody alive to teach me but my dear why should it be you to take such a risk he thought it over carefully before he found the right answer because i want to he said as the month of thunder warmed into the month of green murra tried again and again to recapture his attention or at least to entertain him she didnt nag her husband that wasnt her style murras style was to be forgiving loving and never irritating in fact a perfect winter wife even through coldspring and warmspring and right on through the years she kept inventing pleasures for him unfortunately pleas ures that he didnt seem to want that didnt keep murra from going on with her project of devising entertainments for him some represented real sacrifices on her own part as when she persuaded blundy to a weekends rafting on sometimes river slowly dwindling down from its coldspring flooded size that wasnt a success for either of them murra managed to contain or at least disguise her own distaste for anything out of doors but blundy was not entertained he did some mood disguising of his own he dutifully paddled the raft with her shouting as loud as she when they were drenched in the rapids smiled a lot exclaimed appro priately at the pretty warmspring flowers that were beginning to carpet the canyonsides and was bored again the sort of thing that would really give blundy the pleasure and stimulation he needed had to be a mixture she decided fun people to talk to but not the sort of dolts she had invited to dinner an interesting place to visit but nothing that required too much exertion of course she had it a picnic up on the glaciers perhaps at a place near where the shuttles were just now emerging from their winter shroud of ice again she chose her guest list with the greatest care her first pick was vorian who was old but still spry and was always willing to play chess with blundy besides vorian wouldnt be with them much longer she was pretty sure then momey who was still pretty in spite of the fact that she was nearly three blundy liked being around pretty women impor tandy she was also quite securely married to megrith the family doctor who was an asset to the picnic in his own way he loved to cook outdoors finally there were vincor and veria vincor because blundy liked him and veria because she was murras sister and this time they would be invited to bring their children you couldnt have children at a dinner party but how could you have a picnic without them they were good enough children as children went they were winter born kids old enough to be reasonably civilized and sister veria though a cheerful soul and always good company was conspicuously plain of course when blundy was told about the picnic he got that cold and obstinate look of his but then he always did and he gave in in the end when blundy found petoyne to make his apolo gies she was working in the insemination pens im sorry petoyne blundy told her watching while she worked you know i wanted to spend your birthday with you but i really cant get out of this picnic maybe i can fix it so you could come along she finished with the bieating ewe spraddled on its back with all four of its legs tied in the air and looked up at him fat chance of that she said dispassionately even if murra would let me come id spoil the whole day for her not that id mind that so much but shed make it miserable for me too no she said ill spend my first birthday by myself its all right ill have others she filled the syringe again with the mixture of sheep semen and distilled water and moved to the next writhing ewe blundy knotted his brows why did you volunteer for insemination you dont have to do all this kind of scut work he protested i have to pay my taxtime off dont i well sure they all had that problem pe toyne murra blundy himself everyone connected with winter wife the show had been a great financial success and their taxes were high but not this way petoyne ill be going out with the herd again after the ship lands you could come with me again oh she said i want to get it out of the way i think im going to want to stay in town when the ships here you know just to see what they have to sell and mostly i guess just to see the strangers thats not my idea of fun blundy said well itll be interesting anyway you dont get the chance to see that every day she finished with that ewe and moved to the next it was almost the last do you know what these people from the ship are like she asked as much as you do i guess no more theyre just traders people in an old ship trying to make a living going from planet to planet he thought for a moment then added theyll probably seem pretty strange theyre old you know i dont mean phys ically mean the time dilation they travel pretty close to the speed of light between stars so time slows down for them id bet that some of them were already born when the first colonists landed here she nodded it wasnt anything she didnt know for herself but it needed repetition to make her believe that any living person could have been alive that long long time ago more than twentyfive of slowyears very slow years she sighed poor people she said finishing the last of the ewes she patted the creatures head then sealed the bottle of semen for return to the freezer and sat down to wait until it was time to release the dozen bieating animals youd think it would be more fun for them to do it the other way she said absently watching them struggle against their bonds with a ram i mean then we couldnt control the breeding we get better lambs with artificial insemination he pointed out she nodded then suddenly giggled you could do it this way with murra she said grinning up at him then you could get a baby and you wouldnt have to touch her blundy cleared his throat uncomfortably he hated it when petoyne talked that way about murra almost as much as he hated it when murra talked about petoyne all he said was what makes you think i want a baby well everybody does dont they she said rea sonably i do ill take my chances some day maybe pretty soon too she added because thats the best time to do it when youre one it was another allusion to her birthday blundy thought the birthday that he would not be spending with her the trouble was birthdays were important you didnt have more than four or five of them in your life and every one marked a real change the first long year was for growing up the second was when you finished your education and began to get your career and your family and your life together in your third and fourth years you were as successful and able as you were ever going to be because the fourth birthday was retirement time if you lived to see it and then you just went downhill until you died ive got to get cleaned up and out of here petoyne said and i guess youve got to get back to murra well i promised sure the girl said so long blundy have a nice picnic and she put her face up to be kissed just as though nothing had changed he gave it up he kissed her happy birthday tomorrow he said turning to leave he was a dozen paces away when he heard her call his name he turned to look at her blundy she said i wanted to tell you well if you did want to have a baby well id be willing to have it for you blundy resisted going on the picnic again at the last minute suddenly determined to spend petoynes comingofage birthday with her after all but it didnt take murra long to reason him out of disappointing the others and at last he let murra drag him along to the hills and when they got out of the borrowed catcar in a pleasant glade he seemed resigned to going along with the picnic spirit more than that murra thought he seemed quite relaxed even happy he sat on a blanket under the biggest tree they could find no more that two meters tall because of course it had only had coldspring to grow and gazed out over the scene before them far below the sometimes river had at last returned to within its banks the floodplain all around was already planted and the first crops well along good crops they would be too because all that land was refreshed every year from the spring flooding just as ancient egypt had been before the building of the aswan dam though neither murra nor blundy had any clear knowledge of the country of egypt much less of aswan the thing was that when at last he stirred himself he fled from the grownups murra had selected with such care and romped up onto the glacier with the children murra gazed indulgently up at them sliding around on the ice as they chased a little flock of pollies hes so good with children she told veria proudly thoughtlessly because then her sister had no more sense than to say ive always thought blundy would love having some of his own oh certainly he would murra said her lips smiling but her eyes suddenly cold but we cant have everything we want can we you know how it is with blundy and me can you imagine us with children we do love them so naturally we do but you see that for us it would be quite impossible veria nodded seeing seeing mostly what murra hadnt said she understood out of her own experi ence why any woman would hesitate to have a baby on slowyear they were unbearable in winter when everyone was huddled together underground and not much better in the hot summer when most people were back in the buried city again and even if you arranged to have the childbirth at the best possible time right after new years say when people were getting ready to emerge into the sunlight again as she had with her younger child there was the high risk of heartbreak with infant mortality on slowyear so frighteningly high veria had seen a dozen of her friends go through all the mess and misery of bearing a child and watch it like a hawk for ten long months knowing there were three chances in ten that it would sicken and die swiftly and inevitably before it could walk shed been lucky with her ownso far but others had not two of her own friends had lost babies just in the past five months since new years one of them twice veria didnt say any of that to her sister she turned to peer down into the crevasse where the pumps were sucking the meltwater from around the hydrogen fuel complex that would serve the shuttles all three of them gleaming like beached whales on the flat plateau off to the west she said to the group at large it looks like everything will be ready in time for the ship in time for the ship in time for the ship megrith said looking up from the fire he was starting in the grill thats all you hear these days whats going to happen when the ship comes old vorian agreed but its exciting megrith he said you cant blame people its a good thing the ships coming in warmspring too there be plenty of time for the unloading before the worst of the summer megrith nodded the last one was bad they say you know the one that came in oh eight years ago was iff it came in winter and they had a terrible time getting the shuttles ready to fly before my time vorian cackled at four and a bit it pleased him to talk about things before his time he craned his neck isnt blundy ever coming down he complained i brought the chessboard oh leave him alone vorian veria said good naturedly cant you see hes having fun let him wear himself out with the kids maybe hell wear them out too and then we can have a civilized lunch and talk her husband looked at her and cleared his throat actually he said ive been wanting to talk to blundy about something and to you too murra oh said murra ive just been wondering vincor said apolo getically i mean winter wife was such a great suc cess theyre going to rerun it arent they veria asked yes so they say murra agreed looking at her brotherinlaw she was well aware that vincor had always been a little envious ofblundys success and hers of course the man wanted to be a director himself warily she asked what about it vincor well i had an idea with a huge success like that you might as well follow up on it you know in a few months itll be summer personally his wife put in i think summers as hard to get through as winter though its shorter of course so what would you think of a new one for the summer i thought of a natural title it tells the whole story you could call the new series summer wife murra pursed her lips they had obviously been planning this for some time she didnt blame her sister for being ambitious didnt blame anyone as long as their ambitions didnt conflict with her own and there were advantages to working with your family summer wife she said meditatively now thats quite an idea isnt iff do you think blundy would like to do it vincor asked the eagerness showing in his voice oh heavens vincor murra smiled youd have to ask blundy about that i never interfere when youre married to a genius you have to learn to let the man do things his own way she spread her hands helplessly then she said anyway i think ill just go up and join them on the ice for a bit it looks like so much fun before she reached the ice she had to dodge half a dozen screeching pollies making their escape from blundy and the little boys brightly colored emerald green scarlet one or two patterned with diamonds and polka dots the pollies werent dangerous except to the bugs they fed on but murra disliked having them there they were uncontrolled climbing up from the greensward onto the glacier itself was a very unmurralike thing to do it meant puffing and panting and besides the grass turned into mud and the mud into slush before you were on solid ice she was glad shed worn old boots she was also glad shed worn warm clothes be cause it was cold up there not winter cold of course the sun was still hot but the breeze was chilling besides she could hear sounds of running water from underneath the ice and now and then a sharp cracking sound like a large stick snapping was this place really safe she paused and looked at blundy and the two little boys petternel the sturdy fourteenmonthold porly the toddler they hadnt seen her yet they had found a smooth place for sliding and they were running toward it then planting their feet and gliding along it arms windmilling to keep their balance shouting with pleasure laughing when little porly fell down anyway it was very good murra thought with satisfaction to see her husband laughing like that again the picnic had been an excellent idea she glanced around the world was a pretty sight from the ice sheet she could see clear down to sometimes river and to the dozen streams that fed it with meltwater some of them crystal clear as the ice itself some milky white with the powdered rock they had ground away in their course it would have been even prettier if it were a photo graph or a painting hanging in her drawing room and a lot warmer she thought and for a moment wondered if she should try painting again for a while in the early part of her second year murra before she turned to poetry had thought she had a talent for art but it had been a lot of hard work with improvement coming very slowly and anyway then she met blundy and found a new career as his leading lady of course there was always a part for her in everything blundy wrote more importantly as his wife but a wife could also be a mother to children veria had put that unwelcome idea in her mind not for the first time it wasnt a prospect murra could look forward to four long months of pregnancy with your belly swelling and your grace of movement stolen away then the pain of parturition then the other pain if the baby died she shuddered the trouble was that time was running fast on murras biological clock your second year was when you had your children if you were intelligent about it and it was an unfortunate fact that murras second year was some time past but did she really want to have physical children squalling messy ones wasnt it better to have mind children her poems for instance werent those as valuable as babies but there too the clock was running for murra if anyone was ever going to be a poet a real poet a poet whose work would be admired and cherished by many others than the poets own husband this was the time to do that too wasnt it she turned around starded blundy was ap proaching with the boys one on either hand grin ning blundy asked time for lunch yet i hope veria brought along dry socks for the kids im sure she did murra said and waited for blundy to drop the childrens hands so he could help her down the slippery ice back to where megrith had put the chops on the grill and old vorian was gazing wistfully at the spring he would not likely see another concentrating on her footing murra had forgotten about the little boys behind them until she heard her sister scream the toddlers name they turned little porly was spreadeagled on the ice with his brother fearfully tugging at him he just fell pettemel moaned but he wont get up then all the adults were racing up the slope veria in the lead megrith close behind her transformed instantly from cook to doctor by the time murra got to them they had all surrounded the child and megrith had the boys head on his crouching knee lifting an eyelid to peer at the eye veria was sobbing and blundy was swearing to himself then the little boy opened the other eye and struggling to get up began to cry megrith gave a little laugh hes all right veria he just fell and it knocked the wind out of him but now his clothes are all wetand oh hell cant you smell the chops theyll be burned black if i dont get back to them the chops really were quite all right and so was the salad and old vorian sampling the bottle of wine he had opened pronounced it firstrate so the picnic was a success after all though veria was still shaken when they had settled down after the meal murra sat next to her husband watching the others clean up lowering her voice she said oh blundy vincor had an idea he wanted to talk over with you summer wife a new series for the hot time what do you think blundy pursed his lips then he shrugged but he hadnt said no of course she went on we wouldnt have to have the same cast exactly i mean if you think its worth doing at all for instance maybe im getting a little too well mature for the wifes part and waited for him to say thats ridiculous i wouldnt do anything like that without you you know that and found the day quite spoiled for her when he didnt chapter five mercy macdonald was nothing if not fair so fair that she even gave deputy captain hans horeger credit when he earned it even him as a human being he was scum and nothing would change her mind about that still she admitted to herself that he was a firstclass ship handler the way he eased nordvik into its capture orbit around slowyear was optimal nothing shuddered or jerked the thrust just dwindled and dwindled more until they were there it was the slowest part of the long journey macdonald spent it lying in her bed trying to make herself sleep she failed there were too many thoughts and memories and sudden starts of appre hension to wake her right up again every time she came close they had to do with the decision she would have to make with the barren wasteland that was her life up to this moment tedium punctuated with blazing flareups of anger at for instance hans horeger and most of all with the worry about what these slowyear people were going to be like would they be friendly even welcoming would they at least not be unland there were things she had learned about them which were to say the least not reassuring for instance their criminal law what kind of human beings punished every infraction of the law with the chance of instant death what people would simply cut themselves off from communication however tenuous or difficult or even pointless with the rest of the galaxy for that matter what kind of people could go on living in so mean an environment and could she herself possibly live as one of them then the last little gentle nudge of thrust was gone they had arrived it was a critical moment a moment to reflect a transitional moment but there wasnt much chance for reflection what there was was pandemonium with nordvik at relative rest nothing weighed any thing anymore and everybody was scurrying around the ship chasing the floating pens dishes books keys chasing down and capturing the thousand little items that somebody should have secured but hadnt they should have remembered what zero thrust was like of course but years made you forget even that what mercy macdonald had forgotten was to put the lid on a jar of hard candies shed taken them out to have one to suck as a prophylactic against noweight nausea then the whole jarful had followed her out the door and halfway down the hall bright little balls of colored sugar that were sure to raise hell with the air pumps or the light fixtures if she didnt track them down so in that very significant moment all she was seeing of the planet they had come to visit was a quick glimpse out of the corner of her eye now and then in fact it didnt look like anything special anyway it looked a lot like every other habitable planet in the universe naturally enough blue sky white cloud dappled land bright blue seas that was pretty much what a planet had to look like if any human being was going to be able to spend much time there and when she finally got the last peppermintgreen candy back in the jar and the lid on tight this time when she finally was able to race down to the lock room it didnt look much different even in the big screen except for one thing it was hard to get a good look at the screen there was too much in the way every one of the fiftysix people of nordmk had huddled there floating every which way in a thicket of arms and legs and torsos in the microgravity still macdonald saw the one thing that was different at once some thing new was in the picture coming up toward them out of the rim of the planets dark side was a tiny diamondbright point of intense white light a shuttle was already rising from the planet i told you theyd be eager hans horeger said happily see that they couldnt even wait for us to come down in our own shuttle they had to launch theirs right away but then out of loyalty to the ship he added ill bet its a piece of junk though a place like this hardly sees a ship every fifty years we dont want to depend on them he peered around the crowded lock room for the engineering officer push ing stray limbs out of his way dave is our own shuttle ready it was of course and horeger had known all along that it was because hed been driving the poor engineers crazy for a month testing every circuit to make sure no part of the shuttle had broken or rotted away since the last time theyd used it horegers wife hanging on to her husbands shoulder for a better look as the slowyear shuttle moved closer said disgustedly thats pretty ancient hans he frowned its bigger than i expected though and theyre really pouring on the power his wife turned her look of disgust to him there you go again worrying she scolded what does it matter if its big the important thing is its old its a fossil i bet no ones visited this place in a good long time old captain hawkins cleared his throat from the wallhold where he was hanging he said mildly we dont know that all we know is that nobodys come back from it for a long time but no one listened no one listened because they couldnt his deputy had quelled his wife and begun to shout to everyone ingeneral all of you he cried pay attention quiet down do you all remember what your orders are nobody goes down to the surface without my permis sion no ones allowed into their shuttle unless i order you there and when nordvik leaves for its next port of call no ones going to stay behind unless i say you can and i wont do you all understand that he raked his crew with his eyes one by one craning and twisting to make each eye contact satis fied or as satisfied as hans horeger ever got he finished and if any of you forget what im saying i promise you ill make you regret it but macdonald noticed that he didnt say how nordvik was a hundred times the size of the shuttle but they could feel the whole vast starship shuddering as the slowyear shuttle nuzzled in then there were long seconds of squeaking and rasping while the shuttles portal seals felt the outlines of nordtriks and slowly adjusted themselves to fit then the lock opened nordtriks whole crew moved forward as one as the shuttle people pulled themselves in hand over hand through the tangled crowd macdonald could see clearly enough that they were carrying no weapons there were only three of them one was a slim young girl who held a briefcase the second a tall lean man who had nothing at all in his hands the third a squat goodlooking one who held only a flower the man with the flower peered in at and around the various faces in all their angles of presentation taking his time then he settled on mercy macdonald he grinned at her and handed her the flower my names blundy welcome to slowyear he said the young girl gave him a quick angry look then turned it on macdonald are you the governor she demanded her accent was odd but macdonald understood her easily enough we dont have a governor i guess you mean the captain thats him over there on the wall she said pointing to the real captain of course but im his executive so im the one you have to talk to horeger said quickly and belatedly added uh welcome to interstellar ship nordvik the girl bent to her briefcase and pulled out a thick sheaf of papers the man named blundy still had his eyes appreciatively on mercy macdonald she stared right back he was she thought the smallest person present well the shortest anyway though even that was hard to be sure of with everyone floating in odd directions there was nothing small about his body especially the thick muscles in his bare forearms and his eyes did not leave mercy macdonald he was interested she thought liking the fact that he was showing interest even liking the feelings inside her that came from enjoying it she was sorry when he turned his gaze to hans horeger the kind of thing we want he began visas first blundy the girl interrupted ive got my orders sure petoyne the man said indulgently but they dont have to have visas until they come down do they theyre all probably going to want to wont they so they have to fill out the forms she cleared her throat and addressed the group on behalf of the governor general i welcome you all to slowyear i already said that petoyne said blundy im saying it officially and ask that you fill out these forms and sign them then we can get on with the business were all really interested in each of you take one please have you all got pencils well get some will you while someone was hurrying away to find things to write with macdonald took her eyes off the squat man long enough to read one of the forms the people of this backwater planet didnt seem to have much regular use for such things she saw because these were just photocopied printouts headed planet of slowyear department of trade and immigration with the impromptu look of something somebody had remembered to whomp up at the last minute before nordvik arrived there was an awful lot of tiny type when she signed that form she would be relinquishing any claim for liability for almost any kind of ill that might befall her on the surface of the planet or on the way to it from mechanical failure of the planets ancient shuttles or their own from navigation errors from disease or attack by animals but there werent any dangerous animals on slowyear mercy macdonald knew very well they must have copied the thing out of an old lawbook really it amused her she looked up at the girl named petoyne i didnt know you had lawyers on slowyear she said the slowyear girl gave her an impatient look did you sign iff all right youve got your visa next and the man named blundy was saying whos in charge of selling stuff macdonald raised her hand i am mercy mac donald purser he looked at her again thats nice he said approving then lets find some place where we can go mercy macdonald so we can talk business business was business and this blundy man didnt waste much time getting down to it he perched companionably next to her at her display screen one hand lightly holding her shoulder and frowned at the readout no seeds ova or sperm right now he said not on this first trip we came up light so we could carry a max load back so theres no refrigeration on board this time no living plants right now either not until that other man whose name was gowen fin ished checking them hes our health officer blundy explained hell stay on board until he quickcultures everything so you wont bring anything nasty down with you you know hes going to check everything even us blundy looked surprised hasnt he done you yet no of course not well give him a drop of blood as soon as you can youre coming on the first trip of course i am blundy grinned at her of course you are im glad to say well only take two of you this time to have as much cargo mass as possible you see and that deputy captain of yours insists on being one of them so youre the other macdonald just smiled at that not having made her own mind up yet though actually there wasnt any real doubt about it and he got back to business scrimshaw sure a lot of people would like that sort of stuff he conceded though only heaven knew why books certainly and music and dramas and dance recitals too why not but the big thing he told her was datastores science history medicine especially medicine well buy copies of everything youve got about medicine or biochemistry diagnosis therapies phar maceuticals surgical proceduresyou name it well buy it can you get all that in the first load i assume all this stuff is electronic so it wont mass much fine now what are these hades artifacts i see on the list he kept her jumping but it wasnt all business she could see that she didnt miss the way he was looking at her even when what he was talking about was merchandise it was exciting it gave her pleasure the excitement was good for her she could feel it in her groin an almost sexual tingling no she corrected herself fairly not almost at all it was definitely sexual all right and blundys interest in her was not just for generic sex as it always was with dirty hans horeger because when she took the stranger to see betsy arap dee she observed carefully that although he gave betsy a thoroughly assessing look his eyes returned to macdonald her self betsy of course assessed him right back it didnt seem to be serious though because the other stranger gowen had obviously already taken a lien on betsys interest when he took her blood sample the four of them went over betsys datastores rapidly and before they were halfway through macdonald made a sur prising discovery the surprise was that betsy wasnt moping more than that for the first time since the death of her baby betsy looked not only alert but actually happy there was no other word for it her face flushed and her eyes sparkled she smiled she even laughed out loud then macdonald made the even more surprising discovery that she was quite happy too she was eager to board the shuttle and find out what this forbidding but also intriguing new planet had to offer her of course that was the point at which hans horeger came bustling into the datastore room radi ating officious authority and orders macdonald didnt let even that puncture her mood she let him strut for a few minutes then come on hans she said pulling him by the sleeve as she invented an errand to get him away from betsy and the new man realizing with astonishment that it was the first time in a good while that she had deliberately invited horeger to do anything with her come on help me pick out the first load of scrimshaw and start loading the shuttle that kept them both busy for half an hour then with the selections made she left horeger to round up a loading crew shouting more orders that no one either heeded or needed and she went looking for the health officer he wasnt in the datastore room wasnt even with betsy arap dee who was back in her own room dreamily changing into more interesting clothes macdonald finally found all three of the slowyear people together hanging onto wall holds and talking quietly together for a moment she thought they might not want to be interrupted but as soon as blundy caught sight of her he beckoned her over i thought you could take my blood sample now she explained to gowen holding out her wrist the girl petoyne sniffed at that but gowen immediately dug into his pouch and pulled out a tiny syringe it didnt hurt it only took a second long enough to pull a thin streak of red into an ampoule but also long enough for petoyne to turn away in a marked manner and leave gowenll put your sample in a culture box blundy explained by the time we land well know for sure if you have to go into quarantine or anything but you look pretty healthy to me she smiled back at him but said are you sure i should go on the first trip that girl didnt look as though she wanted me to oh he said dismissively petoyne dont worry about petoyne pack a bag and dont be too long please you dont want to miss the flight she didnt though didnt pack just one bag at least did pack one and then bit her thumb for a moment and went on to pack a second and a third until everything she really wanted to preserve of all her life to date was packed it took up more space in the shuttle than she had planned but blundy only grinned and although hans horeger certainly saw it and was not pleased at all his wife who was complaining about being left on the ship was a more immediate problem for him and then they were inside and the hatches were closed and they were on their way chapter six not even murra stayed home on the day the first shuttle came back from the ship she dressed herself in her prettiest robes and perfumed herself with an extra bit of her special essence since she would be outdoors before leaving the house she studied herself in the mirror for several minutes then regretfully she took off the pretty bugsilk slippers that became her feet so well and replaced them with sheepskin halfboots the boots were beautifully ornamented of course but so rugged she didnt have any choice about that practicality had to triumph over looks because even though warmspring had begun to dry out the landscape there would surely be mud and puddles near the landing strip there were she was lucky enough to get a ride up the slope on a flatbed although it was packed she wasnt refused since everyone was kind enough to make room for blundys murra the landing strip was on the far side of the pass five kilometers of meadow bulldozed flat and at least five thousand other people had already gathered there scores of armbanded marshals were herding them behind a roped line away from the strip itself but even the marshals were looking up half the time in the hope of catching a glimpse of a shuttle through the clouds heaven knew how many thousand others were up in the hills watching with binoculars or simply their unaided eyes everybody was bouncing with anticipation children ran and shouted vendors were all through the crowd selling cold drinks and sandwiches there was a scream from the sky five thousand heads jerked back and voices began to shout i see it there it is its coming then squinting murra saw it too first the threadthin snowy plume that followed the shuttle then the glint of the spacecraft itself it was high overhead passing beyond them to the east then banking sharply and turning back when at last it landed murra thought she had never seen anything moving so fast as indeed she hadnt it was going a good hundred and fifty kilometers an hour even with its flaps and airbrakes extended but it settled on the strip cleverly enough though sudden spurts of smoke and dust puffed up as its tires touched it rolled away long away far down the strip until it was only a toylike thing then the marshals gave up trying to keep order the crowds burst through running toward the shuttle at the end of the strip a waiting tractor backed itself into position to snag the towring in the shuttles nose and begin to drag it back toward the sheds murra spared herself that silly scramble she knew perfectly well that it would be nearly half an hour before the shuttle was in position and had cooled off enough for the hatches to be opened she waited she planted herself where the movable stairs were ready to be rolled into position bought an ice from a vendor who almost forgot to take her money she was so intent on staring down the runway and allowed the whole procession to come to her when everybody had come drifting back pacing the slowly dragged shuttle itself murra was in the front row neatly finishing the last of her ice even then even there nearly everybody recog nized murra while they waited for the shuttle to finish its cooling process crackling and pinging alarmingly as it did people took time to smile at her and nod she accepted their attention as graciously as always it didnt particularly please her it simply would have puzzled her if it had been withheld when at last the handlers pushed the rolling stairs to the hatch and it opened murra did not join in the cheering she was there though she was right there to see blundy and petoyne appear in the doorway with a couple of strangers strutty little man and dark middleaged woman and she only had to see the woman once to see what she saw as soon as they came down she was right at the foot of the stairs gracefully moving up between the woman and blundy to kiss him im so glad to have you back my very dearest she said marking out her claim and i hope youve remem bered to invite your friends to dine with us tomorrow night her too she said gazing benignly at petoyne murra saw rather little of her husband that day or at least not at close range he was frequently on the news screen of course taking the visitors to see the governor showing the visitors around the summer city standing with the visitors as they were welcomed and welcomed and welcomed no actually she saw quite a lot of blundy that day and it pleased her that she saw him as she did because so did everyone else on slowyear it was less pleasing though because it was never blundy alone she saw on the screen but always blundy plus that foolish little petoyne and blundy with that rather unattractive starship woman who would murra was resignedly certain be the next petoyne in blundys lifefor a time by the time blundy got home that night he was too tired to talk or said he was she had expected as much anyway as she certainly had expected he slept that night where he belonged next to her side he didnt talk in the morning either because as soon as he was awake he was out muttering excuses no time so much to do but that was all right too because the dinner was a fixture for that night in a whole marriages worth of arranging pleasing dinners for blundy she was determined this would be the grandest and best everything would have to be perfect so to begin with murra called in the cleaners as soon as he was out of the house and informed her cooker that he would be needed by noon at the latest to start preparing the meal then content that that much was well in hand she allowed herself to go shopping the shopping was for food she told herself but although there were plenty of food stores nearer than the central marketplace that was where she went that was where everyone else went too because the second shuttle this one the starships own had landed at daybreak and the people from the ship were already setting up their displays of course there werent any actual goods there those were already in the sheds by the landing strip what the ship people had were a dozen or so video displays to show the catalogue of their wares one screen was showing a succession of industriallooking machines another household appliances a third plants of many kinds from tiny babys breath blossoms to giant redwoods a fourth animals it was hard to see individuals in the press around the displays but a short sallow man stranger at one of the booths came forward to greet her mrs ah blundy isnt iff he asked and she recognized the man she had invited to dinner actually my name is murra im afraid i didnt catch yours hans horeger the man said promptly holding out his hand im executive officer and deputy captain acting captain really he said with a deprecating shrug because old hawkins is really pretty much past it im honored murra said gravely and please do be sure to come tonight and bring your charming friend you mean mercy macdonald i suppose horeger said murra was aware of his eyes on her missing nothing his study of her was discreet which she appreciated but also quite admiring which she appre ciated even more would you call her charming i guess so in her way but of course next to someone like you she gave him her prettiest smile i dont see her here she remarked looking around the man looked around too no i guess shes not back yet she and your husband had to go to the sheds to look at some samples she nodded yes she said i rather thought they would blundy and herself the two from the starship petoyne there had to be one more a male to make an even number since the extra male would be more or less petoynes escort he neednt be particularly attractive murra thought for a moment then smiled and picked up the phone it was answered at once vorian i know how much you wanted to meet the people from the starship well if youre free for dinner this evening of course he was that settled murra gave orders and watched until she was sure the cleaner and the cooker were well started on them normally murra didnt care for hired servants but they were absolutely necessary this night for there would be no spending time in the kitchen for the hostess when she was convinced they were properly doing the gruntwork they were hired for muna began doing the things she alone could do she arranged the flowers she had bought prettily around the room then music she selected tapes of unobtrusive strings and flutes to play in the background then she programmed the big wall screen with suitable background images mostly a series of still shots from winter wife and other produc tions she and blundy had done together with of course the most flattering shots of herself featured she worked as hard as the hired help because it all had to beperfect it was perfect too she was sure of that before the first guest arrived yet when mercy macdonald showed up murra had a quick moment of doubt the woman had managed to get herself rested and cleaned up and she did not look quite so middleaged any more indeed murra thought justly she looked no older than herself she greeted the woman with a handsontheshoulder almost hug and gave the air by her ear an almost kiss were so grateful you took the time to come my dear she said sweetly and inti mately as though they had been longlost sisters tragically separated somehow but still somehow bonded for life oh whats this you shouldnt have for the woman was handing her something soft wrapped in an even softer fabric was it bugsilk no murra realized it had to be real silk from old earth it was a pity that it was patterned with those quite hideous flowers but still one day murra thought but not a very near day not until the woman who had given it to her was no longer around that wrapping could become a pretty scarf or something attractively unusual to throw over the back of a chair when she unwrapped it and saw what the wrap ping contained she said warmly why its really beautiful trying not to laugh but all the same making sure blundy saw with what effort she was politely not laughing the gift inside was imagine a stiff piece of some coarse fabric sewn with wool lettering greetings from space it said in strident green blue and purple its a sampler people on earth used to make them to hang up in their living rooms mercy macdonald explained i didnt know if youd like it we call this sort of thing scrimshaw people on other planets like to have these things for souvenirs of our visit its stunning murra said knowing that blundy would understand she thought it hideous and just because she thought it so hideous she insisted that blundy put it up at once on the wall over the couch in the living room cant i help the man from the ship asked politely of course not captain horeger murra said warmly consciously flattering him by upgrading his title youre a guest oh please call me hans he said looking at her with admiration and not bothering to mention the fact that mercy macdonald who was also a guest was already standing to help blundy with the hanging hans then she said saying it in a way that conveyed appreciation of the name and also of the man who owned it please just sit down and make yourself comfortable let me get you some wine its summer wine from last year thats when the grapes are best just when everything starts to get too hot to grow and smiled at him while she was pouring but did not fail to see out of the comer of her eye mercy macdonald handing the sampler up to blundy and their hands touching although there were only six at dinner it wasnt quite as intimate as murra had intended though only the six of them sat down to eat rosha the cleaner had stayed on to serve and grannis the cooker insisted on carrying some of the dishes in himself thrilled to be so close to the visitors and both of them felt quite free to take part in the conversation murra made sure there was plenty of conversation careful to guide it to new areas whenever it showed signs of slowing after all murras dinners were not about food they were about talk but it didnt need much guiding there was plenty to talk about the visitors had so much to learn about slowyear and the locals were delighted to tell them about slowyears seasons well yes we have a very long year blundy was telling mercy macdonald so we divide it into six principal seasons coldspring warmspring summer hotfall coldfall and of course winter petoyne made a face winters the worst she said looking at mercy macdonald in a very wintery way not for me rosha disagreed he leaned past murra to set down the soup tureen wow that was heavy he informed them all the way i look at it when its winter at least you can dress warm and go out for a little while if you want to but theres nowhere to go in summer unless youre rich hows the soup fine blundy said just as though it were a reasonable question for a server to ask good ill tell grannis he said and reluctantly left the room muna smiled after him just as though she meant it as a matter of fact she told her guests blundy and i do go to one of the polar places sometimes in the summer then she saw the look on blundys face but not this one i think she said blundy picked up the conversation where it had been interrupted so altogether we have a hundred months each one about seventy days long there are holidays now and then to make it come out even with the year right now were in green coming up on flower the whole countryside gets really pretty in flower youd like it i was born in flower vorian contributed that isnt a good time though i was just beginning to get big enough to be really active when summer came along my mother told me she had the devil of a time keeping me indoors from fry to sweat and i was born on the sixtyseventh of shiver thats the first month of winter murra added and blundys birthday is the fortyfifth of christmas while petoyne here has just had her very first birthday the th of green wasnt it dear petoyne looked down at her food without answer ing blundy took up the thread so im two and seventeen months he told the company that would be about thirtyfive of your years mercy and lets see murras now murra was already overriding his voice to the deputy captain are you really enjoying your soup its delicious horeger responded gallantly what is ie petoyne giggled you dont want to know what do you eat on the ship nothing as good as this horeger said at once and gave murra a complimentary smile she smiled back comfortably aware that the main appreciation in his eyes was not for the food but for herself that was a situation familiar to murra and always welcome there was no doubt in her mind that this hans horeger person would sooner or later do his best to get her alone and from there to a bed she didnt mind that she looked forward to it in fact she also however knew that she definitely would not let it go that far not ever the selfindulgence of actually sleeping with any of the men who had made it clear she was invited would cost too much at a minimum it would mean the sacrificing of a grievance she wouldnt be un selfishly tolerating blundys adulteries anymore simply knowing that she could easily be bedded by horeger was almost as good as doing it and a lot less trouble in the long run when the scoggers were served and each of the guests from the spaceship had sampled them with enjoyment petoyne spoke up theyre bugs you know she said avoiding murras quick vexed look the soup was made out of their shells now this is the meat horeger stopped with a fork almost to his lips bugs blundy took over explaining that slowyears na tive fauna were seldom vertebrate not counting the flying pollies and never mammalian the largest life forms the original settlers found were arthropods vaguely like terrestrial insects with an insectoid egg pupawinged life cycle you wont see them now theyre only out at night but theyre around he told the visitors then when the dry season starts they burrow into the ground and cocoon up in hotfall they come out when the rains start by then theyre big winged things the size of my fist they fly eat mate lay eggs and die then the eggs hatch and over the winter the pupae grow underground we use dogs to dig them up in the winter before they hatch out by themselves this time of year we can catch them on the surface if were good at it these are fresh murra said proudly careful to refrain from displaying the pride she felt in the meal she had set before her guests after all not every hostess could provide outofseason delicacies on short notice hunters brought them back this morn ing they do taste good horeger said doubtful but game mercy macdonald said oh god hans why shouldnt they after all back on earth we used to eat lobsters wed eat them on the ship too if we had any which led to talk about shiplife that was the part that really fascinated the servers consequently slow ing the meal down murra sighed and resigned herself at least that meant more time for conversation mercy macdonald described the universal shipboard practice of making scrimshaw to sell sure but mostly to give us something to do otherwise wed all go crazy hans horeger modestly explained the difficulties involved in guiding a starship across the long light years between worlds macdonald pointed out how boring it was for everyone and how no matter how careful they were in dealing with each other some times some members of the crew simply could not stand some other member of the crew one second longer she was murra thought with interest talking more to her deputy captain than to her hosts but horeger didnt appear to notice he blithely began to explain that they would soon have to dislodge the ships fuel storage converting it to a factory for more fuel and sending it close in to the star for solar energy to make the antimatter fuel murra said quickly surely theres no hurry arent we being good hosts for you here well said hans horeger turning toward her in some ways extremely good he means we dont have any complaints at all mercy macdonald put in youve been so good about commercial dealings youve just about put me out of a job i dont have to bargain you pay us so well that we can afford just about everything we ask for machine parts metal supplies some of us can still hope for more horeger murmured in murras ear were getting plenty from you people in return of course blundy declared paying no attention to what was going on at the other end of the table thats what makes good business a fair price both ways and everybody sat is that the phone murra it was she looked resignedly amused excuse me please she said getting up it wont take me more than a minute in fact it took less she wasnt out of the dining room before grannis appeared from the kitchen his flushed face looking sad say murra he said this isnt so good its your sister you know your nephew porly she says hes in the hospital while murra was out of the room everybody of course had some sort of reassurance or at least good wishes to offer but it was horeger who said the thing that no one else said he looked around the table then turned to blundy is it this infantmortality thing you people have he asked vorian gave him a sharp look what infant mortality thing is that he demanded horeger looked surprised oh shouldnt i have said anything i mean i wondered why you were so hot for all our medical data and so on so i assumed that was it all the babies that die i mean who told you about babies dying vorian asked but blundy answered instead what difference does it make who told him he asked reasonably thats right horeger we have a very high infantmortality rate its the worst thing about living here and every time a ship comes by we hope theyll have something we can use but they never have so far i thought so horeger said sounding satisfied believe me blundy we want to help you any way we can oh christ mercy macdonald interrupted him why dont you just shut up horeger turned a wrathful face on her have you forgotten who youre talking to his voice was strangled as though he was striving against insuper able odds for selfcontrol im simply making a humanitarian offer of aid to people in need yes what kind of aid is that we dont even have a real doctor on nordvik she looked at blundy i think she said the best thing we could do is mind our business vorian sighed wed appreciate that he said softly and now i think its getting late for an old man to be out when murra came back they were all at the door and unwilling to be cajoled into staying no really horeger said apologetically pressing her hand we really must go especially you mercy macdonald gave him a surprised look me horeger nodded blandly to catch the shuttle back to nordvik he explained itll be taking offearly in the morning and youll have to be on it i will its your job he was grinning at her but quite determined you have to check out the rest of the cargo oh you can come back down when thats done of course macdonald thought for a moment then shrugged ill do that she said good night murra and then all the good nights were said it was too bad in a way murra thought that verlas call about little porly had spoiled the party on the other hand one major part of the partys purpose had been to allow blundy the chance to compare his wife and the challenging new woman side by side murra was quite content with the results blundy offered to show horeger and macdonald back to the quarters they had been given with the rest of nordviks landing party vorian went along but when petoyne started to leave with them murra touched her arm in a friendly way stay a little please she urged i sent the servers home so could you help me straighten things up petoyne couldnt refuse that as murra had in tended she couldnt and when sulkily the child began to pick up glasses to take them to the house work room murra stopped her the cleaner will be back tomorrow to take care of that she said sweetly sit down petoyne help me finish that last bottle of wine youre old enough now surely just sit with me a minute please petoyne was unwilling but she was also very young she did as she was told by the older woman whose husband she had borrowed she watched without speaking while murra fetched clean glasses from the sideboard and poured chatting idly about the soup that awful scrimshaw thing the guests im sorry about your nephew petoyne offered murra looked surprised then shrugged its a pity of course but what can you do she sipped her wine looking at petoyne over the top of her glass you know youve been very brave petoyne stiffened me brave i dont know what else to call it i know this is difficult for you dear murra said her tone sympa thetic its an unfortunate situation blundy is a wonderful man but he simply cant help being drawn to attractive women petoyne with her untouched wine glass before her said stiffly if youre talking about mercy macdonald i dont have anything to be brave about i happen to know blundy and that woman arent lovers blundy would have told me no i dont suppose they are now murra agreed but they surely will be dear and you mustnt let yourself be hurt petoyne looked at her for a moment without speaking then she stood up proud if young ill be all right murra i do want to go home now of course murra smiled and would have kissed her cheek at the door if the girl had given her a chance she gazed after her quite content they all had to learn after all these little peccadillos of blundys were well sometimes hard to accept as no one knew better than she in the long run they didnt matter for what was certain was that such silly affairs were all temporary and in any case definitely did not threaten blundys marriage to murra sooner or later they always would end this one with the woman from the interstellar ship sooner than most of course and she thought heading back into the house it was an established fact that blundy wewrwent back to a previous mistress poor starship woman poor petoyne chapter seven when mercy macdonald pulled herself out of the shuttle into nordviks hatch the first thing that struck her was how many people there were aboard the old ship and how few of them she knew the only one nearby was not one she really wanted to talk to but she did her best to be amenable hello maureen she said to horegers wife who was looking even sulkier than usual the woman grunted so hows slowyear she asked managing to convey in three words her extreme irritation at not having already seen it for herself its fine youll like it macdonald said gener ously do you know where betsy arap dee is christ no i dont know where anybody is maureen horeger complained you could try the datastore room unless shes shacked up with that damn slowyear doctor again thanks macdonald said quite pleased at the news and when she found betsy in the datastore room after all she was even more pleased to see the sparkle in her friends eyes the health officer from slowyear that macdonald supposed had put it there wasnt with her but old captain hawkins was so macdonald didnt think it the right time to ask the questions on her mind although she was pretty sure she knew the answers anyway horeger she said wants the complete manifest brought up to date and im supposed to check it out can you help me no problem betsy said cheerfully but the old captain had ideas of his own for macdonalds time he was it turned out looking for warm bodies to help prepare the drive unit for its remotecontrolled sojourn near the star soaking up solar energy to make antimat ter fuel what do you mean you cant mercy he complained but most of the crews already down on slowyear i want to go there myself thats fine she said slightly surprised come down with me ill be going back as soon as i can i wish but ive got to finish my work here he gave her an eager look i get the impression youre enjoying slowyear he said how are things going my god wonderful theyre buying everything and they dont care what it costs he said wistfully you know maybe we could buy what we need to fix the ship up after all ive got to get down there and see only how am i supposed to get them started on the fuel production so i can get away draft some of these new people she suggested there were certainly plenty of them nordvik had more people aboard it than it had seen in years and threequarters of them were slowyearians they were all over the old ship poking into crew quarters looking into storage holds grinning or politely trying not to grin at the sanitary facilities of course micro gravity made all that sort of thing much more compli cated the toilets worked better when the ship was underway taking pictures of the bridge when mercy macdonald opened the door of her own room there was even a slowyearian in her bed blinking up at her in surprise the covers pulled around her head oh the woman in the bed said you must be the one your name is oh hell she said finally beginning to unbuckle the sleep straps this is your room isnt iff im sony i didnt know you were coming back look ill get right out of here just give me a minute to get my clothes on she was floating free in the room scrabbling in total nondignity for the handhold she had forgotten to grasp before macdonald could stop her she was also quite naked macdonald found herself laughing but its really all right she said to the naked woman stay where you are please im just coming up to get a few more things and im going to catch the next shuttle back down the woman looked at her still half asleep youre sure you dont mind then she realized she had nothing on and made a grab for a sheet fortunately she caught a flying corner and managed to tug herself back to the bed wrapped in the sheet now firmly holding to the grip of the headboard she joined macdonald in laughing sorry about all this she said again look im llson burganjeellsonthreely she held out a hand and macdonald drifted herself close enough to shake it mercy macdonald mercy macdonald said re leasing the hand why dont you stay right where you are it wont take me more than ten minutes to get everything together theres not that much here that i want to keep and then you can go back to sleep fine llson said and watched silently for a moment while macdonald opened closets pulled out drawers searched through cabinets she had pretty well cleaned her stuff out but there were she found a few bits of clothes plus a few keepsakes she had overlooked she threw everything into a cloth bag closing the top every time to keep what she packed from drifting out again you look like youre getting ready for a long stay llson offered um macdonald said bobbing her head but more interested in the cabinet she was ransacking i guess it makes a nice change llson said so ciably it does for me being here on this ship i mean im an instrument and control device specialist i never though id have the chance to actually study a space ships systems are you getting all the help you need macdonald said making the effort to be polite oh sure everybodys been great its not that hard anyway this ships a pretty standard design for the old days i mean i could probably fly it myself that made macdonald look at her more closely why would this sensiblelooking woman want to know how to fly an interstellar ship slowyear didnt have any slowyear wasnt going to be building any either certainly not in the lifetime of anyone alive there now they couldnt they didnt have any of the necessary resource base they had no antimatter technology no cspeed instruments none of the complicated gadgetry you needed to get a ship from star to star so macdonald deduced there could be only one reason for ilsons interest the woman was intending to ship out on nordvik when it left there was a lot that mercy macdonald could have said to this woman she didnt say any of it the regrettably bad decisions of a slowyearian woman she didnt even know were none ofmacdonalds business and she wanted to get everything done that she needed to do on nordvik so she wouldnt miss her shuttle she threw the last decent blouse she owned into the bag closed it held herself steady with one hand to the doorknob her brow wrinkled as she tried to remember if there was anything else worth taking then she shrugged and said i guess thats it she was silent for a moment looking around the room i wonder if ill miss this place she mused out loud llson looked surprised then you are planning to stay on slowyear for a while she said you bet for the rest of my life said mercy macdonald with satisfaction so i make you a present of this room may it give you more pleasure than it ever gave me chapter eight in a way blundy wasnt sorry that mercy macdonald was back on the ship for a few days or at least not entirely sorry he did feel strongly that there was unfinished business between them and since she was just off a ship that business couldnt be postponed too long he had work to do though by which he meant not the creation of silly entertainments that other people valued so but his real work politics he faced the fact that at present his most effective political work had to be nonpolitical that was because that was the nonpolitical present mood of the people of slowyear who could never blundy be lieved keep more than one thought in their minds at a time right now what obsessed all minds was the ship so blundy gave up the idea of proposing taxtime reforms and building programs and concentrated on making sure that whenever anyone thought of nordvik and its crew they also had to think about arakaho blundy spenotex as well meanwhile there was a job to be done that was sort of political the governor and the council had invited a few prominent persons blundy one of them to help them deal with the trade problem that wasnt too tough except that they should have taken care of all that long since trade had already begun there wasnt any doubt of that because from the window of the council room where they had gathered they could look right down on the marketplace and see the shopping going on so they disposed of it quickly they already had mercy macdonalds catalogue of the goods nordvik wanted to sell them all they had to do was make a generous estimate of their aggregate value then double it then issue enough supplementary scrip to divide among the people of slowyear to pay for it all the only hard part was allocating the proper amount of scrip to each citizen because the governor thought the most important citizens should be awarded extra scrip and some of the council put forth the idea that lawbreakers for instance should be given less but blundy argued for flatequal distribution to every living human on slowyear babies and felons included he carried the day after all the governor mused when the vote had been taken consoling himself for the defeat what does it matter the only thing thats important is to make the ship people happy and one of the council shrewdly looking forward to future power changes said exactly well call it the blundy plan and we can start the distribution tomor row all that went just as blundy wished it but he was dissatisfied he began to wish for mercy macdonalds return not just for her physical company although there was certainly a sexual interest but for what she knew in blundys eyes mercy macdonald was a resource she had once lived on earth earth was the breeding ground of all politics and he yearned to ask her for everything she knew where macdonald was however was two hundred odd kilometers overhead circling slowyear nineteen times a day twice after dark he looked up and was able to pick out the glimmer of nordvik in its singled orbit there were shuttles going back and forth almost every day there wasnt any shortage of ship people more than thirty of them had already come down in one shuttle or another even in nordviks own shuttle timescarred and reentryheat stained from its long use in so many different parts of the galaxy slowyearians laughed at it among themselves they would not be so rude to their guests almost all of the thirtyodd always excepting mercy macdonald were still on the surface of slowyear being feted and entertained by their hosts blundy did not fail to note that in one particular place there especially was no shortage of ship people or at least of one ship person that place was in his own house it seemed to blundy that every time he came home hans horegerwas there before him sitting under that dumb piece of scrimshaw on the wall sipping wine with murra and looking ill at ease when murras husband turned up that wasnt important either it certainly didnt cause blundy very much annoyance least of all jealousy if there was anything blundy was sure of it was that whatever horeger was hoping for in his persistent attentions to murra murra was not supply ing it but still blundy found himself staying out of the house even more than usual fortunately he had a lot to keep him busy he had nearly decided at least he had come to the point of thinking seriously about whether he was going to decide that it would be worth his political while to write something after all about nordvik and its crew and so he spent a lot of time visiting the ship people on slowyear that was easy they were all over mingling with the natives looking at everything curious about everything they seemed to be happy that the slowyearians were spending their new scrip freely snapping up almost everything they had to offer without much regard to price or quality either because a lot of the junk nordvik had hauled from star to star really was junk old machines that nobody would dream of using anymore art that was almost as ugly as mercy macdonalds guest gift plants that wouldnt grow on slowyear and sperm and ova of animals that would certainly die there none of them were macdonald though when blundy tiring of their company decided to go back home for lunch it wasnt to see whether horeger was there before him but of course horeger was the only surprising thing was that he wasnt alone their doctor megrith was there and he looked solemn horeger was looking solemn too and even murra seemed sober blundy guessed the reason porlyhe asked and megrith nodded hes dying yes but lets not talk about it murra said as she naturally would since such subjects as the death of a small child were not only depressing but quite a bore horeger however wasnt smart enough to let it go he said sounding sad and sincere i feel weve let you down blundy i wish wed had something that helped murra started to speak then restrained herself ill see how lunch is getting on she said getting up megrith responded for all of them well you didnt he said i checked everything in your file myself nothing that seems to help with our own situation of course there are plenty of items from way back on earth we found entries about all kinds of human prion diseases kuru creutzfeldtjakob dis ease gerstmannstraussler syndrome and the vet erinary syndromes scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy but its all old old stuff our own particular variation of the prion syndrome evidently didnt occur on earth maybe not on any other planet we visited either horeger said regretfully because we dumped most of their data in too where is he when blundy biinked at him he added porly i mean the baby that is ah passing away oh in the hospital of course thats in the winter city megrith explained the hospitals too much trouble to move with the seasons with all the equipment and everything we have aid stations out here but the real hospitals in the winter city up under the hill id like to see that too horeger said thoughtfully the whole idea of everybody holing up for the cold weather thats interesting then looking at blundy he added mercy would too shes coming back down tomorrow by the way how very nice murra said coming in to an nounce lunch and speaking for blundy without look ing at him why dont we all go up there and show you around id love it horeger said moving toward the table im sure mercy would too and oh he said sniffing appreciatively that does smell good what is iff or shouldnt i ask blundy didnt have to invite mercy macdonald to tour the winter city murra did that for him as soon as the ship woman had returned to the surface muria was there at the landing strip welcoming her back warmly telling her how much pleasure it would give her and blundy to show murra and hans horeger around the underground dwellings macdonald looked at her strangely but accepted at once and the next morning they set out up the hill all four of them in a tractor cab the winter city was set into the side of winter hill well what else would we call iff murra said amused regard it well its where we all live squeezed in on top of each other for ten long months every year horeger stared up at the thirtymeter metal tower on top of winter hill in that that big metal thing murra smiled and blundy explained the tower is just the entrance the citys all underground to conserve heat horeger frowned up at the tower but its got all those doors he said as of course it had six great doors one at each level of which only the lowest one was open because of the snow blundy said it piles up all winter long you see it doesnt start to melt until new years so sometimes it gets twenty meters deep here as it keeps building up we have to switch to a higher door every month or two so as to come out on top of it he halted the tractor at the base of the tower and they got out to look around holding her floppy hat against the hilltop breeze murra pointed south can you see the pastures over the rim hills there thats where we take the sheep to fatten blundy can tell you all about that yes blundy said giving his wife a look i do go out with the sheep sometimes its taxtime work for me see we have to pay part of our taxes in com munity labor and but smiling horeger was holding up a hand to stop him yes i know about taxtime murra has explained it all well anyway i pay the taxes that way because i like it it gives me a chance to be off by myself or with a good friend murra put in amiably or with a friend maybe but pretty much by myself so i can think as a matter of fact he added ive decided to go out again with the next flock maybe in a couple of days he didnt meet the gaze his wife turned on him but waved to the planted lands down the hill thats all farm were lucky with our farmland here we always get good crops there arent any native pests just a few stowaway bugs that sneaked in from earth on the first landing and not many of those horeger said as a pleasantry i hope we havent brought any new ones theres no chance of that muna said reassur irigly because of course we checked everything did you know that we have farms in the winter city too underground horeger said in admiration well hothouses anyway murra amended her self they arent very big theres plenty of power and water for them of course but we are a little cramped for space still we get fresh vegetables from them all winter long some blundy said murra gave him another look well we cant grow enough to feed everybody all the time of course but theres always plenty of summergrown food in the freezers the powers the big thing blundy said he took mercy macdonalds arm and pointed look over here do you see that field that looks like its just been plowed it hasnt been theyre solar collectors theyre where we get most of our heat and power murra can tell you all about that she works there just for taxtime murra added quickly to make sure the visitors understood her real career was as actress and poet and mostly as wife to arakaho blundy spenotex gallandy horeger said but that sounds fascinat ing murra solar power thats how we make antimatter for nordvik you know id really love to see how you do it here shall i show you around the power plant id be happy to murra said but lets take a look at the winter city itself first so they did at horegers request for whatever sentimental reason horeger thought he had they visited the hospital first naturally enough the hospital was on the highest level of the city that was for the benefit of those who needed to get to it in a hurry in the seventyodd months of the year when the winter city itself was nearly abandonedthough it did noth ing for the great bulk of the hospitals occupants showing visitors around the hospital was a brand new experience for blundy no slowyear citizen had ever had to be given a tour of it since no slowyear citizen ever got through his first year without at least an occasional visit he knew what the starship people wanted though he gave them a cursory look at the general medical section the maternity wing and the long wards more than five hundred beds worth of wards partly occupied with adults recovering from surgery or illness or not recovering as the case might be then he led them to the saddest wards of all the custodial facility for terminal cases where nearly two hundred children some looking like newboms others toddlers and talkers were lying stupefied or gazing blankly or giggling pointlessly murra wrinkled her nose fastidiously even the older children were too sick to be continent horeger scowled helplessly and mercy macdonald shuddered i dont know why we wanted to come here she said her voice shaking with sympathy and horeger said as blundy had known he would isnt your nephew here murra murra gave the captain a sweet look of sorrowful resignation dear little porly she sighed oh hes here all right we could ask one of the nurses to help us find which crib hes in if you like but really theres no point he wouldnt know we were here blundy ex plained or apologized none of them do you see not after the first day or two its the brain thats attacked first it just turns into a kind of sponge and thats it im so sorry macdonald said yes of course murra said nodding graciously well what can one say except that this is a depressing place isnt iff perhaps we should go on to look at the rest of the city there are elevators just outside here we can go down a few flights to the apartment quarters and you can see how we lived the elevator was big enough for forty people or for any reasonably sized cargo the four of them took only a corner of it when it stopped they emerged into a long hall metal walled and punctuated with metal doorways dimly illuminated with sparse standby lights just a minute blundy said and rummaged around a closet until he found the right switch then the overhead lights sprang up they were carefully covered with colored glass to make the light as pleasant and as varied as possible and the walls once the lights were on turned out to be painted and decorated handsomely but blundys look was dour it strikes me as a bit well sterile horeger suggested peering down the long hallway murra gave him a kindly smile oh it is we all feel that dont we dear still its better than being out in the cold she told him although sometimes we dont think so along about christmas or mean and it really is a whole city isnt iff mercy macdonald said strolling a few meters down the hall and testing a door it was unlocked it opened to show stripped rooms nothing in them but bare builtin desks and empty wall shelves we take everything we own when we move out in the spring blundy told her and went on to give her the statistics just about five hundred thousand people live here all winter long thats practically the worlds whole population not counting the few people who stay on in the outposts we have factories here in the city as well as stores and schools and swim ming pools theyre on the next level along with the gyms and the sports facilities and theaters and everything else that makes up a city well be expanding it come fall murra added there be fifteen hundred new rooms added so some families can have private sitting rooms and so on thats one of the things blundys been so good at making the council take action on things that every body needs but they just havent got around to theyll be getting ready to debate the plans in a month or so isnt that right dear blundy nodded we do all our construction in the fall you see because thats when everythings dried out and its not too hot to work outside so we do all our planning before the end of summer when a lot of us come right back into the city here blundy said sourly the summer heats almost as bad as the winter cold so murra finished giving the guests an admir ing look you see that you people came at the best time time of year this is when everybodys pretty happy or as happy as we ever get blundy finished macdonald found herself shivering when she saw that murra had noticed she said apologetically its a lot warmer in the hospital murra was immediately solicitous oh im sorry about that but you see we dont heat the whole city this time of year even the hospital wont need it much longer but the outside airs still a little cool up here on winter hill she smiled i dont know if youre interested in the details i am horeger said immediately well we pump heat in you remember the photovoltaic farm you saw well the pv cells turn the sunlight into electricity thats where we get our power and we use the surplus to electrolyze icewater into hydrogen for fuel for tractors and aircraft and now for the space shuttles too of course but the pho tovoltaic cells cant use much of the infrared radiation the heat from the sun in fact they work better when theyre cooler so we run pipes under them to carry the heat away to a big clay bed in the mountain the clay stores heat all spring summer and most of the fall then we pump the heat back into the city all winter long id really like to see that if youd be willing to show it to me horeger said of course hans you too mercy if youd like iff i dont care much about power plants id rather poke around the city macdonald said if blundy doesnt mind showing me i mean blundy didnt at all when the other two had gone he said i could start by showing you where i lived and when she nodded but im hungry right now arent you lets get some sandwiches first we can take them with us and eat them in one of the apartments then youll get an idea of what its like to live in this place for ten dreary months on end in the huge elevator going back to the hospital level walking down the cafeteria lines to choose their food blundy held mercy macdonalds arm not aggressively just confidently because things were working out as well as he could have hoped they chatted on the way about nonessentials he asked her how her shipmates were enjoying slowyear and she told him they all seemed to love it all of them even old captain hawkins came down with his wife and sam bagehot hes one of our medics got some one to give him a ride to some fishing village on the coast he said hes always wanted to go fishing he looked at her affectionately its interesting for you to be here you bet blundy id almost forgotten what a planet was like all this spacewell not here in this place of course but out in the open he nodded then youll understand how much i hate being cooped up here all through the winter here lets see if we can get into our old apartment he selected a door no different from any other door in the hall as far as macdonald could see then scowled apologetically im sorry i forgot we locked it and i dont have the key but all the apartments along here are pretty much the same he tried three or four other doors before he found one that opened shook his head tried a dozen more until he found the one he was looking for thisll do he said and held the door open for her she looked around the room no bigger than her own cabin on nordvik it was almost as bare as the one they had seen on the other level though it did contain a strippeddown bed so well have something to sit on he said of course she said and he saw her nose wrinkling stinks doesnt iff he said they turn off most of the ventilation when people are outside but its not much better in the winter i was just thinking that it looks pretty crowded she said half apologizing and well dreary it was dreary crowded too he said sourly gazing around well we might as well sit down they sat on the edge of the bed since there was no other place to sit and opened their sandwiches there wasnt much room their elbows touched from time to time and blundy could feel or imagined he could feel the warmth that came from her body he was surprised when she asked him are you sure you want to be here he biinked at her that wasnt the question on his mind at all you seem well i dont know depressed maybe is it seeing the hospital he shook his head then thought for a moment maybe a little he said avoiding the truthful answer maybe its this whole place i cant tell you how much it begins to look like a prison after the first few weeks of course murra and i were lucky because we had our work we kept pretty busy all winter long with winter wife and we got to spend a lot of time in the studios we even went outside on location for a couple of episodes though that wasnt much fun either if youre going to be out for more than a few minutes you have to dress really warmly with electrically heated boots and gloves she looked at blundy quizzically and that was a big success winter wife i mean he shrugged she studied him for a moment i dont understand blundy youre a famous playwright video dramas he corrected her same thing and yet you work as a shepherd but i enjoy that he said surprised after you spend seven hundred winter days crowded together in this place a little solitude is a good thing besides its beautiful out there you see all the stars at night and in daylight the mountains are always there on the horizon theyre really spectacular to look at and the airs so pure and its quiet and by now the flowers are springing up all over and everything smells so sweet he stopped surprised she was almost laughing thats quite a sales talk she said sales talk it sounds like youre saying i ought to go out with you she amplified well he said touching her arm i suppose i am if youd like to i accept she said gravely but in that case and because its still a little chilly in here if you and i are going off into the boondocks together dont you think that now its about time you put your arms around me blundy slept in his own bed that night with murra peacefully sleeping beside him if she knew he had bedded mercy macdonald that afternoon as he was convinced she always did she had had the grace to keep silent about it she had asked no questions when he came home offered no criticism invited no sexual advances she was a model winter wife blundy thought glumly as he drifted off to sleep unfortu nately it was now spring the next morning he rose early wakened by the thunder of the departing shuttle and headed for the marketplace as he had expected he would he found petoyne idly looking through the scanty remaining stocks of scrimshaw when she saw blundy and put down the carved plastic statuette shed been looking at to come over to him there was something in her face that told blundy she knew as well as murra that he had found a new lover unlike murra she didnt pretend not to she said her tone hostile i hope you know what youre doing i do know and listen getting it over with im going to take mercy macdonald out to the flocks with me petoyne nodded as though she had expected it you wont want me along then well i think i know what you think then she gave him a look which he could not decipher it was neither angry nor amused it was if anything sympathetic sad whats the matter he demanded theres something i think you should know that old captain from the ship i saw him taking his clothes off in the marketplace this morning he stared at her and she nodded so if youre going anywhere with mercy macdonald she said my advice is do it pretty soon chapter nine up to the very last minute mercy macdonald had not really decided whether to have an affair with this conspicuously married little man in fact she had decided quite a long time ago that going to bed with married men was the sort of mistake she had outgrown long since but there were always extenuating circum stances werent there obviously this particular mans marriage to that slinky pretentious woman had be come a burden to him while blundy himself had seemed so down and also so very male no there was something about this blundy that was worth pursuing she was sure of it all the same she was starded when she thought about it to find herself climbing into his stubby high roofed vehicle on the way to the sheep pastures with him and it occurred to her that she hadnt really decided to do that either but she was doing it since she was actually doing it there was no reason to worry about it maybe at some later time macdonald informed herself she would have to think harder about what all this was getting her into not now now she was quite content to enjoy this interesting new experience with this interesting new man the word that was important here was new macdonald had had quite a reasonable number of lovers before at one time or another but it had been most of her life since any one of them could have been called new new to share her bed maybe but for decades now any new body that showed up in her bed had been simply an old familiar body in a somewhat altered relationship but now there was this blundy man squat sometimes sulky quite married but oh so very so excitingly and completely new she laughed out loud surprising herself when blundy turned to give her a puzzled look she just shook her head she was as silly as silly little betsy arap dee she thought or as lucky or as yes as young all of a sudden without any physical change she was seeing the world through the eyes of a teenager again it was all fascinating even this silly blocky car they were riding in she had never been in a vehicle quite like it before it was obviously designed for just two people and her big traveling bag had barely squeezed into the space behind the seatswouldnt have made it at all if blundys own bag hadnt been quite small as she studied the way he drove the thing she concluded she could easily learn how to do it herself there was a wheel that steered it and on the wheel a selector lever that seemed to shift gears and on the floor a pedal that controlled the speed and another that controlled a brake all that was simple enough once you started it up and put your foot on the right pedal the highpitched sputtering hydrogen motor pushed the little car along at a satisfying rate of speed there were other vehicles on the road big tractortrailers going empty out to the farms and coming back laden with crates of vegetables and fruits and bins of grain flatbeds with farm workers who dangled their feet over the sides and waved to them as they passed smaller trucks with machinery and beams and slabs of construction materials the important part about driving she decided was knowing how to avoid hitting any of the other vehicles blundy seemed to manage it well enough snaking around and past them if blundy could do it so could mercy macdonald then they were climbing up through a pass and the basin that held the summertown was behind them the number of vehicles dropped sharply the charac ter of the landscape changed the farmland that had been all around them was now gone the road they were on bugged a cliff high above a gorge far below a goodsized river ran sculptured by rapids and boulders i thought we were taking the sheep out to pasture she offered the flock had to leave at daybreak by now theyre thirty or forty kilometers down the pike almost to the graze i got a friend of mine to start them off for us well take over when we catch them she nodded looking around once through the hills the landscape had flattened out again but there were no farms here nothing but meadow and scrub as far as she could see when she commented on that to blundy he explained its the river mercy the first thing that freezes in the winter is sometimes river and then the ice blocks its channel so the whole basin behind the ice dam fills up fifty or sixty meters deep and then that freezes too so all the silt comes out and makes the soil better there on this side of the hills not as good good enough for pasturing sheep though see and ahead of them she did see a long plodding line of stonecolored animals with a dozen dogs loping back and forth along them to keep them in order at the head of the line a tractortrailer was leading the way its pace creeping no faster than the sheep blundy pressed a button on the steering wheel and a horn blared a moment later an arm stretched out from the cab of the tractor and waved she sees us he said well catch up in just a minute and in not more than a minute they had the tractor had pulled a few dozen meters ahead of the flock blundy and mercy macdonald were out of their car and blundy was heaving their bags into the tractor cab at once that part was all right the part that wasnt all right was that the driver of the cab turned out to be the skinny little teenaged girl who was named petoyne i thought we were going to be alone macdonald couldnt help saying but blundy didnt hear he was already climbing into the cab himself sliding behind the wheel come on mercy he ordered and then leaning out of the cab he waved to the girl who was standing with one hand on the door of the little car they had chased her in looking at the two of them with a hard stare thanks petoyne he called see you in a month or so and the leaders of the flock already beginning to catch up with them he started the tractor crawling forward again as soon as mercy macdonalds feet left the ground so it was just as well he hadnt heard macdonald thought as she settled herself in although what she also thought was that the way petoyne looked at her suggested something blundy hadnt seen fit to men tion how many lovers could this man handle she wondered it was not a serious question though for the next few weeks anyway the answer would surely be one for there wasnt going to be anyone else around never once before in all of her life had mercy macdonald been so remote from the society of others in this place there was simply no one at all outside the shell of the tent they lived in imagine living in a tent there was not a single living creature she could see for many miles in any direction except for the herd of snuffling grunting ewes and the dogs that watched over them and except of course for arakaho blundy spe notex it was almost dark before she realized that she didnt feel lonely at all and that the reason was blundy he seemed to take up a great deal of space in her life enough for multitudes he was inescapably but not at all oppressively there when they had reached the grazing grounds bumping slowly over open ground for several hours till they reached the stream he had been looking for blundy turned off the radio beacoa hauled great bulky packages out of the back of the trailer and began setting up their quarters he waved at the sun still high in the sky but beginning to lower we want to get all set up before dark he said so lets get on with it within the first hour he had made them a home no they had made it she did as much as blundy did he showed her how to set the first tent peg in at the proper angle then left her to drive the others in in the pattern he marked out for her while he unrolled the fabric itself they put it up together sweating and grunting blundy lugged in the stuff too heavy for her to carry or too awkward but her bag his own the cooking utensils the one airbed the folding furniture all that he left for her to sort out and shift into position while he dug the sanitary pit and moved the trailer down to the stream she opened cartons and tried to figure out where everything went that wasnt easy tents didnt seem to have built in lockers macdonald had never even seen a tent before much less lived in one the only time shed come across the word was in books where the things seemed mostly associated with armies she spent a long time that first long afternoon wondering what she had got herself into but then things began to pick up when she came out of the tent with sandwiches she saw that blundy had singlehandedly pitched a smaller tent over the sanitary hole they ate companionably if rapidly while blundy outlined to her the other things they had to do that day its clouding up over there he said waving to the west so i think well have rain tomorrow and we want as much as possible done before that she nodded the sheep were scattered all around now without the radio beacon to keep them in order individual animals spotted across the landscape munching away dont you have to worry about the herd she asked what for all they have to do is roam around and eat the dogs wont let them stray too far and the rest they can handle by themselves lets get the pipes strung and so the two of them ran a flexible hose from the tractor at the banks of the stream a pump in the tractor sucked water out of the stream the idling engine warmed it and it came out of a nozzle at the top of a pole a shower wed better only use it in the daytime blundy said because the nights are still a little chilly but it wasnt quite dark yet when they had finished and macdonald insisted on trying it out which is when she discovered the interesting possibili ties when two people showered at once when they came damply out of the shower wrapped in towels into the still warm evening it was full dark she looked up and caught her breath i told you about the stars blundy said his arm around her but no one could have although the western edge of the sky was clouded black most of it was still clear and stars seen through nordviks vision plates were nothing like stars spread over your head on a warm spring night there was nothing in the heavens to compete with them slowyear didnt have a moon slowyears sun certainly had a family of planets but the distances between them were great and none were very bright from the surface of slowyear the stars had slowyears sky to themselves and they filled it here away from the lights of the summer city the sky was black and pearl sprinkled with diamonds the milky way spread across one whole corner of the sky like a lunar mist mercy macdonald leaned against blundys warm arm her head back eyes filled with the starry splen dor it was not only dark apart from the faint glow that came through the fabric of their living tent it was silent all she could hear was small snuffling noises from sleeping sheep she could smell them not an offensive odor just a natural one one of the dogs woke up enough to amble over to investigate them then lay with its head on its paws to watch them this was what solitude was like macdonald thought a little scary but fine blundy stirred and pointed thats where the earth is he said she tried to peer along his index finger you see those two lines of stars three in a row and then four in a row just above them well right between those two lines i dont see anything she said no you cant were too far but thats where it is she didnt answer that and she didnt go on look ing at the stars either she was looking at blundys face very near her own but almost invisible with nothing but starlight to see by she could not make out his expression would you like to go there she asked he lowered his gaze to look at her go to the earth but i cant he said reasonably ships do go there blundy not nordvik of course i dont know where nordvik will go from here but it isnt likely to be the earth but im never going to leave slowyear he said his tone flat so whats the use of wishing come to bed the next morning mercy macdonald woke with thunder crashing in her ears and a drumming of rain on the side of the tent blundy was nowhere in sight that was a new experience for her too and not one she really enjoyed peering out of the flap of the tent she saw eyesearing flashes of lightning all around and the rain that was turning the ground into swamp was not just rain chunks of ice the size of her thumbnail were bouncing off the ground astonishing her she had heard the word hail before she had never seen any but when blundy came dripping into the tent a few minutes later he promised it would all be over soon and it was and by noontime the water had run off and the sky was blue and warm it was not a bad way to live she decided shepherding had a lot going for it the food was good the accommodations comfortable enough once you got used to them and the sex with blundy was she hunted for the right word and grinned to herself when she found it ample it changed the way she felt about everything her whole metabolism seemed to have shifted gears it was just as well that making love never failed to give pleasure because there wasnt much else to do the sheep took care of themselves pretty much with a little help from the dogs but it didnt matter if they wandered when it came time for lambing blundy explained he would turn on the radio beacon and that would bring all the ewes back close to the tent then things would get busy enough helping the ewes deliver when they needed help fitting the newborn lambs with radio guides of their own clipped into their noses can we do that by ourselves she asked trying to imagine what it would be like to help a ewe bring forth its lamb and not liking what she imagined he hesitated for a moment putting his arm around her we wouldnt have to he said id get some help out here for that and she might have asked more but his arm was tightening around her and his hands were on her as he spoke and there was only one place for them to go then but even while they were making love she was thinking and kept on thinking as they settled in this existence was interesting as an experience and re warding in bed but it did she admitted get a little well not boring exactly but empty their work was certainly not demanding once a day she and blundy went out for a walk he called it inspection and what they inspected was the landscape dotted with sheep what are we looking for she asked and he shrugged sick ones dead ones maybe if theyre dead we bury them and if theyre sick we give them antibiotics but its pretty early for that we dont usually get any real problems until the lambing starts he took her hand and moved on to the top of a hill he took out his field glasses and swept the area finding nothing that needed attention macdonald was glad to sit down on the grass for a moment it had been a long time since she had done this much walking she gazed around at the pretty landscape with its haze of bugs none of them more than mild annoyances because slowyears bugs did not care for the blood of mammals never having had any mammals to coevolve with the only large creatures in sight were the idle dogs and the scattered sheep thats all you have for livestock sheep no cattle goats pigs horses he took the glasses away from his eyes and frowned down at her trying to remember we did have some of them a long time ago twentyfive slowyears ago when the colony first landed but they died theyve got frozen sperm and ova on the ship you know yes you told us i dont think theyd work here you could try she said well we probably will hey he said scuffing at the base of a bush with the toe of his boot look at that theres scoggers here she looked but could see nothing but a hole in the ground but that was all you ever saw in the daytime he explained they only come out at night but fresh scoggers the best eating there is well catch us a couple one of these nights he grinned down at her speaking of which he said im getting hungry arent you and that was a shock to her too because what they ate was lamb chops but they didnt get them out of a frozen food locker they got them from that permanently available larder on the hoof that was all around them she closed her eyes with a faint squawk when blundy leisurely selected one of the smaller ewes lifted its chin with one hand slit its throat with the knife in the other that wasnt the end of it either then there was the skinning and the disposal of the offal buried deep so the dogs wouldnt dig it up again then the rough butchering then while their own chops were broiling over the little hydrogenburning grill blundy whistled the dogs in and fed them the rest of the dismembered carcass they have to eat too he reminded her so well slaughter one sheep a day as long as were here macdonald wasnt at all sure she could eat some thing that had been gazing at her with sad eyes no more than half an hour earlier but she did it tasted good too and when it was done and theyd buried the bones she looked around expectandy now what do we do she asked whatever we like he said were through for the day she looked at him doubtfully what would you be doing if i werent here he shrugged write for a while maybe then do it she commanded and tried to make herself inconspicuous while he obediently sat down at his little keyboard that wasnt easy to do she discovered macdonald was used to having a lot of free time between stars time was what you had the most of on nordvik but on the ship at least she had her books and her recorded music and films and people to talk to even if they were always the same few dozen people you had got tired of talking to years before here there was nothing they could have had television but blundy explained that he had vetoed that theres no point looking for solitude and bringing the whole world along is there but then almost as an apology he added theres a player in the cab of the tractor you know i didnt know well its there and i think there are disks mostly theyd be technical stuff on taking care of sheep you know but there might be some others anyway you might want to learn more about sheep she did learn more about sheep more than she had ever wanted to know about sheep but what saved macdonalds sanity was that there turned out to be quite a few disks on other subjects too some had evidently been left behind by that gawky adolescent petoyne blundys former helper those were school work math lessons accountancy lessons grammar lessons they were not in any particular order and some had been spilled out of their container and wedged their way under the seats or behind forgotten tools none of the school lessons were really exating for mercy macdonald but in among the lesson disks were some recorded episodes from blundys video drama winter wife those interested mercy macdonald quite a lot not just because blundy was the guiding spirit behind them but because those particular episodes had been selected for a purpose she did not need to be told that they had been petoynes they mostly had petoyne herself in a leading role but a younger skinnier petoyne than the young woman macdonald had met and macdonald studied them with a good deal of interest so she spent most of her afternoon hours watching vid disks there in the tractor cab while blundy did whatever he did with his writing machine he did not want to show her any of it and she stopped asking and they ate and slept and did their chores and made love and sometimes swam in the very cold stream and sometimes picked wildflowers and sometimes on clouded nights when there wasnt even much starshine to guide them went out scogger hunting in the velvet dark stumbling over bushes and hillocks with ultraviolet lights that made the grubs epicuticles fluoresce so they looked like neonlit cockroaches in the night and broiled their catch for breakfast and made love and sometimes macdonald sat by herself out of blundys sight and stared thought fully into space wondering just what she was doing there on this planet with this stranger that took a lot of thinking there was no doubt in macdonalds mind that she was fond of blundy she had not yet decided to entertain the word love or that blundy was an attractive man most so because he was a brand new one but that didnt answer her main question which was was there a future with him she wondered what he would be like in the long term assuming there was a long term assuming his wife conveniently evaporated while they were gone of course that wouldnt happen of course there were so many of courses she could change her mind and leave with the ship leave without him of course or alternatively she considered the possibility that he might want to come along in nordink the beauty part of that was that murra certainly never would so that part of the problem would solve itself but blundy wouldnt go either it wasnt enough for her to be sure of that in her mind she had to hear it from blundy himself when she broached the subject joking seriously he shook his head nobody from slowyear will ever leave he said positively why he took her hand in his kissing it while he thought for a moment we wouldnt be welcome he said at last and then his kisses moved up her arm and naturally they made love again to change the subject she was pretty sure and why were there so many subjects he kept on changing the last disks she found were the most disturbing they turned up when she had abandoned hope of discovering any more forgotten under a seat cushion and they were additional episodes from winter wife she played one of them over and over until it made her weep when she could watch no more the sun was almost setting and she stumbled to the tent and blundy he looked up in startlement from his machine mercy he cried alarmed jumping up to take her in his arms whats the matter winter wife she said trying not to sob the part where the little girl dies like your little nephew porly oh he said beginning to understand yes that episode you found a copy that was one of the best ratings we got when the baby died it was horrible she said they called it essie or something like that he held her silently for a moment before he answered its the letters se he said stands for spongiformencephalopathy like we said the brain turns all loose and fluffy and they die she let him stroke her hair while he told her again about spongiform encephalopathy known as a disease of animals on earth it was called scrapie when sheep got it mad cow disease when it infected cattle on slowyear it was a kind of failure of the human bodys autoimmune systems the brain dete riorated fast and stopped being any kind of a useful brain adult slowyearians were generally safe from it babies werent their immune systems were incompletely developed so they were at severe riskand four out of ten of them died of it so were old people as their immune systems began to break down putting them at risk if you survive past the first twenty months he explained youre almost always all right until youre almost three three slowyears macdonald said doing the arithmetic in her head almost fifty standard years i suppose so oh blundy she said woefully i dont think i could stand it he said soberly a lot of people cant she didnt answer that because a thought had struck her what she was thinking was that accounted for murras childlessness then she made herself stop crying she sat up straight rubbing the last damp from her cheeks and said the other thing that was on her mind that was really moving she said the show i mean it made me cry blundy didnt answer unless looking modestly pleased was an answer so macdonald pressed on with her thought what i mean she said is that you could sell those disks to the captain im sure thered be an audience for them on other planets he didnt answer that either but the way he didnt answer surprised her his face suddenly went still no expression at all she waited to see if he would speak when he didnt she ventured is something wrong you dont have to do it if you dont want to he stirred and got up i do want to he said mercy what do you think i am im a writer part of the time anyway and when i write i write for people id love to have an audience a big audience the biggest there is people i dont even know maybe even people who arent born yet well so then will you give the captain the disks sure he said in a tone that was not intended to be believed and turned away she looked at him puzzled he seemed to have forgotten the matter he was going about the simple household business of turning on the lights and when that was done he went to the cooler and pulled out a bottle of wine it took the lighting of the lamps to make macdonald realize that it had become dark outside oh my she said were forgetting about dinner he nodded agreement pouring wine for both of them she accepted hers willingly enough they generally had some wine with their dinners why not a glass before but it wasnt going to be just one glass for as soon as the first glasses were down he was pouring more well macdonald told herself she wasnt that hungry if blundy felt like having a few drinks why should they not have them she sat companionably next to him in silence thinking about the things she hadnt really wanted to think about before until the wine emboldened her to speak it is pretty awful isnt iff i mean knowing what might happen to your babies if you had them awful enough he agreed and knowing that its going to happen to you too i mean even as a grownup if you live long enough she went on thoughtfully is that why you ah why we what he demanded pouring again well i mean the poison pills i mean sentencing people to take poison for doing things that really arent so bad you know i mean on other planets they have laws too but mostly they just put people in jail if they break them he thought it over maybe so he said because dying of a poison pill is better than the ah the se thing he had to think about that too maybe he said well i guess it is but thats not the only thing everybody dies on all the other planets too dont they you do seem to have a different attitude on slowyear though yes he agreed i guess we do have a different attitude on slowyear on slowyear i dont think wed ever put anybody in jail maybe we dont have jails because were all in jail all winter long twenty months fourteen hundred days and it doesnt matter if youre guilty of anything or not poor blundy she said kissing his cheek and blundy said finish your wine then lets get to bed when mercy macdonald woke up the next morn ing she knew shed gone to bed pretty tipsy both times because she had a memory of blundy and herself stumbling out into the warm night sometime or other just to breathe a little fresh air before sleeping she even remembered that he had pointed out the glimmer of light on the western horizon that was nordwk high enough above the planet to be caught in the last of the sunlight before it entered slowyears shadow and that he had been crying she remem bered that for some reason that had seemed funny to her at the time what she hadnt expected was that although her head hurt with a serious hangover it seemed funny now too she giggled at the thought that she was still a bit tipsy she got up looking for blundy to tell him that amusing fact he wasnt far he was right outside the door feeding a piece of the scogger they hadnt remembered to eat for dinner to one of the dogs and he looked up when he saw her hi he said smiling because he saw that she was smiling she giggled at him what are you doing that for she asked he looked surprised im giving him a taste for it he explained come winter we use dogs to sniff out the larvae on the slopes sometimes where the wind scours the snow away we have to wear the heated suits to dig them up but the dogs have to tough it out he broke off smiling no longer what is it he asked sharply its just that thats so funny she gasped laugh ing digging up bugs with dogs it was quite annoying though that this man was not laughing with her his look was serious even frightened you dont see the humor of it she said pouting you you then she reeled it was almost as though she were back on the ship suddenly weightless and it was embarrassing too she pulled herself together do you know she said its a funny thing but i dont seem to remember your name and saw with astonishment that the man was crying chapter ten when they moved deputy captain hans horeger of the interstellar spaceship nordvik to the adult terminal ward murrawent with him though she could not have said why by then there was no longer any chance that the man would regain consciousness again he was in the deep sleep or coma or paralysis that marked the final stage of spongiform encephalo pathy and though sometimes his eyes opened she knew that there was nothing he saw the eyes might work still but that was the end of it horeger no longer had enough of a brain to know what die eyes were seeing murra didnt tarry in that depressing place twenty of its thirtytwo beds were occupied now another twenty of nordviks people had died already by now they were smoke and ash in the crematorium surviv ing only as some few harvested grams of cell cultures for the doctors to ponder over later a handful were dead or dying on the spaceship itself not worth the trouble of shipping down planetside and so nordviks long voyages were coming to an end muna took the flowers she had brought and arranged them in a vase by horegers bed it was not a sensible thing to do but she was aware it was a pretty one then she nodded to the attendant drowsing in a chair by the door and when she left the ward deputy captain hans horeger ceased to exist in her mind at the desk a friend hailed her to say that blundys tractor had been sighted coming down the road from the pass she accepted the news with thanks and of course a certain amount of pleasure and decided to wait to see him come in so she went to the hospital cafeteria for a cup of coffee and a bit of pastry chatting with the others sitting around there it was a more cheerful crowd there this day after all the influx of terminal cases were almost all from nordvik and it was not as though they were relatives or friends across the long table from murra a doctor who had just come down from the ship was holding court he was tired everyone could see that but willing to indulge everyones natural curiosity yes every remaining nordvik person in orbit was now terminal or gone hed given the last of them soporifics to ease their passing no he didnt think it was just as well to feed them a poison pill as they did with babies in the last stages of se they were not in pain they were very little trouble and they would die on their own quickly enough no it didnt look as though any of nordviks people had been among the very lucky very few who were naturally immune outsiders so rarely were he held up one of the little dryicecooled boxes hed brought with him still ive brought down all the tis sue samples this one was a woman named betsy arap dee she was one of the first to die and i checked her out myself she never did get down to slowyear he added sounding almost sentimental do you think youll learn anything from the tissue samples one of the nurses on break asked the doctor shrugged but didnt answer he didnt have to they all knew the answer was no but that theyd study them as carefully as they could anyway because what else was there to do then the conversation turned general yes the doctor told them the emptying ofnordvikwas coming along on schedule all the shuttles were busily going back and forth bringing down everything that could conceivably be worth keeping the hastily erected storage tents by the landing strip were already bulging with the loot yes the instrument and control people were nearly finished with installing the automatic controls in nordvik no there was nothing unusual about the way se had struck the ships people it was just as it had always been every one of them had come down with the disease and every one would die it was an interesting conversation but a little sad too everyone was feeling a little of that endofthe party letdown the arrival of nordvik had been exciting it was a once in a lifetime event more than that because many lifetimes came and went without the thrill of a visit from space but now it was over in a little while the last person from slowyear would leave nordvik setting the automatic controls that would launch the old ship on its final trip accelerating until the last of its fuel ran out then going on endlessly forever never to be seen again by anyone it does seem a kind of a waste a visitor said thoughtfully the doctor bent a curious look on him waste but were stripping everything out that we can possibly use the visitor flushed i was just thinking he said i mean thats a whole operating ship we could refuel it you know the equipments all there and the operating materials in the datastores then we could send out an expedition somewhere but where the doctor said impatiently looking around in an aggrieved way and of course there was no answer for that one either by then murra had finished her second cup of coffee she glanced at her watch and decided it was time to look for blundy she gathered her robes around her nodded a pretty goodbye to the others at the table and walked gracefully to the admitting room she had almost left it too late blundy had made better time than she expected he was there before her half carrying the stumbling mercy macdonald whose eyes were wildly glancing around who was whispering gibberish too softly for anyone to hear who had soiled herself whose head lolled helplessly against blundys shoulder until the nurses eased her onto a gumey for her last trip blundy hadnt seen her and murra decided to leave it that way there was a question she wanted to ask blundy was he going to write something about nordvikand its crew and was there a part for her but she confidently knew those answers already so inconspicuously she turned and went to the outside door where she had no trouble finding a ride back to the summer city he was she thought kindly entitled to his last moments alone with the macdonald woman for herself there were things to do she planned the rest of her day with care she would go to their comfortable charming home and prepare a nice meal for him he would be tired when he got home and frayed from what had to have been a distressing experience choosing the menu was a bit of a problem she reflected on the way down the hill it would have to be something that could be kept ready for serving him at short notice she didnt know just when he would get there but there was no doubt in her mind that sooner or later he would for where else was there for him to go
