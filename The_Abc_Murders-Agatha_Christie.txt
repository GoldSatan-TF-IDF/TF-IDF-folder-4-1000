chapter one the letter my name is captain arthur hastings my wife and i have a large farm in south america but before i was married i lived in london there i helped my friend the famous belgian detective hercule poirot solve many crimes poirot used to work with the police in belgium but he retired several years ago since retiring though he has become a very successful private detective when the british police have a difficult crime which they cannot solve they often ask poirot to help them in june i came back to britain for six months on business while my wife stayed in south america to manage the farm i didnt know that during that time i was going to work with my old friend poirot again most of this story is my own personal experience sometimes though i have included information about events when i was not present myself but i believe i have described the thoughts and feelings of the other people in the story correctly poirot has seen my work and agrees that i have in my opinion poirot used his skills in a most clever and unusual way to solve a number of crimes which were different from any others that he had worked on i shall call these crimes the abc murders after arriving in england i went almost immediately to visit poirot he had moved to a new flat in london and was very pleased to see me youre looking wonderful poirot i said you havent changed at all in fact if it were possible i would say that you have fewer grey hairs than the last time i saw you poirot smiled and why is that not possible it is quite true do you mean your hair is turning from grey to black instead of from black to grey i said in surprise thats very strange it seems against nature as usual hastings said poirot you have a beautiful and unsuspicious mind you have not changed over the years you notice a strange fact and explain it in the same breath without noticing that you are doing so poirot walked into his bedroom and returned with a bottle in his hand i looked at it then i understood it was a bottle of black hair colouring poirot i cried youve coloured your hair oh you begin to understand said poirot i suppose next time i come home i shall find you wearing a false moustache or are you wearing one now poirot looked shocked he has a large black moustache which he is very proud of no no mon ami a false moustache how horrible he pulled his moustache to prove to me that it was real i have never seen a moustache like mine in the whole of london that was a very good thing i thought privately but i didnt want to hurt poirots feelings so instead i changed the subject are you still working i asked i know you actually retired years ago yes it is true replied poirot i tried to grow vegetables instead but immediately a murder happened and i had to forget about the vegetables and since then whenever i say that a case will be my last it is not each time i say this is the end but then something else happens but i must say my friend that i do not like retirement at all if i do not use my brain it will stop working i see i said so you still use your brain sometimes exactly but i choose my cases very carefully you know hastings in many ways i think you bring me luck really i said in what ways as soon as i heard you were coming i said to myself something will happen hastings and i will hunt criminals again together just like the old days but if so it must not be ordinary business it must be something he waved his hands excitedly something very fine and special well i said at last smiling has this excellent crime happened yet pas encore at least poirot paused and a look of worry came over his face his voice sounded so strange that i looked at him in surprise suddenly he crossed the room to a desk near the window there were papers arranged carefully inside he took one out then passed it to me tell me mon ami he said what do you think of this i took it from him with interest it was a letter which had been typed on thick white notepaper mr hercule poirot you think you are very clever at solving mysteries that are too difficult for our poor stupid british police let us see mr clever poirot just how clever you can be perhaps youll find this problem too difficult watch out for andover on the st of the month yours abc i looked at the envelope the address was typed too the postmark is london wc said poirot well what is your opinion i handed the letter back to him its from a madman i suppose said that is all you can say well doesnt it sound like a madman to you yes my friend it does his voice was serious i looked at him in surprise youre worried poirot a madman mon ami is a serious matter a madman is a very dangerous thing yes of course thats true i hadnt thought about that but it sounds more like a rather stupid kind of joke perhaps the sender was drunk you may be right hastings what have you done about it i asked what can one do i showed the letter to our good friend chief inspector japp he thought the same as you that it was a stupid joke they get letters like these every day at scotland yard i too have received them before but there is something about that letter hastings that i do not like poirot shook his head then he picked up the letter and put it in the desk if you really think its serious cant you do something i asked as always you are a man who wants action but what can we do the police have seen the letter but they too will do nothing there are no fingerprints on it there are no clues to the possible writer in fact there is only your own feeling not feeling hastings feeling is a bad word it is my knowledge my experience that tells me something about that letter is wrong he waved his hands about then shook his head again well i said the st is friday if a big robbery happens near andover then ah what a good thing that would be a good thing i stared in surprise the word seemed to be a very strange one to use a robbery may be exciting but surely it cant be a good thing poirot shook his head you dont understand my friend it would be a good thing because it would clear my mind of the fear of something else of what murder said hercule poirot mr alexander bonaparte cust got up from his chair and looked nearsightedly round his bedroom the furniture was old and the bedroom was not very clean his back hurt from sitting in the same position far too long as stretched himself to his full height you could see that he was quite a tall man but he did not look tall because he stooped he went to a coat that was hanging on the back of the door and took from the pocket a packet of cheap cigarettes and some matches he lit a cigarette and then returned to the table he picked up a railway guide and searched for some information inside it then he looked at a typewritten list of names with a pen he made a mark against one of the first names on the list it was thursday june i had forgotten about the anonymous letter which poirot had received and the importance of the st on the nd poirot received a visit from chief inspector japp of scotland yard we had known the inspector for many years and he welcomed me warmly what a surprise he cried its just like the old days seeing you with monsieur poirot again youre looking well too your hair is just getting a little thin well thats what happens to all of us i always brushed my hair carefully across the top of my head so i wasnt very pleased that inspector japp had noticed my thinning hair but i decided not to get upset yes were all getting older i agreed except for monsieur poirot said japp smiling at my friend his hair and moustache look wonderful and since he retired hes become very famous train mysteries air mysteries high society deaths oh hes here there and everywhere have you heard about his anonymous letter i showed it to hastings the other day said poirot of course i said id completely forgotten about it what was the date in the letter yesterday said japp thats why ive come here i rang the police in andover to see it anything had happened but the letter is certainly a joke a shop window was broken by children throwing stones and a few people got drunk but thats all i am very glad about that said poirot we get lots of letters like that every day said japp from people who have nothing better to do they dont mean any harm theyre just looking for a bit of excitement i have been foolish to think that the matter was so serious poirot agreed well i must go said japp laughing i just wanted to stop you worrying after the inspector had left poirot said he does not change much the good japp eh he looks much older i said and his hair is going grey i added nastily you know hastings i have a very clever hairdresser said poirot he could put some false hair onto your head and brush your own hair over it poirot i shouted im not interested in your hairdresser whats the matter with the top of my head nothing nothing at all said poirot quickly well i said feeling a little calmer im sorry that that anonymous letter didnt lead to an interesting crime yes i was wrong about that said poirot i am too suspicious the telephone rang and poirot got up to answer it allo he said yes it is hercule poirot speaking he listened for a minute or two and then i saw his face change mais oui yes we will come naturally it may be as you say yes i will bring it a tout a lheure then he put down the phone and came across the room to me that was japp speaking hastings he had just got back to scotland yard there was a message from andover andover i cried excitedly poirot said slowly an old woman has been found murdered she had a tie tobacco and newspaper shop her name is ascher i think i felt a little disappointed i had expected something very unusual the murder of a shopkeeper didnt sound very interesting poirot continued in the same serious voice the andover police believe they know who did it it seems that the woman husband gets drunk and behaves badly he has said several times that he would kill her but the police would like to have another look at the anonymous letter i received so i have said that you and i will go down to andover at once i felt a little more excited perhaps the murder of the old woman wasnt very interesting but it was still a crime it had been a long time since i had mixed with crime and criminals i wasnt really listening to poirots next words but later i remembered them very clearly this is the beginning said hercule poirot chapter two a visit to andover we were met at andover by inspector glen a tall fairhaired man with a pleasant smile he gave us the facts about the case the crime was discovered by police constable dover at am on the morning of the nd he noticed that the door of the shop wasnt locked he entered and at first he thought that the place was empty but when he shone a light over the counter he saw the body of the old woman when the police doctor arrived it was found that the woman had been hit hard on the back of the head the doctor said that she had probably died about seven to nine hours earlier but weve found a man who went in and bought some tobacco at said inspector glen and a second man went in and found the shop empty at five minutes past six so that puts the time of death at between and we havent been able to find anyone yet who saw ascher the womans husband near the shop at the time but he was in a pub at nine oclock and was very drunk hes not a very pleasant kind of man he didnt live with his wife asked poirot they separated some years ago aschers german he was a waiter at one time but he started drinking after that nobody wanted to employ him his wife worked as a cookhousekeeper to an old lady when the woman died she left mrs ascher some money and mrs ascher started this tobacco and newspaper business ascher used to come round and cause problems for her so she gave him a small amount of money every week to make him go away had they any children asked poirot no theres a niece shes working as a maid near overton and you say that this man ascher used to threaten his wife thats right he was terrible when he was drunk threatening to kill her was anything missing from the shop asked poirot nothing no money was taken no signs of robber you think that this man ascher came into the shop drunk started threatening his wife and finally struck her down it seems the most likely solution said the inspector but id like to have another look at that letter you received i was wondering if ascher wrote it poirot handed over the letter and the inspector read it i dont think its from ascher he said at last i dont think that he would use the words our british police its good quality paper too its strange that the letter should say the st of the month of course it might be coincidence that is possible yes said poirot but i dont like this kind of coincidence mr poirot abc who could abc be well see if mary drawer thats mrs aschers niece can give us any help its a strange business a constable came in yes briggs what is it its the man ascher sir weve found him right bring him in here where was he hiding down by the railway franz ascher was a very unattractive man he was crying and threatening us at the same time he looked at each of our faces in turn what do you want with me you should be ashamed to bring me here you are pigs how dare you do this his voice changed suddenly no no i do not mean that you would not hurt a poor old man not be hard on him everyone is hard on poor old franz poor old franz mr ascher started to cry stop that ascher said the inspector control yourself youre not in any trouble yet if you didnt kill your wife ascher interrupted him his voice almost a scream i did not kill her i did not kill her it is all lies you are english pigs all against me i would never kill her never you often threatened to kill her ascher no you do not understand that was just a joke between alice and me a strange kind of joke where were you yesterday evening ascher i did not go near alice i was with friends good friends we were drinking at the seven stars and then at the red dog dick willows he was with me and old curdie and george and piatt it is the truth that i am telling you take him away inspector glen said to constable briggs hold him on suspicion of murder i dont know what to think he said as the unpleasant shaking old man was taken out if the letter didnt exist id say he did it what about the men he talked about asked poirot a bad crowd all ready to tell lies but its important to find out whether anyone saw him near the shop between half past five and six poirot shook his head thoughtfully you are sure nothing was taken from the shop he asked perhaps a packet or two of cigarettes but that not a reason for murder and there was nothing different about the shop nothing new there there was a railway guide said the inspector it was open and turned face down on the counter it appeared that someone had looked up the trains from andover either the old woman or a customer did she sell that type of thing asked poirot the inspector shook his head she sold cheap timetables this was a big one the kind of guide that only a big shop would sell a light came into poirot eyes he bent forward a railway guide you say what kind was it an abc yes said the inspector it was an abc until that moment i had not felt very interested in the case the murder of an old woman in a small backstreet shop was a very ordinary type of crime i had thought that the date of the st in the anonymous letter was just a coincidence mrs ascher i felt sure had been murdered by her husband but now when i heard about the railway guide i felt a small shock of excitement surely surely this could not be a second coincidence the ordinary crime was turning into something very unusual we left the police station and went to the building where the body of the dead woman was being kept a strange feeling came over me as i looked down on that old face and thin grey hair she looked so peaceful so distanced from any violent event she was beautiful when she was young said poirot really i said but yes look at the lines of the bones the shape of the head we went to see the police doctor dr kerr we havent found what killed her he said its impossible to say what it was perhaps a heavy stick did the murderer have to be very strong asked poirot do you mean could the killer be a shaky old man of seventy oh yes its possible if there was enough weight in the head of the stick then the murderer could be a man or a woman the doctor looked surprised a woman eh i hadnt thought of connecting a woman with this type of crime but of course its possible poirot nodded in agreement how was the body lying he asked in my opinion mrs ascher was standing with her back to the counter the murderer hit her on the back of the head and she fell down behind the counter so she couldnt be seen by anybody entering the shop we thanked dr kerr and left you see hastings said poirot this shows that ascher may be innocent a woman faces a man who is threatening her but instead she had her back to the murderer so clearly she was taking down tobacco or cigarettes for a customer poirot looked at his watch overton is not far away shall we drive over there and have an interview with the niece of the dead woman a few minutes later we were driving towards overton inspector glen had given us the address of mrs aschers niece it was a big house about one and a half kilometres from the village on the london side the door was opened by a pretty darkhaired girl her eyes were red from crying i think you are mrs mary drawer the maid here asked poirot gently yes sir thats right im mary sir then perhaps i can talk to you for a few minutes its about your aunt we went inside the house and mary opened the door of a small livingroom we entered and poirot sat down on a chair by the window he looked up into the girl face studying it closely you have heard of your aunts death of course the girl nodded tears filling her eyes again this morning sir the police came here oh its terrible poor auntie you were fond of your aunt mary said poirot gently very sir she was always very good to me i usually visited auntie on my free day she had a lot of trouble with her husband tell me mary did he threaten her oh yes sir he used to say he would cut her throat and things like that so you were not very surprised when you learned what had happened oh but i was mary replied you see sir i never thought that he meant it and auntie wasnt afraid of him he was afraid of her ah said poirot so supposing someone else killed her have you any idea who that person could be ive no idea sir said mary in great surprise it doesnt seem likely there was no one that your aunt was afraid of mary shook her head auntie wasnt afraid of people did she ever get anonymous letters letters that werent signed or were only signed with letters like abc mary shook her head in surprise poirot got up if i want you at any time mary i will write to you here actually sir im going to leave this job i dont like the country i stayed here to be near my aunt but now her eyes filled with tears again theres no reason for me to stay so ill go back to london when you do go to london will you give me your address poirot handed her his card mary looked at the card in surprise then youre not a policeman sir i am a private detective she stood there looking at him for some moments in silence is there anything strange happening sir yes my child replied poirot there is something strange happening later you may be able to help me i ill do anything sir it it isnt right sir auntie being killed it was a strange way to describe her aunts death but i felt full of pity a few moments later we were driving back to andover chapter three questions and answers the murder had taken place on a street which was a turning off the main street mrs aschers shop was about halfway down it on the righthand side a large crowd of people was standing outside the shop a young constable was trying to make the crowd move away poirot stopped at a little distance from them from there we could see the sign over the shop door poirot repeated it softly a ascher come let us go inside hastings we made our way through the crowd poirot showed the young constable a letter from inspector glen explaining who we were he nodded and unlocked the door to let us pass inside the shop was very dark the constable found and switched on the electric light there were a few cheap magazines lying about and newspapers from the day before all dusty behind the counter there were shelves reaching to the tailing packed with tobacco and packets of cigarettes there were also jars of sweets it was an ordinary little shop like thousands of others she was down behind the counter the constable explained in a slow voice the doctor says she never knew what hit her she was probably reaching up to one of the shelves there was nothing in her hand asked poirot no sir but there was a packet of cigarettes down beside her poirot nodded his eyes moved round the small shop noting everything and the railway guide was where here sir the constable pointed out the place on the counter it was open at the right page for andover and lying face down were there any fingerprints i asked there were none on the railway guide sir there were lots on the counter itself were there any of aschers among them asked poirot too soon to say sir poirot nodded again then asked if the dead woman lived over the shop yes sir you go through that door at the back sir poirot passed through the door and i followed him behind the shop there was a small room which was both a kitchen and livingroom it was tidy and clean but without much furniture there were a few photographs on a shelf over the fire one was of mary drawer mrs aschers niece another was of a young couple in oldfashioned clothes the girl looked beautiful and the young man was handsome probably a wedding picture said poirot i looked closely at the couple in the photograph it was almost impossible to recognise the welldressed young man as ascher upstairs there were two more small rooms one had been the dead womans bedroom there were a couple of old blankets on the bed a small pile of underwear in one drawer and cookery books in another a magazine a pair of shiny new stockings and a few clothes hanging up come hastings said poirot quietly there is nothing for us here when we were out in the street again poirot crossed the road almost exactly opposite mrs aschers shop there was a shop selling fruit and vegetables in a quiet voice poirot told me what i had to do then he entered the shop after waiting a minute or two i followed him in he was buying some green beans i chose some apples poirot talked excitedly to the fat lady who was serving him it was just opposite you was it not that the murder happened perhaps you even saw the murderer go into the shop a tall fair man with a beard was he not a russian i have heard whats that the woman looked up in surprise a russian did it mais oui i thought perhaps you noticed him last night well i dont get much chance to look said the woman the evenings our busy time and there are always a lot of people passing after they finish work a tall fair man with a beard no i cant say i saw him i interrupted the conversation as poirot had told me to excuse me sir i said to poirot i think you have the wrong information a short dark man i was told a discussion started between the fat woman her husband and a young assistant they had seen four short dark men and the assistant had seen a tall fair one poirot and i left the shop with our beans and apples and why did you do that poirot i asked i wanted to find out if it was possible for a stranger to enter mrs aschers shop without being noticed couldnt you simply ask those people if they saw anyone no mon ami if i asked those people for information they would not tell me anything but when i made a statement they started to talk we now know that this time is a busy time there are a lot of people on the streets our murderer chose his time well hastings we gave our beans and apples to a very surprised small boy in the street then poirot paused and looked at the houses on each de of mrs aschers house one was a house with curtains that had been white but were now grey poirot knocked at the door it was opened by a very dirty child good evening said poirot is your mother in the child stared at us for a long time then he shouted up the stairs mum youre wanted a sharpfaced woman came down the stairs youre wasting your time here she began but poirot interrupted her good evening madam he said i am a newspaper reporter working for the evening star i would like to offer you five pounds for some information about your neighbour mrs ascher as soon as poirot talked about money the woman became more pleasant im sorry i spoke so crossly just now she said but a lot of men come along and try to sell me things cleaning products stockings bags and other silly things they all seem to know my name too mrs fowler well mrs fowler said poirot you only have to give me some information then ill write a report of the interview mrs fowler began to talk about mrs ascher she had had a lot of trouble with franz ascher everyone knew that but she hadnt been afraid of him had mrs ascher ever received any strange letters poirot asked letters without a signature mrs fowler didnt think so had mrs fowler seen a railway guide an abc in mrs aschers home mrs fowler replied that she hadnt had anyone seen ascher go into the shop the evening before again mrs fowler said no poirot paid her the five pounds and we went out into the street again that was rather an expensive interview poirot i said do you think she knows more than she told us my friend we are in the strange position of not knowing what questions to ask replied poirot mrs fowler has told us all that she thinks she knows in the future that information may be useful for us i didnt understand what poirot meant but at that moment we met inspector glen he was looking rather unhappy he had spent the afternoon trying to get a list of people who had been seen entering the tobacco shop and nobody has seen anyone asked poirot oh yes they have three tall men four short men with black moustaches two beards three fat men all strangers and all looking like criminals poirot smiled does anyone say that they have seen the man ascher no they dont and thats another reason why he might be innocent ive just told the chief constable that i think this is a job for scotland yard i dont believe its a local crime poirot said seriously i agree with you the inspector said you know monsieur poirot its a nasty business i dont like it we had two more interviews before returning to london the first was with mr james partridge who had bought something from mrs ascher at mr partridge was a tidy little man he worked in a bank and wore glasses on the end of his nose he was very exact in everything he said mr er poirot he said looking at the card my friend had handed to him from inspector glen what can i do for you mr poirot i understand that you were the last person to see mrs ascher alive mr partridge placed the ends of his fingers together and stared at poirot that is not certain mr poirot he said its possible that there were other customers after me if there were they have not reported it said poirot but you i understand went to the police without waiting to be asked certainly i did as soon as i heard about the shocking event i realised that my statement might be helpful you have an excellent sense of duty said poirot perhaps you could kindly repeat your story to me certainly i was returning to this house and at exactly i entered mrs aschers shop i often bought things there it was on my way home did you know that mrs ascher had a drunken husband who was in the habit of threatening her life no i knew nothing about her did you think there was anything unusual about her appearance yesterday evening did she seem different from usual mr partridge thought for a time she seemed exactly as usual he said at last poirot got up thank you mr partridge for answering these questions have you an abc in the house i want to look up my return train to london on the shelf behind you said mr partridge poirot took down the abc and pretended to look up a train then he thanked mr partridge and we left our next interview was with mr albert riddell mr riddell was an enormous man with a large face and small suspicious eyes he looked at us angrily ive told everything once already he said ive told the police and now ive got to tell it again to two foreigners poirot gave me a quick amused look and then said i am sorry but it is a case of murder one has to be very very careful you did not i think go to the police why should i it wasnt my business ive got my work to do people saw you going into the shop and gave your name to the police but the police had to come to you first were they happy with your information why shouldnt they be said mr riddell angrily everyone knows who killed the old woman that husband of hers but he was not in the street that evening and you were youre trying to say that i did it are you well you wont succeed what reason did i have to do a thing like that he got up from his chair in a threatening way calm yourself monsieur said poirot i only want you to tell me about your visit it was six oclock when you entered the shop thats right a minute or two after six i wanted a packet of tobacco i pushed open the door and went in there wasnt anyone there i waited but nobody came so i went out again you didnt see the body behind the counter no was there a railway guide lying about yes there was face down i thought perhaps the old woman had to go somewhere by train and forgot to lock the shop perhaps you picked up the railway guide and moved it along the counter i didnt touch it i did just what i said said mr riddell angrily and you did not see anyone leaving the shop before you got there no why are you trying to fix this murder on me poirot got up nobody is fixing anything on you yet bon soir monsieur poirot went out into the street and i followed him he looked at his watch if we are quick my friend we might catch the train to london chapter four the second letter am i a magician what do you want me to do the police are doing everything they can they will discover anything that can be discovered in the days that followed i found that poirot was strangely unwilling to talk about the case in my own mind i was afraid that i knew the reason why poirot hadnt been able to solve the murder of mrs ascher my friend was used to success and he found failure very difficult so difficult that he didnt even want to talk about it the crime received very little attention in the newspapers there was nothing exciting or unusual about the murder of an old woman the newspapers soon found more exciting subjects to write about i was beginning to forget about the matter when something new happened i hadnt seen poirot for a couple of days as i had been away for the weekend i arrived back on the monday afternoon and the letter came by the six oclock post poirot opened the envelope and breathed in deeply it has come he said what has come the second part of the abc business read it said poirot and passed me the letter as before it was typed on good quality paper dear mr poirot well i won the first part of the game i think the andover business went very well didnt it but the funs only just beginning watch what happens at bexhillonsea on the th of the month what a great time we are having yours abc does this mean this man is going to try and murder someone else i said naturally hastings did you think that the andover business was going to be the only case do you not remember me saying this is the beginning but this is horrible were facing a mad killer the next morning there was a meeting of some powerful police officials there was the chief constable of sussex inspector glen from andover superintendent carter of the sussex police inspector japp a younger inspector called crome and also dr thomson the famous specialist in illnesses of the mind everyone was sure that the two letters were written by the same person weve now got definite warning of a second crime which is going to take place on the th the day after tomorrow in bexhill what can we do to stop it said the sussex chief constable he looked at his superintendent the superintendent shook his head it difficult sir theres not the smallest clue about who the victim will be what can we do i have a suggestion said poirot i think it is possible that the surname of the intended victim will begin with the letter b when i got the letter naming bexhill i thought it was possible that the victim as well as the place might be chosen in alphabetical order its possible said the doctor on the other hand it may be that the name ascher was a coincidence remember that we are facing a madman he hasnt given us any clue about his motive does a madman have motives sir asked the superintendent of course he does said the doctor ill keep a special watch on anyone connected with the andover business said inspector glen partridge and riddell and of course ascher himself if they show any sign of leaving andover theyll be followed later poirot and i walked along by the river poirot i said surely this crime can be stopped poirot turned to me with a worried face madness hastings is a terrible thing i am afraid i am very much afraid i still remember waking up on the morning of july it was about seventhirty poirot was standing by my bedside gently shaking me by the shoulder i looked at his face and was awake at once what is it i asked sitting up quickly it has happened poirot said what i cried you mean but today is the th it took place last night i mean in the early hours of this morning i jumped out of bed and got dressed quickly poirot had just had a telephone call from bexhillonsea he told me what had happened the body of a young girl has been found on the beach at bexhill he said she is elizabeth barnard a waitress in one of the cafes according to the medical examination the time of death was between pm and am an abc open at the trains to bexhill was found under the body twenty minutes later we were in a fast car crossing the thames on our way out of london inspector crome was with us he was officially in charge of the case crome was a very different type of officer from japp he was much younger and seemed to think that he was a better detective than poirot if you want to ask me anything about the case please do he said you have not i suppose a description of the dead girl asked poirot she was twentythree years old and was working as a waitress at the orange cat cafe pas ca i wondered if she was pretty i have no information about that said inspector crome rather coldly a look of amusement came into poirots eyes it does not seem to you important but for a woman it is very important there was a short silence then poirot opened the conversation again were you informed how the girl was murdered she was strangled with her own belt replied inspector crome poirots eyes opened very wide ah he said at last we have a piece of information that is very definite that tells one something does it not at bexhill we were greeted by superintendent carter with him was a pleasantfaced intelligentlooking young inspector called kelsey weve told the girls mother and father about her death said the superintendent it was a terrible shock to them of course theres also a sister a typist in london weve communicated with her and theres a young man in fact the girl was supposed to be out with him last night any help from the abc guide asked crome its there the superintendent nodded towards the table no fingerprints its open at the page for bexhill its a new book i think it hasnt been opened much it wasnt bought anywhere round here who discovered the body sir a retired army officer who was walking his dog at about am well sir id better start the interviews said crome theres the cafe and the girls home id better go to both of them kelsey can come with me and mr poirot asked the superintendent i will go with you said poirot to crome crome i thought looked a little annoyed we went to the orange cat a small tearoom by the sea it served coffee tea and a few lunch dishes coffee was just being served the manageress took us into a very untidy back room miss eh merrion asked crome that is my name said the manageress in a high voice this is a very upsetting business most upsetting what can you tell me about the dead girl miss merrion asked kelsey had she worked here for a long time this was the second summer she was a good waitress she was pretty yes asked poirot she was a nice cleanlooking girl replied miss merrion what time did she finish work last night poirot continued eight oclock we close at eight did she tell you how she was going to spend the evening certainly not said miss merrion she looked shocked how many waitresses do you employ two normally and an extra two from july until the end of august miss barnard was one of the regular waitresses what about the other one miss higley shes a very nice young lady perhaps we had better ask her some questions ill send her to you said miss merrion please be as quick as possible this is the busiest time for morning coffees miss merrion left the room a few minutes later a rather fat girl with dark hair and a pink face came in miss higley asked the inspector you knew elizabeth barnard oh yes i knew betty isnt it awful betty betty barnard murdered you knew the dead girl well asked crome well shes worked here longer than i have i only came this march she was here last year she was rather quiet she didnt joke or laugh a lot we learned that betty barnard had had a good looking welldressed friend who worked in an office near the station miss higley didnt know his name but she had seen him and she thought miss barnard had planned to meet him the night before we talked to the other two girls in the cafe but no one had noticed her in bexhill during the evening chapter five a broken family elizabeth barnards parents lived in a small newly built house on the edge of the town mr barnard was waiting in the doorway for us inspector kelsey introduced himself then he introduced us this is inspector crome of scotland yard sir he said scotland yard said mr barnard hopefully thats good this murderer has got to be caught my poor little girl and this is mr hercule poirot also from london and er captain hastings said poirot we went into the livingroom mrs barnard was there her eyes were red and she was clearly suffering from shock its too cruel oh it is too cruel she said in a tearful voice its very painful for you madam i know said inspector crome but we want to know all the facts so we can get to work as quickly as possible your daughter was twentythree i understand she lived here with you and worked at the orange cat cafe is that right thats it said mr barnard this is a new house isnt it where did you live before i worked in london i retired two years ago we always wanted to live near the sea you have two daughters yes my older daughter works in an office in london werent you worried when your daughter didnt come home last night we didnt know she hadnt said mrs barnard in a tearful voice dad and i always go to bed at nine oclock we never knew betty hadnt come home until the police officer came and said and said she started to cry we heard that your daughter was going to be married yes his name is donald fraser and i like him said mrs barnard i like him very much this news will be terrible for him did he meet your daughter most evenings after her work not every evening once or twice a week do you know if she was going to meet him yesterday she didnt say betty never said much about where she was going or what she was doing but she was a good girl betty was weve got to find out what happened said mr barnard betty was just a happy girl with a nice boyfriend why should anyone want to murder her it doesnt make sense youre right mr barnard said crome i tell you what id like to do have a look at miss barnarnds room there may be letters or a diary certainly said mr barnard he got up and led the way upstairs crome followed him then poirot then kelsey i was at the back i paused for a minute on the stairs as i did so a taxi stopped outside and a girl jumped out she paid the driver and hurried up the path carrying a small suitcase as she entered she saw me and stopped who are you she said i came down a few steps i felt embarrassed about how exactly to reply should i give my name or say that i had come here with the police oh well said the girl i can guess she pulled off her hat and threw it on the ground i could see her better now as she turned a little so the light fell on her her hair was black and cut in a modern fashion and her body was thin she was not goodlooking but there was something about her that made you notice her you are miss barnard i asked i am megan barnard you belong to the police i suppose well i said not exactly she interrupted me i dont think ive got anything to say to you my sister was a nice girl with no men friends good morning im not a reporter if thats what you think i said well what are you where are mum and dad your father is showing the police your sisters bedroom your mothers in there shes very upset the girl seemed to make a decision come in here she said she pulled open a door and passed through i followed her and found myself in a small tidy kitchen i was going to shut the door but then poirot came quietly into the room and closed the door behind him mademoiselle barnard he said this is monsieur hercule poirot i said megan barnard looked at him quickly ive heard of you she said youre the private detective arent you she sat down on the edge of the kitchen table i dont see what monsieur hercule poirot is doing in our little crime mademoiselle said poirot i heard what you said just now to my friend hastings a nice girl with no men friends when a young girl is dead that is the kind of thing that is said but i should like to find someone who knew elizabeth barnard and who does not know she is dead then perhaps i should hear what is useful to me the truth megan barnard looked at him for a few minutes in silence when at last she spoke her words made me jump betty she said was a stupid little fool i was very fond of her but i could see that she was very foolish i even told her that sometimes please tell me exactly what you mean said poirot i will help you i heard what you said to hastings that your sister was a bright happy girl with no men friends it was the opposite that was true was it not megan said slowly betty was a good girl i want you to understand that but she liked being taken out and dancing and all that kind of thing and she was pretty yes this was the third time that i had heard poirot ask this question megan got down from the table and opened her suitcase she took out a photo and handed it to poirot it showed the head and shoulders of a fairhaired girl she was not beautiful but she had a cheap kind of prettiness poirot handed it back saying you and she do not look like each other mademoiselle oh im the plain one of the family ive always known that in what way do you think your sister was behaving foolishly asked poirot do you mean perhaps in her relationship with mr donald fraser thats it exactly dons a very quiet sort of person but he well naturally he wouldnt be happy about certain things and then and then what mademoiselle poirot gave her a long hard look i was afraid that he might end the relationship with her and that would be a pity he would be a good husband poirot continued to stare at her she looked back at him so poirot said at last we do not speak the truth now well said megan turning to the door ive done what i can to help wait mademoiselle i have something to tell you come back to my surprise poirot told megan barnard the whole story of the abc letters the murder in andover and the railway guide found by the bodies megan listened to every word very carefully you really mean that my sister was killed by a madman she asked exactly you see mademoiselle you can give me the information i ask for freely without wondering whether or not it will hurt anyone yes i see that now then let us continue our conversation i have formed the idea that this donald fraser has perhaps a violent and jealous temper is that right megan barnard said quietly im going to give you the whole truth now monsieur poirot don is as i say a very quiet person he keeps all his emotions inside himself he cant always say what he feels in words he was always jealous about betty he loved her very much and she was fond of him but she liked other men too and of course working in the orange cat she was always meeting men and then perhaps shed go with them to the cinema nothing serious but she just liked to have fun i understand said poirot continue don couldnt understand why she wanted to go out with other people and once or twice they had terrible arguments when quiet people lose their tempers they get really angry don was so violent that betty was frightened there was one argument just over a month ago i was at home for the weekend and i told betty she was being a little fool shed told don she was going to hastings to see a girlfriend and he found out that shed really been in eastbourne with a married man there was a terrible scene don was white and shaking and saying that one day one day yes hed murder her said megan in a low voice she stopped and stared at poirot he nodded his head several times and so naturally you were afraid i didnt think hed actually done it said megan but i was afraid that the police would find out what he said several people knew about it exactly do you know mademoiselle if your sister met this married man or any other man recently i dont know said megan shaking her head but it wouldnt surprise me if betty had well told don a few lies again an electric bell rang sharply megan went to the window and looked out its don she said bring him in here said poirot quickly i would like to have a word with him before the inspector does megan barnard went quickly out of the kitchen a couple of seconds later she came back leading donald fraser by the hand i felt sorry for the young man his white face showed how great a shock he had had he was a finelooking young man with a pleasant face and red hair whats this megan he said tell me please ive only just heard betty his voice grew quieter poirot pushed forward a chair and he sank down on it poirot gave him a drink he sat up straighter and turned to megan its true i suppose he said quietly betty is dead killed its true don ive just come down from london dad phoned me the police are upstairs now looking through bettys things i suppose poirot moved forward a little and asked a question did miss barnard tell you where she was going last night she told me she was going with a girlfriend to st leonards replied fraser did you believe her asked poirot what do you mean suddenly frasers face looked angry betty barnard was killed by a madman said poirot you can only help us to catch him by speaking the exact truth donald fraser turned to megan then he looked suspiciously at poirot who are you you dont belong to the police i am better than the police said poirot simply well donald fraser said at last i i began to wonder i was ashamed of myself for being so suspicious but but i was suspicious i went to st leonards i got there by eight oclock then i watched the buses to see she was in them but there was no sign of her i was sure she was with a man i went to hastings i looked in hotels and restaurants and cinemas it was very foolish so in the end i came back it was about midnight when i got home the kitchen door opened oh there you are said inspector kelsey inspector crome pushed past him he looked quickly at the two strangers miss megan barnard and mr donald fraser said poirot introducing them this is inspector crome from london turning to the inspector he said while you were upstairs i was talking to miss barnard and mr fraser to see if they could tell me anything which would help us oh yes said inspector crome not really listening to poirot poirot went out into the hall and i followed him have you had any new ideas about the crimes i asked him only that the murderer is a surprisingly kind sort of person said poirot i had no idea what poirot meant but i did not say anything chapter six the third letter after the bexhill murder we had many more meetings with the police there was a lot of discussion about whether the general public should be told about the anonymous letters if we dont give this madman the satisfaction of telling everyone about him whats he likely to do asked inspector crome hell murder someone else said dr thomson at once and if we put everything in the newspapers then what will he do same answer the results the same another crime but it seems to me said poirot that there is one very important clue the discovery of the motive he chooses his victims alphabetically not because he hates them personally but why is he murdering these people he is a very kind murderer the police didnt arrest franz ascher for the murder of his wife and donald fraser for the murder of betty barnard because abc wrote those warning letters i remember well the arrival of abcs third letter it was a friday the evening post came at about ten oclock when we heard the postmans step i went along to the letterbox there were four or five letters i remember the last one was addressed in printed letters i opened it quickly and took out the printed piece of paper inside poor mr poirot you arent as good at these little criminal matters as you thought are you let us see if you can do any better this time this time its easy churston on the th do try and do something about it its a bit boring for me when everything goes so easily you know good hunting ever yours abc churston i said jumping to get our own abc lets see where it is hastings said poirot when was that letter written is there a date on it it was written on the th i said looking at the letter in my hand did i hear you right hastings did he give the date of the murder as the th bon dieu hastings do you not realise today is the th poirot picked up the envelope from the floor there was something unusual about the address but i had been too worried to look at it closely poirot was at that time living in whitehaven apartments the address on the envelope said hercule poirot whitehorse apartments someone had written across the envelope not known at whitehorse apartments eci try whitehaven apartments so the letter had been sent to the wrong address three days before quickly said poirot we must get in touch with scotland yard he telephoned crome and told him about the letter crome then put down the phone to book a ticket to churston it is too late said poirot he looked at the clock its twenty past ten there is only another hour and forty minutes i opened the railway guide i had taken down from the shelf churston devon i read kilometres from paddington population its a small place surely our man would be noticed there but another person will be dead said poirot what time are the trains i imagine that a train will be quicker than a car theres a midnight train from paddington it gets to churston at we will take that hastings i put a few things into a suitcase while poirot again rang up scotland yard a few minutes later he came into the bedroom and explained that we had to take the letter and envelope to paddington with us someone from scotland yard would meet us there when we arrived on the platform we saw inspector crome we dont have any news yet he said all persons whose names begin with c are being warned by phone if possible wheres the letter poirot gave it to him and he examined it you dont think i suggested that he put the wrong address on purpose no said crome shaking his head the mans got his rules crazy rules and he keeps to them he gives us warning the inspector we found was travelling by the same train just as the train was leaving the station we saw a man running down the platform he reached the inspectors window and called up something poirot and i hurried down the train you have news yes asked poirot crome said quietly its very bad sir carmichael clarke has been found murdered sir carmichael clarke was quite famous he had been a throat specialist but had retired he was rich and owned one of the bestknown collections of chinese art he was married but had no children and lived in a house he had built for himself near the devon coast eh bien said poirot the whole country will look for abc unfortunately i said thats what he wants true but he may become careless how strange all this is poirot i said do you know this is the first crime of this kind that you and i have worked on together all our murders have been well private murders this murder is worse because its mad no hastings it is not worse it is only more difficult it should be easier to discover because it is mad this alphabetical business if i could understand the idea then everything would be clear and simple these crimes must not continue soon soon i must see the truth go hastings get some sleep there will be a lot to do tomorrow churston is near the town of torquay until about ten years ago there was only countryside around it but recently small houses and new roads had appeared sir carmichael clarke had bought land with an open view of the sea and built a house it was modern and not large but quite attractive a local police officer inspector wells met us at the station and told us what had happened sir carmichael clarke it seemed had been in the habit of taking a walk after dinner every evening but at some time after eleven he had still not returned it was not long before his body was discovered he had been hit on the back of the head with something heavy an open abc bad been placed face down on the dead body we arrived at combeside sir carmichaels house at about eight oclock the door was opened by a manservant his hands were shaking and he looked very upset good morning deveril said the police officer these are the gentleman from london this way gentlemen said deveril he showed us into a long diningroom where breakfast was laid ill get mr franklin a minute later a big fairhaired man with a sunburnt face entered the room this was franklin clarke the dead mans only brother inspector wells introduced us to him franklin clarke shook hands with each of us in turn let me offer you some breakfast he said we can talk as we eat we ate the excellent breakfast and drank coffee inspector wells told me everything last night said franklin clarke is it really right inspector crome that my poor brothel is the victim of a mad killer that this is the third murder and that in each case an abc railway guide has been left beside the body thats right mr clarke but why what possible advantage can there be for the murderer it wont help us if we look for motives now mr clarke said inspector crome we need a few facts your brother was the same as usual yesterday he received no unexpected letter nothing to upset him no he was quite as usual not upset or worried in any way excuse me inspector i didnt say that it was normal for my poor brother to be upset and worried you may not know that his wife lady clarke is in very bad health she is suffering from a terrible illness and will not live for long my brother is very worried about her i returned from the east not long ago and i was shocked at the change in him imagine mr clarke that you found your brother shot with a gun beside him what would you think asked poirot i would think that he killed himself said clarke but he didnt kill himself said crome now i believe mr clarke that it was your brothers habit to go for a walk every evening quite right he always did i suppose a stranger would be easily noticed around here no in august many tourists come here in cars and buses and on foot unfortunately youve no idea how beautiful and peaceful this part of the world is in june and at the beginning of july did any stranger come to the house and ask for sir carmichael yesterday not that i know of but well ask deveril he rang the bell and put the question to the manservant no sir no one came to see sir carmichael as deveril left the room a young woman came in this is miss thora grey said franklin clarke my brothers secretary the girl was very fair she had the very fair hair and light grey eyes that one finds among norwegians and swedes she looked about twentyseven clarke brought her a cup of coffee but she refused any food did you see the letters that sir carmichael received asked crome i suppose he never received a letter or letters signed abc abc she shook her head no im sure he didnt he didnt say he had noticed anyone during his evening walks recently have you yourself noticed any strangers no of course there are a lot of people here at this time of year inspector crome asked to be shown the path of sir carmichaels nightly walk franklin clarke led the way and we followed thora grey and i were walking a little behind the others i expect this has been a terrible shock to his wife i said lady clarke is usually drugged she doesnt know whats happening for a lot of the time replied miss grey we went out through the garden gate and then along a small path leading down to the sea suddenly we came out to a place covered with grass which looked out over a beach of white stones all around dark green trees ran down to the sea it was a beautiful place white deepgreen and bright blue this was my brothers evening walk said clarke he came here then back up the path then he went across the fields back to the house we continued and came to a place near some trees halfway across the field where the body had been found the murderer probably stood here in the shadow said crome your brother almost certainly noticed nothing until he was struck down we went back to the house as we climbed up the stairs the doctor came out of a room where the body had been taken with a black bag in his hand its a very simple case he said he didnt suffer death happened immediately ill just go and see lady clarke a hospital nurse came out of another room and the doctor joined her we went to look at sir carmichaels body and came out again quickly miss grey was standing at the head of the stairs she looked upset miss grey i stopped is anything the matter i was thinking she said about d about the next murder something must be done it has to be stopped clarke came out of a room behind me what has to be stopped thora these awful murders yes i want to talk to monsieur poirot some time is crome any good i replied that he was supposed to be a very clever officer he has the look of a man who knows everything said clarke but what does he know nothing ive got a plan but well talk about that later he knocked at the door where the doctor had entered miss grey was still staring in front of her what are you thinking miss grey i asked im wondering where he is now the murderer i mean she went downstairs i stood there thinking about her words abc where was he now chapter seven the special legion only one thing connects these three people the fact that the same person killed them mr alexander bonaparte cust left the cinema in torquay with the rest of the people he looked around him uncertainly in the brightness of the afternoon sunshine like a lost dog newsboys went past shouting latest news mad killer at churston mr cust found a coin in his pocket and bought a paper he entered the princess gardens and sat down then he opened the paper there were big headlines sir carmichael clarke murdered terrible event at churston work of a mad killer only a month ago england was shocked by the murder of a young girl elizabeth barnand at bexhill it may be remembered that an abc railway guide was found beside the body an abc was also found by the dead body of sir carmichael clarke the police think the same person is responsible for both murders is it possible that a mad killer is going round our stride towns a young man in a bright blue shirt was sitting beside mr cust a nasty business eh he mid mr cust jumped in surprise oh very very the young man noticed that his hands were shaking so much that he couldnt held the paper very well mad people dont always look mad said the young man often they seem just like you or me sometimes its the war that made them go mad i i expert youre right i dont agree with wars said the young man they should be stopped mr cust laughed he laughed for some time the young man was worried hes a bit mad himself he thought sorry sir he said i expect you were in the war i was said mr cust my heads never been right since it aches you know it aches terribly sometimes i dont know what im doing the young man went away quickly mr cust stayed with his paper he read it and read it again people passed backwards and forwards in front of him most of them were talking about the murder police are sure to get him say he may be jested at any time now quite likely hes in torquay mr cust laid the paper on the seat then he got up and walked towards the town girls passed him girls in white and pink and blue they laughed looking at the men as they passed them but they didnt look once at mr cust he sat down at a little table and ordered tea after the murder of sir carmichael clarke the abc murders were in every newspaper the andover murder was now connected with the other two scotland yard believed that the best chance of catching the murderer was to make the murders as public as possible the population of great britain turned into private detectives looking for the murderer one newspaper wrote he may be in your town the newspapers printed the letters that had been sent to poirot newspaper reporters kept asking poirot for interviews scotland yard were very active working hard to check the smallest clues they questioned people in hotels and guesthouses they listened to hundreds of stories from imaginative people and checked them to see if they were true but poirot seemed to me strangely inactive sometimes we argued but what do you want me to do my friend poirot said the police can question people better than i can all the time while i seem to be doing nothing i am thinking not about the facts of the case but about the mind of the murderer the mind of a madman exactly when i know what the murderer is like i shall be able to find out who he is and all the time i learn more after the next crime poirot but yes hastings i think it is almost certain there will be another crime our unknown killer has been lucky but this time his luck may change and after another crime we shall know a lot more i shall not know his name and address but i shall know what kind of a man he is now i am going to do something which will please you poirot continue it will mean a lot of conversation i want to find out more information from the friends relatives and servants of the victims do you suspect them of hiding things i dont think they meant to hide information but at the time of a murder people talk about only what they think is important quite often they think wrong and by discussing a certain event or a certain person again and again they may remember extra details it did not seem to me to be a very good idea you do not agree with me said poirot then a servant girl is cleverer than you he handed me a letter it was clearly written dear sir i hope you dont mind me writing to you i have been thinking a lot since those awful two murders like poor aunties i saw the young ladys picture in the paper the sister of the young lady who was killed at bexhill i wrote to her to tell her i was coming to london and asked if i could come to her perhaps if we talked about it together we might find out something the young lady wrote back to me and suggested i might write to you she said shed been thinking the same she said we ought to work together so im coming to london and this is my address yours mary drower mary drower said poirot is a very intelligent girl he picked up another letter it was a note from franklin clarke saying that he was coming to london he would visit poirot the following day do not worry mon ami said poirot there will be action franklin clarke arrived at three oclock on the following afternoon monsieur poirot he said im still not satisfied im sure that crome is a very good officer but he annoys me he seems to think he knows best my idea is monsieur poirot that we mustnt delay weve got to get ready for the next crime i suggest that we form a kind of special legion of the friends and relatives of the murdered people if we talk about things together we might be able to find out something new also when the next warning comes one of us might recognise somebody who was near the scene of an earlier crime my brother was a rich man and he left me some money i can pay for everything so i suggest the members of the special legion are paid for their services the same way as in a normal job i suggest myself miss barnard and mr donald fraser who was planning to marry the dead girl then there is a niece of the andover woman miss barnard knows her address nobody else well er miss grey as he spoke her name franklin clarke suddenly looked much younger he looked like a shy schoolboy yes you see miss grey worked for my brother for over two years she knows the countryside and the people round there ive been away for a year and a half in china looking for things for my brothers art collection very interesting said poirot well mr clarke i agree with your idea a few days later the special legion met at poirots rooms each of the three girls was attractive in a different way the fair beauty of thora grey the dark looks of megan barnard and mary drower with her pretty intelligent face the two men were also very different franklin clarke was big and talked a lot and donald fraser was very quiet poirot made a little speech here we have three murders an old woman a young girl an older man only one thing connects these three people the fact that the same person killed them this means that the same person was present in three different places and was seen by a large number of people he is a madman but he does not look like one but he did not murder his victims by chance he chose them on purpose and he spent time finding out about the places where they lived before the murders i refuse to believe that there is no clue which can help us find out who he is one of you or possibly all of you knows something that they do not know they know words said megan barnard its just words it doesnt mean anything well i think its a good idea said mary drower when youre talking about things you often seem to understand more clearly poirot asked everyone in turn to tell the others what they remembered of the time before the murder first franklin clarke spoke and then thora grey about sir carmichael clarkes last day next megan barnard and donald fraser talked about betty barnard finally mary drower spoke about the last letter she had received from her aunt she said she wanted me to go to see her on my free day and she said wed go to the cinema it was going to be my birthday sir suddenly mary started to cry you must forgive me sir i dont want to be silly cryings no good it was the thought of her and me looking forward to our day out i know just how you feel said franklin clarke its always the little things that upset you like remembering a present or something fun megan said with a sudden warmth thats true the same thing happened after betty died mum had bought some stockings for her as a present bought them the same day it happened poor mum she was so upset i found her crying over them she kept saying i bought them for betty and she never even saw them her voice shook she bent forward looking straight at franklin clarke i know he said i know exactly arent we going to make any plans for the future asked thora grey of course said franklin clarke i think that when the fourth letter comes we ought to work together i could make some suggestions said poirot i think it is just possible that the waitress milly higley might know something useful i suggest two ways to find out you miss barnard could start an argument with the girl say you knew she never liked your sister and that your sister had told you all about her she will tell you exactly what she thought of your sister the other way is that mr fraser could pretend to be interested in the girl is that necessary asked donald fraser no it is not necessary it is just one way to find out more information shall i try asked franklin clarke let me see what i can do with the young lady youve got your own part of the world to look after said thora grey rather sharply i dont think there is much you can do down there for the present said poirot mademoiselle grey is more suitable for thora grey interrupted him but you see monsieur poirot i have left devon now miss grey very kindly stayed to help me organise everything said franklin clarke but naturally she prefers a job in london poirot looked from one to the other how is lady clarke he asked i was admiring the pale colour in thora greys face and almost missed clarkes reply not good i wonder if you could come down to devon and visit her monsieur poirot she said she would like to see you certainly mr clarke shall we say the day after tomorrow good ill tell the nurse you my child said poirot turning to mary i think you might perhaps do useful work in andover try talking to the children there were a lot of children playing in the street where your aunt lived perhaps they noticed who went in and out of your aunt shop shall i put an advertisement in a newspaper asked clarke something like this abc urgent h p is close behind you give me a hundred pounds for my silence x y z it might make him show himself it is possible to try said poirot but i think that abc will be too clever to reply he smiled mr clarke i think you are like a boy in your heart well clarke said looking at his notebook were making a start chapter eight a sick lady poirot returned to his seat and sat down it is unfortunate that she is so intelligent he said quietly megan barnard mademoiselle megan words she says she realises that there is no meaning in anything i am saying nobody else noticed didnt you mean what you said i simply said the same thing many times but why eh bien to start shall we say the conversations and there is something else hastings murder can often help people find romance poirot i cried i was shocked im sure none of these people was thinking of anything except did you see how franklin clarke suddenly bent forward and looked at mademoiselle megan and did you also notice how annoyed mademoiselle thora grey was about it and mr donald fraser he poirot i said you have a very romantic mind suddenly the door opened to my great surprise thora grey entered forgive me for coming back she said but there was something that i think i would like to tell you monsieur poirot certainly mademoiselle please sit down thora grey sat down and began to speak choosing her words carefully mr clarke told you that i decided to leave combeside he is a very kind and loyal person but it is not quite like that lady clarke wished me to leave she is very ill and her brain is confused because of the drugs they give her the drugs make her suspicious and imaginative she started to dislike me and told me to leave the house i admired the girls honesty its very good of you to come and tell us this i said its always better to be honest she said with a little smile it was rather a shock to me she said sadly i had no idea lady clarke disliked me so much in fact i always thought she was rather fond of me she got up thats all that i came to say goodbye i went downstairs with her when i came back i said i think that was very brave of her do you know said poirot i am sure that already in our conversations this afternoon something important was said it is strange i do not know exactly what it was something that reminded me of something which i had already seen or heard or noted something at churston no not at churston before that it doesnt matter i will remember a few days later we went down to combeside again to see lady clarke it was a september day at the beginning of autumn there was a deep sadness surrounding the house the downstairs rooms were closed we were shown into a small room where a hospital nurse came to meet us monsieur poirot she asked im nurse capstick how is lady clarke asked poirot not bad one cant hope for much improvement of course but some new treatment has made things a little easier for her i suppose her husbands death was a terrible shock asked poirot well monsieur poirot said the nurse lady clarke doesnt always know whats happening because of the drugs were she and her husband very fond of each other oh yes they were a very happy couple he was very worried and upset about her poor man but he was often busy with his art collection miss grey helped him with that oh yes miss grey she has left has she not yes im very sorry about it sometimes ladies get strange ideas when theyre not well she led us upstairs to a room on the first floor it had been a bedroom but was now a cheerfullooking sittingroom lady clarke was sitting in a big armchair near the window she was very thin and her face had the grey look of one who suffers much pain this is monsieur poirot who you wanted to see said nurse capstick oh yes monsieur poirot said lady clarke giving him her hand my friend captain hastings lady clarke how do you do so good of you both to come we sat down there was a silence it was about cars death wasnt it said lady clarke at last oh yes i told franklin to ask you to come i hope franklin isnt going to be foolish men are so easily fooled they are like boys especially franklin did you want to say something about your husbands death asked poirot cars death yes mad poor man the murderer i mean ive always been sorry for mad people their heads must feel so strange you havent caught him yet she asked surely somebody saw him around here that day there were so many strangers lady clarke it is the holiday season yes i forgot but they stay down by the beaches no stranger came to the house that day said poirot who says so asked lady clarke in a voice that was surprisingly strong the servants said poirot miss grey lady clarke said very clearly that girl a liar i felt shocked poirot looked at me quickly i didnt like her ive never liked her i sent her away franklin said she might be a help to me franklins a fool i didnt want him getting mixed up with her ill give her three months pay if you like i said but i dont want her in the house a day longer theres one good thing about being ill men cant argue with you he did what i said and she went why did you say that miss grey was a liar asked poirot because she is she told you that no strangers came to the house but i saw her with my own eyes talking to a strange man on the front doorstep it was the morning of the day car died about eleven oclock what did this man look like an ordinary sort of man nothing special a look of pain came over her face please you must go now im a little tired thats a very strange story i said to poirot as we travelled back to london about miss grey and a strange man you see hastings there is always something to be found out why did the girl lie about it and tell us she had seen no one the easiest way to answer the question is to ask her its unbelievable that a girl like her would help a madman exactly so i do not believe it lady clarke doesnt like her because she goodlooking i said perhaps lady clarke is right said poirot perhaps her husband and franklin clarke are wrong and captain hastings he looked at me in an amused way you always want to help goodlooking girls in trouble how silly you are poirot said laughing when we arrived home we were told that a gentleman was waiting to see poirot my surprise it was donald fraser he seemed very embarrassed and shy poirot invited him to have sandwiches and a glass of wine with us after we had eaten poirot said you have come from bexhill mr fraser yes he stopped i dont know why ive come to you he said suddenly i know said poirot there is something that you must tell someone you are quite right i am the correct person speak fraser looked at him gratefully monsieur poirot do you know anything about dreams ive had the same dream for three nights i think im going mad im on the beach looking for betty shes lost only lost you understand ive got to find her ive got to give her her belt im carrying it in my hand and then yes the dream changes im not looking any more shes there in front of me sitting on the beach she doesnt see me coming i come up behind her she doesnt hear me i put the belt round her neck and pull shes dead ive strangled her and then her head falls back and i see her face and its megan not betty he sat back white and shaking whats the meaning of it monsieur poirot why does it come to me every night i i didnt kill her did i i dont know what poirot answered because at that moment i heard the postmans knock i left the room and went to the letterbox then i rushed back into the livingroom poirot i cried its come the fourth letter he jumped up and took it from me then he opened it with his paperknife he spread it out on the table the three of us read it together still no success what are you and the police doing well well isnt this fun poor mr poirot im quite sorry for you if at first you dont succeed try try again weve got a long way to go still the next little event will take place at doncaster on september see you abc inspector crome came round from scotland yard while he was still there franklin clarke and megan barnard arrived the girl explained that she too had come from bexhill because she wanted to ask clarke something crome wasnt very pleased to see everyone there he became very official ill take this letter with me monsieur poirot he said this time weve got to get this man said clarke i should tell you inspector that weve formed our own legion to catch him i dont think your job is going to be easy i think abc has beaten you again i dont think people will be able to criticise our arrangements this time said crome the fool has given us a lot of warning the th isnt until next wednesday we have a lot of time to make this public in the newspapers we shall warn everyone in doncaster whose name begins with a d also well move a lot of police into the town clarke said quietly its easy to see that youre not interested in sport inspector crome stared at him what do you mean mr clarke dont you realise that next wednesday the st leger is being run in doncaster the inspector looked shocked thats true he said yes that makes things more complicated we were all silent for a minute or two as we thought about the situation there would be crowds on the racecourse the sport loving english public i believe said clarke that the murder will take place on the racecourse perhaps actually while the leger is being run inspector crome got up and left taking the letter with him we heard voices in the hallway a few minutes later thora grey entered she went straight to franklin clarke and put a hand on his arm she spoke anxiously waiting for his answer the inspector told me theres another letter wheres the murder going to be this time doncaster and on the day of the st leger we started discussing the matter i felt that there was very little hope what could a small group of six people do chapter nine the hunt begins i know nothing about this man said thora grey no no mademoiselle said poirot that is not true each one of us knows something about him i am sure that the knowledge is there clarke shook his head we dont know anything none of us has ever seen him or spoken to him weve tried to remember everything again and again not everything said poirot for example miss grey told us that she did not see or speak to any stranger on the day that sir carmichael was killed thora grey nodded thats quite right is it lady clarke told us mademoiselle that from her window she saw you standing on the front doorstep talking to a man she saw me talking to a strange man the girl seemed very surprised lady clarke has made a mistake i never oh i remember now how stupid but it wasnt important just one of those men who come round selling stockings i was crossing the hall when he came to the door poirot put his hands to his head everyone stared at him stockings he said quietly stockings it is the connection three months ago the other day and now bon dieu yes he sat up straight and looked at me you remember hastings in the shop at andover we went upstairs on a chair in the bedroom was a pair of new stockings and you mademoiselle he turned to megan you spoke of your mother who cried because she had bought your sister some new stockings on the day of the murder he looked round at us all you see it is the same thing repeated three times that cannot be coincidence remember mrs aschers neighbour mrs fowler she talked about people who were always trying to sell you things like stockings tell me mademoiselle he said to megan it is true is it not that your mother bought those stockings from someone who came to the door yes yes she did i remember now but whats the connection cried franklin clarke i tell you my friends it cannot be coincidence three crimes and each time a man visits the area selling stockings he turned to thora describe this man he said she looked at him i cant i dont know how he had glasses i think and an old coat he wasnt the sort of man youd notice you are quite right mademoiselle said poirot he wasnt the sort of man youd notice yes you have described the murderer mr alexander bonaparte cost sat without moving his breakfast lay cold and untasted on his plate he was reading a newspaper with great interest suddenly he got up walked up and down for a minute then sat down again on a chair by the window he rested his head in his hands he didnt hear the sound of the opening door mrs marbury the owner of the building stood in the doorway whats the matter mr cust you havent touched your breakfast is your head hurting you again no i mean yes i just feel a little unwell well im sorry you arent going to go away today then mr cust jumped up quickly no no i have to go its business very important business his hands were shaking im going to cheltennam he said the word so strangely that mrs marbury looked at him in surprise cheltenhams a nice place she said conversationally she bent down and picked up the newspaper which was lying on the floor the newspapers are full of these murders she said doncaster thats the place hes going to carry out his next murder and tomorrow its the races too they say that hundreds of police are being brought in mr cust you do look bad really you oughtnt to go travelling today its necessary mrs marbury when ive promised to do something i always do it its the only way to succeed in in business but if youre ill im not ill mrs marbury just a little worried about personal matters i slept badly im really quite all right mrs marbury picked up the breakfast things and left the room mr cust took out a suitcase and packed some clothes then he unlocked a cupboard he took out about twelve flat boxes and put them in the suitcase too lily mrs marburys daughter came out of another room where are you going this time mr cust she said to the seaside again no no er cheltenham well thats nice too but not quite as nice as torquay i want to go there for my holiday next year you were probably quite near where the murder was the abc murder it happened when you were down there didnt it er yes but churstons ten or eleven kilometres away how exciting perhaps you passed the murderer on the street yes perhaps said mr cust he smiled a strange smile oh mr cust you dont look well said lily im quite all right quite all right goodbye miss marbury he picked up his suitcase and hurried out of the front door funny old thing said lily marbury to herself he looks half mad inspector crome said to his assistant get me a list of all the companies who make stockings and i want a list of all their agents who go to peoples houses selling the stockings is this for the abc case sir asked the assistant yes one of hercule poirots ideas the inspectors voice was not very enthusiastic its probably not important but we have to check everything right sir mr poirots done some good work in the past but i think hes a bit old now sir he loves to get attention said the inspector but hes not as clever as he wants people to think now the arrangements for doncaster lily marbury was dancing with her boyfriend tom hartigan as they danced they talked i saw old mr cust this morning said tom at euston station he was looking lost as usual first he dropped his paper and then he dropped his ticket i picked it up he thanked me but i dont think he recognised me did you say euston or paddington asked li if euston thats strange i thought trains went to cheltenham from paddington thats right but old cust wasnt going to cheltenham he was going to doncaster i saw his ticket well he told me he was going to cheltenham im sure he did no youre wrong he was going to doncaster oh tom i hope he wont get murdered doncaster is where the abc murder is going to happen cust will be all right his name doesnt begin with a d he was down near churston at torquay when the last murder happened was he thats a coincident isnt it tom laughed he wasnt at bexhill before that was he he was away yes i remember he was away said lily because he forgot his swimsuit mother was mending it for him well if he wanted his swimsuit he was at the seaside lily said tom with an amused look perhaps old mr cust is the murderer mr cust wouldnt hurt anything or anyone laughed lily they continued to dance doncaster i shall i think remember september all my life we were all there at the st leger poirot myself clarke fraser megan barnard thora grey and mary drower but what could any of us do thora grey was the only person who might be able to recognise the murderer she wasnt calm and quiet now she was almost crying and her hands were shaking i never really looked at him she said what a fool i was even if i see him again i might not recognise him ive got a bad memory for faces poirot put his hand gently on her shoulder now little one dont be upset he said kindly if you see this man you will recognise him we have had a lot of bad luck and our murderer has had a lot of good luck but now i believe that our luck has changed the clue of the stockings is the beginning now every thing will go wrong for him he too will begin to make mistakes we had agreed that we would walk round as many streets as possible and later position ourselves in different parts of the racecourse i had suggested that i should go with one of the ladies and poirot had agreed with my idea the girls went to put on their hats franklin clarke started to talk to poirot listen monsieur poirot you went down to churston i know and saw my brothers wife did she say i mean did she suggest he stopped embarrassed poirot looked at him with an innocent face did she suggest what franklin clarkes face was rather red its about thora miss grey he said poirot looked surprised lady clarke got certain ideas in her head you see thora miss grey is rather a goodlooking girl and lady clarke became jealous after cars death she got very upset of course its partly the illness and the drugs my brother always said that miss grey was the best secretary he ever had and he was very fond of her too but there wasnt any romantic relationship between them look he put his hand in his pocket heres a letter i received from my brother when i was in asia you may remember thora grey she is a dear girl and a great help to me she loves beautiful things and shares my enthusiasm for chinese art i was very lucky to find her no daughter could be closer to me you see said franklin my brother thought of her like a daughter i wanted to show you this because i didnt want you to get the wrong idea about thora from anything that lady clarke said poirot returned the letter you can be sure he said smiling that i never allow myself to get the wrong idea from anything that anyone tells me i form my own judgements the girls came back and we left the room then poirot called me back which lady do you intend to go with hastings he asked well i er i hadnt thought about it yet what about miss barnard shes rather an independent type i said miss grey yes shes better hastings you are not being honest with me said poirot all the time you wanted to spend the day with miss grey oh poirot i said i am sorry to upset your plans said poirot but i request you to go with mary drower and i must ask that you do not leave her but poirot why because my dear friend her name begins with a d we must be very careful i realised that poirot was right if a b c hated poirot he might be watching his movements he might kill mary drower to show poirot that he was cleverer than my friend i promised to do as poirot asked chapter ten death at the cinema mr leadbetter was at the regal cinema in doncaster at the most exciting part of the film the man next to him got up and pushed past him then he dropped his hat over the seat in front and bent over to get it back mr leadbetter was very annoyed he had looked forward to seeing this film for a whole week why couldnt people wait until the end of a film the annoying gentleman went out mr leadbetter watched the film happily until the end when the lights went up he got up slowly he never left the cinema very quickly he looked around there werent many people this afternoon naturally it was the day of the st leger and they were all at the races everyone was hurrying towards the exit mr leadbetter started to follow the man in the seat in front of him was asleep excuse me sir said a man who was trying to get past the sleeping gentleman mr leadbetter reached the exit he looked back something seemed to be happening perhaps the man in front of him was drunk and not asleep he stopped for a moment and then went out the manager was saying to the man who had tried to get past hes ill he spoke to the sleeping man whats the matter sir the other man touched the sleeper he took his hand away and looked at a red sticky mark blood the manager saw the corner of something under the seat its at abc he said mr cust left the regal cinema and looked up at the sky it was a beautiful evening a really beautiful evening he walked along smiling to himself until he came to the black horse where he was staying he climbed the stairs to his bedroom a small room on the second floor as he entered the room he suddenly stopped smiling there was a mark on the arm of his coat he touched it wet and red blood he put his hand in his pocket and brought out something a long thin knife that was sticky and red mr cust sat down and looted around the room like a hunted animal it isnt my fault he said he passed his tongue over his lips then he went over to the sink and filled it with water he took off his coat and washed the arm the water was red now there was a knock on the door he stood there frown with fear the door opened it was a young woman carrying some water oh excuse me sir your hot water sir thank you ive washed in cold water immediately she looked at the water in the sink ive cut my hand said mr cust quickly there was a pause yes surely a very long pause before she said yes sir she went out shutting the door mr cust stood and listened were there voices feet coming up the stirs he could hear only the beating of his own heart then suddenly he moved he put on his coat went to the door and opened it there no one outside he went quietly down the stairs he ran out of the door that opened onto the hotel car park a couple of drivers wars there talking about the races mr cust hurried across the car park and out into the street should he go to the station yes there would be crowds there special trains with a bit of luck he could get away inspector crome was interviewing mr leadbetter the chief constable colonel anderson was there too please tell me everything clearly said crome this man went out towards the end of the main film as he passed you he fell he pretended to fall i understand it now he bent over the seat in front to pick up his hat he surely stabbed the man then then he went out can you describe him he was a very big man fair or dark i well im not exactly sure he was an uglylooking man inspector crome nodded then he interviewed the cinema manager the manager told crome about the blood on the dead mans coat and the abc railway guide under the seat did you notice a man leaving the cinema a few minutes earlier there were several sir just then a police constable came in mr hercule poirots here sir and another gentleman inspector crome didnt look pleased oh well he said theyd better come in i suppose poirot and i entered the room both crome and colonel anderson were looking worried colonel anderson greeted us with a nod of the head im glad youve come monsieur poirot he said politely another abc murder yes the murderer bent over and stabbed the victim in the back there was an abc on the floor between the dead mans feet do you know who the dead man is asked poirot yes i think a b cs made a mistake this time the dead man is called earlsfield george earlsfield he missed out the letter d my friend shook his head doubtfully shall we talk to the man who found him asked crome hes anxious to get home a middleaged gentleman came in he spoke in an excited high voice its the most shocking experience ive ever known he said your name please said the inspector downes roger emmanuel downes im a teacher at a boys school now mr downes please tell us in your own words what happened at the end of the film i got up from my seat the seat on my left was empty but in the seat next to that there was a man who seemed to be asleep i realised that he was ill and i called out fetch the manager as i couldnt pass him i put my hand on his shoulder to wake him then i took my hand from the mans shoulder i found that it was wet and red colonel anderson was looking at mr downes mr downes youre a very lucky man youre about the same height as the dead man i think the murderer became confused he followed you into the cinema but he chose the wrong victim i am sure mr downes that that knife was meant for you mr downes became weak with shock he sat down on a chair you mean that this madman has followed me but why me he got up he suddenly looked old and shaken if you dont want me anymore gentlemen i think ill go home i i dont feel very well mr downes left the room send couple of constables to watch his house said colonel anderson you think said poirot that when abc finds out his mistake he might try to murder mr downes again anderson nodded its a possibility he said a b c may be upset if things dont go according to his plans a constable came in mr ball of the black horse is here with a young woman sir he said he thinks he has something to tell you which may be helpful mr ball was a large slowthinking heavilymoving man he smelled strongly of beer with him there was a young woman with round eyes she seemed to be very excited this girl mary has something to tell you said mr ball mary told us that she had taken hot water to one of the hotel guests in his room he was washing his hands he had taken his coat off and was holding the arm of it in the water in the sink the coat was wet and the water in the sink was red red said anderson sharply when was this at about a quarter to five more than three hours ago said anderson why didnt you come at once we didnt know that thered been another murder said ball when we heard the news mary screamed out about the blood in the sink i went upstairs to the room but there was nobody there one of the men in the car park said he saw a man leaving so i told mary to come to the police describe this man said inspector crome to mary he wasnt very tall or short said mary and he stooped and wore glasses he was wearing a dark suit and a hat his clothes looked old and cheap inspector crome sent two men to the black horse they came back about ten minutes later and brought the hotel book which all guests had to sign we crowded around it there was a signature there in small writing a b case or is it cash said colonel anderson a b c said crome what about his luggage asked anderson we found a suitcase in his room sir full of small boxes what was in them stockings sir congratulations crome said to poirot your guess was right inspector crome was in his office at scotland yard the telephone on his desk rang it was one of the policemen who was helping him on the case jacobs speaking sir a man has come with a story that you ought to hear a few minutes later there was a knock on the door jacobs appeared with a tall young man this is mr tom hartigan sir hes got something to tell us which may be important in the abc case the inspector got up and shook hands with the visitor good morning mr hartigan sit down what do you want to tell me well began tom nervously ive got a young lady friend you see and her mother rents out rooms in her house one of the rooms has been rented for over two years to a man called cust tom told the inspector about his meeting with mr cust at euston station and the ticket for doncaster which mr cust had dropped lily my young lady also told me that mr cust was near churston at the time of the murder and at the seaside when the bexhill murder happened the newspapers said that information was wanted about a b case or cash lilys mother mrs marbury told me that mr cust is a b cust then we wondered if mr cust had been away from home on the date of the andover murder and we remembered that he was inspector crome listened to everything carefully you were quite right to come here he said these dates may be only a coincidence and the name too but id certainly like to interview mr cust is he at home now yes sir when did he return on the evening of the doncaster murder sir hes stayed in a lot since then and he doesnt look very well mrs marbury says he buys a lot of newspapers mrs marbury says that he talks to himself too tom gave inspector crome mrs marburys address thank you said the inspector i shall probably visit the house later today please be careful if you meet mr cust good morning mr hartigan tom went outside lily marbury was waiting for him he told her about his meeting with inspector crome the police are going to come and ask him some questions he said poor mr cust said lily dont feel scarry for him if hes abc hes murdered four people lily shook her head it does seem awful she said come and have some lunch said tom all right but i must just telephone someone a girl i going to meet she ran across the road and came back looking rather red in the face she put her arm through toms arm tell me more about scotland yard you didnt see the other man there the belgian gentleman the one that abc writes to no he wasnt there well tell me all about it who did you speak to and what did you say mr cust put the phone back very gently he turned to where mrs marbury was standing watching him you dont often have a telephone call mr cust she said i hope its not bad news no no he saw that mrs marbury was holding a newspaper he read births marriages deaths my sisters just had a little boy he said quickly well that is nice said mrs marbury she wondered why mr cust had never said he had a sister well mr cust my congratulations is it the first one or have you other little nephews and nieces its the only one said mr cust the only one ive ever had or am likely to have and er i think i must go there at once they they want me to come i i think i can just catch a train if i hurry will you be away long mr cust called mrs marbury he ran up the stairs oh no two or three days thats all he disappeared into his bedroom a few minutes later he came quietly down the stairs carrying a bag in his hand he saw the telephone and remembered the short conversation he had just had is that you mr cust i thought you might like to know that an inspector from scotland yard may come to see you why had lily telephoned him had she guessed his secret how did she know that the inspector was coming did she know but it surely if she knew she wouldnt women were very strange surprisingly cruel and surprisingly kind lily was a kind girl a kind pretty girl he paused in the hall then he heard a noise from the kitchen mrs marbury might come out he opened the front door passed through it and closed it behind him where poirot and i were having another meeting with the chief constable colonel anderson and inspector crome ive got a list of people in the churston area where the man went and offered stockings said inspector crome he stayed at a small hotel he returned there at on the night of the murder he did the same thing in bexhill he stayed at a hotel under his own name and offered stockings to people at about twelve addresses including mrs barnard and including the orange cat he did the same in andover he stayed at a small hotel there too and offered stockings to mrs fowler next door to mrs ascher and to several other people in the same street i went to the address which mr hartigan gave me said the inspector but i found that cust had left the house about half an hour before he received a telephone message mrs marbury said it was the first time i searched his room very carefully i found notepaper there similar to the paper which the letters were written on there was also a strange quantity of stockings and at the back of the same cupboard there were eight new abc railway guides that proves hes guilty said colonel anderson ive found something else too said the inspector i only found it this morning sir there was no sign of the knife in his room but i thought perhaps hed brought it back to the house and hidden it somewhere i found it immediately the coatstand no one ever moves a coatstand i moved it away from the wall and there it was the knife the dried blood was still on it good work crome said colonel anderson we only need one thing more now the man himself dont worry well get him said crome but there is something that worries me very much said poirot it is the why the motive but my dear poirot the mans crazy said colonel anderson impatiently well as you say crome its just a matter of time before we find him mr cust stood by a fruit and vegetable shop staring across the road yes that was it a ascher newsagent in the empty window there was a sign shop to rent he walked slowly back towards the mam street of the town it was difficult very difficult now that he hadnt any more money he hadnt had anything to eat all day he looked at a board outside another newsagents shop he abc case murderer still free interviews with hercule poirot mr cust said to himself hercule poirot i wonder if he knows he continued walking where was he going he didnt know he had come to the end he looked up there were lights in front of him and letters police station thats funny said mr cust he gave a little laugh then he stepped inside suddenly as he did so he fell forward chapter eleven and catch a fox it was a clear november day dr thompson and chief inspector japp had come to tell poirot about the police case against alexander bonaparte cust whats your opinion of cust poirot asked dr thompson i dont know he doesnt seem to be mad hes an epileptic of course yes that was clear when he fell into the police station in andover i said but can a man murder someone and not know theyve done it in my opinion cust knows very well that hes responsible for murder said dr thompson the letters prove that the murders were planned crimes and we still have no explanation for the letters said poirot until i know why they were written i shall not feel that the case is solved well i must go said dr thompson he went out japp stayed so cust has an alibi for the bexhill murder said poirot yes said the inspector and his alibi is very strong a man called strange has told us that he met cust in the whitecross hotel in eastbourne on the evening of july after dinner he and cust played cards cust played very well they played cards until midnight and separated at ten minutes past midnight so if cust was in a hotel in eastbourne at that time he couldnt strangle betty barnard on the beach at bexhill between midnight and one oclock eastbourne is about twentytwo kilometres away from bexhill and it would take some time for him to get there it is a problem yes said poirot we know that cust carried out the doncaster murder the coat with the blood the knife thats certain he carried out the churston murder he carried out the andover murder so he also did the bexhill murder but i dont understand how tell me hastings said poirot after japp had gone do you think the case is finished well yes weve got the man and weve got most of the facts poirot shook his head but until we know all about the man the mystery is as deep as ever and we know nothing at all we know where he was born we know that he fought in the war and was hit on the head we know that he left the army because he is an epileptic we know that he rented a room from mrs marbury we know that he is very quiet and shy the kind of man that nobody notices we know that he planned and carried out several very clever murders we know that he made some stupid mistakes we know that he killed without pity we know that he did not want anyone else to suffer for his crimes do you not see hastings that the man is like two different people all the time i have tried to get to know the murderer and now i realise hastings that i do not know him at all i am quite confused why did he carry out these murders why did he choose those people alphabetically i began was betty barnard the only person in bexhill whose name began with a b betty barnard i had an idea there it ought to be true it must be true but if it is he was silent for some time i didnt like to interrupt him and i believe i fell asleep suddenly i woke to find poirots hand on my shoulder mon cher hastings he said always you help me you bring me luck i was quire confused how have i helped you this time i asked i remembered something that you said it makes everything very clear i see the answers to all my questions the reason for mrs ascher the reason for sir carmichael clarke the reason for the doncaster murder and finally very important the reason for hercule poirot but first i need a little more information from our special legion and then then when i have got an answer to one of my questions i will go and see a b c we will face each other at last abc and hercule poirot the enemies and then we will talk what do you expect cust to tell you i asked hercule poirot smiled a lie he said and from the lie i shall know the truth during the next few days poirot was very busy he was mysteriously absent for a lot of the time he talked very little and refused to answer any of my questions but towards the end of the week he said he intended to visit bexhill he suggested that i should come with him and i agreed enthusiastically the members of our special legion were also invited poirot first visited mr and mrs barnard and asked them when exactly cust had come to their door and what he had said then he went to the hotel where cust had stayed and asked for a detailed description of cust next he went to the beach to the place where betty barnards body had been discovered he studied the ground carefully he then walked from the beach to the nearest place where a car could be parked from there he went to the place where the eastbourne buses waited before leaving bexhill finally he took us all to the orange cat cafe where the fat waitress milly higley served us tea i have finished in bexhill said poirot i will go to eastbourne i need to ask one question there it is not necessary for you all to come with me but come back to the hotel and let us have a drink that tea was horrible as we were having our drinks franklin clarke said i suppose we can guess what youre trying to do youre trying to prove that custs alibi is false you seem very pleased but i dont know why you havent got a new fact of any kind no that is true said poirot then he continued my friend hastings told me once that he had as a young man played a game called the truth everyone was asked three questions they had to promise to answer two questions truthfully he paused eh bien i want to play that game but one will be enough one question to each of you of course laid clarke impatiently well answer anything ah but i want it to be more serious than that do you all promise to speak the truth everyone became as serious as poirot they all promised then poirot turned to franklin clarke what did you think of the hats that the ladies wore at ascot this year franklin clarke stared at him in surprise is this a joke certainly not clarke began to smile well monsieur poirot i didnt actually go to ascot but i saw some of the women driving to the races and their hats this year were an even bigger joke than the hats they usually wear poirot smiled and turned to donald fraser when did you take your holiday this year fraser stared my holiday the first two weeks in august then poirot turned to thora grey and i heard a slight change in his voice his question came sharp and clear mademoiselle after lady clarkes death did you hope to marry sir carmichael the girl jumped up how dare you ask me such a question its insulting perhaps but you have promised to speak the truth yes or no sir carmichael was wonderfully kind to me he treated me almost like a daughter and thats how i felt to him i was fond of him and grateful too excuse me but that is not answering yes or no mademoiselle the answer of course is no he turned to megan barnard the girls face was very pale mademoiselle what do you hope will be the result of my questions do you want me to find out the truth or not megans head went back proudly no she said clearly we all jumped poirot sat forward studying her face mademoiselle megan he said you may not want the truth but you can speak it he said he turned towards the door then remembered mary drower tell me have you a young man mary looked at him nervously oh mr poirot i i well im not sure poirot smiled then he looked round for me come hastings we must start for eastbourne the car was waiting and soon we were driving along the coast road that leads through pevensey to eastbourne poirot seemed very pleased with himself as we passed through pevensey he suggested that we should stop and look at the castle there as we were returning to the car we passed a group of children in a circle singing a song what is it that they are saying hastings asked poirot i listened until i understood and catch a fox and put him in a box and never let him go poirot repeated the words his face suddenly became very serious that is very terrible hastings he was silent you hunt the fox here i dont ive never been able to afford to hunt and i dont think theres much hunting in this part of the world i meant in england generally a strange sport the dogs run after the fox and at last they catch him and he dies quickly and horribly but the quick cruel death is better than what those children were singing it is not good to be shut away in a box for ever tomorrow i am going to visit cust now lets go back to london arent we going to eastbourne i cried what for i know quite enough now i was not present at the interview between poirot and that strange man alexander bonaparte cust because of his relationship with the police poirot was able to be there but i wasnt included in the special permission that was needed poirot also wanted the interview to be completely private the two men face to face but when poirot came back he told me all about it in great detail mr cust seemed smaller and to stoop even more his fingers pulled nervously at his coat for a time poirot sat and looked at him at last he said gently do you know who i am mr cust shook his head no no i dont or are you from mr maynard from his law office he was polite but didnt seem very interested his mind seemed to be on something else something inside himself i am hercule poirot he said the words very gently and watched for the effect mr cust lifted his head a little oh yes he said then a minute later he repeated the words again oh yes this time he sounded different more interested he looked at poirot poirot looked back and nodded yes he said i am the man that you wrote the letters to at once the contact was broken mr cust dropped his eyes and spoke crossly i never wrote to you he said those letters werent written by me ive said so again and again i know said poirot but if you did not write them who did an enemy i must have an enemy they are all against me the police everyone all against me poirot didnt reply everyone has been against me always even when you were a child mr cust seemed to think about that no no not exactly then my mother was very fond of me she thought i was going to be special that i could do anything he was silent for a minute but she was quite wrong i was afraid of people i had a bad time at school and later when i smarted work i had the feeling that everyone thought i was stupid and in the war asked poirot you know said mr cust and his face lit up i enjoyed the war i felt for the first time like a man his smile disappeared but then i got hit on the head so they made me leave the army i started working in an office but things were very difficult i had very little money and then i got the offer of the job selling stockings you told us the name of the company but you know now dont you said poirot in a gentle voice that that company didnt employ you thats because theyre against me too ive got their letters to me giving me instructions about places to go to and a list of people to visit their letters werent written said poirot they were typed all those letters were typed on the machine which was found in your room so it seems that you typed them yourself and posted them to yourself no no said mr cust it because theyre all against me and the abcs that were found in the cupboard i know nothing about them i thought they were stockings why did you put a mark by the name of mrs ascher in that first list of people in andover because i decided to visit her first one must begin somewhere but i didnt murder her im completely innocent its all a mistake look at that second crime the bexhill one i was playing cards in eastbourne you play cards very well i believe said poirot i i well i believe i do youd be surprised how a game of cards can bring strangers together i remember one man ive never forgotten him because of something he told me we just got talking over a cup of coffee and we started playing cards what did he tell you asked poirot mr custs is face looked worried he read my future in my hand he said i would be one of the most famous men in england before i died he said the whole country would talk about me but he said he said i would die a violent death he was silent suddenly my head i suffer very badly i get cruel headaches sometimes and then there are times when i dont know he stopped but you do know dont you poirot said that you carried out the murders mr cust looked up he looked strangely at peace yes he said i know but i am right am i not you dont know why you carried them out mr cust shook his head no he said i dont chapter twelve poirot explains poirot called a meeting of the special legion from the beginning he said i have been worried about the why of this case the mystery was not the mystery of the murders but the mystery of a b c why was it necessary for him to carry out these murders why did he choose me as his enemy it is no answer to say that the man was mad as soon as i received the first letter i was upset and worried it seemed to me that there was something very wrong about the letter you were quite right said franklin clarke yes but then at the beginning i made a serious mistake the letter made me very worried the police thought it was a joke i was sure that a murder would happen in andover as you know a murder did happen there was no way of knowing who the person was who had carried out the murder i had to try and understand what kind of a person had done it i had to discover the motive of the crime the motive of the letter why did the murderer send the letter to met why not to scotland yard or to a newspaper why to hercule poirot was it for a personal reason then the second letter arrived and was followed by the murder of betty barnard it became clear now that the murders were going to take place according to an alphabetical plan but why did abc need to carry out these murders when we think about the four victims or three of them since i know very little about mr downes or mr earlsfield we realise that it was possible for the murderer to kill them without anyone suspecting him the clear suspects were franz ascher donald fraser or megan barnard or possibly mr clarke why then did the murderer need to call attention to himself why did he need to leave on each body an abc railway guide i was learning certain things about the murderer his crimes were listed alphabetically that was clearly important his victims were men and women and of different ages so age and sex were not important to him the choice of the abc suggested to me that it was someone who was interested in railways this is more common in men than in women small boys love trains more than small girls it might be a sign too of someone whose mind was not of an adult someone who was still a boy the death of betty barnard gave me other clues she was strangled with her own belt therefore she was killed by someone she was friendly with betty barnard liked attention from goodlooking men she went out with a b c so he was attractive to women donald fraser jumped up angrily mr poirot please its finished said poirot i will say no more we will pass to the next murder the murder of sir carmichael clarke here the murderer goes back to his first method hitting the victim on the head we were unlucky over this crime since the warning letter did not reach us in time therefore no preparations could be made to stop the crime then the clue of the stockings was discovered the appearance of a stocking seller near the scene of each crime could not be a coincidence so he must be the murderer but his description as given by miss grey did not match my picture of the man who strangled miss barnard a fourth murder was carried out the murder of a man named george earlsfield in mistake we thought for a man named downes and now the murderers luck changes and a b c is at last arrested the case as hastings says has ended the man is in prison finish but not for me i still dont know the why and there is one small annoying fact the man cust has an alibi for the night of the bexhill crime thats been worrying me too said franklin clarke yes continued poirot the alibi seems real but it cannot be real unless and now we come to two very interesting ideas supposing my friends that while cust was responsible for three of the crimes the a c and d crimes he did not carry out the b crime monsieur poirot it isnt said megan barnard poirot silenced megan barnard with a look be quiet mademoiselle said poirot i want the truth i have finished with lies suppose i say that someone else murdered betty barnard monsieur poirot surely all the crimes were done by the same person poirot took no notice of megan and continued i told you that there was a second idea supposing that someone else killed betty barnard did that someone else do the other murders too but that doesnt make sense cried clarke doesnt it i examined the letters again i had felt from the beginning that there was something wrong with them i had thought they were written by a madman but then i realised they were not they were false the writer was only pretending to be mad what would be the reason for writing such letters to call the polices attention to the murders at first it did not seem to make sense and then i saw light it was to call the polices attention to several murders to a group of murders so that one of those murders would not be noticed i was facing a very clever murderer not mr cust i was facing a very different kind of man a man who enjoyed behaving like a boy remember the schoolboy like letters and the railway guide and who was attractive to women a man who played an important part in one of the crimes i thought about all the crimes again the andover crime the most likely suspect was franz ascher but i could not imagine that ascher could invent and carry out such a complicated plan the bexhill crime donald fraser was clever and had ability but his motive for killing his girlfriend could only be jealousy it was very unlikely that such a crime would be planned we now come to the churston crime sir carmichael clarke was a very rich man who will get his money after he dies his wife who is dying and then it goes to his brother franklin poirot turned slowly round and looked at franklin clarke i was quite sure then abc and franklin clarke were the same person franklin clarke is attractive to women he could easily make a girl in a cafe go out with him he enjoys making lists he made a list here one day and finally his boyish behaviour lady clarke told us about that i was quite sure in my own mind the writer of the letters and the murderer was franklin clarke franklin clarke started to laugh and what about our friend cust what about the blood on his coat and the knife he hid he may say he didnt do the crimes you are quite wrong said poirot he says he did do the murders he believes himself to be guilty but as soon as i saw him i knew he could not be guilty he is not clever enough no there were two people who played a part in these crimes the real murderer clever and daring and the false murderer weak and stupid i think you had the idea when you first met mr cust in a coffee shop you were thinking about murdering your brother you showed me a letter your brother had written to you in it he showed how fond he was of miss thora grey you were afraid that when lady clarke died your brother might marry miss grey and have children then you would not get any of his money your meeting with mr cust gave you an idea his strange names his epilepsy and his weak character made him the tool that you were looking tor the whole alphabetical plan jumped into your mind you contacted a company that made stockings and asked for a large number of stockings to be sent to cust you sent him a number of abc railway guides you wrote a letter to him pretending that it came from the stocking company and offering him good pay for selling stockings you made your plans so well that you typed all the letters that were sent later then you gave him the machine on which they were typed you found two victims whose names began with a and b you sent a list of customers in the andover area to cust telling him to go there on a certain date mrs aschers name was on the list you sent the first abc letter to me then you went to andover and killed mrs ascher for the second murder you probably killed betty barnard before midnight on the th we now come to murder number the important murder for you and here i must thank hastings he suggested that the third letter was sent to the wrong address on purpose and he was right i had wondered why were the letters addressed to hercule poirot a private detective and not to the police you wanted one of the letters to get lost and reach us too late but a letter to scotland yard could not get lost so you sent it to a private address you wanted the police to find out about it only when the murder was safely done your brothers nightly walk gave you the opportunity and everyone was thinking about abc nobody thought that you might be guilty after your brothers murder your purpose was finished you wanted mr cust to be arrested as the murderer but nobody had noticed him so you decided that one more murder was necessary you chose doncaster as the scene of your next crime everything was made very public in the newspapers you gave instructions to mr cust to go to doncaster in the afternoon he went to a cinema you were there too you stabbed a man and put the abc railway guide under his feet when mr cust left you followed him and put the bloody knife in his coat pocket and now my friends let us imagine how mr cust thought about all this the andover crime means nothing to him he is shocked and surprised by the bexhill crime he was there at about the same time then comes the churston crime three crimes and he has been at the scent of each of them epilepsy sufferers cannot always remember what they have done then he receives the order to go to doncaster doncaster and the next abc crime will be in doncaster he becomes afraid and tells people he is going to cheltenham he goes to doncaster and visits a cinema in the afternoon when he gets back to his hotel he discovers there is blood on his coat so he thinks he he himself is the killer he is quite sure of the truth he alexander bonaparte cust is a mad killer he behaves like a hunted animal he goes back to his rented room in london he has the knife with him still he hides it behind the coatstand then he is warned that the police are coming they know i dont know why he went to andover maybe he wanted to look at the place of the crime although he could remember nothing about it he has no money left he is very tired he goes to a police station when i saw him i knew at once that he was not the murderer and that my name meant nothing to him i knew that he thought he was the murderer your idea said franklin clarke is completely mad no mr clarke i found the stick which you used in the andover and churston murders in a cupboard at churston an ordinary stick with a thick handle two people from the cinema in doncaster recognised your photograph milly higley the waitress at bexhill remembered you and you left a fingerprint on custs typewriter clarke sat silently for a minute then he said you win monsieur poirot he took a small gun out of his pocket and held it to his head he tried to shoot it but the gun didnt work clarke stared at it in surprise no mr clarke said poirot perhaps you noticed that i had a new servant today a friend of mine he used to be a clever thief he removed your gun from your pocket and made it safe then he put it back no mr clarke there will be no easy death for you your crime was not at all english not fair two detectives from scotland yard came out from the next room one of them was crome they arrested franklin clarke and took him away as the door behind franklin clarke closed i am sorry to say that i started to laugh poirot looked at me in surprise its because you told him his crime wasnt fair i said it was quite true it was very cruel not only the murder of his brother but to shut a man away for ever in a prison for mad people like a living death to catch a fox and put him in a box and never let him go that is not sport not fair megan barnard said i cant believe it i cant is it true yes mademoiselle said poirot its finished he turned to fraser mademoiselle megan was always afraid that you were responsible for the second crime i thought so myself at one time said donald fraser quietly because of your dream your dream has a very natural explanation in it you find that one sister is being replaced by the other mademoiselle megan is taking the place of her sister in your heart but you feel guilty so you try to kill the thought do not be afraid to forget said poirot gently mademoiselle megan is very special she has a wonderful heart donald frasers eyes lit up i believe youre right he said we all crowded round poirot asking questions why did you ask us those truth questions poirot i wanted to see franklin clarkes face when i asked my question of mademoiselle thora his eyes were full of hate and anger franklin clarke knew it was the end for him when you told him about the fingerprint on the typewriter i said yes they are useful fingerprints i told him that to please you but poirot i cried wasnt it true not at all mon ami said hercule poirot a few days later we had a visit from mr alexander bonaparte cust he shook poirots hand and said do you know a newspaper has actually offered me a hundred pounds if i tell them about my life i i really dont know what to do about it you should not accept a hundred said poirot say that five hundred is your price and tell the other newspapers about it as well you must realise that you are a very famous man probably the most famous man in england mr cust looked very happy do you know i believe youre right monsieur poirot said mr cust the money will be nice very nice ill have a little holiday and then i want to give a nice wedding present to lily marbury really a dear girl you are quite right said poirot and just a word what about a visit to an eye doctor the reason for those headaches is probably that you need new glasses do you think so mr cust shook him warmly by the hand youre a very great man monsieur poirot when mr cust had left my old friend smiled across at me so hastings we went hunting once more did we not the end
