the eternal world clark ashton smith christopher chandon went to his laboratory window for a last look at the mountain solitude about him which in all likelihood he would never see again with no faltering of his determination and yet not wholly without regret he stared at the rugged gully beneath where the gothic shade of firs and hemlocks was threaded by the brawling silver of a tiny stream he saw the granitesheeted slope beyond and the two nearer peaks of the sierras whose slaty azure was tipped by the first autumn snow and saw the pass between them that lay in a line with his appaent route through the timespace continuum then he turned to the strange apparatus whose completion had cost him so many years of toil and experiment on a raised platform in the centre of the room there stood a large cylinder not without resemblance to a divingbell its base and lower walls were of metal its upper half was made wholly of indestructible glass a hammock inclined at an angle of forty degrees was slung between its sides in this hammock chandon meant to lash himself securely to insure as much protection as would be feasible against the unknown velocities of his proposed flight gazing through the clear glass he could watch with comfort whatever visual phenomena the journey might offer the cylinder had been set directly in front of an enormous disk ten feet in diameter with a hundred perforations in its silver surface behind it were ranged a series of dynamos designed for the development of an obscure power which for want of a better name chandon had called the negative timeforce this power he had isolated with infinite labours from the posi tive energy of time that fourthdimensional gravity which causes and controls the rotation of events the negative power amplified a thousandfold by the dynamos would remove to an incalculable distance in contemporary time and space anything that stood in its path it would not permit of travel into the past or future but would cause an instant projection across the tempoaral stream that enfolds the entire cosmos in its endless equal flowing unfortunately chandon had not been able to construct a mobile machine in which he could travel as in a rocketship and perhaps return as to his startingpoint he must plunge boldly and forever into the unknown but he had furnished the cylinder with an oxygen apparatus with electric light and heat and a months supply of food and water even if his flight should end in empty space or in some world whose conditions would render human survival impossible he would at least live long enough to make a thorough observation of his surroundings he had a theory however that his journey would not terminate in the midst of mere ether that the cosmic bodies were nuclei of the timegravity and that the weakening of the propulsive force would permit the cylinder to be drawn to one of them the hazards of his venture were past foreseeing but he preferred them to the safe monotonous certitudes of earthly life he had always chafed beneath a feeling of limitation had longed only for the unexplored vastnesses he could not brook the thought of any horizons other than those which have never been overpassed with a strange thrilling in his heart he turned from the alpine landscape and proceeded to lock himself in the cylinder he had installed a timing device which would automatically start the dynamos at a given hour lying in the hammock beneath leather straps that he had buckled about his waist ankles and shoulders he still had a minute or so to wait before the turning on of the power in those moments for the first time there swept upon him in an unleashed flood the full terror and peril of his experiment and he was almost tempted to unbind himself and leave the cylinder before it was too late he had all the sensations of one who is about to be blown from a cannons mouth suspended in a weird silence from which all sound had been excluded by the airtight walls he resigned himself to the unknown with many conflicting surmises as to what would occur he might or might not survive the passage through unfamiliar dimensions at speed to which the velocity of light would be laggard but if he did survive he might reach the farthest galaxies in a mere flash his fears and surmises were terminated by something that came with the suddenness of sleep or death everything seemed to dissolve and vanish in a bright flare and then there passed before him a swarming broken panorama a babel of impressions ineffably various and multiplied it seemed to him that he possessed a thousand eyes with which to apprehend in one instant tbe flowing of many aeons the passing of countless worlds the cylinder seemed no longer to exist and he did not appear to be moving but all the systems of time were going by him and he caught the scraps and fragments of a million scenes objects faces forms angles and colours which he recalled later as one recalls the deliriously amplified and distorted visions of certain drugs he saw the giant evergreen forests of lichen the continents of brobdingnagian grasses in planets remoter than the systems of hercules before him there passed like an architectural pageant the milehigh cities that wear the sumptuous aerial motley of rose and emerald and tyrian wrought by the tangent beams of triple suns he beheld unnameable things in spheres unlisted by astronomers there crowded upon him the awful and limitless evolutionary range of transtellar life the cyclorama of teeming morphologies it seemed as if the barriers of his brain had been extended to include the whole of the cosmic flux that his thought like the web of some mammoth and divine arachnidan had woven itself from world to world fron galaxy to galaxy above the dread gulf of the infinite continuum then with the same suddenness that had marked its beginning the vision came to an end and was replaced by something of a totally different character it was only afterwards that chandon could figure out what had occurred and divine the nature and laws of the new environment into which he had been projected at the time he was wholly incapable of anything but a single contemplative visual impression the strange world upon which he looked through the clear wall of the cylinder a world that might have been the dream of some geometrician mad with infinity it was like some planetary glacier fretted into shapes of ordered grotesquery filled with a white unglittering light and obeying the laws of other perspectives than those of our own world the distances on which he gazed were literally interminable there was no horizon and yet nothing seemed to dwindle in size or definitude whatever its remoteness part of the impression received by chandon was that this world arched back upon itself like the interior surface of a hollow sphere that the pale vistas returned overhead after they had vanisbed from his view nearer to him than any other object in the scene and preserving the same relative distance as in his laboratory he perceived a large circular section of rough planking that portion of the laboratory wall which had lain in the path of the negative beam it hung motionless in air as if suspended by a field of invisible ice the foreground beyond the planking was thronged by innumerable rows of objects that were suggestive both of statues and of crystalloid formations wan as marble or alabaster each of them presented a m–πlange of simple curves and symmetric angles which somehow seemed to include the latency of almost endless geometrical development they were gigantic with a rudimentary division into head limbs and body as if they were living things behind them at indefinite distances were other forms that might have been the blind buds or frozen blossoms of unknown vegetable growths chandon had no sense of the passing of time as he peered from the cylinder he could remember nothing could imagine nothing he was unaware of his body or the hammock in which be lay except as a halfseen image on the rim of vision somehow in that strange frozen impression he felt the inert dynamism of the forms about him the silent thunder the unlaunched lightnings as of cataleptic gods the atomfolded heat and flame as of unlit suns inscrutably they brooded before him as they had done from all eternity and would continue to do forever in this world there could be no change no event all things must preserve the same aspect and the same attitude as he realized later his attempt to change his own position in the time stream had led to an unforeseen result he had projected himself beyond time into some further cosmos where the very ether perhaps was a nonconductor of the timeforce and in which therefore the phenomena of temporal sequence were impossible the sheer velocity of his flight had lodged him on the verge of this eternity like some arctic explorer caught in everlasting ice there obedient to the laws of timelessness he seemed fated to remain life as we know the term was impossible for him and yet since death would involve a timesequence it was equally impossible for him to die he must maintain the position in which he had landed must hold the breath he had been breathing at the moment of his impact against the eternal he was fixed in a cataleysy of the senses in a bright nirvana of contemplation it would seem according to all logic that there was no escape from his predicament however i must now relate the strangest thing of all the thing that was seemingly unaccountable that defied the proven laws of the timeless sphere into the glacial field of chandons vision athwart the horizonless ranks of immutable figures there came an intruding object a thing that drifted as if through aeons that grew upon the scene with the slowness of some millennial coral reef in a crystal sea even fron its first appearance the object was plainly alien to the scene was obviously like chandons cylinder and the wall section of noneternal origin it was black and lustrous with more than the blackness of intrastellar space or of metals locked from light in the core of planets it forced itself upon the sight with ultramaterial solidity and yet it seemed to refuse the crystal daylight to insulate itself from the nevervarying splendour the thing disclosed itself as a sharp and widening wedge driven upon the adamantine ether and forming by the same violent act of irruption a new visual image in chandons paralytic eyes in defiance of the mental laws of his surroundings it caused him to form an idea of duration and movement seen in its entirety the thing was a large spindleshaped vessel dwarfing chandons cylinder like an ocean liner beside a ships dinghy it floated aloof and separate a seamless mass of unbroken ebon swelling to an orblike equator and dwindling to a point at each end the form was such as might have been calculated to pierce some obdurate medium the substance of which it had been wrought and its motive power were destined to remain unknown to chandon perhaps it driven by some tremendous concentrating of the timeforce with which he had played so ignorantly and ineptly the intruding vessel wholly stationary hung now above the rows of statuesque entities that were foremost in his field of vision by infinite gradations a huge circular door seemed to open in its bottom and from the opening there issued a cranelike arm of the same black material as the vessel the arm ended in numerous pendent bars that somehow gave the idea of fingerlike suppleness it descended uyon the head of one of the strange geometric images and the myriad bars bending and stretching with slow but limitless fluidity wrapped themselves like a net of chains about the crystalloid body then the figure was dragged upwards as if with herculean effort and vanished at length together with the shortening arm in the vessels interior again the arm emerged to repeat the bizarre impossible abduction and draw another of the enigmatic things from its everlasting station and once more the arm descended and a third entity was taken like the theft of still another marble god from its marble heaven all this was done in profound silence the immeasurable slowness of motion being muffled by the ether and creating nothing that chandons ear could apprehend as sound after the third disappearance with its strange prey the arm returned extending itself diagonally and to greater length than before till the black fingers barred the glass of chandons cylinder and closed upon it with their irresistible clutch he was scarcely aware of any movement but it seemed to him that the ranks of white figures the unhorizoned and neverdwindling vistas were sinking slowly from his ken like a foundering world he saw the ebon bulk of the great vessel towards which he was drawn by the shortening arm till it filled his entire vision then the cylinder was lifted into the nightblack opening where it seemed that light was powerless to follow chandon could see nothing he was aware of nothing but solid darkness enfolding the cylinder even as it had been enfolded by the white achromatic light of timelessness he felt about him the sense of long tremendous vibration a soundless pulsing that seemed to spread in circles from some dynamic centre to pass over and beyond him through aeons as if from some titanic heart whose beats defied the environing eternity simultaneously he realized that his own heart was beating again with the same protraction as this unknown pulse that he drew breath and exhaled it in obedience to the cydical vibration in his benumbed brain there grew the nascent idea of wonder the first beginning of a natural thoughtsequence his body and mind were beginning to function once more beneath the influence of the power that had been strong enough to intrude upon the timeless universe and pluck him from that petrifying ether the vibration began to swiften spreading outwards in mighty ripples it became audible as a cyclopean pounding and chandon somehow conceived the idea of giantbuilt machinery turning and throbbing in an underworld prison the vessel seemed to be forging onwards with resistless power through some material barrier doubtless it was wrenching itself free from the eternal dimension was tearing its way back into time the blackness had persisted for a while like a positive radiation rather than the mere absence of light now it cleared away and was replaced by an allrevealing ruddy illumination at the same time the loud enginelike vibration died to a muted throbbing perhaps the darkness had been in some manner associated with the full development of the strange force that had enabled tbe vessel to move and function in that ultratemporal medium with the return into time and the diminishment of power it had vanished the faculties of thought feeling cognition and movement under their normal timeaspects all came back to chandon like the loosing of a dammedup flood he was able to correlate all that occurred to him and infer in some measure the meaning of his unique experience with growing awe and astonishment he studied the scene that was visible from his position in the hammock the cylinder mith the weird crystalloid figures looming near at hand was reposing in a huge room probably the main hold of the vessel the interior of this room was curved like a sphere and all about and above gigantic unfamiliar machineries were disposed not far away he saw the retracted crane or arm it seemed that the force of gravitation inhered everywhere in the vessels inner surface for certain peculiar beings passed before chandon as he watched and ran upwards on the walls till they hung inverted from the ceiling with the nonchalance of flies there were perhaps a dozen of those beings within sight no one with earthly biological prepossessions could even have imagined them very readily each of them possessed a roughly globular body with the upper hemisphere swelling midway between pole and equator to form two neckless conical heads the hemisphere terminated in many limbs and appendages some of which were used for walking and others solely for prehension the heads were featureless but a glittering weblike membrane hung between them trembling continually certain of the nether appendages waving like inquisitive tentacles were tipped with organs that may have served for eyes ears nostrils and mouths these creatures shone with a silvery light and appeared to be almost translucent in the centre of the pointed heads a spot of coalbright crimson glowed and faded with pulselike regularity and the spherical bodies darkened and lightened as if with the rhythmic interchange of riblike zones of shadow beneath their surfaces chandon felt that they were formed of some nonprotoplasmic substance perhaps a mineral that had organized itself into living cells their movements were very quick and dexterous with an inhuman poise and they seemed able to perform many differemt motions with perfect simultaneity the earthman was stricken to renewed immobility by the strangeness of it all with vain fantastical surmises he sought to fathom the mystery who were these creatures and what had been their purpose in penetrating the eternal dimension why had they removed certain of its inhabitants together with him self whither was the vessel bound was it returning somewhere in time and space to the planetary world from which it had set forth on its weird voyage he could be sure of nothing but he knew that he had fallen into the hands of superscientific beings who were expert navigators of spacetime they had been able to build a vessel such as he had merely dreamt of building and perhaps they had explored and charted all the unknown deeps and had deliberately planned their incursion into the frozen world beyond if they had not come to rescue him he would never have escaped from the doom of timelessness into which he had been hurled by his own clumsy effort to cross the secular stream pondering he turned to the giant things that were his companions he could scarcely recognize them in the red glow their pallid planes and angles seened to have undergone a subtle rearrangement and the light quivered upon then in bloody lustres conferring an odd warmth a suggestion of awaking life more than ever they gave the impression of latent power of frozen dynamism then suddenly he saw an unmistakable movement from one of the statuelike entities and realized that tbe thing had begun to alter its shape the cold marble substance seemed to flow like quicksilver the rudimentary head aasumed a stern manyfeatured form such as might belong to the demigod of some foreign world the limbs lightened and new members of indeterminate use were put forth the simple curves and angles multiplied themselves with mysterious complexity a diamondshaped eye glowing with blue fire appeared in the face and was quickly followed by other eyes the thing seemed to be undergoing in a few moments the entire process of some longsuspended evolution chandon saw that the other figures were displaying singular alterations though in each case the ensuing development was wholly individual the geometric facets began to swell like opening buds and flowed into lines of celestial beauty and grandeur the boreal pallor was suffused with unearthly iridescence with opal tones that raced and trembled in everliving patterns in belted arabesques in rainbow hieroglyphs the human watcher felt the insurgence of a measureless –∏lan of a superstellar intellection in these remarkable beings a thrill of terror electric eerie ran through him the process he had just seen was too incalculable too tremendous who or what could limit and control the unsealed activities of these eternal ones aroused from their slumber surely he was in the presence of beings akin to gods to the demons or genii of myth that which he beheld was like the opening of the searecovered jars of solomon he saw that the marvellous transformation had also been perceived by the owners of the vessel these creatures thronging from all parts of the spheroid interior began to crowd around the timeless entities their mechanical darting motions the lifting and levelling of certain members that ended in eyeshaped organs betrayed an unhuman excitement and curiosity they seemed to be inspecting the transfigured forms with the air of learned biologists who had been prepared for such an event and were gratified by its consummation the timeless ones it appeared were also curious regarding their captors their flaming eyes returned the stare of the periscopic tentacles and certain odd hornshaped appendages of their lofty crowns began to quiver inquisitively as if with the reception of unknown senseimpressions then suddenly each of the three put forth a single jointless arm emitting in midair seven long fanlike rays of purple light in lieu of a hand these rays no doubt were capable of receiving and conveying tactile impressions slowly and deliberately like groping fingers they reached out and each of the fans curving fluctuantly where it encountered a rounded surface began to play with a rhythmic flaring about the foremost of the doubleheaded creatures these beings as if in alarm or discomfort drew back and sought to elude the searching rays the purple fingers lengthened encircled them held them helpless ran about them in broadening clinging zones as if to explore their whole anatomy from the two heads to the disclike pads that served them for feet the beings were swathed around with flowing rings and ribbons of light others of the vessels crew beyond reach of the curious beams had darted back to a more secure distance one of them lifted certain of his members in a swift emphatic gesture as far as chandon could see the being had not touched any of the vessels machinery but as if in obedience to the gesture a huge round mirrorlike mechanism overhead began to revolve in its frame on massive pivots the mechanism appeared to be made of some pale lucid substance neither glass nor metal ceasing its rotation as if the desired focus had been secured the lens emitted a beam of hueless light which somehow reminded chandon of the chill frozen radiance of the eternal world this beam falling on the timeless entities was plainly repressive in its effect immediately the fingerlike rays relinquished their quarry and faded back to the jointless arms which were then retracted the eyes closed like hidden jewels the opal patterns grew cold and dull and the strange halfdivine beings appeared to lose their complex angles to regain their former quiescence like devolving crystals yet somehow they were still alive they still retained the nascent lines of their preternatural efflorescence in his awe and wonder before this miraculous tableau chandon had automatically freed himself from the leather bands had risen from the hammock and was standing with his face pressed against the wall of the cylinder his change of position was noted by the vessels crew and their eyetentacles were all raised and levelled upon him for a moment following the devolution of the timeless ones then in response to another enigmatic gesture from one of their number the giant lens rotated a little further and the glacial beam began to shift and widen till it played uyon the cylinder though still including in its hueless range the dynamic figures the earthman had the sensation of being caught in a motionless flood of something that was inexpressibly thick and viscid his body seemed to congeal his thoughts crawled with painful slowness through some obstructing medium that had permeated his very brain it was not the complete arrest of all the lifeprocesses that had been entailed by his impingement upon eternity rather it was a deceleration of these processes a subjection to some unthinkably retarded rhythm of timemovement and sequence whole years seemed to intervene betwixt the beats of chandons heart the crooking of his little finger would have required lustrums through tediously elongated time his brain strove to form a single thought the suspicion that his captors had been alarmed by his change of posture and had apprehended some troublous demonstration of power from him as from the timeless ones then through further decades he conceived another thought that he himself was perhaps regarded as one of the godlike beings by these alien timevoyagers they had found him in eternity amid the measureless ranks and how were they to know that he like themselves had come originally from a temporal world with his altered sense of duration the earthman could form no proper conception of the length of the voyage in timespace to him it was almost another eternity punctuated at lustrumlong intervals by the humming vibration of the machinery to his delayed visual perception the crew of the vessel seemed to move with incredible sluggishness by imperceptible gradations he with his weird companions had been set apart by the chill beam in a prison of slow time while the ship itself was plunging through bottomless dimensions of secular and cosmic infinitude at last the voyage came to an end chandon felt the gradual dawning of an allpervasive light that drowned the vessels ruddy glow in fierce whiteness by infinite degrees the walls became perfectly transparent together with the machinery and he realized that the light was coming from a world without immense images multiform and intricate began to crowd with the slowness of creation itself upon the glaring splendour then doubtless to permit the removal of the guarded captives the retarding ray was switched off and chandon recovered his normal powers of cognition and movement he beheld an awesome vision through the clear wall whose transparence was perhaps due to the complete turningoff of the vessels motivepower he saw that the vessel was reposing in a diamondshaped area surrounded with architectural piles whom very magnitude imposed itself like an irremovable weight upon his senses far up in a fiery orange sky he saw the looming of bulbous atlantean pillars with platform capitals the thronging of strange cruciform towers he viewed with amazement the eerie wonder of unnatural cupolas that were like inverted pyramids he saw the spiral pinnacles that seemed to support an unbelievable burden of terraces the slanting walls like fluted mountainscarps that formed the base of imagineless cumuli all were wrought of some shining nightblack stone like a marble quarried from an ultracosmic erebus they interposed their heavy lowering malignant masses between chandon and the flames of a hidden sun that was incomparably more brilliant than our own blinded by the glare and dizzied by those lofty piles aware also of queer heaviness in all his bodily sensations doubtless due to an increased gravity the earthman turned his attention to the foreground the diamond area he now saw was thronged with people similar to the crew of the timevessel like giant silvery globularbodied insects they came hurrying from all directions on the dark pavement arranged in a ring about the vessel were colossal mounted mirrors of the same type that had emitted the retarding ray the gathering people stopped at some little distance leaving a clear space between the raymachines and the ship as if for the landing of the crew and captives now as if in response to some hidden mechanism a huge circular door was opened in the seamless wall the folded crane began to lengthen and covered one of the timeless beings with itsmesh of tentacles then the mysterious entity still quiet and unresisting was lifted through the aperture and deposited on the pavement outside the arm returned and repeated this procedure with the second figure which in the meanwhile had apparently realized the cessation of the retarding beam and was less submissive than its fellow had been it offered a rather tentative resistance and began to swell as the tentacles enfolded it and to put forth pseudopodic members and fingerlike rays that plucked gently at the tightening mesh however in a few moments the second being had joined its companion in the world without at the same time a startling change had begun to manifest itself in the third figure chandon felt as if he were present at the epiphany of some aeonveiled and secluded god revealing himself in his true likeness from the molten chrysalis of matter the transformation that occurred was as if some chill stalagmite should bureon forth in a thousandfeatured shape of cloud and fire in one apocalyptic moment the thing seemed to expand to rush upwards to change its entire substance to develop organs and attributes such as could belong only to a supermaterial stage of evolution aeons of starlife of worldlife of the slow alchemy of atoms were abridged in that instant chandon could form no clear conception of what was happening the metamorphosis was too far beyond the normal interpretative range of human senses he saw something that towered before him fllling the vessel to its roof and pressing terribly against the curved transparent surface then with inestimable violence the entire vessel broke in a thousand flying glittering glasslike fragments that shrieked with the high thin note of tortured things as they hurtled and fell in all direc tions before the last fragments had fallen the timecylinder was caught and drawn upwards from the wreck as if by some mighty hand whether the looming giant had reached down with one of its nonhuman members or whether the cylinder had been lifted by magnetic force was never wholly clear to chandon all he could remember afterwards was the light aerial soaring in which he experienced a sudden and complete relief from the heavy gravitation of that unknown planet he seemed to float very swiftly to an elevation hard to estimate from the absence of familiar scale and then the cylinder came to rest on the cloudlike shoulder of the timeless one and clung there as securely as if it had landed on the shore of some faroff separate world aloof in space he was beyond awe or surprise or bewilderment as if in some cataclysmic dream he resigned himself to the unfolding of the swift miracle he peered out from his airy vantage and saw above him like the topmost crag of a lofty cumulus with stormy suns for eyes the head of the being who had shattered the alien timevessel and had risen above its ruins like a loosed and rebellious genie far down he beheld the black diamond area that swarmed with the silvery people then from the pavement there rushed heavenward like the pillared fomes of a monstrous explosion the mounting and waxing forms of the other timeless ones tumultuous awful cyclonic they rose beside the first to complete that rebel trinity yet vast and tall as they had grown the pylons around them were taller the terracebearing pinnades the topsyturvy pyramids the cruciform towers still frowned upon them from the glowing coalbright air like the dark colossal guardians of a transgalactic hell chandon was aware of a thousand impressions he felt the divine and limitless energies waked from eternal sleep that were flowering with such dynamic violence in time and he felt warring with these endeavouring to subdue and constrain them the jarring radiations and malignly concentred powers of the new world the very light was inimical and tyrannous in its fiery beating the blackness of the lowering domes and peristyles was like the crushing fall of a thousand muted maces swung by sullen cruel silent anakim the lensmachines on the pavement revolving glared upwards like the eyes of boreal cyclops and turned their frosted beams on the cloudy giants at intervals the sky lightened with a whitehot flaring like the reflex of a million remote furnaces and chandon was aware of surly infrabass reverberant belltoned clangours of drumnotes loud as beaten worlds that impinged upon him from all quarters of the throbbing air the environing piles appeared to darken as if they had gathered to themselves a more evil and positive ebon and were raying it forth to stupefy the senses but beyond this beyond all physical perceptions chandon felt the black magnetism that surged in neverceasing waves that clamoured before the barriers of his will that sought to usurp his mind to wrest and shape his very thoughts into forms of monstrous thralldom wordless and conveyed in thronging images of terrible strangeness he caught the biddings of inhuman bane of transtellary hatred the very stones of the massive buildings were joined with the brains of that exotic people in an effort to resume centrol of chandon and the three timeless ones darkly the earthman understood he must not only submit to the silvery beings he must do their will in all things he and his companions had been brought from eternity for a purpose to aid their captors in some stupendous war with a rival people of the same world even as mankind employs in warfare explosives of titanic potency the silver creatures had desired to employ the timeloosed energies of the eternal ones against their otherwise equally matched foes they had known the route through secret dimensions from time into timelessness with wellnigh demoniac audacity they had planned and executed the weird abduction and they had assumed that chandon was one of the eternal entities with latencies of immense –πlan and godlike power the waves of evil monition rose ever higher chandon felt himself inundated swamped with televisic clearness there grew in his mind a picture of the foe against whom he was being adjured to go forth he saw the glaring perspectives of remote unearthly lands the mightily swarming piles of unhuman cities lying beneath an incandescent sun that was vaster than antares for a moment he felt himself hating these lands and cities with the cold imagineless rancour of an otherworld psychology then as if he had been lifted above it by the giant upon whose shoulder he rode chandon knew that the black sea was no longer beating upon him he was free from the clutching mesmerism he could no longer conceive the alien emotions and pictures that had invaded his mind miraculous ease and sublime security enveloped him he was the centre of a sphere of resistant and resilient force which nothing could subdue or penetrate sitting as if on a mountain throne he saw that the demiurgic triad contemptuous and defiant of the pygmies beneath had resumed their magic growth and shooting upwards to attain and surpass the level of the topmost piles a moment more and he peered across the babelian tiers of sullen stone crowded with the silver people and saw the outer avenues of a mammoth metropolis and beyond these the farflung horizons of the unnamed planet he seemed to know the thoughts of the timeless ones as they looked forth on this world whose impious people had dreamt to enslave their illimitible essence he knew that they saw and comprehended it all in a glance he felt them pause in momentary curiosity and felt the swift relentless anger the irrevocable decision that followed then very tentatively and deliberately as if they were testing their untried powers the three beings began to destroy the city from the head of chandons white supernal bearer there issued a circle of ruby flame to detach itself to spin and broaden in a great wheel as it slanted down and settled on one of the higher piles beneath that burning crown the unnaturalangled domes and inverse pyramids began to quiver and seemed to expand like a dark vapour they lost their solid outlines they lightened they took on the patterns of shaken sand they shuddered skyward in rhythmic circles of sombre deathly iris paling and vanishing upon the intolerable glare from the timeless ones there emanated the visible and invisible agencies of annihilation slowly at first and then with cyclonic acceleration as if their anger were mounting or they were becoming more engrossed in the awful and godlike game from out their celestial bodies as from high crags there leaped living rivers and raging cataracts of energy there descended bolts orbs ellipsoid wheels of white or varicoloured fire to fall on the doomed city like a rain of ravening meteors the builded cumuli dissolved into molten slag the columns and piled terraces passed in driven wraiths of steam under the burning tempest the city ran in swift torrents of lava it quivered away in spirals of spectral dust it rose in black flames in sullem auroras over its ruins there moved the eternal ones clearing for themselves an instant way behind them in the black and cleanswept levels whereon they had trodden foci of dissolution appeared and the very soil and stone dissolved in everspinning widening vortices that ate the surface of the planet and bored down upon its core as if they had taken into their own substance the molecules and electrons of all that they had destroyed the eternal ones grew ever taller and vaster chandon beheld it all from his fantastic aerie with supernal remoteness and detachment in a moving zone of inviolate peace he saw the fiery rain that consumed the ultragalactic sodom he saw the belts of devastation that ran and radiated broadening ever to the four quarters he peered from an everloftier height upon vast horizons that fled as in reeling terror before the timeless giants faster and faster played the lethal orbs and beams they spawned in midair they gave birth to countless others they were sown abroad like the dragons teeth of fable to follow the longitudes of the great planet to its poles the stricken city was soon left behind and the giants marched on monstrous seas and deserts on broad plains and high mountainwalls where other cities shone far down like littered pebbles there were tides of atomic fire that went before to wash down the prodigious alps there were vengeful flying globes that turned the seas into instant vapour that smote the deserts to molten stormy oceans there were arcs circles quadrilaterals of annihilation growing always that sank downwards through the basic stone the firebright noon was muffled with chaotic murk a bloody cyclops a red laocoon battling with serpentcoils of cloud and shadow the mighty sun seemed to stagger in midheaven to rush dizzily to and fro as the world reeled beneath that intolerable trampling of macrocosmic titans the lands below were veiled by mephitic fumes riven momentarily to disclose the heaving and foundering continents now to that stupendous chaos the very elements of the doomed world were adding their unleashed energies clouds that were black himalayas with realmwide lightning followed behind the destroyers the ground crumbled to release the central fires in volcauic geysers in skywardflowing cataracts the seas ebbed revealing dismal peaks and longsubmerged ruins as they roared in their nether channels to be sucked down through earthquakeriven beds to feed the boiling cauldrons of internal disruption the air went mad with thunders as of typhon breaking forth from his underworld dungeon with roaring as of spiretongued fires in the red pits of a crumbling inferno with moaning and whining as of djinns trapped by the fall of mountains in some unscalable abyss with howling as of frantic demons loosed from primordial tombs above the tumult higher and higher chandon was borne till he looked down from the calm altitude of ether till he gazed from a sunlike vantage upon the seething and shattered orb and saw the huge sun itself from an equal height in space the cataclysmic moan the mad thunder seemed to die away the seas of catastrophic ruin eddied like a shallow backwash about the feet of the timeless ones the furious alldevouring maelstroms were no more than some ephemeral puff of dust stirred by the casual step of a passerby then beneath him there was no longer the nebulous wrack of a world the being upon whose shoulder he still clung like an atom to some planetary parapet was striding through cosmic emptiness and spurned by its departure the ruinous ball was flung abysswards after the receding sun around which it had revolved with all its vanished enigmas of alien life and civilization dimly the earthman saw the inconceivable vastness to which the eternal ones had attained he beheld their glimmering outlines the vague masses of their forms with stars behind them seen as through the luminous veil of comets he was perched on a nebular thing huge as the orbit of systems and moving with more than the velocity of light that strode through unnamed galaxies through nevercharted dimensions of space and time he felt the immeasurable eddying of ether he saw the labyrinthine swirling of stars that formed and faded and were replaced by the fleeing patterns of other stellar mazes in sublime security in his sphere of dreamlike ease and motion chandon was borne on without knowing why or whither and like the participant of some prodigious dream he did not even ask himself such questions as these after infinities of dying light of whirling and falling emptiness after the transit of many skies of unnumbered systems there came to him the sense of a sudden pause for one moment from the still gulf he gazed on a tiny sun with its entourage of nine planets and wondered vaguely if the sun were some familiar astronomic body then with ineffable lightness and velocity it seemed to him that he was falling towards one of the nearer worlds the blurred and broadening mass of its seas and continents surged up to meet him he seemed to descend meteorlike on a region of rough mountains sharp with snowy pinnacles that rose above sombre spires of pine there as if he had been deposited by some allmighty hand the cylinder came to rest and chandon peered out with the eerie startlement of an awakened dreamer to see around him the walls of his own sierran laboratory the timeless ones omniscient by some benignant whim had returned him to
