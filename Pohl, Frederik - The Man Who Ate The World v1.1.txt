he had a name but at home he was called sonny and he was almost always at home he hated it other boys his age went to school sonny would have done anything to go to school but his family was to put it mildly not well off it was not sonnys fault that his father was so unsuccessful but it meant no school for sonny no boys of his own age for sonny to play with all childhoods are tragic but sonnys was misery all the way through the worst time was at night when the baby sister was asleep and the parents were grimly eating and reading and dancing and drinking until they were ready to drop and of all bad nights the night before his twelfth birthday was perhaps sonnys worst he was old enough to know what a birthday party was like it would be cake and candy shows and games it would be presents presents presents it would be a terrible endless day he switched off the colord television and the recorded tapes of sea chanteys and with an appearance of absentmindedness walked toward the door of his playroom davey crockett got up from beside the model rocket field and said hold on thar sonny mought take a stroll with you davey with a face as serene and strong as a tennessee crag swung its long huntin rifle under one arm and put its other arm around sonnys shoulders where you reckon the two of us ought to head sonny shook davey crocketts arm off get lost he said petulantly who wants you around long john silver came out of the closet hobbling on its wooden leg crouched over its knobby cane ah young master it said reproachfully you shouldnt ought to talk to old davey like that hes a good friend to you davey is manys the weary day davey and me has been akeepin of your company i asks you this young master is it fair and square that you should be atellin him to get lost is it fair young master is it square sonny looked at the floor stubbornly and didnt answer what was the use of answering dummies like them he stood rebelliously silent and still until he just felt like saying something and then he said you go in the closet both of you i dont want to play with you im going to play with my trains long john said unctuously now theres a good idea that is you just be ahavin of a good time with your trains and old davey and mell go ahead shouted sonny he kept stamping his foot until they were out of sight his fire truck was in the middle of the floor he kicked at it but it rolled quickly out of reach and slid into its little garage under the tanks of tropical fish he scuffed over to the model railroad layout and glared at it as he approached the twentieth century limited came roaring out of a tunnel sparks flying from its stack it crossed a bridge whistled at a grade crossing steamed into the union station the roof of the station glowed and suddenly became transparent and through it sonny saw the bustling crowds of redcaps and travelers i dont want that he said casey crack up old number ninetynine again obediently the layout quivered and revolved a halfturn old casey jones one and an eighth inches tall leaned out of the cab of the sp locomotive and waved goodby to sonny the locomotive whistled shrilly twice and picked up speed it was a good crackup little old caseys body thrown completely free developed real blisters from the steam and bled real blood but sonny turned his back on it he had liked that crackup for a long timelonger than he liked almost any other toy he owned but he was tired of it he looked around the room tarzan of the apes leaning against a footthick tree trunk one hand on a vine lifted its head and looked at him but tarzan was clear across the room the others were in the closet sonny ran out and slammed the door he saw tarzan start to come after him but even before sonny was out of the room tarzan slumped and stood stockstill it wasnt fair sonny thought angrily they wouldnt even chase him so that at least he could have some kind of chance to get away by himself theyd just talk to each other on their little radios and in a minute one of the tutors or one of the maids or whatever else happened to be handy would vector in on him but for the moment he was free he slowed down and walked along the great hall toward his baby sisters room the fountains began to splash as he entered the hall the mosaics on the wall began to tinkle music and sparkle with moving colors now chile whut you up to he turned around but he knew it was mammy coming toward him it was slapping toward him on big flat feet its pinkpalmed hands lifted to its shoulders the face under the red bandanna was frowning its gold tooth sparkling as mammy scolded chile you is got usns so worried wes fit to die how you speck us to take good keer of you efn you run off lak that now you jes come on back to your nice room with mammy an well see if there aint some real nice program on the tv sonny stopped and waited for it but he wouldnt give it the satisfaction of looking at it slapslap the big feet waddled cumbersomely toward him but he didnt have any illusions waddle big feet three hundred pounds and all mammy could catch him in twenty yards with a tenyard start any of them could he said in his best icily indignant voice i was just going in to look at my baby sister pause you was the plump black face looked suspicious yes i was doris is my own sister and i love her pauselong pause dats nice said mammy but its voice was still doubtful i speck i better come long with you you wouldnt want to wake your lil baby sister up ef i come ill hep you keep real quiet sonny shook free of it they were always putting their bands on kids i dont want you to come with me mammy aw now honey mammy aint gwine bother nothin you knows that sonny turned his back on it and marched grimly toward his sisters room if only they would leave him alone but they never did it was always that way always one darn old robotyes robot he thought savagely tasting the naughty word always one darn robot after another why couldnt daddy be like other daddies so they could live in a decent little house and get rid of those darn robotsso he could go to a real school and be in a class with other boys instead of being taught at home by miss brooks and mr chips and all those other robots they spoiled everything and they would spoil what he wanted to do now but he was going to do it all the same because there was something in doriss room that he wanted very much it was probably the only tangible thing he wanted in the world as he and mammy passed the imitation tumbled rocks of the bear cave mama bear poked its head out and growled hello sonny dont you think you ought to he in bed its nice and warm in our bear bed sonny he didnt even look at it time was when he had liked that sort of thing too but he wasnt a fouryearold like doris any more all the same there was one thing a fouryearold had he stopped at the door of her room doris he whispered mammy scolded now chile you knows that lil baby is asleep how come you tryin to wake her up i wont wake her up the furthest thing from sonnys mind was to wake his sister up he tiptoed into the room and stood beside the little girls bed lucky kidl he thought enviously being four she was allowed to have a tiny little room and a tiny bedwhile sonny had to wallow around in a fortyfoot bedchamber and a bed eight feet long he looked down at his sister behind him mammy clucked approvingly dats nice when chilluns loves each other lak you an that lil baby it whispered doris was sound asleep clutching her teddybear it wriggled slightly and opened an eye to look at sonny but it didnt say anything sonny took a deep breath leaned forward and gently slipped the teddybear out of the bed it scrambled pathetically trying to get free mammy whispered urgently sonnyl now you let dat old teddybear alone you heah me sonny whispered im not hurting anything leave me alone will you sonnyl he clutched the little furry robot desperately around its middle the stubby arms pawed at him the furred feet scratched against his arms it growled a tiny dollbear grow and whined and suddenly his hands were wet with its real salt tears sonnyl come on now honey you knows thats doriss teddy aw chile he said its mine it wasnt his he knew it wasnt his was long gone taken away from him when he was six because it was old and because he had been six and sixyear olds had to have bigger more elaborate companionrobots it wasnt even the same color as hisit was brown and his had been black and white but it was cuddly and gently warm and he had heard it whispering little bedtime stories to doris and he wanted it very much footsteps in the hall outside a lowpitched pleading voice from the door sonny you must not interfere with your sisters toys one has obligations he stood forlornly holding the teddybear go away mr chips really sonny this isnt proper behavior please return the toy i wont mammy dark face pleading in the shadowed room leaned toward him and tried to take it away from him aw honey now you know thats not leave me alone he shouted there was a gasp and a little whimper from the bed and doris sat up and began to cry the little girls bedroom was suddenly filled with robots and not only robots for in a moment the butler appeared leading sonnys actual fleshandblood mother and father sonny made a terrible scene he cried and he swore at them childishly for being the unsuccessful clods they were and they nearly wept too because they were aware that their lack of standing was bad for the children but he couldnt keep teddy they marched him back to his room where his father lectured him while his mother stayed behind to watch mammy comfort the little girl his father said sonny youre a big boy now we arent as well off as other people but you have to help us dont you know that sonny we all have to do our part your mother and ill he up till midnight now consuming because youve made this scene cant you at least try to consume something bigger than a teddybear its all right for doris because shes so little but a big boy like you i hate you cried sonny and he turned his face to the wall they punished him naturally the first punishment was that they give him an extra birthday party the week following the second punishment was even worse latermuch much later nearly a score of yearsa man named roger garrick in a place named fishermans island walked into his hotel room the light didnt go on the bellhop apologized were sorry sir well have it attended to if possible if possible garricks eyebrows went up the bellhop made putting in a new light tube sound like a major industrial operation all right he waved the bellhop out of the room it bowed and closed the door garrick looked around him frowning one light tube more or less didnt make a lot of difference there was still the light from the sconces at the walls from the reading lamps at the chairs and chaiselongue and from the photomural on the long side of the roomto say nothing of the fact that it was broad hot daylight outside and light poured through the windows all the same it was a new sensation to be in a room where the central lighting wasnt on he didnt like it it wascreepy a rap on the door a girl was standing there young attractive rather small but a woman grown it was apparent mr garrick mr roosenburg is expecting you on the sun deck all right he rummaged around in the pile of luggage looking for his briefcase it wasnt even sorted out the bellhop had merely dumped the stuff and left the girl said is that what youre looking for he looked where she was pointing it was his briefcase behind another bag youll get used to that around here nothing in the right place nothing working right weve all gotten used to it we he looked at her sharply but she was no robot there was life not the glow of electronic tubes in her eyes pretty bad is it she shrugged lets go see mr roosenburg im kathryn pender by the way im his statistician he followed her out into the hall statistician did you say she turned and smileda tight grim smile of annoyance thats right surprised garrick said uneasily well its more a robot job of course im not familiar with the practice in this sector you will be she promised bluntly no we arent taking the elevator mr roosenburgs in a hurry to see you but she actually glared at him dont you understand day before yesterday i took the elevator and i was hung up between floors for an hour and a half something was going on at north guardian and it took all the power in the lines would it happen again today i dont know but believe me an hour and a half is a long time to be stuck in an elevator she turned and led him to the fire stairs over her shoulder she said get it straight once and for all mr garrick youre in a disaster area here anyway its only ten more flights ten flights nobody climbed ten flights of stairs any morel garrick was buffing and puffing before they were half way but the girl kept on ahead light as a gazelle her skirt reached between hip and knees and garrick had plenty of opportunity to observe that her legs were attractively tanned even so he couldnt help looking around him it was a robotseye view of the hotel that he was getting this was the bare wire armature that held up the confectionery suites and halls where the humans went garrick knew as everyone absently knew that there were places like this behind the scenes everywhere below stairs the robots worked behind scenes they moved about their errands and did their jobs but nobody went there it was funny about the backs of this girls knees they were paler than the rest of the leg garrick wrenched his mind back to his surroundings take the guard rail along the steps for instance it was wirethin fraillooking no doubt it could bear any weight it was required to but why couldnt it look that strong the answer obviously was that robots did not have humanitys builtin concepts of how strong a rail should look before they could believe it really was strong if a robot should be in any doubtand how improbable that a robot should be in doubtit would perhaps reach out a sculptured hand and test it once and then it would remember and never doubt again and it wouldnt be continually edging toward the wall away from the spiderstrand between it and the vertical drop he conscientiously took the middle of the steps all the rest of the way up of course that merely meant a different distraction when he really wanted to do some thinking but it was a pleasurable distraction and by the time they reached the top he had solved the problem the pale spots at the back of miss penders knees meant she had got her tan the hard way walking in the sun perhaps working in the sun so that the bending knees kept the sun from the patches at the back not as anyone else would acquire a tan by lying beneath a normal healthful sunlamp held by a robot masseur he wheezed you dont mean were all the way up all the way up she said and looked at him closely here lean on me if you want to no thanks he staggered over to the door which opened naturally enough as he approached it and stepped out into the flood of sunlight on the roof to meet mr roosenburg garrick wasnt a medical doctor but he remembered enough of his basic prespecialization to know there was something in that fizzy golden drink it tasted perfectly splendidjust cold enough just fizzy enough not quite too sweet and after two sips of it he was buoyant with strength and wellbeing he put the glass down and said thank you for whatever it was now lets talk gladly gladly boomed mr roosenburg kathryn the files garrick looked after her shaking his head not only was she a statistician which was robot work she was also a file clerkand that was barely robot work it was the kind of thing handled by a semisentient punchcard sorter in a decently run sector roosenburg said sharply shocks you doesnt it but thats why youre here he was a slim fair little man and he wore a golden beard cropped square garrick took another sip of the fizzy drink it was good stuff it didnt intoxicate but it cheered he said im glad to know why im here the golden beard quivered area control sent you down and didnt tell you this was a disaster area garrick put down the glass im a psychist area control said you needed a psychist from what ive seen its a supply problem but here are the files said kathryn pender and stood watching him roosenburg took the spools of tape from her and dropped them in his lap he asked tangentially how old are you roger garrick was annoyed im a qualified psychist i happen to be assigned to area control and how old are you garrick scowled twentyfour roosenburg nodded um rather young he observed maybe you dont remember how things used to be garrick said dangerously all the information i need is on that tape i dont need any lectures from you roosenburg pursed his lips and got up come here a minute will you he moved over to the rail of the sun deck and pointed see those things down there garrick looked twenty stories down the village straggled off toward the sea in a tangle of pastel oblongs and towers over the bay the hills of the mainland were faintly visible through mist and riding the bay the flat white floats of the solar receptors its a power plant that what you mean roosenburg boomed a power plant all the power the world can ever use out of this one and all the others all over the world he peered out at the bobbing floats soaking up energy from the sun and people used to try to wreck them he added garrick said stiffly i may only be twentyfour years old mr roosenburg but i have completed school oh yes of course you have roger but maybe schooling isnt the same thing as living through a time like that i grew up in the era of plenty when the law was consumel my parents were poor and i still remember the misery of my childhood eat and consume wear and use i never had a moments peace roger for the very poor it was a treadmill we had to consume so much that we could never catch up and the further we fell behind the more the ration board forced on us thats ancient history mr roosenburg morey fry liberated us from all that the girl said softly not all of us the man with the golden beard nodded not all of us as you should know roger being a psychist garrick sat up straight and roosenburg went on fry showed us that the robots could help at both endsby producing and by consuming but it came a little late for some of us the patterns of childhood do linger on kathryn pender leaned toward garrick what hes trying to say mr garrick is that weve got a compulsive consumer on our hands north guardian islandnine miles away it wasnt as much as a mile wide and not much more than that in length but it had its city and its bathing beaches its parks and theaters it was possibly the most densely populated island in the world for the number of its inhabitants the president of the council convened their afternoon meeting in a large and lavish room there were nineteen councilmen around a lustrous mahogany table over the presidents shoulder the others could see the situation map of north guardian and the areas surrounding north guardian glowed blue cold impregnable the sea was misty green the mainland fishermans island south guardian and the rest of the little archipelago were hot hostile red little flickering fingers of red attacked the blue flick and a ruddy flame wiped out a corner of a beach flick and a red spark appeared in the middle of the city to grow and blossom and then to die each little red whipflick was a point where momentarily the defenses of the island were down but always and always the cool blue brightened around the red and drowned it the president was tall stooped old it wore glasses though robot eyes saw well enough without it said in a voice that throbbed with power and pride the first item of the order of business will be a report of the defense secretary the defense secretary rose to its feet booked a thumb in its vest and cleared its throat mr president excuse me sir a whisper from the sweetfaced young blonde taking down the minutes of the meeting mr trumie has just left bowling green heading north the whole council turned to glance at the situation map where bowling green had just flared red the president nodded stiffly like the crown of an old redwood nodding you may proceed mr secretary it said after a moment our invasion fleet began the secretary in its high clear voice is ready for sailing on the first suitable tide certain units have been ah inactivated at the ah instigation of mr trumie but on the whole repairs have been completed and the units will be serviceable within the next few hours its lean attractive face turned solemn i am afraid however that the air command has sustained certain ah increments of attritiondue i should emphasize to chances involved in certain calculated risks question question it was the commissioner of public safety small dark fireeyed angry mr commissioner the president began but it was interrupted again by the soft whisper of the recording stenographer listening intently to the earphones that brought news from outside mr president it whispered mr trumie has passed the navy yard the robots turned to look at the situation map bowling green though it smoldered in spots had mostly gone back to blue but the jagged oblong of the yard flared red and bright there was a faint electronic hum in the air almost a sigh the robots turned back to face each other mr president i demand that the defense secretary explain the loss of the graf zeppelin and the th bomb group the defense secretary nodded to the commissioner of public safety mr trumic threw them away it said sorrowfully once again that sighing electronic drone from the assembled robots the council fussed and fiddled with its papers while the situation map on the wall flared and dwindled flared and dwindled the defense secretary cleared its throat again mr president there is no question that the ah absence of an effective air component will seriously hamper not to say endanger our prospects of a suitable landing neverthelessand i say this mr president in full knowledge of the conclusions that mayindeed shouldbe drawn from such a statement nevertheless mr president i say that our forward elements will successfully complete an assault landing mr president the breathless whisper of the blonde stenographer again mr president mr trumie is in the building on the situation map behind it the pentagonthe building they were inflared scarlet the attorney general nearest the door leaped to its feet mr president i hear him and they could all hear now far off down the long corridors a crash a faint explosion and another crash and a raging querulous highpitched voice a nearer crash and a sustained smashing banging sound coming toward them the oakpaneled doors flew open with a crash splintering a tall dark male figure in gray leather jacket rocketgun holsters swinging at its hips stepped through the splintered doors and stood surveying the council its hands hung just below the butts of the rocket guns it drawled mistuh anderson trumie it stepped aside another male figureshorter darker hobbling with the aid of a stainless steel cane that concealed a raypencil wearing the same gray leather jacket and the same rocketgun holstersentered stood for a moment and took position on the other side of the door between them mr anderson trumie shambled ponderously into the council chamber to call on his council sonny trumie come of age he wasnt much more than five feet tall but his weight was close to four hundred pounds he stood there in the door leaning against the splintered oak quivering jowls obliterating his neck his eyes nearly swallowed in the fat that swamped his skull his thick legs trembling as they tried to support him youre all under arrest he screeched traitors traitors he panted ferociously glowering at them they waited with bowed heads beyond the ring of councilmen the situation map slowly blotted out the patches of red as the repair robots worked feverishly to fix what sonny trumie had destroyed mr crockett sonny cried shrilly slay me these traitors wheepwheep and the guns whistled out of their holsters into the tall bodyguards hands ratatattat and two by two the nineteen councilmen leaped clutched at air and fell as the rocket pellets pierced them through that one tool mr trumie pointed at the sweetfaced blonde bang the sweet young face convulsed and froze it fell slumping across its little table on the wall the situation map flared red again but only faintlyfor what were twenty robots sonny gestured curtly to his other bodyguard it leaped forward tucking the stainless steel cane under one arm putting the other around the larded shoulders of sonny trumie ah now young master it crooned you just get ahold o long johns arm now get them fixed sonny ordered abruptly he pushed the president of the council out of its chair and with the robots help sank into it himself get them fixed right you hear ive had enough traitors i want them to do what i tell them sartin sure young master long johnll be pleased to do it now and you davey i want my lunch reckoned you would mistuh trumie its right hyar the crockett robot kicked the fallen councilmen out of the way as a procession of waiters filed in from the corridor sonny ate he ate until eating was pain and then he sat there sobbing his arms braced against the tabletop until he could eat more the crockett robot said worriedly mistuh trumie moughtnt you rear back a mite old doc aeschylus he dont hold with you eatin too much you know i hate doc trumie said bitterly he pushed the plates off the table they fell with a rattle and a clatter and they went spinning away as he heaved himself up and lurched alone over to the window i hate doc he brayed again sobbing staring through tears out the window at his kingdom with its hurrying throngs and marching troops and roaring waterfront the tallow shoulders tried to shake with pain he felt as though hot cinderblocks were being thrust down his throat the ragged edges cutting the hot weight crushing take me back he wept to the robots take me away from these traitors take me to my private place as you see said roosenburg hes dangerous garrick looked out over the water toward north guardian id better look at his tapes he said the girl swiftly picked up the reels and began to thread them into the projector dangerous this trumie indeed was dangerous garrick conceded dangerous to the balanced stable world for it only took one trumie to topple its stability it had taken thousands and thousands of years for society to learn its delicate tightrope walk it was a matter for a psychist all right and garrick was uncomfortably aware that he was only twentyfour here you are said the girl look them over roosenburg suggested then after youve studied the tapes on trumie weve got something else one of his robots but youll need the tapes first lets go said garrick the girl flicked a switch and the life of anderson trumie appeared before them in color in three dimensionsin miniature robots have eyes and where the robots go the eyes of robot central go with them and the robots go everywhere from the stored files of robot central came the spool of tape that was the frightful life story of sonny trumie the tapes played into the globeshaped viewer ten inches high a crystal ball that looked back into the past first from the recording eyes of the robots in sonny trumies nursery the lonely little boy twenty years before lost in the enormous nursery disgusting breathed kathryn pender wrinkling her nose how could people live like that carrick said please let me watch this its important in the gleaming globe the little boy kicked at his toys threw himself across his huge bed sobbed garrick squinted frowned reached out tried to make contact it was hard the tapes showed the objective facts but for a psychist it was the subjective reality behind the facts that mattered kicking at his toys yes but why because he was tired of themand why was he tired because he feared them kicking at his toys becausebecause they were the wrong toys kickinghate them dont want them want a bluish flare in the viewing globe garrick blinked and jumped and that was the end of that section the colors flowed and suddenly jelled into bright life garrick recognized the scene after a momentit was right there in fishermans island some pleasure spot overlooking the water a bar and at the end of it was anderson trumie at twenty staring somberly into an empty glass the view was through the eyes of the robot bartender anderson trumie was weeping once again there was the objective factbut the fact behind the fact what was it trumie had been drinking drinking why drinking drinking with a sudden sense of shock carrick saw what the drink wasthe golden fizzy liquor not intoxicating not habitforming trumie had become no drunk it was something else that kept him drinking drinking must drink must keep on drinking or else and again the bluish flare there was more trumie feverishly collecting objects of art trumie decorating a palace trumie on a world tour and trumie returned to fishermans island and then there was no more that said roosenburg is the file of course if you want the raw unedited tapes we can try to get them from robot central but no the way things were it was best to stay away from robot central there might be more breakdowns and there wasnt much time besides something was beginning to suggest itself run the first one again said carrick i think maybe ill find something there garrick made out a quick requisition slip and handed it to kathryn pender who looked at it raised her eyebrows shrugged and went off to have it filled by the time she came back roosenburg had escorted garrick to the room where the captured trumie robot lay chained hes cut off from robot central roosenburg was saying i suppose you figured that out imagine not only has trumie built a whole city for himselfbut even his own robot central garrick looked at the robot it was a fisherman or so roosenburg had said it was small dark blackhaired possibly the hair would have been curly if the sea water hadnt plastered the curls to the scalp it was still damp from the tussle that had landed it in the water and eventually into roosenburgs hands roosenburg was already at work garrick tried to think of the robot as a machine but it wasnt easy the thing looked very nearly humanexcept for the crystal and copper that showed where the back of its head had been removed its as bad as a brain operation said roosenburg working rapidly without looking up ive got to short out the input leads without disturbing the electronic balance snip snip a curl of copper fell free to be grabbed by roosenburgs tweezers the fishermans arms and legs kicked sharply like a dissected galvanized frogs kathryn pender said they found him this morning casting nets into the bay and singing sole mio hes from north guardian all right abruptly the lights flickered and turned yellow then slowly returned to normal brightness roger garrick got up and walked over to the window north guardian was a haze of light in the sky across the water click snap the fisherman robot began to sing tutte le serre dopo quel fanal dietro la caserma ti staro ed click roosenburg muttered under his breath and probed further kathryn pender joined garrick at the window now you see she said garrick shrugged you cant blame him i blame him i she said hotly ive lived here all my life fishermans island used to be a tourist spotwhy it was lovely here and look at it now the elevators dont work the lights dont work practically all of our robots are gone spare parts construction material everythingits all gone to north guardian there isnt a day that passes garrick when half a dozen bargeloads of stuff dont go north because he requisitioned them blame him id like to kill him snap sputtersnap the fisherman lifted its head and caroled forse dommani piangerai e dopo tu sorriderai roosenburgs probe uncovered a flat black disc kathryn look this up will you he read the serial number from the disc and then put down the probe he stood flexing his fingers looking irritably at the motionless figure garrick joined him roosenburg jerked his head at the fisherman thats robot repair work trying to tinker with their insides trumie has his own robot central as i told you what i have to do is recontrol this one from the substation on the mainland but keep its receptor circuits open to north guardian on the symbolic level you understand what im talking about itll think from north guardian but act from the mainland sure said garrick and its damned close work there isnt much room inside one of those things he stared at the figure and picked up the probe again kathryn pender came back with a punchcard in her hand it was one of ours all right used to be a busboy in the cafeteria at the beach club she scowled that trumie you cant blame him garrick said reasonably hes only trying to be good she looked at him queerly hes only roosenburg interrupted with an exultant cry got it okay yousit up and start telling us what trumies up to now the fisherman figure said obligingly yes boss what you wanna know what they wanted to know they asked and what they asked it told them volunteering nothing concealing nothing there was anderson trumie king of his island the compulsive consumer it was like an echo of the bad old days of the age of plenty when the world was smothering under the endless pounding flow of goods from the robot factories and the desperate race between consumption and production strained the whole society but trumies orders came not from society but from within consumel commanded something inside him and use it cried and devour it ordered and trumie obeyed heroically they listened to what the fisherman robot had to say and the picture was dark armies had sprung up on north guardian navies floated in its waters anderson trumie stalked among his creations like a blubbery god wrecking and ruling garrick could see the pattern in what the fisherman had to say in trumies mind he was dictator building a war machine he was supreme engineer constructing a mighty state he was warrior he was playing tin soldiers said roger garrick and roosenburg and the girl nodded the trouble is roosenburg said he has stopped playing invasion fleets garrick he isnt content with north guardian any more he wants the rest of the country too you cant blame him said roger garrick for the third time and stood up the question is what do we do about it thats what youre here for kathryn told him all right we can forget about the soldiersas soldiers that is they wont hurt anyone robots cant i know that kathryn snapped the problem is what to do about trumies drain on the worlds resources garrick pursed his lips according to my directive from area control the first plan was to let him alonethere is still plenty of everything for anyone so why not let trumie enjoy himself but that didnt work out too well didnt work out too well repeated kathryn pender bitterly no nonot on your local level garrick explained quickly after all what are a few thousand robots a few hundred million dollars worth of equipment we could resupply this area in a week and in a week said roosenburg trumie would have us cleaned out again thats the trouble garrick declared he doesnt seem to have a stopping point yet we cant refuse his orders speaking as a psychist that would set a very bad precedent it would put ideas in the minds of a lot of personsminds that in some cases might not prove stable in the absence of a completely reliable source of everything they need on request if we say no to trumie we open the door on some mighty dark corners of the human mind covetousness greed pride of possession so what are you going to do demanded kathryn pender garrick said resentfully the only thing there is to do im going to look over trumies folder again and then im going to north guardian island roger garrick was all too aware of the fact that he was only twentyfour but his age couldnt make a great deal of difference the oldest and wisest psychist in area controls wide sphere might have been doubtful of success in as thorny a job as the one ahead he and kathryn pender warily started out at daybreak vapor was rising from the sea about them and the little batterymotor of their launch whined softly beneath the keelson garrick sat patting the little box that contained their invasion equipment while the girl steered me workshops of fishermans island had been all night making some of the things in that boxnot because they were so difficult to make but because it had been a bad night big things were going on at north guardian twice the power had been out entirely for an hour while the demand on the lines from north guardian took all the power the system could deliver the sun was well up as they came within hailing distance of the navy yard robots were hard at work the yard was bustling with activity an overhead traveling crane eight feet tall laboriously lowered a prefabricated fighting top onto an elevenfoot aircraft carrier a motor torpedo boatfullsized this one was not to scale rocked at anchor just before the bow of their launch kathryn steered around it ignoring the hail from the robot lieutenantjg at its rail she glanced at garrick over her shoulder her face taut itsits all mixed up garrick nodded the battleships were modelsized the small boats full scale in the city beyond the yard the pinnacle of the empire state building barely cleared the pentagon right next door a soaring suspension bridge leaped out from the shore a quarter of a mile away and stopped short a thousand yards out over empty water it was easy to understandeven for a psychist just out of school on his first real assignment trumie was trying to run a world singlehanded and where there were gaps in his conception of what his world should be the results showed get me battleships he ordered his robot supply clerks and they found the only battleships there were in the world to copy the childsized toyscaled play battleships that still delighted kids get me an air force and a thousand model bombers were hastily put together build me a bridge but perhaps he had forgotten to say to where garrick shook his head and focused on the world around him kathryn pender was standing on a gray steel stage the mooring line from their launch secured to what looked like a coast defense cannonbut only about four feet long garrick picked up the little box and leaped up to the stage beside her she turned to look at the city hold on a second he was opening the box taking out two little cardboard placards he turned her by the shoulder and with pins from the box attached one of the cards to her back now me he said turning his back to her she read the placard dubiously i am a spy garrick she said youre sure you know what youre doing put it on she shrugged and pinned it to the back of his jacket side by side they entered the citadel of the enemy according to the fisherman robot trumie lived in a gingerbread castle south of the pentagon most of the robots got no chance to enter it the city outside the castle was trumies kingdom and he roamed about it overseeing changing destroying rebuilding but inside the castle was his private place the only robots that had both an inside and outsidethecastle existence were the two bodyguards of his youth davey crockett and long john silver that said carrick must be the private place it was decidedly a gingerbread castle the gingerbread was stonework gargoyles and columns there were a moat and a drawbridge and there were robot guards with crooked little rifles wearing scarlet tunics and fur shakos three feet tall the drawbridge was up and the guards stood at stiff attention lets reconnoiter said carrick he was unpleasantly conscious of the fact that every robot they passedand they bad passed thousandshad turned to look at the signs on their backs yet it was right wasnt it there was no hope of avoiding observation in any event the only hope was to fit somehow into the patternand spies would certainly be a part of the military pattern wouldnt they garrick turned his back on doubts and led the way around the gingerbread palace the only entrance was the drawbridge they stopped out of sight of the ramrodstiff guards carrick said well go in as soon as we get inside you put on your costume he handed her the box you know what to do all you have to do is keep him quiet for a while and let me talk to him carrick will this work garrick exploded how the devil do i know i had trumies dossier to work with i know everything that happened to him when he was a kidwhen this trouble started but to reach him takes a long time kathryn and we dont have a long time so he took her elbow and marched her toward the guards so you know what to do he said i hope so breathed kathryn pender looking very small and very young they marched down the wide white pavement past the motionless guards something was coming toward them kathryn held back come on garrick muttered no look she whispered is thatis that trumie he looked then stared it was trumie larger than life it was anderson trumie the entire human population of the mostcongestedislandforitspopulation in the world on one side of him was a tall dark figure on the other side a squat dark figure helping him along his face was horror drowned in fat the bloated cheeks shook damply wet with tears the eyes squinted out with fright on the world he had made trumie and his bodyguards rolled up to them and past and then anderson trumie stopped he turned the blubbery head and read the sign on the back of the girl i am a spy panting heavily clutching the shoulder of the crockett robot be gaped wildly at her garrick cleared his throat this far his plan had gone and then there was a gap there had to be a gap trumies history in the folder that roosenburg had supplied had told him what to do with trumie and garricks own ingenuity had told him how to reach the man but a link was missing here was the subject and here was the psychist who could cure him and it was up to garrick to start the cure trumie cried out in a staccato bleat you what are you where do you belong he was talking to the girl beside him the crockett robot murmured reckon shes a spy mistuh trumie see thet sign ahangin on her back spy spy the quivering lips pouted curse you are you mata hari what are you doing out here its changed its face trumie complained to the crockett robot it doesnt belong here its supposed to be in the harem go on crockett get her back wait said garrick but the crockett robot was ahead of him it took kathryn pender by the arm come along thar it said soothingly and urged her across the drawbridge she glanced back at garrick and for a moment it looked as though she were going to speak then she shook her head as if giving an order kathryn yelled garrick trumie wait a minute that isnt mata hari no one was listening kathryn pender disappeared into the private place trumie leaning heavily on the hobbling long john silver robot followed garrick coming back to life leaped after them the scarletcoated guards jumped before him their shakos bobbing their crooked little rifles crossed to bar his way he ordered one side out of my way im a human dont you understand youve got to let me pass they didnt even look at him trying to get by them was like trying to walk through a wall of moving thrusting steel he shoved and they pushed him back he tried to dodge and they were before him it was hopeless and then it was hopeless indeed because behind them he saw the drawbridge had gone up sonny trumie collapsed into a chair like a mound of blubber falling to the deck of a whaler though he made no signal the procession of serving robots started at once in minced the maitre d bowing and waving its graceful hands in marched the sommelier clanking its necklace of keys hearing its wines in their buckets of ice in came the lovely waitress robots and the sturdy steward robots with the platters and tureens the plates and bowls and cups they spread a meala dozen mealsbefore him and he began to eat he ate as a penned pig eats gobbling until it chokes forcing the food down because there is nothing to do but eat he ate with a sighing accompaniment of moans and gasps and some of the food was salted with the tears of pain he wept into it and some of the wine was spilled by his shaking hand but he ate not for the first time that day and not for the tenth sonny trumie wept as he ate he no longer even knew he was weeping there was the gaping void inside him that he had to fill had to fill there was the gaping world about him that he had to people and build and furnish and use he moaned to himself four hundred pounds of meat and lard and he had to lug it from end to end of his island every hour of every day never resting never at peace there should have been a place somewhere there should have been a time when he could rest when he could sleep without dreaming sleep without waking after a scant few hours with the goading drive to eat and to use to use and to eat and it was all so wrong the robots didnt understand they didnt try to understand they didnt think for themselves let him take his eyes from any one of them for a single day and everything went wrong it was necessary to keep after them from end to end of the island checking and overseeing and ordering yes and destroying to rebuild over and over he moaned again and pushed the plate away he rested with his tallow forehead flat against the table waiting while inside him the pain ripped and ripped and finally became bearable again and slowly he pushed himself up and rested for a moment and pulled a fresh plate toward him and began again to eat after a while he stopped not because he didnt want to go on but because he absolutely couldnt he was bonetired but something was bothering himone more detail to check one more thing that was wrong mata hari the houri at the drawbridge it shouldnt have been out of the private place it should have been in the harem of course not that it mattered except to sonny trumies neverresting sense of what was right time was when the houris of the harem had their uses but that time was long and long ago now they were property to be fussed over and made to be right to be replaced if they were worn destroyed if they were wrong but only property as all of north guardian was propertyas all of the world would be his property if only he could manage it but property shouldnt be wrong he signaled to the crockett robot and leaning on it walked down the long terrazzo hall toward the harem he tried to remember what the houri had looked like the face didnt matter he was nearly sure it had changed it it had worn a sheer red blouse and a brief fed skirt he was almost certain but the face it had had a face of course but sonny had lost the habit of faces this one had been somehow different but he couldnt remember just why stillthe blouse and skirt were red he was nearly sure and it had been carrying something in a box and that was odd too he waddled a little faster for now he was positive it was wrong thars the harem mistuh trumic said the robot at his side it disengaged itself gently leaped forward and held the door to the harem for him wait for me sonny commanded and waddled forward into the harem halls once he had so arranged the harem that he needed no help inside it the halls were railed at a height where it was easy for a pudgy hand to grasp the rail the distances were short the rooms close together he paused and called over his shoulder stay where you can hear me it had occurred to him that if the houri robot was wrong he would need crocketts guns to make it right a chorus of female voices sprang into song as he entered the main patio they were a bevy of beauties clustered around a fountain diaphanously dressed languorously glancing at sonny trumie as he waddled inside shut up he shrieked go back to your rooms they bowed their heads and one by one slipped into the cubicles no sign of the red blouse and the red skirt he began the rounds of the cubicles panting peering into them hello sonny whispered theda bara lithe on a leopard rug and he passed on i love you cried nell gwynn and come to me commanded cleopatra but he passed them by he passed dubarry and marilyn monroe he passed moll flanders and he passed troys helen no sign of the houri in red yes there was he didnt see the houri but he saw the signs of the houris presence the red blouse and the red skirt lying limp and empty on the floor sonny gasped where are you come out here where i can see you nobody answered sonny come out he bawled and then he stopped a door opened and someone came out not an houri not female a figure without sex but loaded with love a teddybear figure as tall as pudgy sonny trumie himself waddling as he waddled its stubby welcoming arms stretched out to him he could hardly believe his eyes its color was a little darker than teddy it was a good deal taller than teddy but unquestionably undoubtedly in everything that mattered it was teddy whispered sonny trumie and let the furry arms go around his four hundred pounds twenty years disappeared they wouldnt let me have you sonny told the teddybear it said in a voice musical and warm its all right sonny you can have me now sonny you can have everything sonny they took you away he whispered remembering they took the teddybear away he had never forgotten they took it away and mother was wild and father was furious they raged at the little boy and scolded him and threatened him didnt he know they were poor and did he want to ruin them all and what was wrong with him anyway that he wanted his little sisters silly stuffed robots when he was big enough to use nearly grownup goods the night bad been a terror with the frowning sad robots ringed around and the little girl crying and what had made it terror was not the scoldinghed had scoldingsbut the worry the fear and almost the panic in his parents voices for what he did he came to understand was no longer a childish sin it was a big sin a failure to consume his quota and it had to be punished the first punishment was the extra birthday party the second wasshame sonny trumie not quite twelve was made to feel shame and humiliation shame is only a little thing but it makes the victim of it little too shame the robots were reset to scorn him he woke to mockery and went to bed with contempt even his little sister lisped the catalogue of his failures you arent trying sonny and you dont care sonny and youre a terrible disappointment to us sonny and finally all the things were true because sonny at twelve was what his elders made him and they made him neurotic is the term a pretty sounding word that means ugly things like fear and worry and endless selfreproach dont worry whispered the teddy dont worry sonny you can have me you can have what you want you dont have to have anything else garrick raged through the halls of the private place like a tiger kathryn he shouted kathryn pender the robots peeped out at him worriedly and sometimes they got in his way and he bowled them aside they didnt fight back naturallywhat robot would hurt a human but sometimes they spoke to him pleading for it was not according to the wishes of mr trumie that anyone but him rage destroying through north guardian island garrick passed them by kathryn he called kathryn he told himself fiercely trumie was not dangerous trumie was laid bare in his folder the one that roosenburg bad supplied and he couldnt be blamed he meant no harm he was once a little boy who was trying to be good by consuming consuming and he wore himself into neurosis doing it and then they changed the rules on him end of the ration end of forced consumption as the robots took over for mankind at the other end of the farmandfactory cornucopia it wasnt necessary to struggle to consume so the rules were changed and maybe trumie knew that the rules had been changed but sonny didnt it was sonny the little boy trying to be good who had made north guardian island and it was sonny who owned the private place and all it heldincluding kathryn pender garrick called hoarsely kathryn if you hear me answer me it had seemed so simple the fulcrum on which the weight of trumies neurosis might move was a teddybear give him a teddybearor perhaps a teddybear suit made by night in the factories of fishermans island with a girl named kathryn pender insideand let him bear from a source he could trust the welcome news that it was no longer necessary to struggle that compulsive consumption could have an end then garrick or any other psychist would clear it all up but only if trumie would listen kathryn roared roger garrick racing through a room of mirrors and carved statues because just in case trumie didnt listen just in case the folder was wrong and teddy wasnt the key why then teddy to trumie would be only a robot and trumie destroyed them by the score kathryn bellowed roger garrick trotting through the silent palace and at last he heard what might have been an answer at least it was a voicea girls voice at that he was before a passage that led to a room with a fountain and silent female robots standing and watching him the voice came from a small room he ran to the door it was the right door there was trumie four hundred pounds of lard lying on a marble bench with a foamrubber cushion the jowled head in the small lap of teddy or kathryn pender in the teddybear suit the sticklike legs pointed straight out the sticklike arm s clumsily patting him she was talking to him gently and reassuringly she was telling him what he needed to knowthat he bad eaten enough that be had used enough that be bad consumed enough to win the respect of all and an end to consuming garrick himself could not have done better it was a sight from mother goose the child being soothed by his toy but it was not a sight that fitted in well with its surroundings for the seraglio was upholstered in mauve and pink and the paintings that hung about were wicked sonny trumie rolled the pendulous bead and looked squarely at garrick the worry was gone from the fearfilled little eyes garrick stepped back no need for him just at this moment let trumie relax for a while as he bad not been able to relax for a score of years then the psychist could pick up where the girl bad been unable to proceed but in the meantime trumic was finally at rest the teddy looked up at garrick and in its bright blue eyes the eyes that belonged to the girl named kathryn he saw a queer tincture of triumph and compassion garrick nodded and left and went out to the robots of north guardian and started them clearing away the monstrous childseye conception of an empire sonny trumie nestled his bead in the lap of the teddybear it was talking to him nicely so nicely it was droning away dont worry sonny dont worry everythings all right everythings all right why it was almost as though it were real it bad been he calculated with the part of his mind that was razorsharp and never relaxed nearly two hours since be had eaten two hours and he felt as though he could go another hour at least maybe two maybemaybe even not cat at all again that day maybe even learn to live on three meals perhaps two perhaps he wriggledas well as four hundred greasy pounds can wriggleand pressed against the soft warm fur of the teddybear it was so soothing you dont have to eat so much sonny you dont have to drink so much no one will mind your father wont mind sonny your mother wont mind it was very comfortable to bear the teddybear telling him those things it made him drowsy so deliciously drowsy it wasnt like going to sleep as sonny trumie had known going to sleep for a dozen or more years the bitterly fought surrender to the anesthetic weariness it was just drowsy and he did want to go to sleep and finally he slept all of him not just the four hundred pounds of blubber and the little tormented eyes but even the razorsharpmind trumie that lived in the sad obedient bulk it slept it had not slept all these twenty years
