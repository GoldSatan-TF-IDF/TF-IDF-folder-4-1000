the fools run john sandford whereas crime has traditionally occurred in environments of manual human activities some crime is now perpetrated inside computers in the specialized environment of rooms with raised flooring lowered ceilings large grey boxes flashing lights moving tapes and the hum of airconditioning motors a new jargon has developed identifying automated methods such as data diddling trojan horses logic bombs salami techniques superzapping piggybacking scavenging data leakage and asynchronous attacks utility programs such as superzap are powerful and dangerous tools in the wrong hands they should be kept secure from unauthorized use computer crime a criminal justice resource manual us department of justice prologue it was hard work which he hadnt expected the thief removed each leaf from the blueprint book squatted and centered it between tape markers on the rug when it was in place he stood up squinted through the cameras viewfinder and tripped the shutter then he did it again ninetyfour times a long half hour of deep knee bends as he worked he talked to himself ooo thats got it danny awright motherfucker lets move this sucker a leetle bit this way when he finished he was sweating he turned off the photoflood and lit a cigarette the thief was tall and sandy haired with a long english face beaked nose and chinablue eyes his ruffledfront shirt was buttoned and cuffed with onyx studs he wore tuxedo trousers a black cummerbund and patent leather shoes a tuxedo jacket was folded over the back of a visitors chair the thief was working in his own office the desk was real oak the carpet real wool the two regulation plants a palm and something else were plastic but exceptionally authentic at the back of the office an oldfashioned drafting table stood beneath a window he didnt use it it was a harmless affectation allowed an uppermiddle manager a swingarm lamp was mounted on the drafting table though and that had been useful the thief replaced the lamps watt incandescent bulb with a floodlight and maneuvered the lamp out over the carpet the light on the blue prints was flat and even the pictures would be perfect after a dozen drags on his cigarette the thief snubbed it out and began rebinding the blueprints as he clipped the pages in place he paused occasionally to listen except for the odd plonks and plunks the building was quiet when he finished with the blueprints he set them aside and turned to a second book this book was also looseleaf but smaller the size of a telephone directory its pages were covered with computer code he could photograph four pages at a time the pages would be out of order on the film but that made no difference as long as he got them all it took him two hours and fifteen minutes to make the copies jesus christ he muttered as he picked up the last two pages his knees cracked when he stood and his lower back ached he lit another cigarette stretched and looked idly around the office he had spent a thousand days in it but never breached its builtin anonymity memos business cards and procedure statements were thumbtacked to a bulletin board beside the desk a photo of himself riding backward on a bicycle at a company picnic was pinned in the lower corner a cartoon from the new yorker was mounted next to it a goldframed photo of margo with tammy and ben on her lap sat on his desk next to an onyx ashtray from cancun there was little else that was personal when he finished a second cigarette the thief picked up the code book and the unwieldy blueprint binder and stepped into the darkened hallway the executive suite was empty the annual directors dinner began in an hour all the hustlers and hotshots would be there early all the hustlers danny he muttered through his teeth he would be late and would miss the cocktails but he wasnt so important that his tardiness would be noticed he thought with a touch of bitterness down two floors was the security library the thief carried the books down the fire stairs and through another dark hallway and opened the library door with a key from a steel ring inside he went to a separate room in the back opened the fire door with another key and put the books back on the shelves from which hed gotten them three hours earlier as he shut and locked the library door he was seized by a graveyard chill footsteps no there was no one there he pulled the key out of the lock and hurriedscurrying he thought like a ratback to his office suddenly afraid of the dark afraid that somebody would step out of a doorway and say we know what youre doing inside the office his heart pounding the thief put the original bulb back into the drafting lamp dropped the floodlight into a brown paper sack and crushed it under his heel he would dump the sack in a trash basket on the way out the film cassettes he tucked under his cummerbund like so many bullets in a cartridge belt the camera on a short strap went over his shoulder under and slightly behind his armpit with the tuxedo jacket covering it the camera would be invisible satisfied he turned out the light picked up his alligator briefcase and rode the elevator down eight floors to the lobby the guard at the front desk was watching an orioleswhite sox game on a grainy blackandwhite television he turned his head at the sound of the elevator how are we doing the thief said as he crossed the marble floor down three to two but were coming up in the eighth the guard pushed the signout register across the desk you going to the big party yes the thief glanced at his watch right on time the guard checked his briefcase deferentially opening the half dozen file folders inside they contained routine personnel papers nothing technical sokay and have a good time the guard said dont do anything i wouldnt ill be careful said the thief with a quick pleasant smile his teeth were white against his dark face sharp dresser the guard thought as the thief went down the steps and out the door though his tux was a little too full in the shoulder the guard looked at his watch and sighed five hours to go he opened the drawer that held his lunchbox where a package of hostess cupcakes waited he knew if he ate them now hed regret it at lunch time he opened the box and took out the cellophanecovered cupcakes and stared at them chocolate frosting with pink squiggles god it was a lonely job chapter he was tall and lanky and wore an expensive white summer suit with a complementary creamcolored shoulder bag and jetblack wraparound fuckyou sunglasses her ashblond hair just touched her shoulders she would fit in nicely with the concorde crowd on the river she was wildly out of place her business heels dug into the side of the levee as she came down the summer suit light as it was clung to her thighs like wet paint at the base of the levee she brushed through a screen of headhigh willows took a few steps out on the sand kicked off her shoes and scooped them up with one hand she walked like an athlete like a longdistance runner i was working on a sandbar below the st paul municipal airport where the mississippi curls away from the twin cities its a rough river off the bar deep and muddy brown it smells of dead carp rotting wood and diesel fuel a half mile upstream the st paul skyline soars over the river the buildings more impressive for the hundredfoot bluffs beneath them a gravel road ran behind the levee so it was possible to get in by car as the blonde had id come by water the boat was tied off on a driftwood stump and the easel sat out on the sand facing the bluff across the river i work in watercolor and sometimes pastel a newspaper critic once wrote that mr kidd paints in a colorful representational style borne of the second generation of new york school abstract expressionism one of the basic rules of life is that artists dont question favorable newspaper reviews but i brood about that borne when ive had too much beer or gotten stuck on a tough painting did he mean born or did he really mean borne i had to give up on the days painting this bluff was a monster the rock was mostly a golden yellow crossed halfway down by a band of pink weedy little saplings sprouted from crevices on the rock face and the mix of green leaves and pink rock set up uncontrollable vibrations then too id made a couple of bad moves i said shit and stopped the painting was gone mr kidd the only other person who ever came to the bar was a snuffchewing catfisherman with a plastic drywall bucket for a seat a halfpound of spoiled chicken livers for bait and a face like an english walnut hed sit and spit and never say a word yeah shed looked good coming down the levee up close she looked even better im ann smith she took off her sunglasses with one hand and stuck out the other i shook it her hand was cool and soft a business hand with short squared nails no polish no rings we have an abundance of goodlooking blondes in minnesota even so she was a headturner green eyes with gold flecks square chin a few freckles on her tootidy nose surgery maybe the most delicate scent floated about her a mix of iris and vanilla a woman at your apartment building said you were working down here i hope you dont mind the interruption its important i was finishing up i took an xacto knife from the tackle box and cut a triangle from the center of the painting she frowned took another step forward and cocked her head to look at the painting whyd you do that ruin the picture it was already ruined if you leave bad paintings laying around they wind up on walls i tossed the knife back in the tackle box what can i do for you a job she answered promptly her eyes still on the wrecked painting ah a job she put the sunglasses back on hiding her eyes a computer job a computer job ill tell you miss smith i charge outrageous prices and i hate consulting work i can recommend a reliable freelancer were not looking for bugs she said flatly she opened her purse and took out an envelope i have a retainer here i tried again look ive had a good run of paintings she interrupted again last year you made seventeen thousand dollars on paintings she said her dark glasses gave her a hostile power that will barely pay your mortgage you might make twenty thousand this year you spend a month fishing in the northwest territories you spend another month on biscayne bay out of miami you go to new orleans to paint youd like to buy a permanent place down there your karate costs a thousand you have to eat so youll have to take computer work and we dont care about your outrageous fees we can afford them my easel is a homemade contraption designed to disassemble and fit in the boat its held together by a bunch of butterflysized wingnuts as she was talking i dropped to one knee and reached in to loosen one of the nuts and to hide my face while i thought about what she said she looked too rich to be a cop and she was too direct to be political political people ooze butter even when the knives are out that left two possibilities she might be private or she might be federal working for an agency i didnt want to know about whichever it was shed seen my tax return thats the only place shed find the amount of seventeen thousand dollars because it was phony i made a lot less than that on the painting anyway but declared seventeen it accounted for income that couldnt be hidden and that i couldnt afford to explain so she had some clout the business about a place in new orleans was harder to figure it suggested surveillance though i hadnt felt a thing you want more she asked showing off your friends say youre odd thats the word they use odd you have a bachelors degree in electrical engineering you have a master of fine arts in painting you should have a phd in software design but you skipped your orals to go fishing in costa rica they were biting i said lamely trying to slow the recitation thats bullshit she said crisply yeah but its the simplest explanation that fits all the facts occams razor a good guy occam i said your friends say you stay up all night and sleep until noon you paint and do computer programs and know a lot of politicians who come to your apartment with sacks full of money sometimes shoeboxes only rarely shoeboxes i mean she rolled on like a vandal your friends say you have a wonderful nerd act you dress up like an engineer with a white shirt and string tie and put a calculator on your belt and nine ballpoint pens in a white plastic pocket shield thats how you went to the beaux arts ball last year with bette whatshername but you dont quite make it as a nerd you worked with the strategic operations group out of saigon during the vietnam war and i have a fuzzy television monitor photo of a man who looks quite a bit like youcouldnt prove it but its closegoing over the threestrand wire at belkap microtech hes not dressed like a nerd at all hes dressed in an army urban camouflage suit thats supposed to be sort of secret he left a little blood behind on the wire type apositive which happens to be your type you want more no the wingnut came loose in my hand i looked at it and wondered who had designed such an elegant useful thing it might be something to draw its all pretty much of a fantasy anyway she took another step closer until she loomed over me i dont think so we have excellent sources of information you were recommended by jack clark at clark foods he gave you high marks for solving his problem whatever it was if shed talked to jack there was one more thing shed know but hadnt asked about it was coming theres one more thing she said i thought there might be a couple of people said you do the tarot that makes us a little nervous it shouldnt you dont know how i use it the job we have is critical we dont want it done based on the stars or whatever im probably less superstitious than you are i said i stood up and it was too close for comfort she backed off i use the tarot my own way you wouldnt understand it and im not inclined to explain if you dont like it you can hike back over the levee i pulled the easel apart and laid the uprights in the boat we just dont want it to get in the way she said is that a royal we or do we have an employer youll get a name when you agree to work with us thats what this is for she unfolded the envelope and showed me the money she was a big woman her eyes level with my chin and the sun and the light breeze turned her blond hair into a halo behind her on the water a tow pushed a string of rustcolored barges upstream a barechested deckhand in grimy jeans sat on the lead barge and watched us we will give you five thousand dollars to ride in to chicago with me this afternoon ive got a plane waiting at the airport well buy you a return ticket convincer money i said she shrugged free money mr kidd all cash no record no taxes i declare all my income miss smith right if her name was smith id eat my brushes how much for the main job youll have to talk to my employer about that if you take it you wont have to worry about financing a place in new orleans youll be able to buy it outright she was cool superior and slightly snotty a male friend if she had time for one would have a hard body a great tan a gold chain a twoseater mercedesbenz and no sense of humor a commoner had little chance of peeling off her shorts should it happen shed do it purely for the experience like shopping at kmart or sniffing glue she knew what i was thinking of course and she knew she was reaching me with her information money and long athletic legs all management tools properly deployed well under control it was mildly irritating letting it percolate for a moment i looked down at the battered grassgreen fiberglass hull of my boat the brilliant white darches paper the black handles of the watercolor brushes it was all i really wanted to do i didnt want to fool with some rich guys computers but a bigger boat would be nice and money would buy more time to paint and new orleans is a pleasurable place it sounds illegal i said after a while i dont know what you did for jack clark she said but i got the impression that the police wouldnt be happy about it when i talked to him he was grinning like the cat that ate the canary i could call jack and ask who your boss is i said he wouldnt tell you she said promptly five thousand id been rubbing my hands with an old tshirt now a paint cloth she handed me the envelope absolutely sure of herself in twenties and fifties she said see you at the airport in an hour make it an hour and a half i said giving up i tucked the money into my hip pocket ive got to pull the boat out of the water and make arrangements for the cat take a shower she looked at her watch and nodded she started to walk away then changed her mind and turned back to the ruined painting i went to an opening a few weeks ago she said oil paintings though not watercolors they had holes cut in the middle of them like that one my friend and i spoke to the artist he said the holes represented his contempt for the conventional form that has trapped painting for so long he said the american indian for instance often painted on irregularly shaped war shields it was the kind of talk that gives me headaches miss ah smith i said when she slowed for a breath yes if we have to fly to chicago together if i take this job do me a favor yes dont talk to me about art okay her face froze up offended she looked down at her watch and said an hour and a half please be prompt she started stiffly across the sandbar toward the willows but loosened up after a few feet and even gave it a little extra effort knowing id watch which i did at the base of the levee she stopped to put on her shoes glanced back and nimbly climbed the bank i keep a pair of x binoculars in the boat so i can get a closer look at landscape structures when she disappeared over the levee i got the glasses and jogged after her a car door slammed as i scrambled up the levee and put the glasses on her cars license plate it was a minnesota tag probably a rental back at the boat i wrote the number on the cash envelope with a nice vibrant black made of alizarin crimson and hookers green then i went off to call robert duchamps pronounced doosham and usually called bobby chapter the cat a tigerstriped torn had moved in a few months after i bought the apartment he was waiting now on the back of the living room couch gazing out the window toward the river he was doing the same thing one day when a pigeon one of the big blue and white numbers smacked headlong into the glass he came off the couch like a bullet and hid under the kitchen sink for the rest of the day he hasnt trusted a pigeon since im going out of town i told him ill leave the flap open emily will feed you he looked at me yawned and turned back to the window emily anderson lives in the apartment below mine shes seventy years old and a damn good painter most wednesday nights we hire a model and drink beer and draw and argue i walked down the stairs and knocked on her door when she answered i told her about the trip she agreed to take care of the cat though you ought to pay me for taking care of the smelly thing jesus christ you drink enough of my beer to float a battleship i said yeah and make sure theres a sixpack in the fridge she said as she shut her door we get along famously i live in a sprawling apartment in the northeast corner of a converted redbrick warehouse four floors up the painting studio is on the north side under a lot of glass theres also a study a small living room that looks east toward the railyards and river a tiny kitchen with a dining bar and one bedroom most of my time is spent in the studio or the study which is dominated by three walls of books and a bunch of personal computers theres an ibmat thats been collecting dust lately one of the ibm ps s a mac ii and my favorite a fullbore amiga a lee data dumb terminal is stuffed under a book table next to an early vintage mac a few oldtimers from commodore radio shack and apple sit in boxes in a corner with power cords wrapped around their disk drives i work on the big machines when i need money but prefer the small ones power to the people i turned on the amiga loaded a communications program and typed in bobby duchampss phone number in east st louis bobby lives in the phone wires we met one night in the late seventies by accident deep inside the general motors design computers we had a nice chat and he gave me a number in chicago the number didnt exist as an independent phone line but it triggered an intercept bobby was a phone phreak before he started hacking bobby specializes in databases hes deep into arpanet and milnet and bnet and a half dozen other international and intercontinental data networks he knows the credit company computers like the back of his hand if you need something from a phonewired database chances are he can get it other than that i didnt know much about him i was down in new orleans once and hadnt hooked up my portable and he called me on a voice line he sounded like one of those softspoken delta blacks in his teens or twenties he had a speech impediment and hinted that he had a physical problem cerebral palsy something like that since then ive called him at half a dozen different numbers in the biggest metro areas east of the mississippi i dont know whether he actually moved or somehow changed area codes you can get him personally twentyfour hours a day if you know how the east st louis number rang without an answer i counted the rings to eight and pressed the a key before the ninth ring it rang twice more and then the carrier tone came up if i hadnt pressed an a between eight and nine itd have rung forever after another moment a came up on my screen and i typed in a pseudonym after another moment a whatappeared i typed need info minutes max on driver rental car xdb white ford it sat there on the screen for a moment before he came back with his price for the information i typed ok and he came back with leave on receive i typed okagain and a second later the modem signaled a disconnect i switched the modem to autoanswer and hung up bobby doesnt take cash his patrons sign up with scinet a scienceoriented dataprocessing service and give bobby their account numbers and passwords he uses their time up to an agreed amount he never cheats i have no idea what hes using scinets mainframes for it might be a moneylaundering shuck of some kind while bobby looked for data on the blonde i showered and brushed my teeth as i was brushing i stared at myself in the mirror something that i seem to do more and more often as the years go by searching for signs of immortality finding signs of erosion the lines on either side of my nose get deeper and my hair is shot through with gray which i like to pretend is premature i thought about growing a mustache again but the last time i tried the experiment ended in embarrassment a woman friend was teasing me about the new growth saying i reminded her of someone but who i modestly mentioned a few movie stars and she started laughing things were moving right along until halfway through the evening when her forehead wrinkled and she pointed her index finger at the brush above my mouth i got it mark twain mark twain was a wonderful guy but in the picture everybody remembers he was thirty years older than i am twenty anyway i lost the mustache when i finished brushing i changed into a clean pair of jeans a blue oxfordcloth shirt and a fading linen sport coat then i went out to the kitchen opened a can of chicken feast for the cat and unlocked the flap so he could come and go i was stuffing underwear and a couple of clean shirts into an overnight bag when bobby called back the computer answered and data began running down the screen margaret ellise kahn dob indian evanston ill eyes green height weight

on his way credit records government records social securitytheyre all open books if you have the right opener hed given me something to think about anshiser was serious money a billion or two if the wall street journal knows what its talking about i subscribe to twentyfive or thirty magazines and newsletters that touch on my work everything from artnews and byte to pc world and vector reports any issues of particular interest get tossed in a closet if i wasnt mistaken business week sometime in the past year had done a profile of anshiser and his businesses i opened the closet and started sorting through the accumulation of paper i found it six months down anshiser according to business week directly controlled anshiser holding corporation which in turn owned a dozen major companies on the industrial side was anshiser aviation where he got his start during world war ii building up a company bought by his father during the depression there was also an avionics company a small aluminum specialties mill and a string of scrap yards the holdings on the service side where anshiser had been most active in the past twenty years were even more impressive they included a hotel chain two franchise restaurant chains one of the nations biggest garbagehauling firms and kelmark vending a building and distributor of candy and cigarettemachines coinop pool tables and similar equipment anshiser was known for his willingness to take risks and to delegate authority if he gave you a company to run and you ran it well he made you rich and kept his hands off executives who failed to measure up were ruthlessly weeded out he was also a force in republican politics particularly in the upper midwest and that i thought was where he got my name most of my political money is republican that has nothing to do with personal preferences the republicans simply have more cash as far as im concerned the two parties are about as different as curly and moe before leaving the apartment i stepped into the studio and sat down at the drawing table i keep a tarot at hand wrapped in silk in a wooden box from poland the deck is a common one a popular variation of the ryder design i did five quick spreads and the fool showed up in critical positions in three of them the fool represents a major change that occurs as a natural and inexorable part of life without your volition because of the way you live i wrapped the cards in the silk cloth put them back in the box and slipped the box into my overnight bag something to consider the municipal airport from my apartment is across the robert street bridge down onto the flats along the river kahn was waiting for me in the terminal smiled perfunctorily when she saw me coming with the bag and the portable and headed out the door were right out here she said over her shoulder it was a redandwhite anshiserbuilt business jet with a charter logo i hate traveling on small jets you feel like youre in a mailing tube the pilot and copilot were already in the cockpit im surprised its a charter i said id have thought youd fly it yourself margaret like you fly the porsche she turned her head and looked at me her eyes unfocused a bit and before we got to the waiting plane she said the rental car you got the license number very good i said the data said she was smart the data were right youve got a friend at the rental booth the redhead she asked as we stopped at the steps to the plane no database the redhead wouldnt know about the porsche i gave her my best smile her forehead wrinkled so you know who my employer is rudolph anshiser hmph she said and led the way to the jet at the top of the stairs she turned and said its not margaret its maggie chapter in what seems like another century i was a first lieutenant in the us army the unit was small and eventually all but four of us were dead or in pieces i lay in an army hospital in san francisco tried to rationalize my part in the deaths and failed since then ive had an aversion to organization for the most part i simply want to be left alone thats not as simple as it should be i paint during the days and late at night i sit in front of a computer terminal and make statistical models in the early evenings there are workouts at the shotokan dojo on east seventh street i like my cat a couple of women in town fifteen or twenty twins ball games a year fishing out of miami in the winter and on a canadian lake in the summer and the music and food in new orleans i go to new york and chicago for gallery openings and to hustle my paintings it all takes money only a small fraction of my earnings comes from painting but the fraction is getting larger a bigger chunk comes from the computer models the models predict political behavior using social statistics a cynics view of history and a variety of small computers if you want to be a state legislator governor congressman or us senator from wisconsin minnesota or several other states of the upper midwest you can buy a kidd election model and run it on your own ibm office machine you crank in a political position and out comes a result in terms of vote shifts if you dont like the answer you can crank in a different position a model like that will cost five to twenty grand depending on how rich you are sometimes especially in political offyears i take less conventional computerrelated jobs they pay the best of all i told most of this to rudolph anshiser himself three hours after maggie and i flew out of st paul we were met at the ohare general aviation terminal by a gray mercedes limousine the chauffeur wore a blue pinstriped shirt and rep tie he looked like he might own a company or two himself we drove north and east out of ohare fortyfive minutes after we left the airport the chauffeur turned off the arterial highway into a fourlane street through an expensive neighborhood it may have been evanston but may also have been a bit farther north eventually we left the fourlane street for a twolane through an even more expensive neighborhood and finally turned onto a blacktopped lane that twisted and turned past gated entries and vinecovered walls we stopped at a brick gatehouse with wroughtiron gates the chauffeur pressed a button on the cars dashboard and the gates rolled open behind them were two acres of crisply landscaped grounds dotted with oak ash and the distinct forms of gingko trees here and there were the stumps of departed american elms the house a pile of ivycovered brick covered another quarter acre lake michigan broke against a seawall in back the chauffeur stopped at the arched front entry and maggie led me across a red quarrytile porch through a dimly lit walnutpaneled entry hall and into an oldfashioned parlor she pointed at an overstuffed chair i have to report well have you up in five minutes she said she left and i sat down and looked around the room it had the peculiar stillness that comes with a lack of livingin it was a waiting room but few people waited in it there was a blockedup fireplace flanked on both sides by bookshelves loaded with obsolete business texts another wall featured a narrow window with heavy brocade drapes drawn back to show a thin slice of green lawn little sparkly dust motes glimmered in the shaft of sunlight that came through a german romantic oil painting hung over the fireplace and my eye kept skipping over it from the corner beside the bookshelves a much smaller painting made noises at me i finally heaved myself out of the chair and went over to look at it then i got down in front of it damn a whistler one of the pastels from venice a street scene with strollers and a garbageeating dog the buildings outlined in black chalk on graytoned paper leaned out over the crowd and were brought to life with a few simple touches of color in the lower lefthand corner was his butterfly signature id never seen it before not the real thing the painting was hung five feet off the floor and i was practically down on my knees peering at it the light was terrible i didnt hear maggie come back like it i jumped and turned jesus this is a whistler uhhhuh she was not interested yeah i like it i went back to it how did he make it so real with so few lines and so little color i looked at it until maggie started fidgeting okay i said and followed her out of the parlor and up a curving walnut staircase to the second floor a long carpeted corridor crossed the stairs at the top running both ways the full length of the house we turned left past bedrooms now converted to offices there were people in some of the offices working over computer screens or stacks of paper they didnt look up as we passed halfway down the hall maggie knocked at a heavy oak door and went through this room was a complete contrast to the waiting area anshiser had opened up the rear wall with huge glass windows the lake made a sharp dark horizon line as far as you could see to the north to the south you could sense the great culdesac at south bend anshiser in wheat jeans and a blue roughsilk sweatshirt sat behind an ornate table his back to the windows another man dressed in a gray business suit white shirt wine tie and wingtips sat on a side chair one leg crossed over the other maggie and i plodded across a pondsized carpet and anshiser stood to shake my hand mr kidd his face had once been craggy but the crags were softening with age and erosion his eyebrows were thick tangled mats hanging over the pale blue eyes of a born killera man who lived on energy but his energy betrayed by the flesh was beginning to fail he gestured to a leather chair as i sat down facing him across the table i noticed that his hand shook this is mr dillon he said indicating the man in the side chair dillon nodded two computer terminals squatted on anshisers table one was a dedicated stocktrading link its screen covered with lists of numbers in tiny amber print the other was a generalpurpose ibm showing a dense block of text a report of some kind as he introduced dillon anshiser reached out and tapped a key sequence and the screen went blank tell me how you identified us he said i dont want any trade secrets just in general i told him without mentioning names or phone numbers hmm he pulled at his chin when i finished suppose somebody like your friend wanted to get into my company files is there any foolproof way to protect them from the outside sure dont hook them up to a telephone your little ibm therei nodded at his desktop terminalis absolutely secure from telephone interference as long as the modem is turned off if you set it to autoanswer because you have people calling in then you could have a problem and i assume youre hooked into a mainframe which means that it has incoming lines so that could be vulnerable everything important is protected by randomly generated passwords there are lots of ways to get passwords tell me one i told him several and since he lived on a lake mentioned work done in the netherlands involving the processing of images projected onto computer monitors everything that shows up on a monitor is the result of a highspeed beam that scans back and forth across itletters words pictures everything as the beam switches on and off it creates an electromagnetic pulse sort of like a radio wave its weak but with the right gear it can be picked up amplified sorted synchronized and reproduced on another screen up to a few hundred feet away or further if there isnt much interference a boat on the lake would do quite well they wouldnt have independent access to your files but theyd see everything you see when i finished anshiser glanced out at the lake then over at maggie who was sitting at a side table with a leatherbound book check this he said briefly she nodded ill call that fbi fellow who helped on the container ship contamination problem he should know somebody anshiser turned back to me contemplated my face for a minute and then decided have you had any contact with the aviation industry i shrugged not much i did some work on boeings economic and political clout in seattle and plugged the data into a political model it didnt come to much why not he asked curiously it wasnt a vote discriminator nobody in seattle fools with boeing the discriminators involved other issues hmph anshiser pivoted his leather chair and peered out the window toward the lake it was getting dark and the line of the horizon was splitting deep blue sky and black water i have a problem he said after a moment he sighed and shook his head and pivoted back to face me its the biggest problem of my career it could destroy or badly damage the heart of this company more than forty years of work for me and twentyfive more for my father i can help he grunted maybe he turned the chair again to look out over the lake gathering his thoughts about ten years ago it appeared that there would be an opportunity an opportunity to design a cuttingedge allweather fighter aircraft it would be a halfstep after the f f f generation but earlier than a really operational f hypersonic plane came on there was a lot of skepticism back then in and out of government about new military fighters we were paying huge amounts of money for tiny increments of advantage he laced his hands behind his head in any case the big defense aviation companies were focusing on the hypersonic aerospace fighter to a few of us it seemed that a gap might open and we could slip into it with a privately built plane so we started working on one just concepts at first springing some engineers here and there to do studies and try out new ideas we werent the only ones doing that whitemark aerospace had its own project going and the bugs were out of it they tried building private fighters and got burned they got burned even though they did a hell of a job but they werent working with the same kind of gap that we are now he paused and looked at his hands as though he would find words in them anyway it was us and whitemark these things get complicated almost philosophical but we took different routes to the new fighters they went with a heavy bird called it hellwolf big weapons platform lots of armor lots of computer assist its a brute we went with a light bird the sunfire not much armor limited amounts of weaponry although it could take a good varietycannon rockets smart bombs airtoair and airtoground missiles areadenial canisters the full spectrum it has an exceptional stealth configuration and selectively malleable wings that make it into a hell of a lifting body with great idle time it can go out and hang there waiting its as fast as the whitemark entry mach at thirtyfive thousand feet at treetops but it has half again the combat radius better than twentythree hundred miles sounds unbeatable i said uncertainly though i dont know much about fighter specs it looked good anshiser said there was a bitter note in his voice for a while at least he turned and looked at me there are reasons to build light birds and reasons to build them heavy pure speed is good but its not everything dogfighting speeds are a lot lower than fullburn running if youre trying to maintain air superiority over a ground fight youve got to stay over the killing ground whitemark figured that for practical purposes in dogfights hellwolf would be as maneuverable as our sunfire with the advantage of the armor and the extra weaponry they also knew that the american defense establishment has always gone for the heavy fighter when it had a choice so whitemark thought they had an advantage but we had something they didnt and that was he hesitated i havent told you anything secret yet im aware of your old military security clearance but youve got to know that some of this is classified i dont talk he nodded what we had was a genius walter markess he was a synthesizer theyre pretty rare among engineers he took some stuff from navy submarine design and some stuff from the corps of engineers god help him he did some research of his own and he had access to all the work on air target acquisition he came up with a thing that he called string for selective targeting you see the maneuverability of a fighter is not limited so much by its design as by what the pilot can endure above certain turn rates you get pilot failure theyre crushed by the highg turns they black out they red out their reactions go to hell they get confused and disoriented string targeting was a system that used laser tags radar imaging and even acoustics to get a target and hold it it didnt make any difference what altitude the enemy plane was in or your plane what speeds or directions they were going once the target was acquired string would hold it and relate it to your plane until it was so far out that it was no longer a factor just like you had a string tied to it then markess took the whole thing a step further he designed a control system using limited artificial intelligence software that could gameplay the opposing fighters given selections made by the pilot in other words the plane could fly by itself it could make intelligent choices by considering a whole array of data type of armaments and remaining supply remaining fuel number of opponents and their armament actions of allied and enemy aircraft prospects of success the importance of success and so on and the thing is you see a pilot could opt to let the plane go beyond his own control even beyond his blackout point he could say to the plane take it run it to x number of gees and its okay if i go out for a while because you can handle it and the plane would stay short of lethal maneuvers you see the advantage that gave us no matter how fast their hellwolf turned we could turn inside it in critical situations we could run with it climb with it and outwait it on target we could do maneuvers hellwolf couldnt even consider maneuvers never seen before we could attack and keep attacking when the pilots themselves were completely out of it what happened anshiser had become more and more animated as he recited the qualities of the sunfire but suddenly he was still almost frozen the hush lasted for five heartbeats before he moved again to lean forward on his desk those sonsofbitches at whitemark stole string from us he slammed a big fist on the desk his face tense and pale stole it paid some sonofabitch to copy plans and carry them out of our corporate headquarters they built their own string the specs for their early system designs even had our mistakes because they didnt know enough to identify them you didnt have any legal protection its not the sort of thing you get a patent on anshiser snorted if we went to court we might prove something fifty years from now but after they figured out the system they started altering it every time they found an alternate way to do something they took it if you went out right now and looked at the plans for our system and their system youd probably feel the resemblance but youd have a hard time proving that their system is a copy he suddenly switched direction how old do you think i am i figured seventy or seventyfive but gave him five years out of courtesy i dont know sixtyfive seventy thank you he grinned im eightythree i dont have much time left ive been feeling hollow i cant explain it but its worse than being sick not that ive been sick that much the doctors say its stress and dillon and maggie say its this sunfire thing my wife is gone my kids are okay but nothing special theyll each inherit a couple of million or so when i die and turn into the fossilized dipshits you see standing around country clubs i can see it in my grandchildren theyre okaymost of thembut im not very interested in them so im eightythree and the company is all im leaving behind now i might not leave that in this business development costs are so high that if you dont win the contract if you dont get to build the plane the whole company can go down right now we employ thirteen thousand workers in our aviation division if sunfire wins the competition well hire ten thousand more if we lose and all we have left is the corporate jet division well be down to five thousand by the end of the decade the corporate jet field is saturated competition is getting worse and we have nowhere else to go there are eight thousand people more or less who could lose their jobs because of a rotten little thief im not going to stand for it not if i can do anything about it do you know who the thief is he glanced at dillon dillon stared back impassively and when anshiser turned to me again i got the feeling he was about to tell a lie no we have some ideas but right now we dont know okay so where do i come in what do you want me to do a couple of things everything we do from design to production to cost estimating we do on computers its all so complicated there is no other way if somebody smart got into our computer system i dont know how but did it he could hurt us badly and you think its the same with whitemark i know it is there simply isnt any other way to do the work whitemark has about three months to integrate the string system with their hellwolf avionics then they have to demonstrate to the navy and air force that it will work as it is they might not make the deadline theyve got a crash program going but they started late i want you to slow them down i want you to get into their computer system and screw it up be subtle be obvious i dont care but i want you to push them to the walli want you to jam them up so they cant move if they cant demonstrate their system in three months and we can were back in the ball game whats the other thing you want i asked revenge he said his killers eyes glittering in the dying light i want revenge on the bastards who stole my baby chapter i spent the night in a chicago hotel watching a bad movie about teenagers and thinking over the job proposition anshiser was a maniac of course he knew what he was doing but he was clinging to a thin edge of control like a grunt with battle fatigue would a crisis crack the control or harden it it could go either way maggie was something else she was precise measured cool she knew what she was doing and she was nowhere near the edge she apparently agreed with anshiser dillon was a cipher their proposition was not entirely novel there have been several hushedup incidents in which businesses were damaged by computer attacks most of the time the object of the attack was theft or embezzlement and the damage was an unintentional byproduct a major railroad was burned when a group of technothieves as they were called in the fbi report began shuffling and relabeling boxcars the intent was to send certain cars loaded with highvalue consumer items like televisions and stereos to remote sidings where the gang would crack the cars load the loot onto trucks and haul it away the most serious damage came when they tried to cover their tracks three thousand boxcars were mislabeled and sent to the wrong destinations the result was chaos perishable products rotted timecritical shipments were late it cost the railroad millions to straighten out in a few of the known raids the damage was intentional in every case though the attacks were from the insideguerrilla hits by employees against their own company anshisers proposition was altogether different he was proposing a war an act of naked aggression an attack to the death by one corporation on another as far as i knew there had never been anything like it a war that was business by other means to paraphrase a famous prussian maggie called at eight oclock jesus i said with a yawn when you said morning i thought you meant like eleven where are you downstairs she said briskly i have three warm bagels a small cup of cream cheese a plastic knife two styrofoam cups of coffee and your room number what do you think she looked like shed been up for hours she came in sat in one of the chairs and ate one of the bagels while she watched me finish the other two you look like youve been dragged through hell by the ankles she said any thoughts yet it will take a while i said scratching my dayold beard i wonder about anshiser if hes crazy i might have picked a different word but thats what you want to know she said the answer is no he is not crazy he is extremely anxious this might be our last card if were going to play it we have to do it soon in six weeks or two months it will be too late hmph i drank the last of my coffee let me shave and take a shower and we can get out of here she came and leaned on the bathroom doorjamb while i shaved still nibbling on her first bagel i used to watch my father shave when i was a little girl she said as i wiped the last of the shaving cream off my face you watch your father take a shower too i asked of course not a tiny frown well if youll move your elbow ill shut the door and spare you the experience i said and she grinned and moved off across the room the anshiser research plant was somewhere out by ohare a nondescript modernoid building it looked as somebody clever once said like the box the building should have come in the director didnt quite slaver over maggies hand but he personally took us down to the laboratory level where a string package was being assembled the lab looked like the worlds cleanest machine shop with concrete floors and a lot of noise the string package was in a back room entry was through three sets of glass doors and for the last two the director needed differentcolored key cards string was the size of a console television it was mounted on a testing gyro that allowed it to swivel freely there was nothing tidy about it wires and electronics boards stuck out at all angles there were nozzlelike protrusions here and there and cylindrical openings where other nozzlelike protrusions would fit a dolly full of testing equipment sat next to it and nearby two engineers in blue smocks argued about readouts they stopped when we walked in maggie introduced me as mr lamb and told them i was cleared for all access what do you think she asked me i walked around the instrument package and shook my head beats the shit out of me i said we could give you the bigshot show one of the engineers suggested he had tape wrapped around the bridge of his glasses which gave him a slightly crazed look itd take about two minutes to rig up sure why not the testing equipment was quickly disconnected the two engineers rolled in a dolly that carried what looked like a cartoon fishbowl except that it bristled with short metallic rods at the end of each rod was a glassy bubble the engineers fitted the fishbowl around the string package like a plexiglas jacket and plugged in a half dozen multicolored flat cables okay said one of the engineers there was a keypad with a tiny digital led panel on the side of the package he punched a few buttons and peered at the readout punched a few more and nodded mr lamb if you could stand right here he pointed at a spot on the floor and i stood there okay now look at this screen he turned on a monitor it showed what looked like a head as painted by a twoyearold thats your head as interpreted by highfrequency audio waves infrared sensors radar and laser rangers right now were looking at the laser sensing you can read it like a contour map the brightest yellow part is your nose then it moves through the red green and blue as it goes further back now here he said flipping on another monitor is a simulated threedimensional readout of your head and its direction size range velocity and probable identity shown down here in the corner of the screen most of the numbers were meaningless unless you knew the code sequences though under identity it said head we rigged it to say head said the engineer with the crazed look now move around the room said the other one i moved and the readouts changed its following you he said i stepped behind maggie and looked over her head it was still following me and when i came out from behind her continued to follow your personal characteristics were read into the computer so it followed only you we have it programmed for a single target or it would have picked up ms kahn as a second target and started a separate reading on her while registering that you were eclipsed behind her neat i said listen what is this audio thing and what use can you make of audio pickups if youve got two planes on diverging courses each at say mach okay said one of the engineers slipping into a professorial tone you have to understand maggie and the director excused themselves after fifteen minutes of it i stayed for another two hours looking at the machinery and talking about the software that would run the stuff it was not my field at all but i could see the concepts if i started studying right away it would only take six years to catch up with what they were doing the ai and gameplaying concepts were easier and we got tangled in a complicated argument about gaming concepts we gave up at lunchtime and i went looking for maggie she was in the directors office working with a business terminal the director was hovering in the outer office pretending to supervise a harassedlooking secretary ah there you are she said when i walked in all done yeah we ought to get a cheeseburger or something the director fussed over her as we went out and shook my hand as he turned back and maggie went out through the door his face flattened in a distinct look of relief i think that guy was happy to see us go i said yes she said i scare him cant think why at anshisers we went through the waitinthesittingroom routine again and i spent some more time looking at the whistler when she came and got me i thought id figured out how he did it maggie said you were a little worried that i might be nuts anshiser said cheerfully when we walked into his office i glanced over at her and she grinned yeah a little good if you didnt wed be worried about your stability but we want you to understand how strongly we feel about this i think about it constantly i cant sleep i cant do business it might be crazy but weve talked it out and we dont think so so what do i do specifically i asked dropping into his visitors chair first we want your agreement that if you decide not to take the job what we discuss never goes out of this office i wouldnt talk anyway talk wouldnt get me anything but a conspiracy indictment i relaxed and crossed my legs sure if you want to take my word for it our research indicated that we could id like to know about that research i said how did you find me dillon found you dillon is the best researcher in the united states the library of congress calls him anshiser said when we found out what had happened that string had been stolen we knew wed probably lose the competition for the contract oh we wriggled and turned and twisted and talked to lawyers and patent specialists and the answer kept coming up the same so i assigned dillon to the problem i told him to forget any parameters at alljust find a solution as it happens there is one maybe it just isnt legal i glanced over at dillon and the gray man smiled again thats true he said anshiser continued to save ourselves we have to put their ass in a sling then maybe i can work some kind of deal what kind of deal well have to see an acquisition maybe we can buy them maybe a merger i dont know but i need an edge i thought these guys were your blood enemies i can live with enemies i just cant watch the company go down if i can hustle them into a merger i can take care of them later right now theres no reason in the world they should talk to us we need to give them a reason he turned back to the desk and picked up a blackbound typescript this is dillons report in general it says the best way to stop whitemark is through their computer systemsdesign systems accounting systems information systems scheduling and materials altering them destroying them faking them out this is a defense industry i said if were caught theyll drop us in leavenworth for the rest of time ah now thats something dillons report covers quite thoroughly said anshiser i will give you a contract outlining the kind of attack i want if you are arrested you will present the authorities with a copy of the contract i will voluntarily confirm that i hired you to do this work you will instantly become a very small fry and you join me at leavenworth no i dont think so im not absolutely sure of course but i dont think so if i am arrested or any of my people are arrested i will publicly discuss the contributions i have given our president over the past ten years hes exceptionally popular you know and intends to run for reelection the contributions i made were quite illegal but they kept his political career alive at several critical junctures i am confident that any investigation will be quashed blackmail exactly youve been around politicians enough to know that it happens every day its usually not quite so blunt oh there wont be anything blunt about it if they get to me at the end of the investigation theyll punch me into their computers and a flag will pop up some flunky will run over to the white house and the whole investigation will disappear i grunted and thought about it it could work but i didnt intend to commit myself without more thought its shaky id have to think about it think about the fee when youre thinking about the job anshiser said he leaned back and tented his fingers if you take the job and it doesnt work out one million dollars if you take it and it does work another million i assume you would have to hire other people buy equipment whatever when you sign the contract ms kahn will give you the first million in cash plus one hundred thousand in expense money jesus i said now i was thinking furiously why so much if i was willing to do it it wouldnt take a million to convince me mr kidd he said quietly im eightythree years old and supposedly have a billion dollars maybe two billion if i gave away a million a week for the rest of my life i wouldnt keep up with accruing interest i dont care what i pay youbut i suspect you do with two million youll be free forever or in jail for eight to ten jail would protect you from distractions while you paint he sat and looked at me smiling i thought about it two million dollars i might also mention that you seem to have precisely the right qualifications for the job not only are you able to do it you have the will to do it i had the most flattering report from our string engineers by the way they want to hire you to work on the ai software thats nice i said distractedly two million i had to be missing something you need time to think he offered yeah i do and the deals not quite right i said if i take the job ill want a second contract two million for computer consulting work security or something so if i declare it with the irs itll be clean agreed and i want the whistler the what he seemed puzzled the whistler pastel down in the sitting room anshiser glanced at maggie who said its the one next to the mantel to the right oh that the gray one he said the wrinkles disappearing from his forehead my wife bought it years ago that was the last time i looked at it sure two million and the whistler ill think about it i said i have to do more research on you on whitemark on what we might do ill get back how long i shrugged a week he nodded a week then if you would go with ms kahn she will give you a copy of a report on whitemark and you can take this copy of dillons report he pushed the blackbound typescript across the desk at me stood and rubbed his big wrinkled hands together goddamn he said im going to enjoy this maggie said follow me please dillon who hadnt said a thing followed us out of the office and turned the other way down the corridor leaving anshiser alone maggie led me to a smaller office and gestured at a chair as she settled behind her desk there were two walls of bookshelves packed with texts and references another window overlooking the lake and a long oak table stacked with more books you need a painting in here i said send me one she turned on her desk terminal typed in a series of passwords and punched a print command the whitemark report churned out of a highspeed printer in thirty seconds i had a sheaf of computer paper that ended with a list of names and job titles thats as uptodate as we can make it it was good last week she looked a bit haggard for the first time i noticed the fine lines near the corners of her eyes incipient crowsfeet frightened i asked no no im a believer she said looking up at me but there will be problems theyre inevitable we have a lot of complicated operations in our business ive learned one thing about them something will go wrong nothing ever works out quite the way you wanted it to nothing with this operation the consequences of error could be severe we talked for another minute then she led the way back to the stairs and we circled down the staircase to the front entry the chauffeur was waiting there with a package wrapped in brown paper whats that maggie asked a painting from the waiting room the chauffeur said he handed it to me mr anshiser said you should look at it while you think he spread his hands in a gesture of incomprehension i dont know what it means thats just what he said the picture even with the thick fruitwood frame was light in my hands a whistler chapter with the whistler under my arm i decided against another night in chicago and had the chauffeur drop me at ohare on the flight back to st paul i thumbed through dillons report whitemark headquarters which included design and research facilities were in virginia outside washington the companys main assembly plants were in north carolina if i took the job wed work out of a washington suburb so wed be in the local call area of the whitemark computer center the report listed the names of the companys top officers manufacturing personnel and engineers i made a note to call bobby with the list whitemark was founded by an eccentric electronics enthusiast named harry whitemark in the midtwenties originally the company manufactured radios it barely survived the crash and in the thirties went into avionics during world war ii the company rebuilt civilian planes as specialized light observation aircraft when korea came along it refitted helicopters with special radio gear needed for medivacs and the increasingly complex groundair networks whitemark got into the fighter business almost by accident in the seventies the company found itself without a dominant stockholder and whitemark execs liked it that way nobody interfered with them but there was one large fly in the soup the company was undervalued and cashheavy a sitting duck for a takeover they looked for a way out and found a lowbrowed neerdowell named winton woormly iv woormly had inherited a majority holding in a mediumsized aviation company the company specialized in jet trainers and small groundsupport aircraft marketing them in third world countries that couldnt afford the big stuff woormly was smart enough to understand that if he tried to run the company himself hed screw up and lose it besides he wasnt interested he was interested in singlemalt scotch ocean racers polo trout fishing and young boys in that order whitemark offered him a deal theyd give him a big lump of cash a special issue of stock and a place on the whitemark board in return woormly would turn over his controlling interest in the aviation company woormly jumped at the deal he wound up with a title and more money than he could spend whitemark got a major stockholder who wasnt interested in running the company and whose stock holdings would scare off pirates theyd also stripped themselves of excess cash which made them a less inviting target the woormly buyout was a success from the start the two companies matched up well there was always a demand for the groundsupport planes then came the hellwolf concept whitemark started lifting its eyes to the big leagues there was much more in the report details on the hellwolf speculation about flight trials and cost overruns arguments in the military press over the advantages and disadvantages of the hellwolf versus the sunfire i was still reading when the wheels came down out the window the dark ribbon of the mississippi curled through the lights of the cities separating st paul from minneapolis the redbrick east from the chromeandglass west i caught a cab into st paul the whistler on my lap the cat was out roaming the rooftops when i got home i found a hammer nails and hangers and hung the whistler on the big interior wall of the studio surrounded by the work of friends and personal heroes the other work ranged from simple sketches in india ink to slashing expressionist stuff in electric acrylics the whistler simple as it was dominated them age and power the shamans are right i got a bottle of beer from the refrigerator and walked around and looked at it some more i was still looking when emily knocked at the door youre back she said emily has steelgray hair pulled into a bun at the nape of her neck like a nineteenthcentury english schoolteacher shes usually wrapped in a woolen shawl if it werent for the flinty sparkles in her dark eyes you might take her for whistlers aunt i thought you were gone until tomorrow i heard the pounding and thought i should check cmere i crooked a finger at her she followed me into the studio and spotted the new piece immediately from where she stood she recognized it and said holy shit is it real yeah what have you done nothing yet it must be pretty extreme whatever it is she said she grabbed my upper arm with a surprisingly strong hand i hope you dont get hurt ill be careful i said you want a beer sure when i came back from the kitchen with a longneck leinenkugel her nose was a quarter inch from the sketch little jimmy whistler she said you know he learned to draw at west point flunked out couldnt pass chemistry years later he said if silicon was a gas id be a general now he was probably right he was at west point just before the civil war west pointers got quick promotions we looked at the picture some more and then she went back to her apartment and i went into the study to call bobby what need everything available on whitemark aerospace top execs with personal data access control to all internal computer systems any trouble with the law political connections business connections need soonest will pay big bux hundreds or thousands stop for now at could be much more later may need major backup for big project also need information on rudolph anshiser his secretary maggie kahn assistant named dillon and other key anshiser personnel also data on company leave terminal on receive if i was going to do it id need help a few minutes after midnight i walked into town for a snack when the american fries and eggs were on the grill i stepped across the street to the greyhound station and called long distance to the wee blue inn a beer joint down by the superior docks in duluth a man answered weenie this is him this is the art guy from st paul i came in that time with your girlfriend yeah i need to see her im coming through town tomorrow at two oclock if you see her around let her know yeah i dont know if ill see her sure but if you do okay luellen is a thief she steals only from the rich for the excellent reason that theyre the only people worth stealing from jewelry coin and stamp collections bearer bonds cash shes never ripped off a stereo in her life i met her one hot summer night when she was breaking into a neighboring apartment i was lying in a hammock on the roof outside my living room window lights out looking at the stars i was almost asleep when i heard a clunk at the opposite end of the building it was an odd sounddistinct but furtive i crawled across the tarpaper roof and peered over the edge a slight dark figure was climbing the wall opposite mine a woman moving like a professional gymnast shed thrown a muffled grappling hook over the balcony outside the thirdfloor apartment and was swinging up the rope hand over hand i watched her slip over the balcony rail pause apparently listening then pull the rope up behind her a second later she was at work on the sliding glass doors they were open in less than a minute and i heard a telephone ringing the woman went inside and the ringing stopped the apartment belonged to a fat unpleasant political hack with bad breath and size aaaa feet who delighted in bragging about the strange things he does to hookers in las vegas and sometimes to women who need his help in the city hall turf wars i didnt think id feel too bad if he was hit by a burglar in the next few seconds i went through a onehandotherhand sequence on the one hand i wouldnt mind seeing him hit but on the other hand it was a bad precedent to let my own apartment house get burglarized the word could get around the crack houses that it was an easy target although the woman who had just gone in the window seemed too smooth to be the typical smashandgrab doper on occasion i had gone places uninvited though not usually to steal so much as to look i look at chips plans production schemes the places i had gone were factories and offices never homes or places where people might gather and i always had inside help still watching the thief go into the apartment i felt a spark of collegiality we werent in quite the same business but there were similarities a few seconds after she went through the sliding doors i eased back across the roof and into my apartment i found my autoeverything nikon still loaded with a roll of trix i clipped on the strobe and went back out on the roof two minutes later she appeared when she turned toward me ready to go over the balcony rail i hit her with the strobe she froze probably blinded after the strobe recycled i said hello she looked up at me and i hit her again full in the face then her voice floated across quiet but distinct whos that a neighbor you alone at the moment im thinking about calling the cops dont do that wait there a minute and ill be over will you buzz me in i thought about it thought about the fat fixer and said yeah she went over the balcony rail and down the wall when she was on the ground she did something to the rope and it dropped to her feet she coiled it and turned the corner out of sight it was a full halfminute before i started to feel foolish she wasnt coming back shed be halfway to minneapolis i was actually surprised when the doorbell rang a few minutes later she stood in the hall outside my apartment trying to look earnest while i peered at her through the peephole she was a small woman with an oval face and dark closecropped hair she wore a bright red jacket and jeans are you going to let me in she asked through the door take off your clothes what take off your clothes everything i dont want you bringing in a gun she didnt argue just began peeling off clothes when her underpants came off i opened the door turn around i said she turned around if she was carrying a gun it was hidden under the butterfly tattoo on her left hip i opened the door all the way ease on by and keep your hands away from your clothes i said she walked past me looking me over i picked up the pile of clothes and carried them in behind her look she said as i shook them down there was a pleading note in her voice im a former friend of that asshole over there he had some of my stuff and wouldnt give it back i had to get in please dont tell him hell send his cop friends after me what did you take she cast her eyes down at the floor with a heartbroken sign she said marijuana i kept a stash over there thats why you cant call the cops it was an impressive performance especially done extemporaneously bareass naked in a strangers apartment did you make that story up on the spot or did you think it up days ago just in case or what i asked curiously its the truth bullshit i told you to take off your clothes and you didnt hesitate you stand there with your hands on your hips and dont even pretend to cover up you wouldnt do that to protect a stash not unless youre crazy and look at this jacketbright red reversible to black i saw the way you went up that wall youre some kind of pro she looked at me for a moment and frowned unsure of herself what are we going to do about this she asked there might have been an offer in the question but it wasnt explicit i caught myself staring take a good look sucker she snarled sorry i mumbled i tossed her clothes to her feeling like a pervert when she was dressed we talked she had taken ten thousand in small bills out of the fat mans apartment the money was intended by him as lubricant on a bar license question she had no plans to visit the apartment complex again unless she admitted somebody else showed up with ten thousand in untraceable cash he cant even complain that it was stolen because then he might have to tell somebody like the irs where he got it she said neat i walked back to the kitchen got the nikon rolled the film back popped it out and tossed her the cassette for your scrapbook i said want a beer she did several in fact i had several myself late at night we found ourselves laughing immoderately at some modest witticisms even later she shed her clothes again how come you didnt hit on me when i had my clothes off before she asked propping herself up on a pillow we hadnt been properly introduced i said you were thinking about it maybe since then shes visited me a few times and one cold february we had a pleasant twoweek trip to the bahamas ive visited her a couple of times in duluth which is her hometown where she never steals ive never been to her house or apartment i dont know where it is or even that luellen is her real name shes a pro and shes cautious to the point of paranoia she picks her targets carefullynever anything too big never anything that will attract major attention she takes down or a year some fifty thousand goes into investments she lives modestly on another forty thousand or so and drops the rest on expenses ponies and cocaine every year she pays two thousand to the irs on nonexistent wages from the wee blue inn weenie declares her imaginary salary as a business expense weenie is her phone drop if she was out of town hed have told me that he didnt know where she was since he didnt tell me that she was in town and hed let her know i was coming whether or not she showed up was up to her duluth is a seaport built around the grain and iron ore docks there were two big russian freighters taking on wheat at the docks and a long low ore carrier was headed out the wee blue inn which is neither wee nor blue sits on the first bank level above the lake at the base of the big hill that makes up the heart of the city its the kind of place where the bartender throws sawdust on the floor and calls it decor eggs and sausage float in scumfilled jars on the bar sacks of garlic potato chips and cheese balls hang from wall racks and the mirror was last cleaned in the fifties weenie is fat chews a toothpick and wears a boatshaped white paper hat he was behind the bar when i arrived a few minutes after two back booth he said i got a bottle of beer and headed toward the back luellen was drinking a perrierandlime hows the painting business she asked as i slid into the booth okay hows the burglary business not bad nice and steady any scary moments just one nothing serious so tell me i said i tell her about my unconventional jobs and she tells me about hers therapy she called it she had been tracking a guy in cleveland the manager of three busy fastfood franchises on the interstate every saturday evening he picked up the collections from friday and saturdayall cash no checks accepted most weekends he drove downtown and dropped the moneyas much as twentyfive thousandat his banks night deposit sometimes though when he had a big date with his stewardess girlfriend hed take the friday and saturday receipts back to his apartment where he lived alone and leave it there overnight so im talking to the stewa friend called me about herand she tells me about this guy doesnt like him hes got money all right but hes a little rough and serious about his blow jobs which she doesnt like so much shes looking to dump him so we talk about this and that and she says shell take twenty percent i say okay and she lays a couple of keys on me just a little girltalk i said right so on this one saturday afternoon the stew calls him up and he says whats happenin babes which is the way he talks she hums a few bars from the boogiewoogie bugle boy from company c and he says lets go luellen watched him take the money bag to his apartment ten minutes later hes out of there and i follow i get him with the stew watch them take off downtown and then i head back to his place theres no doorman just the outside key and the apartment key i go up and straight in i get the door open and head for the kitchenthe stew tells me he puts the cash in the refrigerator when hes leaving it overnight and there it is in the freezer im taking it out and all of a sudden theres this voice a mans voice from the

who the hell are you i say tina and come on like his friends secret lover but i act very nervous about being alone with this strange guy make him feel like a bully get out of there luellen had never been caught by the police or done jail time there had been a few close calls even a few actual encounters like the one shed had with me but shed always managed to talk her way out so far we chatted a while longer and finally she popped the question why was i in duluth how much more do you need to retire i asked maybe a quarter million thats another four or five years unless i get lucky or unlucky your coke bill still going up what am i going to do she asked sharply i need it to work i cant do it cold anymore a customer walked past the booth toward the rest rooms in the back and we both shut up until we heard the door close behind him ive got a project i said i havent decided to do it but i might be looking for help me ive got no one else who could do it jeez kidd what are you into its weird but theres a big payroll i get a million and change you get half a million theres another guy ill talk to hell take a quarter i pick up all expenses its illegal but its not stealing nobody gets hurt and ill cover you when the guy pays me i pay you you might have to meet them but they wont know where you come from or who you are she lifted her perrier bottle toward the light and inspected the bubbles that streamed up through it thinking it over thats an awful lot of money kidd she said finally it couldnt be as clean as you say i believe it will be like i said its weird what do you need me for ill want to get into some houses general backup driving cars carrying stuff around maybe some computer stuffid show you how youd have time to think about it a week anyway why dont you do it yourself youve gone into some places never residences ive always been set up from inside i dont know the first thing about breaking into private homes she considered it for a full minute and sighed i dont think i can take another four years she said finally okay tell me about it we spent the night in a holiday inn the next morning i flew to chicago and caught a noon flight to washington on the way i rolled out the tarot cards the fool showed again thats cool i thought thats okay i was at washington national by three oclock and took a cab down to a shabby secondhand business district a place called the sugar exchange judging from the lobby the last white powder exchanged in the place hadnt been sugar dace greeley was locking his thirdfloor office when i came up the stairs hey kidd he said he brought up the shaky remnant of a oncegreat smile he had always been thin even delicate but now he was gaunt in his twenties hed had an odd effect on young women they wanted to take care of him and those who were most likely to be burning their bras in the morning were most likely to be taking care of dace in the evenings it wasnt that he was hustling all the time hed go to a party sit on a couch twenty minutes later the most interesting women in the place were hustling him one told me it was his eyes big dark pools under an unruly shock of black hair his eyes were still dark but now against his starved face they looked almost lemurlike his hair had thinned and was shot through with streaks of gray the last time i heard about him a mutual friend said he was spending his days in outoftheway bars why dont you buy me a drink i suggested as we shook hands sure if you want to crawl through a dive ive got about four dollars on me on the other hand you could buy me a drink and we could go someplace decent okay i said im buying we skipped the aging elevator and took the stairs down youre looking good he said still training shotokan yeah how about you shit do i look like it hey you look like youre doing okay he grabbed my coat sleeve on the bottom landing before we went into the lobby kidd my boy we have had some interesting times together so dont bullshit me i look like a wreck i cant get a reasonable job my wife dumped me and moved to la and i dont blame her lets go have a couple of drinks but no bullshit he was pleading all right but i need to know something right now how bad is the booze you a drunk or what dace laughed a highpitched whinny that wasnt quite a giggle jesus if i was only a drunk id be okay but if i take a fourth drink i puke all over myself cant keep it down the doctor says its an allergy says im lucky okay so lets go have two or three dace worked at the post back in the watergate days when everybody there was young and hot and tough he was an investigator specializing in the pentagon he had a nose for dirt he did one story after another probing the cozy relationship between the generals and the industrial complex then he found a big one a group of ranking army officers helped a defense contractor cover up critical faults in a particular run of artillery shells correcting the problem would cost a bundle the vietnam war was obviously winding down if it had ended soon enough the defective weapons could have been routinely retired and nobody would have known but the war didnt end soon enough a dozen grunts were killed by the friendly fire dace had a leak a disgruntled colonel with some combat ribbons of his own the story was big a brace of generalsa total of three stars worthand a halfdozen colonels found themselves looking for work dace was on his way or so he thought but the pentagon was tired of dace greeley when another story surfaced even bigger than the first dace had it cold and had it exclusively the post ran it big and it turned out to be a figment of someones imagination supporting documents were fraudulent sources denied their quotations dace was held up as an overstepper a reporter more intent on success than on the truth watergate had come along by then with nixons attacks on the press everything had to be squeaky clean the post dropped dace like a hot potato nobody wanted to hear about a conspiracy of military bureaucrats who believes in that kind of fairy tale he went west for a year worked on a solid smaller paper but he wanted washington there were no newspaper jobs so he wound up in public relations he was bad at it but he was cheap and persistent and eventually built a semipermanent relationship with a sportsmens lobbyist group i can live with myself he told me over the first drink you ever think about a book a solid piece of work you could do it whos got the time i have to eat he said ive got alimony im four or five months behind but its out there id need two years to do something right ive got a project i told him its illegal they could put you in jail if you were caught ill cover for you but there arent any guarantees doesnt sound so good he said morosely rattling his ice cubes there are two good reasons to do it i said tell me he held a finger up to the waitress and pointed at our glasses one we fuck over some of those guys who tore you up with the post or guys just like them two you get a quarter million in cash nobody knows where it comes from nobody knows how much you can spend the rest of your life in mexico do six books jesus who do we kill nobody you do research take care of some logistics write some press releases and get them to people wholl read them figure out a way to cover us so nobody will know where theyre coming from do some light typing what the hell are you into kidd his next drink was forgotten and he was watching me closely first tell me what you think he ran his fingers through his thinning hair if its like you make it soundi know you havent given me the details but if its morally like you make it soundid buy it he said id need to know the details the second round came and when the waitress went away i gave him a few chapter the whitemark job if i took it would be the first time i worked with a team teams are bad news if a team is tracked and caught theres always the possibility that a teammate will turn the police have powerful persuaders talk can get you a free ticket out of jail silence can buy you five to ten if another player talks first luellen was a solid choice she was cool actionoriented decisive a pro she methodically calculated the possibilities and consequences of her work she had rehearsed what she would do in virtually any situation she didnt have to rationalize what she was doing she knew she was a thief she focused on being a good one dace was a riskier proposition he was good at what he did but he lived on dreams dreamers lose track of whats going on around them dreamers try to outrun bullets and outshoot cops they move from one act to the next with no assessment of consequences in the phony story that killed him at the post dace never stopped to think what if these people are wrong what if this is all bullshit he had fame at his fingertips he was hot he was on a roll he knew he was right a phone call might have saved him he had some problems but i would take him anyway he would not get a lot of pressure he would mostly do paperwork i also chose him for one of the oldest and least honored of reasons among thieves he was available when i got back to st paul the computer was signaling that it had been accessed bobby i dumped the file to the printer and twenty feet of paper spewed out with the exception of a few things pilfered from the anshiser computers it had all come from public databases most of it had been published in various magazines and newspapers anshiser was a tough guy bobbys report said but hed gotten that way on his own hed never had to fight never been on the streets never been poor his father was a german immigrant who started out at the turn of the century collecting scrap metal in a horsedrawn wagon he wound up as the owner of the biggest junkyards in chicago a couple of steel reprocessing mills and a small airplane company that he let his son play with there was nothing about the way hed jumped from wagon to steel mill but it wasnt important the old man had been dead for more than forty years world war ii turned the airplane company which he had given to his son into a defense industry rudy anshiser came out of the war with more money than the old man when the war ended anshiser moved into the service fields the hotels the vending companies the restaurant franchises he made no movies never bought a sports franchise his wife died in the early seventies and he never remarried in the past few years as he became richer and richer he grew more and more reclusive not a howard hughes exactly but he seldom left his chicago mansion there was more biography including information on his wife and children the wife had been a big benefactor of the chicago institute of arts the children kept every nickel they could lay their hands on and spent most of their days in warmer climates anshisers company computers had routine defense industry security bobby said he had gone in for a look around but had found nothing that interested him it was all design work and perhaps a million pages of clerical records and correspondence he did find references to anshisers accounting company stumbling onto the records of traffic between the companys computer and that of the accountants naturally he followed up tapping into the accountants computer way down in the database bobby found a private file that detailed anshisers cash gifts to the president and dozens of other working politicians if you were given to tsktsking this would be an occasion the president as a midwestern senator had built an image as the plaintalking squaredealing conscience of the senate so he took twenty thousand dollars in a brown paper bag in a ramada inn in des moines tsktsk i carefully tucked away that portion of the printout there was also a report on maggie she was not quite as advertised before the hitch at the university of chicago shed gone to a bad public high school in a pennsylvania steel town her daddy worked at the mill before he disappeared altogether leaving maggie and her mother to get along as best they could after high school she worked for two years with an indianapolis accounting firm and then headed for the university one of the partners in the accounting firm paid the ticket at least for the first four years after that she was hooked up with an economics professor and then with anshiser she was not a secretary except in the oldfashioned british sense on two different occasions shed been dispatched to straighten out troubled companies she had temporarily been the president of the vending subsidiary and when she had it running right interviewed and picked her own replacement she also ran a trashhauling company during an arizona jurisdictional war and won the war outright she did it if bobbys reports were correct in a little more than three months there were problems in that arizona garbage gig trucks burned tires slashed gas tanks blown up will see if can find more but not much around except newspapers while maggie was getting noticed in the business press dillon was the invisible man there was nothing on him except credit reports and a few citations to articles hed written for professional library magazines the credit reports said he was a millionaire in his own right there was a note that said he collected japanese netsukes i read bobbys anshiser material and reread dillons whitemark report sitting in a comfortable leather chair with a light over my shoulder my feet on a hassock looking out over the river in the darkness i needed to think it might be impossible to slow down whitemark without attracting an awful lot of attention from the wrong kind of people but the money i spent the rest of the week painting fishing on the st croix river and working out at the dojo i read dillons report so often that i could recite it by heart luellen called twice with questions dace twice more they were ready to sign up at eight oclock in the morning six days after the flight to chicago i walked up the hill to the dojo the first classes were at noon but the sensei did office work in the morning he came to the outer door when i knocked raised his eyebrows when he saw who it was and let me in without a word i spent two hours on the vacant hardwood floor working on a formal exercise called a kata i know twenty of them more or less i had been working on this one sochin for six months a kata can really cool out the mind when you do a kata right the surface of the brain the intellectual stuff turns off the action is all down in the lizard part where reflexes and instincts are paramount the anshiser job was intriguing the money was a big factor no denying it it would buy a certain kind of freedom a powerfully attractive freedom but that wasnt the only motivating factor of the proposition beyond the money was the game this was a big target with heavy players could i take whitemark out i didnt know maybe if i won i took a major prize if i lost it might be prison interesting stakes to tell the truth i didnt much care what happened to whitemark any more than id been impressed with anshisers talk of people losing their jobs if whitemark won the competition i had spent one and twothirds military tours in vietnam i could remember running down a game trail on the border between south vietnam and laos two hmong were up ahead of me one of them with a stomach wound riding his buddys back an nva hunterkiller team was on our ass and i was screaming for help on the radio the radio kept cutting out i thought it might be the tape antenna i had twisted down my pack straps but i was not inclined to stop and unfold the whip and try that one the nva team was too close and the whip rattles through the overhead when you run because trees and ground contour and everything else can affect radio transmissions id stop at high points and clearings to call and since they were high points and clearings id drop down on my belly to do it and the radios transmitter would cut out the radio worked earlier in the run and i could receive the choppers were calling say again echo say again but everything i transmitted was broken up and unintelligible things were looking so bad that i started calling on the run and i found that as long as i was bolt upright the radio worked it didnt make sense with the nvas maybe a half mile back we climbed a small knoll beside a burnedout village popped some smoke and got a pickup when the chopper was away and a few minutes after the hmong died of his stomach wounds i pried the back off the radio with a knife and looked inside spare change the asshole who did the final assembly left two dimes and a penny inside the protective box every time i went down the penny skidded out on an electronics board and shorted it out when i stood up the penny fell into the bottom of the box and the radio worked there are more stories like that hundreds of them everybody in nam had a story about the stuff we worked with and the stuff we ate the gear that rotted the mortar rounds that fell short the early mls that jammed in firefights the crations that included four cans of limas and ham and nothing else but a pack of lucky strike greens which had been manufactured in world war ii when i saw that loose change rattling around in the radio i decided the whole damn defense industry could take a flying leap i havent changed my mind all this cooked down in the lizard brain while i worked through the kata through the difficult stances the slow pressing moves and the impossible sidekicks when i finished i was sweating hard the sensei who looked in from time to time said with hard work i should have it under control in two or three more years in another sport the comment might have been sarcastic not in shotokan he was absolutely sincere it may have been the nicest thing he ever said to me after the workout i hit the makiwara board fifty times with each hand showered walked back to the apartment i called weenie he called luellen and she called back five minutes later and signed up i called dace and he was ready to go then i called anshiser and told him id take the job with one more condition what he asked i write the contract you sign it and fingerprint it and i stash it it will be straightforward and incriminating no wherefores or parties of the second part it might not be binding in court but it will bind your ass if you leave us stranded out there agreed ill there tomorrow ill want the first million ill want it early enough to get to a bank make it about one oclock at the house itll take the morning to get it together he said what im moving dont dump to apartment ill call ok ok got about names addresses telephones for whitemark execs who may use home terminals goes slow getting positives on addresses confirming computers how long to finish tomorrow good money ok so far charged theres more if you need it ok goodbye it took a good part of the day to close the apartment down i dumped the garbage cleaned out the refrigerator and put together a basic watercolor kit for road work emily agreed to take care of the cat and the whistler and to pick up mail and pay utility bills i gave her an envelope full of cash to cover it before leaving i spread the cards again the wheel of fortune reversed was dominant that told me nothing i knew that just after dark i rolled onto interstate in my twoyearold oldsmobile its a big clumsy car with lots of power comfortable seats and a large trunk where eyecatching gearterminals printers cameras painting equipmentcan be stashed out of sight i tuned in wls and let the fifty thousand clearchannel watts of rock n roll suck me down the highway toward chicago chapter i spent the early morning at the art institute rembrandt didnt paint young girl at an open halfdoor like the museum says he did but i like it anyway and even if you dislike pointillism georges seurats sunday afternoon on the оle de la grande jatte is a masterwork when i see it i tend to hyperventilate its like looking down that marvelous wall of degass paintings at the met as usual i overstayed my time and had to race across town to meet luellen at ohare she was wearing a tan summer suit with slacks a touch of lipstick and a white panama hat that snapped down over her eyes we picked up her bags and went downtown and rented safety deposit boxes at the second illinois afterward i dropped her at my hotel while i went to anshisers maggie met me at the door and took me up the money was in a small fakeleather suitcase on anshisers desk the contract he asked his voice trembled and he cleared his throat dillon was back in his chair against the wall still dressed in gray still showing the small smile right here i handed him a letter of employment it clearly spelled out what i was to do he read it and passed it to maggie who looked at it nodded and handed it back that should do it he said he took a pen from his coat pocket and signed and dated our agreement now the fingerprints i said i took a stamp pad from my pocket and handed it to him this will be messy he said a small price hmph he rolled his fingers across the pad and onto the paper leaving a row of neat fat fingerprints below his signature both hands one is fine maggie handed him a purse pack of kleenex to clean his fingers the money he said he pushed the case toward me its all there one million one hundred thousand dollars twenties and fifties nonsequential it came right out of the cash box at one of our casinos you can count it if you wish i popped open the locks peered in and shut it again ill count it later i said you want some kind of progress report go ahead he leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms over his stomach now the executive listening to a subordinate i told him id hired two associates and had begun processing names from dillons report i outlined a couple of methods of attack told him wed be working out of the washington area and that i would call him every few days with reports when i finished he looked at dillon at maggie and back to me we have a request he said what we want maggie to work with you to see what youre doing how its done she wont interfere unless it looks like youre getting carried away what im saying iswed like to keep some oversight i looked over at maggie and thought about bobbys report on her she looked back a level gaze no smile i run the show i said to anshiser its my ass on the line i dont care if she observes but ill give her only one option she can pull the plug if she says kill the program we kill it but she doesnt tell us how to run it thats all we ask anshiser said he pointed a finger at her if theres any sign of trouble you get out right speaking of trouble anshiser said to me a cold note in his voice let me say a few words to the wise do not try to steal this money from us mr kidd we want performance if you cant perform say so but you must try i wont be stolen from im not threatening to break your legs should you abscond but a billion dollars can purchase a world of legal and financial trouble for anyone id choose to pick on understood fine i said i picked up the money bag a million dollars it was lighter than id expected a friend and i are leaving for washington tomorrow ill get back to you when weve got a place maggie can fly out then good luck anshiser said standing and extending a hand his hand felt cool and damp and mealy like tightly wound wet tissue paper i shook it dropped it hastily and left partners in crime maggie said in the hallway i hope youre well paid i said this will be a major event im well taken care of she said i opened my mouth and quickly shut it what were you going to say a wisecrack i said youre not deferential she said looking up at me with mild amusement whyd you hold back i shrugged my mouth sometimes gets me into trouble with women i like im trying to be friendly and it comes out wrong you like me i looked into her cool green eyes i could youre bright and mean as a snake those are decent recommendations she laughed out loud the first time id ever heard her do it it sounded nice unrehearsed a million bucks luellen said in a reverent tone we could be in brazil in eight hours the money was spread on the hotel bed so we could look at it count it check serial numbers and run our fingers through it when we were satisfied that it was all there we packed it into three bags there was for me for luellen and for dace we put the hundred thousand of expense money in with daces cash a hundred thousand for expense money luellen said she looked at it looked at me and started giggling when she finally stopped we checked out of the hotel dropped our personal shares at the bank and mailed the safety deposit keys back homemine to emily and hers to somebody in duluth i didnt ask who and didnt tell her where mine went the rest of the money less a few thousand for pocket and purse went into a small hidden box just forward of the spare tire well in the trunk of the car late in the afternoon armed with the chicago tribunes want ads we drove around the suburbs and paid cash for two used kaypro ibmcompatible computers and a toshiba printer then we drove south made the big turn at gary and headed for washington you sure about this friend of yours in washingtondace luellen asked im sure hes got a place for us yes furnished telephones dishes the whole works we can move in the same day how much two thousand a week she whistled thats steep its a special deal the landlord runs a call girl operation for the pentagon brass in alexandria the apartments are for the girls but he let dace have one hes a crook himself so he wont talk to anyone there wont be any records there wont be any receipts he wont be around wont see our faces he stays out of sight himself personal cars are invisible in america as long as you dont buy gas on credit cards or get traffic tickets and if you drive off the main interstate highways down into the midsized towns when youre looking for a motel you can find one where all transactions are done in cash they dont want to see a visa card they dont check your license plate to see if you wrote down the right number hand over forty dollars in advance and theyre satisfied there was a reason for our caution despite what anshiser said about the powers of political protection it was still possible that he didnt understand the magnitude of what we were doing a computer attack on a major corporation is a technologicalage nightmare if word of a corporate war got out to the computer community the reaction could be violent some very unpleasant people could come looking for us given that possibility the whole job was best done with as few personal traces as possible we took out time getting to washington and talked about the attack so if things started to get hairy luellen said you might not even need me around at all especially toward the end right you could take off you could probably take off anyway your job will be right up front before the attack starts id like you to hang around for a while but you wont have to stay until the end id like to know how it comes out youll know one way or the other i said either ill call you and tell you or youll read all about it in the newspapers you fill me with confidence she said luellen was pleasant company she didnt feel pressure to talk all the time in the evenings after dinner we would catch a movie on home box office and afterward make love a reasonably athletic event that made a nice transition into sleep we were feeling almost domestic by the time we got to washington we arrived in the late afternoon on a hot damp thursday our new headquarters was in a pretty neighborhood of narrow green lawns neatly trimmed hedges and tastefully shabby private homes interspersed with wellkept apartments the apartment buildings were mostly of dark brown or wheatcolored brick tenant parking was tucked discreetly behind screens of bridal wreath or in reproduction carriagehouse garages with weathered wood siding at the address dace had given us we parked the car in a guest slot the building was a long twostory rectangle with the narrow end toward the street there were four separate entrances each with eight apartment numbers above the outer door we went to the door nearest the front of the building a call phone hung on the wall of the entry i dialed the apartment and dace buzzed us in nice luellen said as we stepped inside this is the kind of place i might do a job a heavy winered carpet covered the lobby floor setting off the greenfigured wallpaper four oak doors led off the hall between the two on the right was an elevator our apartment was on the second floor on the right as we came out of the elevator from the outside it would be the second apartment in on the back side of the building away from the driveway i rapped on the door and dace answered hey kidd he said he was barefoot in khaki shorts and a golf shirt he stepped back and looked curiously at luellen as we shook hands id told him other people were involved but hadnt mentioned who dace this is luellen luellen dace they said pleasedtomeetyous and i said luellen is uh a spacial intrusion engineer what a burglar said luellen oh dace wiggled his eyebrows and looked interested well come on in and look around from where i was standing i could see a kitchen with a dining area and a comfortable living room with overstuffed couches facing a console television the fabric wallpaper was done in a discreet gold figure over beige and nineteenthcentury british sporting prints hung on the walls a hallway led back to the bathrooms and bedrooms pretty nice i said a little classier than i expected dace shrugged hes got an upscale business cant have the place looking like a cathouse you order the furniture already here in the big bedroom he led the way to the rear of the apartment there were four bedrooms with a bath off each the master bedroom had been converted to a neat and efficient office with a big library table in the middle and four office chairs facing it a telephone perched on one end what happened to the bed i asked he took it down the hall he owns the whole building is there another phone yeah four more one in each bedroom and one in the living room theres a separate line for each jesus you could run a book out of here luellen said i thought about getting somebody to move the phones but then i figured maybe you would want to do it good the fewer people who see this place the better i said in an hour the whole thing was set up i moved a second phone into the office hooked both lines through the portables and set up the printer i tested it by calling bobby what i gave him the new number got a dump want now sure set to receive two minutes later i had the files in the memory of one of the computers and dumped them to the printer the printer took another five minutes to print out two copies ive never seen a computer working luellen said looking over my shoulder as i stripped paper off the printer dace was in the kitchen making coffee what is all that stuff names addresses phone numbers and background information on whitemark executives plus a few people who have home computer terminals we might want to get at thats where you come in we steal their computers no no we just steal the information they keep on their computer disks i dont know what that means a computer disk is like magnetic recording tape except that its flat like a phonograph record the information is stored on the disk in the form of magnetic markers when we play the disk into the computer the computer translates the markers into letters and puts them on the screen so were going to steal the disks i hope not we can use the computers to copy them it takes a minute or two to make each copy id rather copy the disks and leave the originals in place so nobody will know that we took anything dace came back with the coffee so whats next he asked i want to look at this stuff and do some thinking i said why dont we call it a day ill brief both of you tomorrow morning what we do first where all of that dace nodded nine good think it would be all right if i went downtown and looked at the washington monument and the capitol and everything luellen asked ive never seen them i shrugged sure go ahead ill show you around dace offered when they were gone i started working through the printout it was neatly done dozens of names with some personal backgroundappearance credit ratings marital status type of automobile luellen got back about ten oclock yawned and said she was going to bed i went back a half hour later to get a copy of the whitemark report id left on the chest of drawers and found that we were no longer sleeping together luellen had moved to another bedroom curious i poked my head into her room the lump on the bed was too quiet to be asleep uh do we have a problem she half rolled toward me so i could see a crescent of her face in the hallway light no i just thought this would be better as long as were like going into combat does dace have anything to do with this there was a moment of silence hes an awful nice guy she said in a small voice he wants to go to mexico and write youre going with him i dont know nothing happened tonight if thats what youre asking she sounded a bit frosty like she was about to claim she wasnt that kind of girl but couldnt since we both knew she was hes a nice guy i like him okay just asking i said turning away from the door kidd she called i stepped back i like you an awful lot too she said now she sounded sad but youre not a nice guy i always wanted you know a nice guy gee thanks no really do you think youre a nice guy i had to think about that for a minute was i a nice guy the question had never occurred to me see luellen said in the lengthening silence sometimes im sure i dont relate well to women there always seem to be a couple around but they always leave luellen i thought would be different she was as selfcontained as i was we fit well together we each thought the other was interesting we didnt talk too much didnt rub anything i went back to my bedroom accepting the change of condition but when my undershirt came off i found myself wadding it up and pitching it at the wall like a fastball the next morning dace showed up at nine oclock with a package under his arm and a look of mild embarrassment on his face he walked casually through to the office bedroom and couldnt quite contain a look of satisfaction when he saw the rumpled blankets in luellens bedroom ah i see he said when he noticed me noticing him yeah dont worry about it you must have hit it off last night a fascinating woman he said were talking about mexico afterward so i hear luellen came out of the kitchen with a cup of coffee are my ears burning just straightening out administrative details i said details repeated dace say we got a box he handed it to me the box had no return address but the postmark indicated that it came from a california friend of mine who operates an electronics specialty business he usually works from a rented garage and his appliances are very very expensive tools i said lets start sorting things out chapter what need fix on murs give me numbers cant be simple patch will do cutout ok how much k ok the phone company keeps computer records of local phone calls hackers call them muthers for message unit records if a hacker uses his home phone for illegal computer entries and the law gets interested the phone company can check his muthers to see when and to where he made calls once whitemark realized that their computer was under attack they would call in federal investigators the feds with their grays could sweep the washington muthers looking for a pattern of calls to whitemark if bobby did a simple software patch one that tells the muther computer to ignore calls from this number the feds might find the patch and read the number right off it i told luellen so whats he going to do hell rig a cutout every time we dial out the call will be assigned to a random number thats what muther will record he can do that from wherever he is i dont know he might hire a tech out here but for the price i doubt it i think he does it from wherever he is murs out w random bypass thanx we ready for backup ill get back we would attack whitemark in two ways we would enter the companys computer system and alter it some of the changes would be subtle some crude the damage would be extensive as the computer breakdown got whitemark into deeper and deeper trouble wed open the second front dace would leak word of the companys problems through the pentagon rumor mills and the defense press if it was done right whitemarks credibility would crumble and with it hellwolfs but first we had to get into the whitemark computers defense industries like whitemark have physical security ranging from adequate to pretty tight fortunately for the craft of industrial espionage they do have weak points one of them is greed they like the idea of their engineers and key managers working at home those people inevitably have home terminals with phone links to the main computer center the existence of those outside terminals creates a paradoxical problem for the computer centers on the one hand if nonexperts like engineers or accountants are going to use the computers the computers have to be friendlyeasy to enter and easy to use on the other hand if theyre too friendly a bunch of hackersor spies if paranoias your stylecould get in and trash the system the usual answer is a tough but thin security screen there are a number of different techniques for building the screens but most are based on coded access the home users of the system would have entry codes to get into the whitemark computers we had to have the codes we had to steal them the only way to do that was to get into the users homes we could copy the codecarrying software and leave behind a concealed bug that would relay computer traffic if the whole business looked like an ordinary burglary no one would suspect that computer security had been penetrated once we had the codes though we had to start using them because the damn things expire and once we attacked the whitemark computer we had to keep the attack rolling when whitemark figured out what was happening they would isolate the computer system and shut us out it was a matter of doing everything at once it wasnt good but there was no choice bobbys research turned up a long list of potential burglary targets dace knew washington like only a local newsman can and luellen crossexamined him on street layouts crime rates and landscaping styles as we narrowed the list of prospects to a dozen bobby went into the credit companies and pulled out full reports on the primary targets late in the afternoon with the list down to a handful of solid possibilities and their files in hand we broke for dinner i drove luellen in the front seat beside me dace in the back as we stopped at the curb cut before entering the street luellen reached over and touched my hand on the steering wheel while turning to look at dace okay guys she said smiling i dont want anybody to look but when we came out the door there was a guy sitting in the drivers seat of that green van up the street i think he was looking for us in his outside mirror and when we came out he looked back at us now hes not in the drivers seat anymore hes not around i think hes in the back of the van watching us asked dace not looking at the van it was thirty feet up the street on the opposite side im paranoid said luellen i got a funny vibe when he looked at us it was like our eyes met we cant just sit here i said i looked both ways and turned down the street toward the van dace you look luellen said like youre talking to me but look past my head and see if theres anybody in the front seat we passed the van and dace grunted nobody shit said luellen maybe the guy was just getting out when you saw him and he left while we were walking to the car dace suggested nope i said looking in the rearview mirror the van just pulled out hes coming after us the van driver waited until there was another car between us then fell in behind luellen casually turned her head and watched for a few seconds and then turned back to me what the fuck is this kidd she demanded i dont know we havent made a move yet youve been doing the computer stuff could the cops be monitoring already no thats too paranoid i said there are probably a half million data transmissions every day in this town she watched the van for another minute well then what she asked impatiently i dont know but hes breaking off whoever he is i said the van had followed a few blocks but as we approached a traffic light at a major intersection it slowed waited for two additional cars to get between us then did a uturn and headed back toward the apartment i took a left drove a block took another left and headed back after it go past the apartments and come back from the other side they wont be looking in that direction luellen said when we got back the van was parked on the street directly in front of the building a tall man in green maintenance coveralls was just getting out of the back and when he slammed the door the van pulled another half block up the street and stopped so there are two of them luellen said the outside guy is a lookout the inside man has a radio or maybe a beeper so now what asked dace luellen looked at me our security must be fucked she said its not right i repeated for somebody to be onto us itd have to be the biggest coincidence in the world so what are we doing dace asked a million bucks i said i thought about it we dont even know if were the targets if we are and we can take the guy inside we might find out whats going on we havent broken any serious laws yet if we catch a guy in the place and talk to him we might find out exactly where we stand and he might not be in there at all we better move if were gonna do it luellen said id be surprised if hes in there for more than five minutes i shook my head thats if hes burglarizing the place if hes tossing it looking for something specific about us or if hes putting in bugs hell be a little longer any ideas about that lookout sure i need a phone luellen said there was a phone box on the side of a recreation center two blocks away luellen called the cops and then came running back i told them that the guy in the green van picked up a little girl outside the rec center and took her down the street she said when she climbed back in the car theyll have a car here in a minute thatd be a top priority call the squad car actually arrived less than a minute later we waited on a side street when the squad went by i pulled around the block and went up an alley into the back entrance of the apartment parking lot the cops had the van driver in the street dace you wait here i said over my shoulder if luellen doesnt come down in five minutes exactly you get the cops up there why dont i come up he asked anxiously i dont have time to argue i said luellen followed me into the building and we took the steps to the second floor at the door to the apartment luellen put her finger to her lips listened for a few seconds then checked the door lock scratches she said pressing her lips close to my ear they werent there before they could come from an oldstyle automated lockpick can we get inside i whispered back hell hear us coming if hes armed were in trouble will he take the elevator or the stairway stairs lets go back there we walked back to the stairs and shut the steel fire door you better go down and tell dace were okay i said ill wait here and try to take him when he comes through the door there was a small mechanical sound from beyond the fire door too late luellen said hes coming shit get down the stairs out of sight luellen scrambled down the concrete steps and stopped below the next landing i stood behind the fire door and waited if the person coming down the hall was one of the alleged hookers who frequented the place or a pentagon general this would be embarrassing but it wasnt the guy who came through the door was slender anemic with thin blond hair and pale watery eyes he was wearing coveralls and carrying the toolbox he pushed the door open with his right hand and his body was into the doorway before he saw me his eyes widened and his mouth dropped open and i pivoted and kicked the door as hard as i could a good solid karatestyle thrust kick that smashed the steel door into his body and the side of his head his tool case fell its contents spilled over the landing as the door rebounded off him and he half stumbled i kicked a leg out from under him and rode him down to the concrete he put out his hands to break his fall and i got a knee in his back and an arm around his throat fight and ill break your fuckin neck i said luellen had come back up the stairs and i said tell dace she turned to go and froze a ratfaced guy was on the landing he had eyes like ball bearings and was pointing a small black pistol at my forehead let him go motherfucker ratface said he had a highpitched raggededged voice like a chalk squeak but there was nothing ragged or shaky about the black hole at the end of the pistols barrel it was cold and round and absolutely steady i stood up and the guy beneath me got to his hands and knees sobbing saying jesus christ scooping his gear back into his toolbox except for a few pairs of pliers screwdrivers and some black plastic tape the equipment was all electrical and mostly illegal who the fuck are you i asked ratface luellen looked like she was ready to make a move but i put out a hand and she relaxed shut up the hole at the end of the barrel never wavered when the techs box was packed he stood up shot me a fearful look and scurried down the stairs past ratface the gunman backed down after him the gun steady on my face were walking out he said dont come after us we heard the door slam below then the fire door opened above us dace what happened to you i asked him the second guy came in right on top of us with a gun christ the cops talked to him for a couple seconds and then they left i mean they just got in their car and drove away about one second later this guy was running over here i never had a chance to get in front of him i was too far away i took the elevator up i was hoping that if you were inside hed stop in the stairwell and wait or something howd he get in the door key dace said probably had keys to the outer door but not to the apartment thats how they got into the stairwell too luellen said she looked at me we all fucked up its not daces fault i said somethings really fouled up this guy wasnt a burglar he was a wire man and i cant believe that somebodys already on us it must come out of chicago in the apartment we packed and i took the phones apart they were bugged the bugs were crude and so was the installation he wasnt in here long enough to do much more i said we could probably sweep the place and wed be okay lets check chicago luellen said she had packed everything she brought with her she wasnt planning to come back we moved into a holiday inn for the night when i called chicago maggie was vehement about her security theres no possibility of a leak here she said flatly three people know about your teamme rudy and dillon period and none of us would talk its more likely this guy dace is the problem i dont think so we go back too far i said you dont know though no i dont but hes a friend my instinct tells me hes okay he was scared today and surprised i tell you the problem isnt here she insisted i still cant believe they just stumbled over us i said if we cant figure this out well have to call it off christ just hold on for a couple of days ill get dillon checking there was a longish pause and then she said thoughtfully say do you suppose this might be some kind of leakage from the previous tenants didnt you say it was some kind of whorehouse something like that i said i thought about it it made some sense at least better sense than the other possibilities whats the landlords name i gave it to her and she told me she would get back to us that night i worked the tarot luellen and dace came to argue huddle together and watch me turn cards that tarot shit is spooky dace said after a while its okay luellen said she looked at me tell him about it i use it to game i said shortly what the hell does that mean i looked at a spread of cards dominated by minor swords distress tension they got that right i turned to dace back in seventynine i was hired by an astrologer to put together an astrology program preparing an astrology chart is all mechanical figuring moon rises and stuff i thought it took years to learn how to do it dace said thats the interpretation of the chart the chart itself is fixed anyway a computer can do the mechanical part as well as a humanbetter really because it doesnt make computational errorsand save a lot of time so i had to build a scanner to scan the ephemeristhats the book with the actual astronomical information in it when the planets rise and set and all that then i had to work out another program to scan it in again with a second method so we could compare the two bunches of data to crosscheck for errors it was a hell of a job it took weeks anyway this astrologer fooled around with the tarot and i got interested you tell the future no almost everything you read about the tarot is bullshit but if you take the cards as archetypes for different kinds of human motives and behaviors it becomes a kind of wargaming system i said so what does that do dace asked when a person looks at a problem its always in a particular context most of the time hes blinded to possible answers by his own prejudices and by the environment around him by gaming a problem youre forced outside your prejudices so our question is why do we have a security problem id never think that luellen was the problem i trust her but maybe luellen got caught in that apartment back in cleveland and maybe she has a federal indictment that i dont know about and when i got in touch with her and explained what i wanted to do maybe she went to the us attorney and cut a deal or could be bobbys got a legal problem and he cut a deal the cards throw out random possibilities and then you lay back and think about them i didnt cut a deal luellen said i know how do you know dace asked i mean just as an example ive seen luellen do her act she wasnt acting today she was about to take on that gun we all thought about that for a minute thats weird dace said finally do you ever do just an oldfashioned magic reading i can i dont do it often doesnt work he asked curiously no just the opposite it does seem to work and that worries me why because i dont believe in that shit i said maggie called just before midnight you said the man with the gun was short and ratfaced with a brush cut yeah what about the other man was he kind of tall and wimpy kind of thin and nervous yeah whered you get that from theyre private detectives from washington at least the ratfaced one is the blond guy works for him they do divorce work what do they want with us nothing the landlord says he had another runin with these guys a couple of months ago theyre chasing after some general who used to meet a woman in the apartment youre using thats a pretty pat answer i said after a minute thats what the guy said the landlord you can go on over and meet him tomorrow hes pissed hell talk to ratface tomorrow he says hell get them off your back hes going to tell them the apartment is leased to a private computersecurity group working out of the pentagon and that you want to go after them with the fbi he says thatll take them out this detective supposedly has a bad reputation with the feds and he wont mess with anything that smells like government security i dont know i said but it sounded reasonable it would account for the archaic bugging equipment and what luellen said was an oldfashioned lockpick ill have to talk to the other two theyre pretty spooked look find another place if you want but get on the job this was just a bizarre coincidence talk to the landlord that night with daces suggestive questioning in the back of my head i did a magic layout with the tarot i got the seven of swords overlaying the emperor in a crucial position later i knew what it meant but then it was too late dace agreed to talk to the landlord the next morning while i went out and bought a commercial bug detector you can buy them across the counterjust another necessary appliance in washington like vcrs and compactdisc players im pretty shaky about this luellen said as we went back in the building no reason i said we havent done anything detectably criminal yet if we see any problem at all up here we walk away we didnt find anything i took the bugs out of the phones checked the lines then went over the rest of the place inch by inch with the scanner nothing were clean i said finally he wasnt up here long enough to do more than the phone certainly nothing so sophisticated that it would be completely invisible and wouldnt show up on this i waved the scanner at her luellen was skeptical but when dace came back from meeting the landlord he seemed convinced im pretty sure he was telling the truth ratfaces name is frank morelli the other guy is a phone technician he brings in on some of his cases they tried to get in once before nine weeks ago chasing this pentagon guy the pentagon guy drops his mistress like a hot rock but he was back here last week for a party morelli must have been watching him and figured it started up again so he talked to them yeah he says morelli used to be a cop thats how he got around those cops we sicced on him he pulled out his private eye card and mentioned a few names and told them he was on a job they said okay and took off so what do you want to do i asked looking at luellen youre the skeptical one if you dont want to do it well call it off she chewed on a thumbnail a half million bucks she said yeah all right she said she pointed a finger at me but one more problem and im outa here we havent done enough research on these guys luellen said it was the next day and she was draped over an easy chair looking at the final list of whitemark burglary targets all of them bobby thought had access to whitemark computers from their homes were going in semiblind it bothers me we dont have time for more i said if you get caught the whole job goes up in smoke said dace from his perch on the arm of a couch he had a tin can of prince albert in one hand and a pinch of tobacco between the thumb and forefinger of the other thats why luellens here to keep risks to a minimum but youre not taking her advice dace argued she said we need more research youre pushing to go in now he was right but there was no help for it every day that passed brought whitemarks version of string closer to completion if we didnt move quickly there wouldnt be any point in doing it at all look couldnt we spend a week scouting all of them and then pick the best two or three dace asked we dont have a week i said we have to take our best shot and go into the computers and see where we are maybe well only need one or two and all the other scouting would be a waste of time but wait a minute wait a minute luellen said waving us down it makes me nervous but i didnt say we couldnt do it we have to be careful thats all i dont like it dace said i hate sitting around here i wish i could come along and drive or something anything we already talked about that having you along wouldnt help itd only make things worse luellen snapped lets just work on this list okay we wanted to do three specific things inside the whitemark computers we wanted to interfere with the programs used to design the hellwolf we wanted to destroy whitemark administrative systems and we wanted to attack the computer itself to fundamentally bollix up the way it operated the best way to do that was to get the entry codes of the top systems programmer with those codes we would be able to move through the whole system but going after a systems man was dangerous computer experts are paranoically sensitive about security if we broke into the top mans house he might change his codes as a matter of routine it would take only a few minutes and he could do it himself so why not instead of going after the systems programmer first i decided to go after an engineer and a manager and hope we could get into the programming levels through their terminals we want a suburban neighborhood of singlefamily houses not an apartment complex because there are fewer people around we dont want kids because kids get sick and stay home from school or come home at odd times and if there arent any kids both the husband and wife are probably out during the day at work luellen said ticking off the points on her fingers if the neighborhood and the house are right the ebberly woman ought to be our top target bobbys credit report says her husband is an executive with the postal service which is a ninetofive job the other ones where the husband works for whitemark and the wife works somewhere else its hard to tell how important they are they could be working late shifts or early shifts so we go for the woman the personnel evaluator samantha ebberly samantha and frank i said luellen nodded well give them first look anyway that night i did a few spreads with the tarot but couldnt find anything significant the fool was in hiding we left the apartment at nine oclock the next morning the day was already thick and sultry with thin morose clouds sliding off to the south we were dressed in tennis whites and court shoes we carried tennis bags with racket handles sticking out of the side pockets white folks think burglars are these big black dudes with panty hose on their heads who come in the middle of the night they wont look twice at a white couple walking around at ten oclock in the morning with tennis rackets luellen said while we were buying the equipment we put the crowbar and the bolt cutters the gloves and your tools and the electronic stuff in the bottom of the bags if theres a problem we ditch the bags and jog back to the car jogging is one way you can run in the burbs without a single soul paying attention to you the ebberlys lived in falls church virginia in a neighborhood of uppermiddleclass ranch homes and bungalows the streets had names like willow lane and crabapple court and twisted endlessly back on each other like a ball of twine there were sailboats in the side yards basketball hoops on garages heavy black barbecue grills on brick and stone patios the houses were separated by tall hedges and lines of weeping willows we drove by the ebberlys home and luellen looked it over it feels empty she said the house was a twostory splitentry design with evergreen bushes on either side of the front door she was pleased by the layout i like those shrubs they cut off the view from the side these streets are good too with the curves theres nobody right across the street looking at the targets front door gives you some extra privacy to work we went by a second time she took out a pair of compact leitz binoculars and scanned the place you look for lumps of dark green grass in the backyard especially along the fences luellen said idly if they have a dog and he does his business in the yard therell be dark clumps of grass like pimples its not a sure thing but it can warn you off there was nothing satisfied by the house we drove six blocks out to a convenience store where we had seen a driveup phone checking the list from bobby she called the ebberlys at their separate offices samantha came on and luellen rattled the receiver a few times and hung up frank wasnt in his office but had been just a minute ago he was probably down the hall for coffee according to the woman who answered the phone but he had an appointment coming up so he should be right back luellen promised to call in fifteen minutes get my bag she said i reached into the backseat for her bag as she dropped another coin into the phone who now i asked the house she listened while the ebberlys house phone rang thirty times then glanced around the parking lot sure that nobody was watching she took a pair of compact bolt cutters from the tennis bag and nipped off the phone receiver lets go she said tossing the receiver in the backseat lets do it youre sure goddamnit lets do it she snarled luellen carries no excess fat and now her face muscles stood out in bundles she slipped a packet of white powder out of her purse carefully tipped some on a matchbook and snorted it up you want some no good stuff she said itll give you an edge ive got an edge i said then drive as i pulled out of the parking lot she retrieved the amputated receiver from the backseat and stuffed it out of sight in the glove compartment if you cut the receiver off nobody will try to use the pay phone she explained that means nobody will hang it up so the phone should still be ringing at the ebberlys when we get there if theres nobody home right we stopped at a neighborhood park two blocks from the target both tennis courts were occupied we did some stretches got the bags and walked down the street toward the ebberlys when we get there we turn right in i knock if somebody comes to the door we ask where the park is if we hear the phone and nobody answers the knock you back up so i can get at the door i pop it and we go in keep everything slow she said quietly as she talked her head turned from the street up to me and back to the street her smile switched on and off the perfect rhythm for a friendly husbandwife talk on the way home from a tennis game the streets were eerily quiet for a nice summer day no kids no cars its an older suburb one of my favorite situations luellen said young families cant afford it the people who moved here when the houses were cheap are in their forties and fifties their kids are growing up theres nothing to do here during the day so the teenagers take off for work or go into the city or out to the beaches its empty nobody home she glanced up at me and grinned youre twitching ill be okay i said irritably the words were strangled in my own ears its a trip she said she put her hand up to her face as though she were coughing and took another hit on the cocaine nothing moved along the street as we came up to the house luellen looked casually around lets do it she said hoarsely halfway up the drive we could hear the phone ringing on the front step luellen pushed the doorbell with a knuckle and then knocked nothing she took a silent dog whistle from her pocket and blew on it hard there was no answering bark probably okay she said looking around again wed been at the door for fifteen seconds she took a short curved bar from the tennis bag and i stepped back to cover her with my body she shoved one end of the bar in the crack between the door and the jamb and threw her full weight against it there was a loud crack and the door popped open goddamn that was loud i muttered nobody ever looks she said she pushed the door open with the back of her hand and we stepped inside we were in a short hall off the living room the kitchen was to the left with coffee cups and cereal bowls still on the table the living room was furnished with a couch and easy chair a piano a couple of tables there was a cheap art barntype oil painting over the couch lets move get the gloves on luellen said she handed me a pair of latex surgeons gloves from the tennis bag the computers probably upstairs in this kind of house she said you go up there check all the bedrooms before you do anything ill check the basement as i headed up the stairs she picked up the phone in the kitchen to kill the ringing the computer was in a converted bedroom i checked the rest of the rooms found nobody and went back to the computer it was a standard ibmat with a hayes modem an inexpensive plastic disk box sat next to it i brought the computer up and started flipping through the disks all but three were neatly labeledword perfect lotus files and so on the three unlabeled disks were from different manufacturers so ebberly probably kept track of the contents simply by remembering the brand names i took a box of blank disks and a special diskcracking program of my own out of the tennis bag when the computer came up i loaded my cracker disk and stripped the directory out of the first unnamed disk games i loaded one to make sure and a popular baseball game flashed on the screen pirated of course i killed it and shoved in a second disk it was a custom communications program after a little manipulation it coughed up a short list of sevenletter words code words thats the baby i muttered to the machine it took two minutes to duplicate the disk on one of my blanks as i made the copy luellen was working in the other parts of the house from the sound of it she was trashing the place but there was no time to look when the code disk was copied i dropped it in my bag and pushed in the third disk more games i put in another disk labeled as files i opened one and found personal letters i opened another and an accounting program showed a list of personal accounts the ebberlys were doing well according to the accountsand i was pretty sure that they werent being clever with mislabeled disks as i put the original disks back in the storage box luellen came to the door she was panting hows it going halfway there i said she nodded and disappeared and i looked at the phone outlet where the modem was plugged in it was a standard at t connection i got a screwdriver from the tennis bag removed the wall plate and pulled out the tangle of wires behind it it took a minute to find the right wires isolate them and strip a halfinch length off each the bug a piece of exotic hardware about the size of a beer bottle cap clipped onto the bare wires the work was not difficult but it was delicate every move took an eternity when it was done i put the wall plate back in place and screwed it in tight if a knowledgeable phone tech took the plate off the bug was hanging there like a great fat leech with any luck it wouldnt happen for years weve been in ten minutes thats my personal record luellen said from the door her face was screwed tighter than id ever seen it right im done i threw all the tools back in the tennis bag and wiped my forehead on a shirtsleeve christ im falling out let me in there luellen said she pulled open the drawers in the file cabinets and dumped the papers on the floor like we were looking for money she said lets go we walked back to the front door where she picked up her tennis bag carry mine she said its heavy i stripped off my gloves and took her bag it felt like an anchor was stuffed inside whats in here i asked guns what pistols heaters rods gats you know guns one of the ebberlys is a collector why take them if we get stopped because this is supposed to be a horseshit smashandgrab burglary looking for money dope jewelry one inch up from a stereo thief she said as we stepped out on the porch she carefully pulled the door shut behind us from ten feet away it would look intact nobody but a real specialist will leave guns behind on the street pistols are as good as cash if we left them the cops would know something was wrong we had to take them so what do we do with them i asked as we walked out of the ebberlys driveway throw them in the river she said drop them in a sewer i dont care we couldnt leave them our walk back to the car seemed to take twice as long as the walk to the house a mailman came down the street in his red white and blue jeep and nodded at us as we went by luellen told me twice to slow down and talk you look like one of those longdistance racewalkers she said with a practiced smile slow the fuck down at the car i dropped the tennis bag in the back and buckled up before we pulled away jesus christ i said after a couple of blocks as my stomach uncoiled it does get intense luellen giggled she went into her purse for the cocaine again and took two hard hits id never been caught inside a factory during one of my midnight research excursions with a couple of exceptions i walked inside with a regular employee a paid guide if somebody had stopped us to question my presence the employee was supposed to claim i was a friend waiting for him to get off that we didnt think it would hurt if i hung around for a while sorry about that etc on the few occasions i went into a hostile plant cold the preentry research had been so thorough and the objectives so limited that i had been more interested than excited and not particularly worried this entry had been different more freeform like jazz say compared to bach if youre an anonymous guy in a huge defense plant and a security guard comes by thats one thing theres a ninetynine percent chance you can talk your way out of any problems if youre in somebodys house and they walk in the door thats something else altogether i was still buzzing from the entry and luellen started backseat driving she kept me three miles an hour under the speed limit and called out every street and stop sign when we got back dace met us at the door with an anxious look what happened he demanded what does it look like asked luellen we went in i said grinning it was perfect get the computer stuff yeah were wired in luellen walked across the room and grabbed him by the ears cmere you she said and tugged him into the bedroom and slammed the door i was left by myself in the front room a few minutes later when i realized the apartment wasnt quite as soundproof as i had thought i got the watercolor kit and drove down to the potomac it was hot and humid the buildings across the river shimmered like white silk scarves and i tried to get them down just like that i got back to the apartment late in the afternoon arriving just behind a metallicblue corvette the vette took the first available slot and i pulled in three spaces down the vettes driver was already striding down the lot when i got out of the car it was an entrancing sight she was small darkhaired and perfectly built she moved like a dancer she used her key at the entry door and let it close behind her i used my own key and caught her waiting for the elevator she looked me over with a careful eye you must be one of the people in twoa she said with a touch of a french accent yes and youre twod she said are you a business consultants i said ah consultants she said brightly as though it explained everything in washington of course it probably did to tell you the truth i was happy to see louis and his little friends move out louis the landlord oh sure ive never met him one of my associates actually rented the place ah the elevator came and she got in and pushed the button for the second floor what uh i gave her my best most open smile i cant resist gossip im afraid thats why im a consultant what about louiss friends she shrugged and her eyes evaded mine if one is heterosexual she shrugged theres an uneasy feeling i know what you mean you are heterosexual yes i saw the woman your associate she is very attractive yes she looks not unlike you very attractive she dimpled and was about to say something when the elevator arrived at the second floor i do not mind homosexuals she said pronouncing the word with care but there were so many of them five or six living there at once in the evenings sometimes it sounded like they were all in one pile and then one hears about aids now youve got me worried were they living there for long two years she said god ill have to spray the place oh thats not you are joking me id never joke you i said we were at my door she continued down the short hallway and turned when she got to her door could i buy you a drink sometime i asked she considered for a moment then shook her head in what looked like genuine regret i have a friend she said if i did not i would like it she pushed her door open gave me a final smile and was gone luellen was standing just inside the door when i opened it with dace a few steps behind her a halffinished microwave pizza sat on the kitchen table we heard you talking she said a question in her voice another tenant she told me something odd what she said the landlords gay and that he used to keep a bunch of male friends in here several of them for maybe two years aw shit said luellen nibbling her lip dace looked puzzled what difference does it make luellen turned to him and asked the question that was bothering both of us if there were a bunch of gays living here how come ratface was bugging the place to catch a general and his mistress jeez somebodys lying to us luellen said we hashed it over without reaching any conclusion ill sweep the place again and make sure bobby is sterilizing the phone lines i said and ill see if bobby can get a line on ratfacemorelli whatever his name is maybe bobby can do something with his phones should we be talking about this dace asked looking at the walls i went over the apartment inch by inch and again found nothing bobby said our lines were clean guaranteed maybe were worrying about bullshit i said theres no way anybody could know about us not unless anshiser has sprung a major leak and if anybody did knowthe lawthey would have moved dace shook his head paranoia he said shadows luellen was looking doubtful i dont know she said she took a couple of slow turns around the front room then plopped on the couch i cant figure it let it go for now said dace maybe bobby will come up with something i said its worth a try luellen agreed okay we let it go for now good dace turned to me wanna look at the loot we dumped luellens tennis bag on the frontroom floor there were a halfdozen pistols two hundred dollars in cash three credit cards and several good pieces of gold jewelry including a gold and diamond stickpin total value she said would be about two thousand on the street itd be a good haul for a junkie she said they usually get a transistor radio and a bottle of picante sauce late that night she and dace dropped everything but the cash and guns in the alley in one of the harder districts of washington theyd be picked up and get about the use that the cops would expect the guns they dropped in the potomac the cash we kept while they were out i dialed the ebberlys number before the phone rang i blew into the receiver with a pitch pipe the whistle activated the intercept which linked their line to ours i flipped the open line over to one of our computers and left it when the bug detected a computers electronic sound packets it would relay them to our computer it would also pass them through to the ebberlys machine ebberly would get her work done as usual we would have a complete record of it nothing happened the first night or early the next morning we left the apartment a little after nine oclock to scout more targets when we got back the computer showed a transmission from the ebberlys home to whitemark thats what we wanted dace asked thats what we wanted i said she must have been working at home this afternoon good thing she wasnt there yesterday shes probably home because of the burglary luellen said talking to cops a computer work session printed out soaks up an enormous amount of paper every time samantha ebberly even glanced at a personnel form the computer printed the whole form i ran the session back across the screen did some quick editing and printed it it was seventy pages long and i handed it to dace we need to extract procedures i said we want to do things just the way she did get in and out without being noticed map these things for us every time she gets on map them again by the time were ready to go in we should know how to operate as well as she does all right but itll bore my brains out think about the money ive been doing that didnt work asked luellen no no it worked ill sit here and watch the computer but dont tell john wayne chapter samantha ebberly was a manager so her codes would get us into the administrative side of the whitemark computers but we also had to get into the engineering side we scouted four of the five engineering targets and all were marginal prospects the morning after the ebberly entry we went to check out the fifth engineer from the moment we turned the corner the target looked bad aside from the dying brown grass the front yard was devoid of plant life a battered tenspeed bike was lying at one side of the driveway next to a greenandcream chevy set up on concrete blocks the driveway was stained black by a tearshaped oil slick that was creeping out from under the car the backyard was surrounded by a shoulderhigh chainlink fence there were no clumps of extradarkgreen grass because there wasnt much grass but subtle signs were unnecessary two oldfashioned doghouses squatted against the house and an evillooking whiteeyed hound crouched beside one of them the chain around his neck looked as if it might once have been used to haul logs as we drove by a blonde in a tight black tshirt banged out the front door followed by a teenage boy who swatted her on the butt as they cut across the moribund grass toward his harley which was curled up to the curb just keep on rolling luellen said dont bother to look back christ its the jukes nice harley though wonderful softtail she said id rather eat worms than ride a harleydavidson i said remembering a bumper sticker i once saw on a honda riding a hondas like fuckin a faggot it feels sorta good but you wouldnt want your friends to see you doin it luellen said i thought this bobby guy was finding us people without kids hes doing it from databases there arent any guarantees so now what the durenbargers are probably the best bet i said youve seen the other choices durenbarger jason and ellen she said reading from the list they make a lot of money between them goddamn i hate apartments the durenbargers lived in an apartment called the summit rock not far from our own there are too many people around luellen said as we sat on a bench across the street from the summit rock if you crack the door with a crowbar somebody will hear you its only a short walk down the hall to check then they see the door and call the cops and there are too many eyes around even where there shouldnt be look how you caught me outside your place you were on the fuckin roof in the middle of the night asshole always be alert america needs more lerts right then with apartments theres a hassle getting through the outer door in some towns like des moines or lincoln you can walk up to the front door as one of the tenants goes through and catch the door as it closes you say thanks and go on in most of the time you get away with it here theres too much crime everybodys suspicious you try that trick in a big city and theyll ask to see your key what do we do we get a key she said do we know what they look like what their cars look like yeah we know the cars his is a darkbrown thunderbird shes driving a red toyota celica i thumbed through the report bobby had sent us and found the license numbers okay we wait we see if theres any chance to get a key that could take forever no you said time is getting tight well give it a couple of days and then well try cracking the place the street in front of the apartment was oneway the paired street was on the other side of a narrow public boulevard six blocks long dotted with oak trees and green metal benches we found a place to park across the boulevard and waited luellen waited well i didnt i was looking at the story of my life as represented by the folded and bent bits of paper in my billfold when luellen cleared her throat ah she said what ah you think its dace the leak i dont know if weve got a leak we had a problem and it seemed to go away we get some information that doesnt fit with other information but nothing happens i dont know if we have a leak i still dont think its dace i said he doesnt lie well enough look at it this way luellen said you talk to him hes nodding his head but inside hes saying what a story giant companies raiding each other it could be the story of his life i thought about it i admitted but it doesnt feel right hes just too innocent she looked out the window and sighed it sounded like relief i think the same thing but i had to ask youve got one of the great poker faces in the western world but i kind of trust your instincts you in love she pushed out her lower lip and squinted at me thinking maybe she said jason durenbarger showed up at six oclock his wife a half hour later they parked in back of the summit rock their cars side by side in a fenced compound too bad they dont have garages luellen said most people hide spare house keys in garages we could shake down the garage and find it if pigs had wings yeah we waited four more hours for the first twenty minutes we talked then luellen turned the radio on and we discovered that its impossible to listen to a radio in a parked car something about the ambience after she turned the radio off it was like driving across north dakota except we didnt get to stop for gas they arent gonna move luellen said finally now what home maybe we ought to rent an apartment there if theyve got vacancies dace suggested when we told him what had happened weve got the money once were inside we could take a chance on popping the door its an idea i said looking at luellen two problems the manager gets a good look at us and knows were guilty as sin if we pay for the place then split the day after the burglary luellen said so wed have to stay on for a while thats the second thing we cant stay if theres a burglary a day or two days after we move in the copsll look at us just routine i dont want to be looked at hmph if you watch people long enough something happens they go to a restaurant she goes into the can leaves her purse on the sink i only need a minute with the keys to make an impression luellen had three or four metal sucrets boxes filled with damp clay she could open them press both sides of three keys in each and shut the lid to protect the impressions the process took two seconds per key the next day we looked at another prospect in the suburbs the husband was an engineer who specialized in fiber optics as they applied to airframe control the wife was a real estate agent who sometimes came home at odd hours in the middle of the day the neighbors on one side had a half dozen kids and there were more kids in the house across the street it was possible but dangerous we got back to the durenbargers at five oclock jason durenbarger arrived promptly at six as he had the night before his wife was only a minute behind him theyre young they ought to go out luellen said they wont stay in two nights in a row the day before wed picked out what we thought was their apartment the lights went on a minute after jason went inside confirming it here we go luellen said half an hour later the durenbargers walked out the front door of the building around to the side toward the parking lot we were on the opposite side of the block i hurried around the boulevard to get behind them and moved too fast they still hadnt come out of the driveway as we approached luellen ordered me over to the curb fuck it just wait she said theres a technique for following another car you never get too close you stay in an adjacent lane rather than directly behind the car youre following and you memorize the other cars taillights a good surveillance man will risk losing the car before he risks being spotted and here we were illegally parked fifty feet from their drive in plain sight a good surveillance man would have been weeping in disgust it didnt matter because they pulled out with barely a glance up the street we memorized the taillights gave them some distance and followed them onto interstate and across the river to georgetown as they got off the main streets we were forced to close up but i managed to keep a car or two between us finally they slowed and turned through a curb cut beside a nicelooking redwoodandfieldstone restaurant oh god get in behind them quick right now luellen said almost shouting look at the valet oh shit i didnt know what she was talking about but her tone was clear enough and i eased in behind the durenbargers jason walked around the front of the car took a tag from the valet and they went inside the valet put a flat hand out to us telling us to wait and drove the durenbargers car back into the lot get out and stand by the car and wait for the valet im going to get out and go over to his hutch ill call him over to talk before he gets to you luellen said in a rush slipping out the passenger side i got out on the drivers side and waited there the valet was back in fifteen seconds and swerved toward his hutch when he saw luellen standing beside it she said something about the little girls room and he smiled and pointed at the door and motioned sharply around to the left at the same time he casually reached into the hutch and hung the durenbargers keys on a peg luellen thanked him and started away he handed me a tag and slid into the car as soon as he was out of sight luellen was back with a quick look around she reached into the hutch took the durenbargers keys and led me into the restaurant the bar she said we got a booth and ordered cocktails when the waitress had gone luellen opened her hand to show me the key ring there were five keystwo car keys two that might be apartment keys and one that looked like it might fit a suitcase she took out the sucrets tin made her impressions and wrote down the code for each key we finished the drinks and left make it the valet asked with a grin just barely luellen said i gave him the tag and as he went after the car luellen hung the durenbargers keys back on the hook were in she said a light in her eyes dace was at his own apartment when we returned luellen phoned him and asked where we could get some key blanks with no questions asked he called around and ten minutes later we had the name and address of a locksmith the voice on the other end of the phone said hed be around for an hour yet it took almost an hour to find the place it was a dingy dump in a shopping center sandwiched between a brightly lit but empty laundromat and a vacant storefront that had last housed a usedclothing store called one more time a guy in a sleeveless jeans jacket was sitting on a trash can outside the laundromat watching the fat white moths circle the parking lot lights as we got out of the car and walked across the cracked pavement the guy on the garbage can shifted his weight for a moment it looked like he might say something he had shoulderlength black hair chin whiskers and a death before dishonor tattoo on one skinny upper arm when we went to the lockshop instead of the laundromat he settled back on the can and watched us the front of the shop was dark and the door was locked but a light was shining in the back luellen banged on the door until somebody yelled yeah yeah yeah a minute later the locksmith walked through the gloom to the door were the people who called for the keys luellen said through the glass he nodded and unlocked the door and locked it again behind us we followed him toward the light at the back of the shop he stepped around the counter fished under it for a moment and came up with three blank keys elwin fourohtwos he said thatll be ten bucks each jesus christ what are you talking about thats fortyfive cents apiece if luellen squealed the locksmith cut her off tell it to somebody else lady somebody asks me for a bunch of key blanks for elwin fourohtwos the kind of locks you find on rich guys apartments and i sell the fourohtwos blank no questions asked for ten bucks thats the price luellen looked at him for a minute then cracked a tiny tight smile ill remember you she said it was a promise of future business she turned to me and said pay him i gave him a twenty and a ten thanks he said for another hundred ill cut them off impressions no thanks luellen said we dont consort with crooks the locksmith laughed showing crooked yellow teeth come back anytime he said outside the guy in the sleeveless jeans jacket was waiting as we stepped outside the door he came up close behind and said give me your wallet he had one hand in his jacket pocket luellen looked him over you gotta be kidding hey lady hey yourself asshole if you had a gun in your hand itd make a bigger lump theres nothing in there but your fist why dont you take it home and fuck it the guy looked at her mouth half open then he did something with his hand in his pocket there was a pop and luellen said oh shit he shot me when the gun went pop i kicked the guy on the inside ball of his knee his leg went out from under him and he lurched forward and i hit him with a right hand on the bridge of the nose his nose crunched and he went down like a sack of sand luellen was looking at her arm maybe im not shot no i think i am the guy was face down on the blacktop with both hands covering his face trying to figure out what happened broken noses do that to you for the first few minutes its impossible to think about anything else luellen pulled up the sleeve of her blouse an inch above the elbow was a red streak where a smallcaliber bullet had grazed her pushing holes through the shirtsleeve both coming and going he could have hurt me luellen said the locksmith had seen the commotion he came out and looked at the guy lying on the blacktop tried to rob you huh yeah thanks for the warning the locksmith shrugged i aint the sisters of mercy he shot me luellen said the guy tried to get up on his knees one hand still cradling his face luellen moved behind him and kicked him in the crotch a fullfooted punt the guy gurgled and knotted up his hands in his crotch now blood streamed down his chin into his little black beard luellen dipped into his jacket pocket and came up with a singleshot built into a stainless steel zippo cigarette lighter the locksmith reached out for it a short effective range about the length of his dick what a dipshit lets go said luellen aint you going to take his money asked the locksmith you can have it luellen said as we drove away the locksmith was going through the guys pockets luellen didnt say much for a while just kept looking at her arm and finally giggled wish i had some coke probably good that you dont you should have felt his nuts squish yeah right a real treat and i missed it how come you didnt go for his nuts in the first place too chancy a target if you miss and kick a thigh instead of the balls hell be inside your shirt theres no reflex to protect the knee and thats crippling if you get it and nothing hurts as bad as the first two minutes of a broken nose it really sounded ugly when his nose broke luellen said it gives me the shivers thinking about it yeah well i touched my own nose which has been broken twice i can remember each time with painful clarity you ought to hear it from the inside that was on a friday we couldnt risk going into the durenbargers place over the weekend so dace and luellen drove out to a cabin he owned in the hills of west virginia the shack he called it my wife hated the place she called it chigger city on sunday afternoon while they were gone bobby called id given him ratfaces real namefrank morelliand with the help of a washington phone phreak hed been watching morellis phones no activity i look up gas stations near morelli apartment and check data banks for most likely credit cards morelli makes five charges in past week atlantic city area hes out of town yes week also check consumer credit reports shows personal loan secured by chevrolet year unknown but bluebook value at so must be old also estimated pretax earnings last year thanx keep tabs yes bye luellen and dace got back at midnight and i told them about bobbys call so its unlikely that hes watching us luellen concluded and hes a smalltimer fiftytwo thousand in billings wouldnt keep a church mouse alive in dc not if he pays for an answering service and an office in addition to an apartment dace said i feel better about it luellen said thats still weird about the gays though i wish i knew about that we went into the durenbargers first thing monday morning i made my copies set the bug and we were out of there like a cool breeze luellen didnt touch a thing chapter monday night while and luellen went to play in the district i broke down the disks wed taken from ebberly and durenbarger the whitemark code system was simple when the central computer was called from the outside it asked for a name and account number after receiving those it sent a code word back directly to the home computer and asked for a matching word from the code disk the home computer scanned the list of words on the disk found the match and returned it if the code was correct you were in when i understood the code operation i reviewed daces outline of samantha ebberlys sessions on the whitemark computer she had gone directly to a number of administrative files and also called up a letter form the format was standard when i was sure that i knew what i was doing i dialed one of our computers into the ebberlys to make sure she wasnt talking to the whitemark system she wasnt i left the line open in case she came on then i dialed our second terminal into whitemark entry was routine inside i found a typical mainframe administrative system stuffed with files and forms using common techniques worked out by hackers over the past couple of decades i spent four hours wandering through the system opening files reading and moving on there were no surprises and there were some disappointments security was a notch tighter than i hoped it would be key files were protected with personal passwords and i had no way around them except laborious trial and error i let that go for the time being whitemark programmers had also constructed programming barriers between the various sectors of the computer using ebberlys codes i could wander at will through the open administrative sector but i couldnt get down to the underlying programs i couldnt get into the system itself i next checked the durenbarger codes once again entry was easy on the engineering side the computer was jammed with numbers and designs and ongoing work with key files protected by personal passwords just like the administrative side and as on the administrative side access to the programming level was thoroughly blocked luellen and dace came in late saw me working and tiptoed away much later i went to bed and lay staring at the ceiling by four in the morning id decided there were no options we had to get into the programming level of the computer we had to crack another house at breakfast luellen rambled on sore about the play theyd seen the night before it concerned a street gang the single scene was set in a basement where the gang was waiting for a shipment of pistols it was like one of those world war two movies where theres a jew and a black guy and an italian and the coward and this cool white guy whos the hero you know one of everything luellen said thats what this gang was like but i know gang punks i went to school with them you dont find any jews and blacks and whites together you hang out with a white gang and its niggerthis and niggerthat if a jew comes along its fuckin kike in real life these guys are assholes it was supposed to be allegorical dace said dryly right what really happened was the guy who wrote it had his head up his ass luellen trailed off and peered at me why so glum something we should know about we have to hit the systems programmers place i said the head mans theres no way around it you knew we might she was leaning on the refrigerator munching a bowl of dry honeynut cheerios the play was forgotten when do you want to do it we can cruise by this afternoon see how it looks is this the last one dace asked yeah if hes got the codes and he should were pushing our luck i know i sweat blood every time i said while luellen and i had been scouting the homes of whitemark employees and hit the first two dace had worked out the tactics of the propaganda attack after breakfast he produced a yellow legal pad with a list of notes and outlined the plan when you get the computer operation going well start leaking stories about their production and design troubles well get that out to the technical press itll scare the brass over at the pentagon theyve been burned too oftentheyre gunshy about design problems but most newspaper and tv reporters dont care about that stuff whitemark might be able to sweep the whole thing under the rug if we really want to nail them we need raw meat corruption if you tell a post reporter that theres a tenmilliondollar cost overrun on a control circuit for a fighter plane and anyway the circuit doesnt even work hell say so whats new but if you tell him the company president spent ten thousand on broads and booze for a couple of generals and youve got the pictures to prove it hell camp out on your doorstep so where do we get the pictures luellen asked we could make them up dace said mildly frame them he nodded yeah frame them he looked sanguine about the prospect sipping tea and watching us sounds risky i said there are advantages too if we frame them we can make the corruption as spectacular as we want and we dont have to waste time looking for it we can go in and out fast plant the documents create the backup and supporting material and call the papers the biggest problem well have is getting somebody to listen to us washington is overrun with crazies the city desk receptionists at the major newspapers and television stations dealt with a dozen screwballs a day by telephone and in person there were letters from a dozen more some threatened to wipe out the zionists some the arabs some reported the deleterious effects of fluoride on the nations testicles others could prove that aids was a deliberate plot by the russians the chinese the gays the blacks the cia or the league of women voters take your pick several hundred people knew of the island where a braindamaged jfk was still living sometimes with elvis if we can find or create something good enough i can handle it i can get us in but it has to be good he said once we get in the media will stay with it especially if they get the credit a big defense contractor paying off the generals and caught in the act by a vigilant press thats good stuff what about the poor assholes who supposedly took the bribes i mean we could be killing these people luellen said look what happened to you dace nodded thats not the only thing if you frame someone everything must be precisely right if we say general jones was getting laid on bimini on march and he can produce fifty witnesses who say he was in boise speaking to the mothers for righteousness the whole effort goes down the drain if we frame them well have to make it a loose frameslush funds women cash payoffs but no names will that take i asked we could rig something dace said but see where im headed it would be better to find the real thing if its spectacular enough the real thing always has a special flavor you know its real and im sure its in there somewhere all of these big companies do favors for the brass maybe its not money or sex but its something if you could get me into their general files i could find something but it might take time ive already been in so entry is no problem i said and it seems like the payoff potential would be bigger yeah it would be ill outline a frame just in case but we should take a run at their files and see what we can find dace said luellen and i looked at each other and luellen said i dont like the frame i nodded okay we cant take more than two or three days to look but lets try it and first we hit the systems programmers place so i can get into the system when are you going to chicago luellen asked i wanted one last talk with anshiser to get the final goahead if i can get into the system soonlike tonightill go tomorrow or the next day are you still planning to bring this maggie back if she wants to come it makes me nervous another outsider knowing our faces my face luellen said i hope shes all right i shrugged no guarantees theres not much choice either if we want to get paid chapter maggie sounded good on the phone her voice low and husky she laughed once and it brought back the memory of her scent the iris and vanilla and the feel of the day we met on the sandbar we have to make one more entry i said well try it this afternoon hows anshiser hes worse were going ahead but hes not so good can i talk to him when i come in sure hes functional if thats what youre asking when are you coming day after tomorrow if everything works out if we get in this afternoon be careful always the last target was in an exclusive suburb in the virginia countryside the sprawling lawns were shaded by fullsized trees swimming pools were standard equipment and a few yards had tennis courts screened by lilacs and honeysuckle most of the houses had small signs posted by the driveways this house protected by acme alarms luellen scanned the target looking especially at the phone line coming out she was spooked what is it i asked the security no we can get past that if they have it but somethings not right she said these people arent important enough for this house you say this guy makes seventyfive or eighty thousand these places must start at three hundred and fifty and go up from there maybe papa had money maybe she said but she wasnt happy about it the neighborhood was quiet we rolled through it three times from different directions without seeing anything obviously threatening lets go make the calls luellen said finally but if we cant get them at work i want to wait we got them though virtually on the first rings luellen dug some coke out of her purse and took a hit while i called the house cut the line tossed the phone receiver in the backseat and drove back to a neighborhood park we ambled down to the house in three or four minutes taking our time luellen miming a cough to cover a couple of additional hits on the cocaine we could hear the faint ringing of the phone as we walked up the driveway there was no security sign outside but that meant nothing when i pop it you step right inside the door behind me and stand there dont do anything until i tell you she said as we walked up to the front door she took a pair of wire cutters out of her tennis bag and slipped them into the pocket of her shorts im going to be running around like a rat for a couple of minutes at the door she rang the bell and blew hard on the dog whistle there was no response she dipped into the bag for the bar and i covered her with my body while she cracked the door we stepped into a darkpaneled entry hall the kitchen was to the left the living room straight ahead hanging on the entry wall was an eyepopping egon schiele drawing of two women nude except for calflength silk stockings making love it was worth a good fraction of the houses value i began to understand luellens misgivings that drawing belonged in a museum or a millionaires bedroom not in a suburban house in virginia luellen launched herself into the house literally running ripping open the front hall closet pivoting going into the kitchen pulling open the cabinets one after another the doberman pinscher caught her on her knees halfway down the kitchen he came around the corner from the dining roomblack and brown and rippling with muscle running like a leopard i was looking at the schiele drawing when i heard the dogs toenails on the kitchen floor and luellen screamed no and i turned and the dog was coming he must not have seen me behind luellen because he leaped toward her snarling and she half stood her hands in front of her i took two steps toward them and as he hit her upper arms and she started to go down i kicked him in the throat luellens arm pulled out of his mouth as he tumbled over and down then he scrabbled his legs under him recovering and i took another step and he was almost on his way again and i kicked him in the head and he went down again he was still alive and still trying and i kicked him again in the ribs without doing much damage except to roll him over and then luellen pushed by me lifting the crowbar over her head and bringing it down like a baseball bat the dog rolled his head and the bar bounced off she flailed at him again and this time connected squarely blood spattered across the floor and the dogs legs started to run in a death kick and she hit him again and again and i grabbed her and pulled her off let go she said im okay she dropped the bar and began flinging open the doors of the kitchen cabinets and raced into the dining room and looked down the stairs and then went out through the garage door the phone was still ringing in the background i hunted it down and pulled it off the hook and rehung it in the sudden silence i could hear the dogs bubbling breath as he died get that fuckin dog and stuff it in the hall closet luellen snarled as she came back in the house i went back to the kitchen and dragged the dog by its collar into the hallway and pushed it into the closet what happened with the whistle some dogs are trained to ignore them in fact they go on alert when they hear one i dont think theres an alarm by the way the dog was it she was examining her upper arm and there was blood on her shirt theres no entry alarm theres no motion or sound detectors i can see i thought maybe they had a directcall alarm but i couldnt see anything on the phone lines i cut them anyway lets get this done in a hurry how bad are you he got me but it doesnt look too bad let me see i pulled the neck of her shirt down over her shoulder and found four gashes each an inch long ragged and deep they were bleeding profusely hurts like hell she said i have to find a different shirt and something to soak up this blood we went down the hall and she suddenly stopped and said whoa the living room had been done by the marquis de sade scarlet flocked wallpaper set off a twoinchdeep wool pile carpet as black as india ink the furniture included a walnutcolored baby grand piano and an inkyblue overstaffed living room suite of velvet a candelabra mounting six black candles sat on the piano the room smelled of incense and marijuana and something else something from the locker room or the bedroom sweat human juices something on the walls at eye level were groupings of small highquality art photographs and engravings all expensively framed all pornographic i dont believe these things luellen said as she examined one of the engravings everybody needs a hobby i muttered looking around lets find that fucking computer fucking computer is right luellen said walking from one picture frame to the next you could hurt yourself doing some of this stuff think its up or down what the computer for christs sake up she said she peered closely at me you okay you looked cranked its okay it was that dog the computer was in the first room at the top of the stairs an efficient little office with an ibm two big lockable disk boxes both unlocked and a desk made of a formica countertop set on a half dozen twodrawer filing cabinets the only odd element was the clock on the wall the face of the clock portrayed a nude woman seen endon her legs representing the clocks hands the view was unblushingly gynecological i brought the ibm up and was shuffling through the disks when luellen called hey kidd take a look at this just a second i popped my cracker disk into the machine and started it loading when i stepped out of the office i found luellen in the hall holding a wad of kleenex against her bleeding shoulder and gazing into a bedroom look she pointed into the bedroom there was a waterbed with black candles on the headboard and a mirrored wall the main attraction was a photo mural of a womans face as she performed oral sex on a man who was mostly but not entirely out of the picture look at the size of that thing luellen said shoot ive seen donkeys bigger than that i said i meant the picture not the guy she said coloring a bit but ill tell you what kidd these people arent a little weird theyre a lot weird theres a picture like this in every bedroom this might be some kind of whorehouse maybe thats how they could afford to buy the place maybe thats why they dont have any alarms they dont want the cops coming in no matter what i got to get back i said i returned to the office and luellen started trashing the bedrooms i loaded and reloaded the disks looking for the communications program the boxes were full of disks identified only by number i was on the fourth or fifth one all files when luellen went past the door stuck her head in said found two grand in cash three guns and six dildos and kept going a second later she went down the stairs to the livingroom level the communications program was on the seventh disk i had pulled off the phone plate and was ready to wire in the bug but took a minute to run through the program there was a list of code words but they looked too similar to the words used by ebberly and durenbarger they might get me into all the system files but i wasnt sure they would give me access to the programming level as the disk was being copied i finished wiring the bug into the phone box and put the plate back on when the communications disk was copied i dropped the copy into the tennis bag and looked quickly at the rest of the disks they were all files mostly long lists of names and addresses the files were protected by a commercial security program that wasnt quite worthless it slowed me down by about five seconds per disk when i finished i pulled out the file drawers under the counter and went through the paper files nothing of immediate interest i was closing the bottom drawer when a flash of white on the inside front panel caught my eye i pulled it all the way out and found a piece of masking tape seven tendigit numbers were written on the tape that looked promising i copied them out in the order they were written in kidd luellen was shouting up the stairs cmere quick i pushed the drawer shut shoved the copied disks and the list of numbers into the tennis bag and headed down the stairs there was no one in the living or dining rooms where are you i called down in the basement the windowless basement was divided lengthwise down the middle in one half was the utility room with a washing machine and drier a tool bench storage and what looked like a small bathroom with the exception of one room the other half was nothing like the upstairs it was a warehouse a paradigm of efficiency with fluorescent overhead lights and flat white tile floors the exception was the neat little photo studio it had a velvet couch a pile of red and black velvet drapes and a cardboard box full of sexual implements dildos handcuffs a whip masks and dolls the army dolls that boys play with and two oldfashioned fat plastic baby dolls that cry when they sit up there were three lights with umbrella reflectors pulldown seamless paper and a pair of hasselblad cameras each with its own tripod next to it was a professional color darkroom the rest of the basement was stacked with cartons and envelopes luellen had opened the cartons and held a sheaf of slender fullcolor magazines take a look at these she said the magazines ran the gamut of the sexual activities usually portrayed by porno magazines with one significant difference in each picture one of the participants was a child and the shots had been taken in the neat little photo studio these are those childporn assholes you hear about luellen said she was wearing a pink blouse not her own holding her shoulder and shouting im going to burn this fucking place down no youre not i said grabbing her around the waist and pulling her tight we can use this you get everything youd normally takeguns money jewelry and grab those hasselblads and all the lenses you see those are worth a bundle lets hurry take one copy of each magazine but dont mess them up and for christs sake dont get prints on them i ran back up the stairs and started making copies of all the file disks if they were what i thought id have a complete mailing list for the childporn ring it took fifteen minutes to copy the files while i did it luellen went through the place with a vengeance she came into the office once to get my tennis bag and when i finished i found her with two fat garbage bags in the kitchen well take twenty grand out of here she said with satisfaction jesus if a cop sees us carrying those bags hell stop us for sure i said theres way too much stuff i know so we leave them here in the kitchen except for your disks and go get the car come back load them up and take off she said oh man i dont know its what a doper would do with a load this size she said defiantly hed take the risk so did we we brought the car back and i jumped out while luellen waited with the car running in the driveway i walked up to the front door knocked pushed through got the bags brought them out tossed them in the backseat on an impulse i walked back to the house took the schiele off the wall carried it out to the car and handed it across the seat to her that was stupid she said fiercely as we drove away she was hurting yeah a few minutes later she said i feel bad about the dog he was doing his job a minute later she punched me on the arm saved my ass kidd luellen went up to the apartment ahead of me and when i came in carrying the bags dace had her wrapped up in his arms weve got to get a doctor he said can you handle that i asked somebody wholl keep his mouth shut yeah i know a guy tell him the dog was a neighbors and well make sure its quarantined and not to sweat it we dont want any trouble no reports i said i knew something was going to happen he said sooner or later what are you going to do about those freaks luellen asked if the number codes get me into the system i can make some changes that will give me the same status as the systems programmer i said ill be able to go anywhere in the system after the operation is running well write to the cops tell them the truth that we broke in what we found i got a copy of their whole subscription list well print it out and include that say we found it with the magazines child pornography is not appreciated in the state of virginia theyll be looking at ten years in the joint what if the burglary scares them so much that they dump all the stuff luellen asked theyll freak out but they wont dump it i said theres too much money involved especially if they think they were hit by a crackhead who wouldnt be any further threat what about the kids who get fucked between now and then i shook my head its not a perfect world if you want to nail these people put them out of business this is the way to do it she wasnt happy dace on the other hand was pleased in a grim sort of way this is a major story he said majormajor well drop this thing on whitemark like an atomic bomb weve got to do it right and wait until theyre already in trouble and then boom this could sink them dace took luellen to see his doctor while i sorted through the stuff wed taken in the burglary there wasnt much we could save but i would keep the schiele drawinghe was among the best draftsmen of the twentieth century and his erotic pieces are stunning this was a good one it could tie me to a burglary but i looked at it and looked at it and knew id keep it that night dace and luellen dumped the rest of the loot and i went into the whitemark computer using the system programmers codes the word codes got me through the first line of protection the number codes got me into the programming level it was there that i found the complete list of passwords for every file in the computer no matter how confidential when luellen and dace returned luellen was laughing were going to get a crowd if we dump any more stuff in that alley she said her shoulder had been bandaged and the doctor gave her a small envelope of pain pills she took them all and was looking very relaxed im in and ive got to stay with this i told them nodding at the terminal im going to build my own back door into the computer so i wont have to use the operators codes ill have my own i picked up the second telephone looked whitemark up in the phone book and called when the operator answered i asked for the computer room systems hey i heard a rumor that youre shutting down early tonight is that right nope i dont think so let me check the receiver on the other end clattered onto a desk and lay there for a minute then the voice returned nope regular time so how late can i stay on if i push it all the way to four oclock if you want to stay for another hour give us a ring and well leave it on but we have to shut down by five for system maintenance thanks no problem i worked through the night setting up my own back door the next day we started breaking into the key files dace looking over my shoulder as i worked letters memos plans and budgets rolled up the screen and into oblivion by six oclock we were getting tired a long white snake of computer paper twisted across the table two wastebaskets in the corner were crammed with more jumbled printouts and with empty coke cans whats next i asked so far we had rifled the confidential personal and private files of a half dozen top whitemark officials there was some interesting paper but nothing incriminating vice president for materials dace said he yawned and shuffled through a whitemark phone book wed printed out early in the process his name is bell i think dace ran a finger through the bs and i started looking through the filing lists for a bell hold it dace said suddenly he was looking into the phone book with a frown wrinkle across his forehead heywood beltrami say what theyve got a guy here named heywood beltrami so what you know him yeah hes a hairball i had no idea he was working for whitemark with that name there sure as shit couldnt be two of them i said whats he do it says here hes in corporate relations dace said it took two minutes to find beltramis files it took another five minutes with the master list to figure out which code words were his and another minute to run them beltrami wasnt a technical man and there was nothing technical about his files they were all letters and memos let me in there dace said i gave up the seat at the computer and went to get a beer luellen was watching television in the front room got anything yet dace found somebody he knew says hes a sleaze i said i went into the kitchen got a beer and stopped to watch the game show for a minute i couldnt do computers luellen said after a while i mean it sounds neat but its really just sitting in front of a tv tube and pushing buttons isnt it yes and no you could say that reading a newspaper is looking at long lists of letters but its obviously more than that same thing with computers i was about to go on but dace interrupted got em he yelled from the office luellen got off the couch and followed me back dace was grinning at the computer screen an old dirtbag never changes his grease spots dace said i knew we could count on heywood he tapped the computer screen with a fingernail this is a letter to a very heavy air force acquisitions guy at the pentagon two stars theres a whole series of letters in here they talk in circles but when you see them all at once its pretty clear some of them talk about employment and some of them talk about problems with specs on the hellwolf you have to look at the dates and whats going on before you realize that whitemark is promising to take care of this guy and his buddies when they retire consultant jobs big bucks big offices cars goddamn all whitemark wants is some help with spec changes it restores your faith in mankind to know that people like heywood are still out there oozing around after all these years dace was happy he looked in fact about ten years younger luellen squeezed his shoulder and i said right lets get it printed out we dumped everything in beltramis files into our memory as it came chugging out of the printer we decided on the next step we can work through the stuff tomorrow decide the best way to leak it to the media dace said and well get a package together on our pornographer friends so we can hand it to the cops im going to chicago i said ill be back the next day we start the day after you get back asked luellen yes the fuckin rubicon chapter maggie was waiting at the ohare arrival gate she wore shades of blue this time and low business heels the outfit was subtly chic and must have set her back a thousand or more she wore no makeup except a touch of pearlpink lipstick when she saw me she smiled briefly and lifted a hand in greeting did you check any bags she asked as i came through the gate nope just this i held up the canvas carryon ive got a car she led the way toward the exit and i tagged along behind like a friendly basset the first two times id seen her her hair had been loose on her shoulders now it was swept up in a knot her bare neck made her seem more vulnerable her carriage had also changed she seemed softer tired crumpled you look down worn out i said struggling for the right words she glanced back its rudy she said theres been a lot of pressure how sick is he i dont know she said hes been having headaches pretty bad ones he had migraines when he was young hes afraid theyve come back you called in a doctor she gave me the brief smile again oh sure billionaires arent allowed to suffer hes had all kinds of scans and probes they cant find anything organic theyve given him tranquilizers they seem to help i grabbed her arm and stopped her she pivoted to face me what are you telling me that hes out of control no he still has control but sometimes the pain affects him we started walking again and i held onto her arm he gets angry out of all proportion to whatever set him off and when it goes away the relief is so strong that he gets almost maniacally happy overconfident the swings are hard to deal with how is he now hes in pretty good shape he had a bad headache yesterday but it was gone this morning are you still planning to come to washington yes he insists on it the worse the headaches get the more determined he is to follow this through we passed all the usual exits to the parking ramps and approached an unmarked desk manned by an elderly guard he saw us coming and nodded at maggie she walked past him to a door labeled fire and bumped it open with her hip we were in a reserved section of the parking ramp separated from the rest of it by a concrete wall it was the kind of place whose existence i never would have suspected though it made sense the average car was probably worth sixty or seventy thousand there were a half dozen rollsroyces and a few sleek italian jobs that made maggies porsche look puritanplain she dropped neatly into the drivers seat opened the passenger door and i climbed inside during the ride to anshisers she was friendlier than she had been in the past luellen fascinated her and she asked a dozen questions about the burglaries as we loafed along when i mentioned that luellen and dace were sleeping together she half turned toward me in the dark isnt that a major change um youre not distraught luellen and i like to roll around together our relationship is important but not serious if you know what i mean this dace from what youve told me he seems very likeable luellen says hes a nice guy she says im not she wants to try nice for a while she thought about that and it occurred to me that i was feeling some electricity i wrote it off as fantasy a product of unrequited hormones in any case she stopped talking about luellen and i brought her uptodate on the whitemark project so youre ready she said when i finished yeah if anshiser says go he will she said she glanced at me dillon was doing more research you know just because hes dillon anyway he found a reference to a paper you wrote about the tarot he went out and bought a deck i grinned in the dark where did he find it the paper that was the strange thing it was at the war college yeah i knew they were using it she wanted more but we were in the twisting streets and a moment later she turned in at anshisers wroughtiron gate it rolled smoothly out of the way and she gunned the car up to the house anshiser was a shock hed been thin when i last saw him and hed lost another ten pounds the lines in his face had deepened and his short hair seemed to stand on end his nose appeared redder and larger mr kidd he said hoarsely as maggie ushered me into the office dillon was nowhere to be seen i understand were ready to go i gave him the report id given maggie on the way in he was pleased when i told him what we planned to do with the child pornographers he said goddamned right and laughed that ought to open up some sinuses over there he whacked the top of his desk with sudden energy you dont look so good i said maggie said youre having migraines something like it not quite but close he said somberly to tell you the truth i think im dying my god rudy maggie protested the doctors say its tension it could be kidds project doing this who knows youre not dying anshiser laughed again the laugh trailing off to a cough the doctors are full of horseshit he said i know what i feel like he looked at me and held his hand to his head i cant explain it but when i have one of these headaches my whole body feels empty i dont know what it is ive never had it before and its bad look i said youre making me nervous if youre about to lose it either mentally or physically we could have serious problems youre our backup if anything goes wrong he hacked again covering his mouth with his fist his eyes never leaving mine ill last he said im too damn mean to die before thats done he reached under his desk and produced a nylon handbag and pushed it toward me half of the remaining money he said a half million dollars im extremely pleased with your progress i looked at the bag for a minute and then back up at anshiser the real thing starts the day after tomorrow i said maggie and i will get out of here tomorrow well show her where were at and then we do it i need you to say right now to go ahead do it i wish you luck i do anshiser said he pushed himself slowly out of the chair and i picked up the bag and leaned forward to shake his hand you take good care of maggie he said shes the daughter i should have had or the wife he grinned and for another instant the vitality was back maggie led the way to the door and just outside put a hand on my arm i wasnt expecting this i said holding up the money bag thats rudys way of telling you hes happy she said do you have reservations in town no i thought it would be better to show up somewhere and pay in cash i sure as hell have enough of it why dont you stay at my place i have an extra room and youre welcome to it it would be untraceable thats nice of you thanks i have to talk to rudy privately for a moment ill be right back i waited in the hallway heard the sound of their voices then anshiser laughed again and a moment later she came out his sense of humor seems to be intact i said as we headed down the stairs you seem not exactly to amuse him but to make him laugh she said its good for him whatd i say she glanced back at me the smile extending to her eyes this time i told him id offered to let you stay at my place in the spare bedroom and how you said thats nice of you and he said god almighty maggie why dont you take that boy home and let him screw your brains loose thats when he laughed no he laughed on my line he never laughs on his own she was ahead of me going down the stairs so all i could see was that tantalizing neck and not her face what was your line shed reached the bottom of the stairs and crossed the short hall to the outside door she turned at just the right moment with one hand on the knob i said i planned to do exactly that i said oh to an empty doorway as a toplevel manager and a large athletic woman she was surprisingly soft and yielding in the bedroom while luellen went after sex with the enthusiasm of a beerdrinking cowgirl maggie was slower and looser and almost submissive when we broke apart after making love the first time she rolled onto her back the skin of her stomach and breasts was shinydamp in the dim bedside light and she said sounding satisfied with herself there there what she propped herself on one elbow and looked down at me there are some men getting them in bed is a challenge you know you were such an arrogant asshole the first time we met out on the sandbar with your brushes and your paintings and your torn shirt and your tan i was sweating like a pig my nylons were full of holes my hair was a mess and when i try to make conversation about the hole you cut in your painting you cut me off at the knees what a jerk jesus i muttered what nothing id just heard something similar well youre the type who would not about me about someone else i said time to change the subject are you worried about the raid we could call it off right now and nobody would ever know she dropped flat on her back again sure im worried im paid to worry im worried about rudy too the way he talks about dying dont ignore that i said sometimes people know what the doctors dont thats what worries me that he might somehow talk himself right into the grave she looked sideways at me tell me why this attack is going to work i thought for a moment because its set up right i said we took some time and we know what were doing theres a possibility that well be nailed right away that theres some kind of invisible monitoring system in whitemarks software but ive been careful and i havent seen it and ive been deep enough into their system to know that they depend on it when we corrupt that system theyll be effectively frozen people will be hurt not physically like anshiser said the first time i saw him its either his company or whitemark somebodys got to lose whitemark cheated that makes it a little more okay but not completely okay nothing is completely okay what about this problem with whatshisname ratface she asked she knew about the incident with the woman from down the hall and that we thought the landlord had been lying about ratface i still dont know what that was about i said bobbys watching him but nothings happened i have it in the back of my head that maybe it wasnt a divorce thing that maybe ratface and the landlord were involved in some kind of blackmail business you know were not even sure that the technician was putting those bugs on the phones maybe he was taking them off maybe the landlord called them and said hey these guys are some kind of computer freaks maybe you better get those bugs out of there i dont know that doesnt feel right either maggie laughed softly it all sounds nuts you know whacky like something one of those rightwing fascist weirdo groups would fantasize about yeah but theyd do it in treebark camo i said the main thing is nothing has happened ratface is still off in jersey maggie snuggled up on my shoulder and i looked at the ceiling feeling her there and neither one of us said anything for a few minutes then her hand crept down my stomach and she said hmm its going to work she said a half hour later i was a little confused and wondered for a second if that was a personal comment i thought it did work dillon did a risk evaluation on this job we had a hard time evaluating the first phase the burglaries because we didnt know what kind of personnel youd have thats why rudy kept me out of it until now id caught up with her how about the second phase going into the company that was easier to evaluate we know you and your work and there have been studies of this kind of attack by the national security agency and the fbi dillon thinks this will be the least risky phase but after we hit and the news reports start coming out the risks escalate the key is picking the time to get out if you wait too long zut she drew a finger across my throat and if we get caught what happens then that depends its absolutely critical to keep your name and face everybodys name and face out of the media the biggest danger is that you would be arrested and processed before we could interfere once something is on paper it gets much harder she said if you can keep things private and give rudy time to operate we should be okay so we keep things informal absolutely jesus i wish i still smoked why i could use a cigarette the next day while maggie took care of lastminute business at anshisers i went into chicago and stashed my share of the extra money in a second safetydeposit box i mailed the key to emily in st paul along with a note telling her that everything was fine we flew out of chicago in the early afternoon and got to washington in time to catch the evening crush on i when we arrived at the apartment i unlocked the door and pushed through carrying my own overnight case and maggies threesuiter dace and luellen were working in the office luellen was wearing jeans and her white tassled cowboy boots maggie was in one of her blue power suits dace and luellen this is maggie kahn and maggie i gestured at the other two pleased to meet you luellen said cheerfully sticking out a hand maggie shook it smiling and said my pleasure ive heard something about your work from kidd id like to hear more luellen glanced sideways at me then back at maggie what did he say her tone was light but her eyes were dark and serious well he told me that luellen might not be your real name that he doesnt know your last name or where you live and he doesnt know what you do when youre not working but that he does know youre good when you are working luellen relaxed her security was sound dace shook maggies hand and offered to show her around she looked at the office tapped on the keyboard of one computer and glanced through the letters between whitemark and the generals id like to look at those administrative formats you worked out maybe i could help run through their files she said in her executive voice any time you want to see them dace said we can take you through the signon routine tomorrow thanks maggie said she glanced around the office again then stepped outside and looked down the hall wheres our room she asked i want to get out of this suit uh right over here i pointed at the door ill bring your suitcase she disappeared into the bedroom and as i picked up the heavy case in the living room a grinning luellen slapped me on the butt and whispered way to go josй i may have blushed chapter computer programming can be as beautiful and complicated as a tree as compelling as the best painting programmers admire each others code they talk like rock climbers that was a very difficult pitch and look how he did itwith stylea good programmer uses a computers potential to create worlds where other people will live or in some cases where they will fight the attack on whitemark began after breakfast on a beautiful august morning maggie and i split a bag of bagels and a pot of coffee chatted and laughed cleaned up the kitchen and went to war the attack lasted precisely four weeks twentyeight days to the hour the first moves were invisible to whitemark we infested their system with a virus a virus is a chunk of computer code compact and deadly once a virus has infected a computers system software it makes copies of itself and inserts them into the working programs being run through the system the working program in turn infects other operating systems unless the virus is detected it will eventually infect every program that passes through the system and those programs will infect every other program they encounter besides replicating itself the virus usually does damage not always there are christmas card viruses for example that insert graphic christmas cards in every text file they find when somebody opens the computer file the first thing that appears is the christmas card the disease viruses are a different story they are killer bugs they erase information jumble it destroy expensive oneofakind custom programs there are some viruses more complicated than the straightout bombs that may change a systems programming in more subtle ways our first virus was not subtle it was a bomb pure and simple fortyfive days after being inserted in the whitemark computer system it would explode any whitemark program containing a virus would be thoroughly and irretrievably jumbled nothing would come out of the companys computers but garbage why fortyfive days maggie asked when i explained the virus to her we were in the whitemark computer using the special entry codes i had created for us the whitemark programmers will eventually catch on to what were doing weve got three or four weeks at the most if their top systems man is busted on the porno charge we may get a few more days out of the confusion anyway when the trouble starts theyll do the routine system checks that will take a couple of days when nothing works theyll start sweating eventually theyll figure it out theyll realize theyre under attack and theyll shut down outside access there are some ways around that but only for a day or two at that point well be fifteen or twenty days out and theyll call in the fbi or somebody like that to look for us theyll be worried about sabotage once they get everything shut down therell be a couple of weeks of confusion theyll be paranoid about the system theyll run all kinds of tests then theyll start repairs bringing in new software checking it that should get us five or six weeks down the road so then at six and a half weeks the bomb explodes itll be the finishing touch they wont recover before the contract deadlines she thought about it for a minute nibbling on her lower lip so whats the first move after you get the viruses in the first thing that will affect them if we dont hurt them soon itll be too late ill start on that tonight i said most of their design work is done at individual work stations but all the stations are tied into the central computer i can get to them when theyre not being used ill start by hacking up the math programs engineers run a million numbers through their computers ill stick in a program that will add or subtract various small percentages on certain calculations it wont be quite random identical calculations will come out the same way every time so if they check their work itll be confirmed but itll all be wrong she didnt understand whats the practical effect she asked tell me a practical effect okay say you were designing a screwin gas cap for your porsche theres a male part and a female part the threading has to be the same on both parts say the twist on the male part is altered just slightlythe pitch is changed a few degrees the cap becomes worthless you cant look at the plans and tell that its worthless you cant tell its worthless when youre making it it looks fine right up to the time you try to screw the parts together then they dont work and the whole problem is in a calculation somewhere or say that you want to design the kind of round gascap cover that goes on the outside of some cars on the fender say you make the round metal cover a quarter inch too big in diameter it wont fit its useless you cant make it fit any more than you can push a nickel through a popbottle top but it looks fine right up to the moment you try to put it on the car she considered it for a moment staring dead into the eye of an onion bagel that sounds pretty crude she said finally those examples are i agreed but if you do analogous things in electronics it gets more complicated you cant see which parts are wrong it can take days to figure out a mistake every individual part works and every part is just as specified but the system wont work anytime you build a complicated electronic machine there are always mistakes pure accidents theyre nightmares sometimes it takes days to find them you dont know if youre dealing with a basic design flaw or if theres a bad electrical connection somewhere if mistakes are generated on a large scale by design i dont know of a cure she thought that over as she got into the onion bagel how do you know that they just wont check the computer and fix it she asked as she chewed they will sooner or later but probably later computers are the water engineers swim in they dont question the answers they get from computers any more than a fish questions water they know the computer is correct the problem must be somewhere else that seemed to satisfy her although she was more thoughtful than pleased later in the morning i injected the first of the viruses into the whitemark system when it was done i wandered into the kitchen and heard her talking on an extension phone relaying what id told her when she got off the phone she came in and sat down i was talking to our systems man she said i didnt tell him what were doing of course but i did say that id talked to a guy about computer security he says youre right but he says the chances of a good enough programmer ever getting into our system are slim and none thats why it could be done i was tempted to tell her that bobby had already been in the anshiser system but some things are best left untold if i were you i might have another little chat with him i made a note she said she smiled and the skin crinkled at the corners of her eyes while i was working on the attack programs that wed insert into the whitemark system dace was working on the publicity angle his first product was a package on the systems director the pornographer i put it together with words cut out of the post he said he was wearing surgeons latex gloves and holding the paper by the corners it was an ugly jumble of clippedout news type scotchtaped to a piece of spiral notebook paper the hardest part was getting the words right nothing too big but nothing too small either something just right for a halfbright crackhead the text was three paragraphs long and explained we needed the money from the robbery for medicine so we started robbing houses found these porno magazines full of little children which was not cool which is a hundred times more cruel than anything we ever done it specified names the address and the day and time of the burglary maybe they hid it by now but if you watch them you you catch them little kids are getting fucked a sample magazine was enclosed along with the list of subscribers one thing that strikes me as phony is that were sending it to the right police jurisdiction a junkie would probably send it to the washington cops dace said as he sealed the envelope i dont want to take a chance that the whole thing would get lost in the bureaucracy so im going to send it to the right place to the chief even if theyre a little suspicious theyll check especially with the magazine and the subscriber list what do you think theyll do the cops maggie asked when i was working a police beat years ago theyd pass it off to the vice squad the vice cops would go over to the house see if the door looks like it had been broken in recently im assuming that the breakin wasnt reported then they might look in the windows and see if we described the place right or knock on the door with some phony excuse to see if it looks right if everything jibes theyll watch the place see who comes and goes maybe have a quiet talk with a neighbor or two theyll do a computer search and see if these people have ever been involved in a sex thing in the past if they find anything they may do a discreet blackbag job themselves to check the place out then depending on what they find theyll go to a pet judge and get a search warrant they wont have a real good case but it should be enough for a warrant what if they did report the breakin for insurance dace shrugged in that case they probably moved the porn out at least during the investigation if they did report it the cops would have corroboration in their own files that the burglary took place theyll still watch the place sooner or later theyll bust them it better be sooner maggie said if it happens two months from now it wont help its not a sure thing dace said but id be willing to bet itll happen in a week howll we know if it happened well give the cops a couple of days to work then we tip off the papers and the tv stations that theyre about to bust the biggest kiddieporn ring in the country its hyperbole but the tv people love that kind of thing a new record for kiddie porn theyll get in touch with the cops and thatll goose the cops along well see it on the evening news the night after the first attack maggie lay on her back in bed the lights out the code was still running through my head its weird she said reaching over to pat me on the stomach when rudy and dillon and i talked about hiring you i had this picture of somebody climbing a barbwire fence with plastic explosive in his teeth instead we sit in an airconditioned apartment and eat donuts and you type on a computer you never carry plastic explosive in your teeth i said have you ever seen the whitemark building nope should i i guess not theres not much to see just a big glass cube with a funny pyramid thing for the roof i thought you might be curious nah you can tell more sitting here than you can from looking at the outside of the building she shook her head that doesnt seem right somehow its like she groped for an analogy its like dropping bombs on vietnamese peasants you know you push a button and people die but you go home to lunch if youre going to have a war you should have the courtesy to kill your enemies in person and maybe suffer a little bit youre rambling i said i know i dont even know what im trying to say but it seems wrong to be able to attack somebody youve never seen dont know and probably wont ever meet you mean i should find the president of whitemark and personally rip his heart out oh bullshit kidd you know what im getting at this seems so sterile i mean its scary its little electronic lights ruining a huge company welcome to the big city i said thats an ugly attitude she said yeah but thats the way it is you wanted this done and i can do it were both consenting adults its the new reality the little electronic lights are more real than that glass building with the pyramid on top she shivered the letter about the porn merchants went in the mail the first day over the next two days as i jimmied the whitemark computer system dace and maggie worked and reworked the approaches to the media on the public attack dace suggested that the whitemark letters to the generals be leaked first anonymously to a weekly defense newsletter called from the turret a lot of people read it a lot of reporters turrets not too scrupulous about what they use or where they get it if we drop them a note say we have been unfairly demoted in the company and send along the letters theyll use them he said it doesnt sound public enough maggie said with a frown i mean frankly every company in the defense industry hires retired generals to lobby for them we do you put that story in a defense newsletter there might be a few raised eyebrows but nothing much will happen ah but this isnt hiring a few generals this involves a quid pro quo theyre saying if our airplane is picked therell be jobs in procurement for those who helped us thats not recruiting thats bribery as soon as turret publishes we call the post the new york times and knightridder bureau and so on and tip them off just being in print gives the story cachet theyll be interested because its the kind of thing they expect to find in a newsletter then the next day we send along copies of the letters to the papers defense specialist writers think that will break it out i think so it wont be the biggest story of the year but it will be a nice one the front pages of the post probably a good inside spot in the times after we get that going maggie said we should get in touch with the business magazines about the problems theyre having meeting the hellwolf schedules that will have a nasty effect on their stock prices dace and luellen usually went out at night and often spent the night at his apartment i worked evenings maggie talked with chicago or worked with the other computer terminal via telephone with her chicago office one night simultaneously overcome with office fatigue and horniness we staggered into our bedroom pulling off clothes and fell on the bed in a frenzy afterward maggie showered and dropped into the bed naked and was instantly asleep the next morning i woke first yawned slid out of bed and halfopened the narrow venetian blinds that covered the bedroom window light flooded across the bed illuminating the long valley of her spine and the turn of her hip and shoulders her face was turned away her blond hair spread over the pillow she was still sleeping soundly i looked at her a moment then tiptoed out and got the big pad of parchment paper i use for sketching when she woke id done a half dozen preliminaries what are you doing she said sleepily drawing she was suddenly awake alarmed let me see those she crawled across the bed and i showed her the pad she looked at the drawings and lay back cant see my face she said i can always put it in i joked just what i need a nude picture of myself hanging over the bar what are you going to do with them probably do a paintingif i can convince you to lie in the light for a few mornings so i can get your skin i dont know id feel silly im no model she said and seemed genuinely shy that afternoon by chance i saw an oldfashioned redwhiteandbluechecked comforter in a shop window and went in and bought it dace and luellen were gone again the next morning and i got her to lie on it nude face down her head turned away the light streaming in over her shoulders and butt i spent an hour doing color studies before she put a stop to it how much do models get paid she asked depends on how good they are i said anything between nine and fifteen dollars an hour you owe me fifteen bucks she said pulling up her underpants fraid not youre awful five bucks at the most you kept scratching your back and youd move around on that checked background drove me nuts awful huh so its not a fallback if i get fired dace saw the beginnings of the painting that afternoon and whistled nice ass huh maggie said nice painting he said seriously maggie looked at me as if she had never seen me before the changes i sneaked into the whitemark computers were worked out on editing programs at the apartment i wrote the code on our machines tested it developed the sequence for inserting it at whitemark and put it in i was online with whitemark for only a few minutessometimes a matter of seconds as the work progressed i drifted into the traditional programming schedule the programming and debugging were done at night and i slept late once i even ordered out for a pizza with everything the only official programmer food the attack programs were inserted into the whitemark software during the heavy computerworking hours in the morning when wed be less likely to be noticed in the afternoons id paint id never worked in washington but it was an exceptional place with its heavy subtropical flora the water the varied stone and brick buildings going back two hundred years the light was almost italianate but bluer and clearer when i went out to paint often along the mall maggie would come along bring a book and a blanket and lie in the sun and read and doze dace and luellen were making plans for mexico with the burglaries done luellen had almost nothing to do and spent the days touring washington scouting possible burglary targets i suspected twice she flew back to duluth alone to make arrangements for a longer absence dace had decided on the west coast of mexico a semimodern fishing village in baja with americanowned villas on the hillside just the right combination of ambience and convenience he said his first novel would involve pentagon power politics with a dash of sexual intrigue like it really is maggie and dace sent the material on the generals off to turret dace playing the part of a demoted and treacherous executive called the newsletter to make sure they had gotten the package and that they understood it they had and they did the television stations were tipped on the pornographers and promised to make inquiries dace also spent some time hanging around the pentagon talking with reporter friends listening for rumors about whitemark there was nothing at first then slowly they began to come trouble with plans trouble with production disputes between lowerlevel managers over a series of brutal snafus on the ninth day of the attack i found something interesting in the whitemark system i had noticed a dataexchange line that ran out of the main computer to a satellite computer elsewhere i paid no attention to it until one day i saw an exchange that involved a remote terminal beyond the satellite that meant that somebody was telephoning the satellite computer and from there was getting into the main computer if i could learn how to access the satellite from the outside i could avoid the phone lines that went directly into the main computers for practical purposes i would be working from inside the whitemark building toward the end of the attack it might buy me a few more days of work unfortunately the computers accessed each other with special codes and i couldnt find the code listings inside the main system it was all done inside the satellite what i could see were incoming codes each fivenumeral code group was uniquethe same one was never used twice all the codes were handtyped so they werent coming off a master list on a disk eventually i fed a list of onceused codes to bobby explained the problem and asked if he had an analysis he called back three hours later the code is the th mersenne prime digits in groups of five starting with your code sample starts groups in and continues in sequence i am sending you the next sequence groups enough plenty how much my pleasure no charge bobby is not a person to bother with unimportant matters so i never asked him directly how he figured it out that he did is bizarre beyond words once i had the codes i got inside the satellite it turned out to be a small computer in the accounting department i got its phone number from its files on the tenth day of the attack maggie flew out to chicago she was back two days later how was anshiser i asked she sat at a dressing table with her back to me peering into a dark mirror as she took down her hair worse she said tersely i hate to look at him hes losing more weight his skin looks like crepe paper the doctors still dont know whats wrong they keep saying stress but some of them are nervous about the diagnosis he may go out to the mayo he should have gone a month ago i was lying on the bed in my shorts all the lights out except the small pinkshaded lamp on the dressing table the apartment was quiet dace was at his apartment closing it down and luellen was in duluth how has it been here maggie asked unscrewing an earring whitemark will figure it out soon now i said the engineering system is falling apart things must be chaotic the office mail system will stop working tomorrow thats the main way they route assignments and schedules so thatll be shot on friday the paychecks all come up short maggie dropped a second earring on the tabletop and turned on the cushioned bench so she was facing me turret comes out tomorrow she said i called dace this morning before i left chicago he had solid word that the generals story would be in it he didnt mention it to me i said i didnt see him today just the note on the table saying he would be at his place tonight she stood up and stepped toward the bed wearing a brassiere and panties and slip she pulled the slip over her head and tossed it negligently on a side chair you were on the computer and he didnt want to bother you she said he said you were in a fugue state undo me she sat on the edge of the bed i propped myself up and unsnapped the brassiere and kissed her between the shoulder blades she arched her shoulders and pivoted on her butt and lay back on her pillow her hair spreading out havent heard anything about the kiddie porn yet i said ah dace said something was happening he attached his video recorder to the tv and set the timer for the news programs its running now she said jesus i didnt even see it ive been out of it she rolled on her side facing me and slid her hand down inside my shorts aw has you been aw wonesome and sulking since mamas been gone i groaned god save me from women who talk baby talk to my dick oh yeah she said later that night we were lying in spoons my arm over her hip her butt against my stomach when she had been breathing deep and steady for ten minutes i got up and padded out of the room and quietly closed the door behind me i had the computer up a minute later and i was out on the phone lines looking around sometimes nothing will stop the code in your head the next day was the peak of the programming i sat on the computer for nine straight hours working out one piece after another checking debugging rechecking when i got out of the chair i could barely walk you need a fuji dace said as i hobbled out of the office whats that fujis watergate was a thoroughly westernized japanese bathhouse not far from the pentagonwesternized because the patrons wore tank suits and bathed in private groups the bathing pools were not much bigger than goodsized hot tubs but the water was infinitely hotter dace and maggie dropped into it moaned for a few seconds then relaxed and watched luellen and me test the water cmon youll live maggie said no guts with that luellen dropped in like a stone went completely under gasped and tried to crawl back out dace laughing grabbed her around the waist and held her squealing until she settled down get your ass in here kidd she said the water was hot enough to boil lobsters i slipped in an inch at a time to my hips supporting my weight with my hands thats the worst way dace said snidely you get ten minutes of pain instead of ten seconds ill do it my way i said youll boil your balls is what youll do maggie snorted luellen and dace looked at her strangely and she blushed then all three burst out laughing all right all right i took a breath and dropped the rest of the way in up to my chin luellen who is as strong as an ox reached over and pushed my head under for a moment i thought my heart had stopped when it started again i huddled up next to maggie until all the nerve endings died and i could straighten out jesus how long do we have to stay in here an hour or so maggie said grinning well be dead in an hour nonsense in two minutes youll feel fine she was right two minutes later i felt fine we floated around the pool talking not touching never mentioning whitemark or the attack luellen had been to the smithsonian anddace laughedhad been looking at the display of locks dace luellen said had been closing down his apartment and she had been helping when she cleaned out the front room she found a sack lunch behind the couch dace admitted that it was probably two years old from a tough time when he was making his own lunch there was a little plastic container of green grapes luellen said that had gone past raisinhood and had reached petrification maggie told the other two that when i thought she was asleep i snuck out of the bedroom and went back to the computer i cant compete i guess of course you can dace said ogling her thinly concealed breasts down boy said luellen maggie threw back her head and laughed and lay back in the water and she looked like a medieval swan queen come to life sometime during the fortyfive minutes we spent in the pool the code stopped running through my head the head of the whitemark systems department his wife and twentythreeyearold son were arrested at seven oclock the next morning on a variety of pornography charges all of them felonies it was midmorning and i was already on the machine working when the phone rang and maggie answered she listened for a moment said great and what channel and goodbye that was dace she reported leaning in the doorway he said to look at the morning break news on channel three he said the cops picked up our pornographer friends there was a live eye report right from the house we went into the living room and backed up the video recorder until we found the morning break segment and watched the three people coming out of the house in handcuffs i feel kind of sorry for them maggie said the wife a weighty grayhaired matron was weeping she tried to cover her face with her hands but the cameras tracked her right to the car think about what they were doing i said but it wasnt pretty after the unhappy family was bundled off in a squad car the camera cut to a half dozen uniformed cops filing in and out of the garage door carrying boxes full of magazines we watched until the end of the segment and then maggie called channel three listen she said when she got the news department if you hadnt heard this man they arrested on the child pornography is a very important executive at whitemark aerospace i work there and i know he runs all their computers i think some of the other guys in that department may be working with him on this porn thing theyre pretty close she listened for a minute no i cant if i told you my name i could get fired but hes really a bigshot she dropped the phone on the hook and it rang again almost before she had taken her hand away she listened for a moment said thanks and hung up dace again she said turret is out the generals are on the front they reprinted the critical letters word for word ah were rolling yes she got the phone book and methodically called the rest of the television stations about the tie between the pornographer and whitemark then she started calling the newspapers and wire services urging them to look at the turret article on day the wall street journal ran an expanded version of the turret story the new york times the post and the associated press followed the next day although the ap story was so hedged against libel that it was hard to tell what was happening the post is not nearly as good a paper as the times but it can bleed a story like an eighteenthcentury barbersurgeon squeezing every exquisite moment of agony out of a public death after reporting the generals relationship with whitemark it followed the next day with a complicated explanation by whitemark the day after that there was an even more complicated explanation from the generals paired with a post editorial deploring military corruption the day after that there was an analysis and the day after that more of the lettersdace had saved a few to use as fresheners after the story started to age dace also called the post metro desk and reminded them of the pornographers arrest he hinted that the release of letters was revenge taken by somebody in the computer department on the company that was currently blackguarding their former systems director that produced a masterpiece of analysis that ran on day in the meantime the paychecks failed on day and maggie planted rumors that swept through wall street on the following monday containing the killer phrase inadequate cash flow whitemark stock which had drifted higher during the year on favorable rumors about the hellwolf plummeted from seventyone to fiftynine on monday rebounded to sixty on tuesday and dropped to fiftyfour on wednesday is that good enough i asked she snorted anytime you take twentyfive percent of value off your target in two days youre doing okay she said youve done this before she had one computer hooked into a market bank and she looked up from the numbers and smiled not exactly like this but weve taken down a few in our time on day dace overheard a rumor about a fistfight at whitemark he chased it and over a couple of drinks an old friend told him that an engineer had attacked a computer tech on the production floor another computer tech jumped in and a couple other engineers tried to break it up and wound up in the fight themselves something weird is happening out there daces friend told him the security guys hauled everybody down to the lounge area to cool them off one of the computer techs told one of these security guys that the computers were possessed possessed yeah you know by the devil all through the attack when i was alone i looked at tarot spreads i did two dozen spreads on day the emperor the empress the wheel the moon the hanged man the fool i worried it i assigned identities and reassigned them i went to bed dreaming of anshiser and the hermit on day maggie had a long talk with dillon luellen and dace and i were in the kitchen drinking coffee when she got off the line dillons freaked out she said whitemark is shaking right down to the roots theyre paralyzed their string copy is failing theyre running into new problems with hellwolf dillon said theyre completely out of control he sounded scared he said were making history he said this was like pearl harbor but nobody recognizes it except us so its working said luellen look what happened to the japs dace said hows anshiser i asked maggie shook her head dillon says hes about the same hes not losing much but hes not gaining either so so we just go on at one oclock on the morning of day a few hours after maggie talked with dillon the phone rang i picked it up and got a baud carrier tone i punched the modem up and there was a quick squirt of data and the line shut down something happens with whitemark phone lines cutouts watching incoming calls at whitemark set to trace from now on call me at special line number only call now i dialed a special number bobby had arranged that couldnt be traced out to him the techniques were unremarkable he said but if a trace were made it would end at an afghanistan banana stand which hed found while paging through a kabul phone directory in the kremlin when he came up this time there was no what tried to trace the tracers not go to fbi go to nsa scary shit recommend stay off wires use back door only okay recommend that you change your main number leave me only special line will do now need more money you got more sure will send k bye frankly what i did in vietnamit sounds silly now when i think about itwas run up and down the ho chi minh trail and bug vc telephone lines most people dont think about the vc having phone lines and operators and all that but they did of course id find a good place tap into a line lead it out to a batteryoperated radio disguised to look like a lump of mud or a pollywog or whatever the backroom boys at the cia thought was good that month and sneak away for the next couple of weeks wed listen to their phone calls which i was told went mostly like this hey vang you see the knockers on that pfc came down with that load of bike tires yesterday honest to ho i wanted to crawl right in between them and play motorboat you know what i mean in the course of gathering this intelligence i met dozens of people from the cia most of them were okay a few were stone killers and one or two were terminally stupid i met only two guys from the national security agency both were frighteningly smart somewhere at the back of my head i tucked away a personal memo that said if you get your ass out of this dont fuck with the nsa after bobbys warning i began entering the whitemark computer through the satellite the computer that used the codes from the mersenne prime it was an old machine a minicomputer with its own phone lines it wasnt used much but it did have that direct line into the main system i would call into the satellite and from there plug into the main system if the nsa was watching only the incoming phone lines for the main computer i could still get in without being noticed if my presence in the main machine was detected it would seem that i was working from inside the system itself on the morning of day i put in several minor bombs calculated to alter some critical bits of software in a way that would not be immediately detectable but which would thoroughly screw selected work output on day on the same day the justice department announced a special task force to investigate the whitemark relationship with defense department officials i changed the code that did whitemarks floatingpoint mathematics the change would be virtually undetectable and the resulting design problems would be almost impossible to pinpoint at one oclock on the morning of day as i was working on a couple of final items bobby called again more phone changes believe monitoring entire exchange for data transmissions recommend shutdown can i get in one last time there was a pause and then if you call special number can piggyback on me i call whitemark when get in you put in code i watch lines one time only okay tomorrow am your time luellen was back the next morning and she and dace came in with maggie to watch over my shoulder as we put the last program in or tried to is there any possibility that they could trace us here luellen asked i dont think so but with the nsa you cant be sure if they do bobby will know well get out luellen looked around the room what about fingerprints and everything were all over this place if theyre good enough to trace us through bobbys intercepts were cooked i admitted all we can do is run for it and hope anshisers interference will pay off even if they pick up prints wed have a day or two you guys can get out to mexico maggie can get back to chicago and ill take off in my car shit that doesnt sound so good luellen said whats the risk whats the benefit maggie asked ive got a nice finishing touch to put in and to tell you the truth i think bobbys at least as good with phones as anybody at nsa besides theyre not expecting him they dont know we can see the traces coming out she thought about it for a minute pulling at her lip lets do it she said you on line with code yes second squirt be ready bobby dialed us into whitemark through the satellite when it came up i punched it in and our modem started transmitting two seconds into it the transmission shut down as though cut with an ax holy shit i muttered what luellen said anxiously bobby shut us down i hope you hope yeah i hope it was bobby a second later the phone rang and we all looked at it like it was a cobra after a couple of rings i picked it up and heard the familiar carrier tone i turned on the modem again those suckers fast they on line followed me at least to rome maybe all the way to banana stand you okay we okay yes but you must shut down now no more entries or they get us yes will call later still special line bye whats the special number maggie asked its a cutout i dont know the details but it signals him that im trying to reach him hes changed the main number the one i used to have and i dont have it anymore we dont know exactly what nsa might do if they caught us but just in case i mean if they use chemicals its better if i dont know how to get him if they get the special number out of me and try to use it hell see the trace and get out good luck on that luellen said we all sat and looked at the monitor for a moment there was nothing on it thats it i said feeling suddenly tired were all done jesus said dace i looked over at maggie satisfied im going in to chicago she said dillon will be doing a final analysis well shut down here are you coming back or should we come there you wait here there might be something else dillon thinks we should doi dont know what but maybe something ill bring the rest of the money she looked pinched taut if the job wasnt done now it would never be done dillon would know chapter the figure of maggie was the best painting id ever done she looked at it when it was finished and said its mine the day after the end of the attack i rolled it and slid it into a shipping tube as she packed her clothes this has been a strange experience she said on the way to national she had the window down and her hair blew out behind her a team like yours opens up all kinds of possibilities when i get back to chicago im going to ask dillon for a crash study of corporate aggression to work out the limits and the consequences tell him to call me i said i have some thoughts about it yes she turned and stared out the window lost in thought this attack on whitemark theres a temptation to write it out document it then stash it somewhere it could be a classic someday like clausewitzs on war dont use my name i said call me ann smith or something equally innovative at the airport i waited until her plane was called and kissed her goodbye she walked out through the gate with the painting tube under her arm she looked back once and smiled dace and luellen finished packing his apartment the few things he wanted to keep were put in storage and the rest of it was sent to a goodwill store i spent the afternoon working at the apartment disassembling the office and cleaning up a little portable computer with a builtin modem watched the phone in case bobby called the attack programs we used against whitemark had been written in a deliberately structured functional but inelegant programming style if nsa or the fbi had a textual analysis capability for computer code the structured programs wouldnt match any examples of my usual programming style it was a small piece of security probably unnecessary but who knows the computers and printer had to go for the same security reasons if there were tapes of incoming data from our terminals a sophisticated analysis of transmission peculiarities might identify them same with the printer type should they compare samples with the printout sent to the cops with the pornography package i hated the thought of dropping the equipment in the river so i packed it with newspapers in three big cardboard boxes hauled the boxes to a delivery service and had them sent to an elementary school in a slum area the note said the equipment was from a friend dace and luellen showed up just before dark and we all went out to eat later that evening i put the phones back where they were when we rented the place we would leave the working table the landlord could get rid of it the next morning dace and luellen took care of financial matters and shopped i called bobby at the special number told him wed be out of touch for a few days and took the portable and the rest of our personal stuff down to the car when the apartment was empty i started wiping the place down it was another piece of security that would probably be unnecessary but maggie before she left for chicago had insisted on it we know the place is used by prostitutes if there should be any trouble here in the next few weeks and they find fingerprints from a computer expert and an executive from anshiser aviation and a washington publicity expert and a burglar im not on record as a burglar anywhere luellen said you see my point though maggie had said somebody smart could reach the right conclusion the chances of a problem are almost nonexistent i said exactly almost but not quite itll take two hours and itll eliminate the possibility she stuck out her lower lip for me i was nearly finished wiping the apartment when the phone rang it was maggie calling from chicago its done she said crisply ill be back tonight with the cash dillons analysis indicated that whitemark was reeling its stock had dropped into the forties then started drifting back up but only because of takeover rumors the hellwolf project was dead in the water due to massive problems with their design system computers work on their copy of the string system had stopped manufacturing had problems with supply coordination and couldnt straighten them out routine administrative work was completely tangled the company would again fail to meet the payroll at the end of the week the unions threatened to walk out unless the paychecks were validated the press was still pushing the corruption stories and procurement people at the pentagon were afraid to talk to anybody at whitemark the whitemark systems director had been fired after his arraignment on child pornography charges to make everything worse the fbi was crawling all over the place questioning employees about a possible source of the attack which they suspected was internal the interrogations further disrupted the process of straightening out the company rudy is very pleasedalso a little frightened he hired the biggest computer security people in the country to revamp our system she said her voice sounded oddly tight who have they got i asked she mentioned three names and i recognized all of them one was a charlatan but the other two were good they were all expensive and not likely to miss much how soon will they finish i asked she hesitated for a moment and then said yesterday yesterday rudy hired them right after we started the attack on whitemark my reports scared everybody out here so he hired these people and gave them three weeks and a big bunch of money most of what they did was rearranging phone lines and moving furniture and they changed some procedures there wasnt much new equipment involved anyway they finished yesterday rudy was talking about hiring you in a year or so to see if you could crack it you know where to find me i said right on a sandbar she said have you got the apartment cleaned up you mean wiped just about im just finishing the kitchen now we could meet downtown somewhere to split the cash but we thought this was convenient to the airport no no ill see you there i should be in about seven oclock dace and luellen got back in the early afternoon and dace had shed another five years he was wearing an expensive tweed coat a dark blue shirt with silk knit tie whipcord pants and leather boat shoes he was pleased with his appearance for christs sake dont touch anything i said as they came in what do you think he said spreading his arms luellen stood behind him grinning straight out of esquire i said and look at this he said he pulled out a bundle of travelers checks twentyfive thousand in tens and twenties i made him go to ten different banks luellen laughed this ought to take care of us for six months or a year dace said thumbing through the stack of checks if it doesnt we can always come back for more with the new clothes and the money burning in his pocket dace wanted to run around to newspaper and public relations offices and buy drinks for a few friends and contacts it wouldnt be a good idea if i just disappeared he said besides i like some of these guys ill be back in time to eat i got my painting gear and luellen and i went down to the banks of the potomac where i did a watercolor as good as anything id ever done the whitemark attack sat on the surface of my mind but the painting took care of itself it was all eye and hand and the pigment seemed to flow without effort by the time i finished i was beginning to hyperventilate luellen had gone off across the park and as i was looking at it wondering about one more touch one last touchits always the last ones that ruin paintingsshe walked up and looked jesus christ kidd thats good she said i swirled the brush through the icecream bucket i used as my main water container when it was clean i dropped it back in its box and tossed the bucket of water out on the grass it was good by god september is beautiful in washington one of the best months of the year the sky was a perfect china blue and there was just a hint of leaf smoke in the air luellen was chatting along as we walked back to the car and i kept sneaking looks at the painting the nude of maggie was the best figure id ever done this was the best landscape and it had come out in two hours was it luck or was it a breakthrough i put the painting in the trunk carefully braced between two suitcases on top of the portable so it wouldnt rattle around on the way back to the apartment i stopped at a grocery and bought a pack of kitchen gloves having wiped the entire place i didnt intend to leave any isolated prints during the final cleanup at the apartment there was an odd moment before we went inside a car was parked across the street a red buick with tinted windows dark glass wasnt uncommon in washington and i paid no attention but as we walked up to the apartment door i happened to glance back at it and caught the white crescent of face close to the glass in the cars back window maggie if you work in figurative art you quickly become aware of the strange qualities of human perception a mother can walk up to a playground and immediately spot her kid among dozens of others all of whom are about the same size and color and wearing similar clothing you can see a friend from a block away too far to pick out details of face or color or dress and recognize him instantly i saw the flash of white and thought maggie but nobody got out of the car and she wasnt due for two hours i let it go and followed luellen into the apartment and up the stairs dace was sitting in the kitchen drinking a cup of coffee and reading the post he looked up when we came in and said havent touched a thing except this coffee cup you ready luellen asked kissing him on the forehead anytime he said i want to go through this place literally on our hands and knees to make sure were not leaving anything behind i said let me finish the sports dace said i dont think they write about the skins down in mexico luellen and i pulled on the plastic gloves and she followed me to the first bedroom i got down on my knees and looked under the bed she pulled open the drawers in the bureau theres not going to be anything she said look under the shelf paper too i said she rolled her eyes and started pulling the shelf paper out of the drawers we were about finished with the first room when the doorbell rang luellen looked at me and i stood up maggie i said i thought i saw her could be the landlord dace said coming out of the kitchen with the paper in one hand and the coffee cup in the other i told him wed be pulling out he crossed to the door and opened it two men stood in the hallway the one in back was mostly out of sight but he was big the one in front was wearing a neat redandwhite striped golf shirt tan slacks and tennis shoes ratface he pulled a long skinny gun from under his shirt and raised it toward dace dace said wait and held up the newspaper and ratface shot him three times in the head the shots went phutphutphut luellen who had gone into the hallway before i did spun and started toward me and we both surged back into the bedroom and i slammed the door and flipped the lock since it was a whorehouse the door was heavy wood and the locks were solid but i picked up the rosewood dressing table and literally threw it against the door luellen didnt stop to look she dashed across the bedroom to the oldfashioned doublehung windows frantically turned the crescent lock on the top of one and slid it up and slapped at the hooks holding the screen outside gogogo she screamed she had her feet out the window and i ran across the room toward her the guy in the hallway outside kicked the bedroom door at the lock but it held and he kicked it again but by then i was at the window watching luellen drop into the alley behind the apartment she landed like a cat and turned to run toward the back of the building i slid through hung for a second heard the door splinter and dropped luellen was thirty feet in front of me when i landed i yelled car car and she cut behind the apartment when i turned the corner she was squatting gasping for breath next to the passenger door i unlocked the drivers side slid in pulled the lock and cranked the engine we left the back end of the lot in a hurry and luellen looking back said there he is looking in the rearview mirror as we turned the corner i saw ratface limp around the building stop and then hobble back out of sight they killed dace luellen moaned yeah there was nothing else to say i took a left at the next corner drove a block took another left and headed west toward a big commercial street there was no sign of a chase what the fuck happened luellen demanded who were those guys i dont know i said but theyve got maggie too what luellen was stricken her face white and drawn but she was functioning what makes you think that when we were going into the building i thought i saw her face in a car across the street i didnt think it could be her because shes not due for a couple hours but i got a bad feeling theyre not coming after us luellen said lets get on another street somewhere find a phone and call chicago theyll know if she left early if she didnt they should know her flight number and we can catch her at the airport i drove another two miles and spotted a phone booth outside a convenience store i pulled around to the side of the store where the car couldnt be seen from the street and called chicago collect maggie had not left early shed taken a three oclock flight out of ohare just as she had planned and was still in the air dillon was stunned by the shooting i dont know what to tell you he said this is far out of bounds from anything ive ever heard of who would they be whitemark they cant just be some fuckin private eyes like you guys said i said thats what we got from people in washingtongood people that theyre just private detectives i dont know it doesnt add up there was another long silence and finally he said i cant imagine it would be whitemark big corporations can be ruthless but we dont have gunmen hanging around im afraid it might be the federal people when we checked on these private detectives we heard theyd had some trouble with the government in the past remember yeah i remember something like that so maybe somebodys got them on a string it would be a way of killing somebody without official involvement but why would they come after us there was another moment of silence and he said in a cooler voice its very hard to think very hard but suppose they figured out what happened at whitemark and talked to each other and said if we arrest these people the publicity could set off a whole rash of these things like a rash of jet hijackings if there is some kind of murder squad in the cia or the nsa they might have decided that this was the most expedient way to solve the problem jesus i said i thought about the people id known in the strategic operations group a few were killers plain and simple they were career military men special forces and some held rank but at heart they were gunmen if an intelligence agency needed a couple of shooters theyd know where to find them and private investigation was just the kind of job that attracted former company cowboys where are you dillon asked i looked around but there were no street signs i dont know standing at a eleven on a street corner we have to stay out of sight for a while and then head out to the airport in time to find maggie no dont do that they may very well be looking for you at the airport ill call maggie in the air we have a business code we use for open phones when were negotiating deals and i can warn her off shell call me from national and ill tell her what happened and turn her right back around there wont be anything you can do for her ill arrange for extra security and talk to mr anshiser about what to do next so what about us if we can get a line on who it is we might be able to work some kind of a deal can you call back here later yeah well get out of town find someplace we can hide out for a couple of days until we figure out whats happened what about your friend the one who was shot theres nothing we can do about that i said theres no way he could still be alive all right we can leave that for now had you finished wiping the apartment yes good and you still have your car yes if theyre federal or have federal sponsors they may put out a watch for your car they wont have done it yet though if they thought they would catch you at the apartment and if theyre an assassination team theyre illegal it might take them a while to get everything set can you hold on there just a minute yes his phone receiver hit the desktop and i scanned the street for the red buick with the dark windows nothing cars coming and going some of them red but nothing that looked like the buick okay are you still there yes im looking at a road atlas i would recommend that you take highway fifty east through annapolis cross the bay then head north through wilmington and into new jersey im not uptospeed on police procedure but as i understand it watch bulletins usually go out on a statebystate basis thats the shortest distance that will get you out of all the states surrounding marylandvirginia you can be in new jersey in less than three hours that sounds good i said well call you when we find a place dillon had pulled himself together he sounded like an intelligence officer giving a briefing calm detached certain but then he wasnt being hunted and he hadnt known dace get as far away as you can the closer you get to new york the less attention the local police should pay to routine watch bulletins theyve got other problems okay call back here in six hours i should know something then luellen was lying in the backseat of the car she wasnt weeping she was absolutely still her arm thrown across her eyes her breathing shallow and quick as though she had been injured you okay im fucked she said just drive i went back into the eleven bought a map a pack of donuts and a styrofoam cooler that i stocked with ice and two sixpacks of coke in the car i traced out the course dillon had recommended and five minutes later we were on the way we caught the evening rush going out of town the trip was a nightmare of stopandgo we saw state troopers twice both times they were involved in clearing fenderbenders luellen lay in the backseat for an hour before climbing into the front her eyes were red and sunken but there were no tears theres no chance hes alive is there no they shot him three times going in if he was still alive they would have shot him again before they left who were they we dont know dillons trying to figure it out well call him from camden think theyll come after us she asked probably ill be the main target but youve seen their faces wed better stick together until we find out if they havent made you youd best get on a plane to duluth and lie low for a while we stopped once at a fastfood place in delaware luellen said she had to call duluth and she used a phone on the wall of the restaurant while i sat in the car and ate a soggy cheeseburger i got the name of a guy in philadelphia she said for what in case you want to buy a gun no questions a few minutes after eight oclock going north out of wilmington i spotted a chain electronics store in a strip shopping center and pulled in supplies i told luellen i ransacked the stores telephone and homefurnishings departments bought a few general electronics tools a power drill drill bits and a stapler paid and threw the sack in the backseat of the car now wheres this guy with the gun i asked the guy with the gun lived in a suburb of philadelphia a place with small lawns and aluminumsided ramblers and a maple tree in the center of each front yard we found his house after twenty minutes of searching he met us at the door mr drexel asked luellen yes you must be miss carlson yes weenie called about us this is a friend come in he said he was a solemn type tall and bespectacled with a ruddy outdoorsmans complexion he was dressed from the l l bean catalog with a blue pinstriped oxford cloth shirt and cotton slacks with cargo pockets on the sides his wife and teenage daughter were watching a movie on television in the living room the woman said hello but the girl ignored us we followed drexel down a short flight of stairs into the basement the basement contained a neat wellequipped woodworking shop and a couple of metalcutting machines a fullsize unfinished airplane wing hung on one wall building a plane drexel said laconically finish it in a year or so he led the way to an upright cabinet in one corner now what exactly did you have in mind he asked i havent handled a handgun since i was in the army i said he arched one eyebrow and opened the cabinet the top was filled with long weapons ms and aks the bottom contained drawers filled with shorter arms he opened a drawer and pulled out two bundles wrapped in oiled paper in that case and depending on your requirements i would suggest one of these two weapons he said the first looked like it had been made in a high school metal shop all rough edges and bent black steel this is a mac a great favorite with drug smugglers i understand he handed it to me its simple to operate and this model is fully automatic a submachine gun if you will he turned to luellen you pull the trigger and a stream of bullets comes out for as long as you hold down the trigger or until you run out of ammo i have sixteen and thirtyshot custom clips for it the gun felt big and awkward in my hand i held it up and sighted down the length of the shop the front sight wavered in front of me you really wouldnt want to shoot it like that he said hold it closer to the body so you can brace your elbow he showed me what else do you have ah this one you may be more familiar with it he unwrapped the second bundle and showed me a colt identical to the one id qualified with in the army what do you think i asked luellen she shook her head i dont know about guns if i might recommend drexel sounded like a wine waiter dealing with a couple of firsttime drinkers if you need something for immediate selfprotection and dont have time for practicei got the impression from mr weenie that this was the casethen id recommend the mac even the rankest amateur can do amazing damage with it though it is a bit more expensive i took it and he ran me through its operation he also sold me one thirty and two sixteenround clips for the gun already loaded and for the lady he asked uh i dont think i want anything luellen said looking at me anxiously let me show you this one he said he reached back into one of his drawers and pulled out a handsized doublebarreled derringer a h r magnum very safe and very simple to operate you should use it only in the most extreme circumstances of course in this caliber at five yards you could actually miss your target at two yards or two feet its quite effective luellen looked at the tiny gun for a moment glanced at me looked back at drexel and nodded ill take it she said make sure you pull the trigger with your index finger its so small that theres a temptation to use your middle finger and lay your index finger along the barrel but if your finger overlaps its going to catch a lot of muzzle blast okay luellen nodded uncertainly just pull the trigger with your trigger finger he said smiling the two guns cost us twentyfive hundred dollars we rewrapped them in the oiled paper and went back out to the car the wife nodding pleasantly as we tramped through the living room again if you need anything else drexel said as we got in the car dont hesitate to call the next stop was the airport i left the car in the longterm parking lot rented a nondescript dodge and transferred the luggage we were an hour north of philadelphia before i spotted the right kind of hotela long low lshaped place inexpensive with two dozen cars distributed up and down its length i told the desk clerk that my secretary and i wanted adjoining rooms but without connecting doors ive got divorce proceedings going i said trying out a sheepish grin i dont want people to think you know he knew and he wasnt interested luellen was dazed and heavyeyed from the stress we have to keep going another half hour or so and then we can get some sleep i said we unloaded the box of electronics supplies in my room the first item was a compact motion detectora burglar alarm i mounted it behind the door at ankle level then i made a few simple changes in the telephone wall outlet next using the power drill id bought i drilled a neat hole through the wall into luellens room and ran two lines through the first line was hooked into the motion detector if my door opened the detector would buzz us in luellens room the second line would allow me to make and take calls in luellens room from my phone the stapler made the job neat all the wiring ran under the edge of the carpet along the baseboards even a maid shouldnt notice the changes if its the cia or nsa they could be monitoring everything anshisers got if they trace us itll give us a break i said we left the car one space down from luellens room in front of another room where the lights were on and carried our suitcases the portable and our cash reserve down to luellens what can fast check anshiser house lines for trace yes minutes need money no put terminal on receive luellen had collapsed on the bed and was out breathing jerkily with an occasional moan but asleep i was crumbling when bobbys call came in and the terminal automatically answered lines clean thanx maggies not back yet but shes okay i turned her around at national and talked to her in the air not more than an hour ago we still dont know what happened dillon said its hard to ask the right questions without admitting your guilt what if they dont know what were talking about then well have to look into other possibilities it could be whitemark but that doesnt seem likely mr anshiser was wondering if it might have something to do with the nature of the place you were staying some kind of prostitutionrelated activity a mistake just like we thought the first time thats bullshit i said you dont kill somebody to get the goods on him for a divorce they knew who we were and they were there to kill us yes thats what i think dillon said maggie should be back almost anytime she wants to talk to you can you give me a number yeah i gave him the motels phone number and my own room extension have her call as soon as she gets in luellen groaned again and said dace and started to wake up shh i whispered go back to sleep she frowned and muttered something but went quiet again i turned out the light took off my shoes and put my head on the pillow feeling her breathing next to me thats all i knew until the phone rang chapter the phone sounded like a distant dentists drill id wrapped it in a heavy synthetic blanket to muffle the ringing and now i couldnt find it i twisted off the bed and floundered around for a minute in the darkness and finally stepped on it what said luellen i got it the receiver came free and i said yeah kidd this is maggie jesus you okay yes i just got back i talked to dillon and well start talking to people in washington in the morning but weve got another problem something happened to rudy he collapsed hes on his way to the medical center the ambulance just left a stroke a heart attack what no no he started spouting gibberish babbling it could be nervous exhaustion a breakdown they dont know ill let you know when we hear okay tell me what happened at the apartment i told her in a few words and she asked if we were sure that dace was dead if they werent shooting blanks ratface shot him three times from a range of about two feet luellen grabbed me by the arm i half turned and then i heard it the soft buzz of the alarm the door in my room had been opened ah shit i said what whats going on maggie asked somebodys outside i gotta call the cops talk to you later i said and hung up luellen crawled across to the single window and peeked out through a gap between the heavy fiberglass curtain and the windowsill dont move the curtain i said i fumbled the mac out of the open suitcase cocked it and crawled over beside her theres nobody out there she said the alarm continued to burp you think wait a minute wait a minute i looked out over her head we couldnt see much but a man in a dark raincoat stepped onto the sidewalk outside my room theyre confused i whispered they dont know what to do the dark shape moved away and i crawled back to the telephone and dialed is this an emergency goddamned right it is im the night clerk at the knights ease motel and there are two guys with fuckin machine guns out in the parking lot jesus christ i gotta go and i slammed the phone down think theyll send somebody oh yeah and if theyre good jersey cops theyll come in with the sirens screaming thats in case there really are guys with machine guns itll give them a chance to get away we huddled below the window listening the mac ready if the hunters were talking to the night clerk he might tell them about my secretary so we waited in the dark until we heard the siren and then risked another look a few seconds later two men crossed the parking lot and got into a big red buick with dark windows thats them luellen breathed ratface was wearing a tan gabardine trench coat that looked two sizes too big for him the other guy was a barrelchested pug in a cheap doubleknit suit he moved with the easy grace of an aging heavyweight fighter yeah the car pulled away and we watched it all the way to the freeway entrance when the phone rang again luellen started across the room i grabbed her ankle dont i said it rang thirty times before it stopped by then the cops were in the parking lot we left the hotel twenty minutes later on the heels of the cops hustling the luggage and the computer into the car we didnt bother to drop off the keys but left them with a tendollar bill on a bureau i did clean up the phone and alarm wires leaving nothing behind but a nearly invisible halfinch hole in the wall we need some sleep before we can think i said well head back through philadelphia and grab a motel somewhere on the other side were not worried about federal cops anymore from the corner of my eye i could feel her studying my face no you figured it out she asked some of it im glad i didnt have to tell you that was no coincidence the phone call coming at exactly the same time as those two goons maggie fingered us theres more to it than that i said she thought for a minute then nodded that ratfaced guy he got here in an hour and a half with the car i said the car was the one i saw in washington dillon routed them right along with us they must have driven up to philadelphia then waited for us to call he told me to call in six hours which would tell them about how far wed get but jesus christ kidd what are they doing i dont know maybe anshiser cut a deal with the feds i dont think so the feds wouldnt be interested in knocking off the small guys and letting the big ones go theyd do it the other way around if anything net the big fish jesus she said maggie remember her in the japanese baths kidding you about burning your balls off i thought shed never stop laughing she was a friend i thought you two guys were developing into something i thought so too and dace is dead we drove into the philadelphia airport and retrieved my car before we left i called bobby from a phone booth using the portable what need everything you can find on hellwolf whitemark and sunfire anshiser crash jobs fulltime flat fee need feeds every few hours leave terminal on answer leaving the airport we turned back west the appearance of the two hoods and the inevitable conclusion about maggie kept me awake i drove all the way through to gettysburg where we checked into the biggest motel we could find i put luellen to bed called bobby and took the first dump of information on anshiser and sunfire luellen slept most of the day woke up long enough to eat and went back down for the night i was beatup but drove into town and bought another printer so i could dump incoming files to paper late in the day bobby was calling every hour and the stuff was coming faster and faster most of it was useless lightweight businessmagazine stuff public biographies id seen some of it during the first runthrough before taking the job on the second day a rainstorm came through from the west it killed a spell of late september heat and replaced it with autumn the rain left the park grounds dark and somber i walked luellen along cemetery ridge pointing out the path of picketts charge it doesnt look so hard its not hardly a hill she said it didnt have to be the crest was just high enough to hide the federals and give them some cover during the preparatory barrage the southerners thought the cannonading had done a lot more damage than it had but they came up the hill into a hornets nest the high tide of the confederacy the south was defeated that week lee was turned around here and out west grant was taking vicksburg what a time wed gone out to the battlefield during a break in the rain but now it was sweeping in again a thin gray wall coming down from seminary ridge across the peach orchard obscuring the roundtops and up the hill we turned our backs on it retreated to the car i was supposed to be in mexico today luellen said as we went back to the motel she stared out the window and tears trickled down her cheeks i couldnt think of anything to say we rode back to the beat of the windshield wipers and the sound of wet pavement hissing under the wheels another lengthy file was waiting at the motel i dumped it to the printer and started working through it ten minutes later i found it thats funny i sat up on the bed what i looked at the source of the article i was reading one of the popular science magazines ive seen a couple of references to a guidance system called snagger for the hellwolf so so it sounds a hell of a lot like the string system but i havent seen anything about string what need word search on all files references string and snagger it took about six hours to accumulate but when we had done it the facts were clear enough anshiser never had the string system whitemark developed the snagger same thing essentially anshiser didnt have a clue then six months ago when preliminary design studies were due word got out that whitemark was onto something big anshiser didnt have anything to compare with it so anshiser stole it from whitemark not the other way around looks like it they desperately needed time to understand snagger and do a knockoff for their own plane thats where we came in that whole routine they did in chicago was an act jesus i bought the whole thing luellen sat hunched on the bed her hair hanging limp down the sides of her face her face wrinkled in thought eventually she shook her head and looked up so so yeah so what she said so they conned us into doing a job on whitemark what difference does it make if theyd told you the truth and offered you two million to take down whitemark you probably would have said yes anyway they lied but thats no reason to start shooting at us were no more likely to go to the cops now than if they were telling the truth maybe not but it makes what we did a lot more serious especially for anshiser if whitemark had stolen the string system and anshiser could prove it it might have cost whitemark the contract or a lawsuit so big that winning the contract would have been meaningless but if anshiser stole snagger and then wrecked whitemark to slow them down so they could do a knockoff and if whitemark could prove it then anshiser is ruined absolutely and if anshiser had hired the job done by a group of outsiders and one of them was a newspaper guy with a reputation for busting defense industries and another one was a thief whose name he didnt even know it might make sense to get rid of them permanently luellen concluded we both thought about it for a minute where did they get the gunmen she asked i shrugged anshiser is a defense industry they know all kinds of people they probably found a couple of exspecial forces guys looking for a little cash and then youve got a couple of guys who know the story and have killed people because of it luellen objected i dont know it sounds weak they wouldnt have to tell those guys the whole story just point them at the targets i said i cant think of any other rationale the motel room had two single beds when we went to sleep that night luellen suddenly said in the dark id like to come over and sleep with you but like no sex i just want to sleep with somebody come on she snuggled in against me and we whispered back and forth for a while and then she drifted away her body warmth under the blanket reminded me of maggie like a black patch on my mind i was dozing off when the computer alarm sounded and i rolled out of bed to look something weird what been in newspaper clip files gone way back anshiser old man was in german mob what chicago had german mob like mafia anshiser father convicted in extortion two years in prison charged murder and extortion not guilty no more charges but mentioned in stories as accountant for german mob dont know what that is yet keep digging look for stuff on anshiser and associates already got most of it got access to criminal intelligence data banks fbi no tried once maximum protection how about ncic easy access if got codes need codes who got codes i find call back later want mob clips now he dumped the clips to the computer there werent many of them but there was enough information to suggest that anshisers father was a major crime figure exactly what he did was unclear from the clips i had just finished reading the clips when bobby called again he had a name when luellen woke the next morning she smiled a small tentative smile the first one id seen since the shooting i dont know how to break it to you i said what happened she asked quickly serious weve got to hit another house we need some more codes i told her about the background on anshisers father we need to get into some crime intelligence files bobby found a guy for us he goes into the ncicthe national crime information centerfrom his home computer uh is this guy yeah hes a cop chapter the cop was named denton he was the liaison man between the washington police and the national crime information center supervising computerentry work for the city ive never hit a cop before luellen said she was worried it shouldnt be any worse than the others maybe hell have better locks we were leaving gettysburg we could see blue sky to the south and west but the town was still under a dark slab of cloud and it was raining again a semitrailer ahead of us on the highway threw up a plume of water and resolutely fought off attempts by the cars behind him to pass we slowed to fifty then to fortyfive and settled down for a long trip there might be another problem luellen said when dace and i were going around town i didnt see many white cops if hes black and he lives in a black neighborhood everybody on the block will be looking at us bobby says hes black all right but he and his wife live out in bethesda i said shes got a heavy job with the commerce department and hes a lieutenant so theyve got a few bucks we need this right asked luellen yeah we have to know whats going on all right but if we wind up in deep shit dont say i didnt warn you when we got to bethesda the sun was shining and the clouds were blowing out to the northeast the streets were still damp with dead oak leaves stuck to them and everything smelled cool and clean the dentons lived in a low dark woodandstone house on a lot with tall trees in the back and a narrow sloping front yard there were no extragreen tufts of grass basement windows were set into the foundation and the garage was attached to the left side of the house as you approached it beside the garage a tall gray board fence separated the dentons yard from the one next door look at that fence must not like their black neighbors i said as we cruised by the first time thats a pool fence luellen said matteroffactly theres a swimming pool back there in the neighbors yard theres a law about putting fences around your pools to keep kids out we drove past once more everything about the house was neat and in good repair theyve got money all right i said maybe we ought to check them out for a maid no black cop in the world has a maid not if he wants to get ahead lets find a phone lets call them and if theyre working lets do it today right now you sure goddamned right im sure she sounded fierce tight angry i looked her over and slowed the car if youre doing it because youre scared or pissed about dace thats not good enough it wont help him if were busted or shot i said im scared and im pissed about dace but im not crazy she said looking across the seat at me the house feels right theres nobody home theres hardly anybody on the street this is the time i took a left at the first street and drove to a shopping center she dipped into her purse for cocaine and took the first hit as we pulled up to a phone we got mrs dentons secretary but mrs denton was in a meeting and couldnt speak to us we left a message tell her bob called we couldnt get the cop on the phone he was working a woman said but he might be out for an early lunch we called the house there was no answer i clipped the phone and luellen took a deep breath lets go she said youre sure youre making me nervous i shoved the phone receiver under the car seat this one feels nervouser probably because hes a cop she said she had the cellophane wrap of coke in the palm of her hand lets get it the fuck over with cmon we dropped the car at a park and walked down to the demons an oldsmobile passed us as we were approaching the house and the driver lifted a finger in greeting as though he recognized us i nodded and luellen lifted a hand we slowed to let the car get out of sight before we turned into the dentons driveway a small louvered window in what was probably the kitchen or bathroom was cranked open we could hear the phone ringing as we walked up to the house hold it a minute luellen said as we walked in front of the garage there was a row of windows in the garage door just at shoulder height and she peered through them all right she muttered distractedly glancing up and down the street she took my arm and led me around the side of the house between the garage and the neighbors pool fence there was a door on the back of the garage and it hung open we stepped into the garage nice and private luellen said there was a space for two cars side by side both spaces were empty a lawnmower smelling faintly of gasoline and grass clippings was pushed against one wall several fishing rods hung on one wall along with a small net a sack of birdseed and another of fertilizer sat on the floor below the rods two bikes hung by their wheels from hooks screwed into the rafters a pair of green plastic garbage cans stood beside the door into the house luellen tried the door it was locked we were standing on a doormat and she pushed me away and lifted it nothing then she scanned the walls and finally looked up at the overhead tracks for the garage door can you reach up there she asked if i stand on the garbage can i stood on the can and stretched to the track slid my fingers along a few inches and pushed the key off the track into luellens waiting hands wala she said cops can be as dumb as anyone else she cracked open the door and used her doggie whistle nothing anybody home she called the phone kept ringing we went inside and she picked it up and dropped it back on the hook we dont have to trash the place if we can get the stuff and get out hell never know we were here she said the house arrangement was purely functional a kitchen dining room living room library two bedrooms and two bathrooms along with a miscellany of closets marched straight down from the garage to the opposite end of the house the garage door opened into the kitchen the better to unload groceries the basement door also opened into the kitchen directly opposite to the door coming in from the garage the front door was about halfway down the house we checked the top floor but there was no sign of a computer we went back to the kitchen and down the stairs there were four more rooms in the basement the general utility room had a washer and drier a furnace and water heater and a workbench made from an old chest of drawers and covered with a pile of tools adjacent to it was a small tiled studio with a floor loom on the loom was a skillful halffinished weaving of a vegetable garden another weaving hung on the wall the initials dd in one corner indicated that the cop whose first name was david was the weaver next was a family room with a television set a couch and two comfortable leather chairs the computer was in a little nook off the family room along with a twodrawer steel file cabinet a few computer books a printer and a box of disks off the computer nook was the fourth room a bathroom luellen was impatient and hurried me along lets go lets go she said as i brought the computer up denton had one standard communications program which i copied but there was no sign of a code list in the program his file disks all appeared to contain personal budgetary stuff games programming languages and the like i went through them one by one the minutes ticking away the sweat gathering on my forehead look through the cabinet and around the desk see if you can find anything that looks like a list or a serial number maybe i whispered to luellen it might be written right on the desk or on the top of a file anywhere right she whispered back suddenly we were dealing in whispers i unscrewed the plate over the phone line and clipped a bug in place luellen riffled through the files in the cabinet and checked the desk top and bottom but found nothing look under the covers of the books i said she started going through them as i was screwing the strike plate back on the phone outlet shed just put the last book on its shelf and i was dropping the screwdriver into my bag when the garage door went up we froze and looked at each other there was a beat of silence then another beat and then a car door slammed shit hes home luellen hissed as the garage door came down with a bang her face was deathly pale and hes a cop hell have a gun did you lock the house door behind you of course so now what get all the tools get everything she whispered violently we shoved a couple of extra bugs and the disk copies into the bags in here she said pushing me into the bathroom she stepped back out to the computer area and looked quickly around to make sure wed left nothing behind satisfied she followed me into the bathroom and eased the door shut open that window she whispered urgently the bathroom window was one of the slanted type with the hinges on the bottom it pulled down fortyfive degrees theres no way we can get out of that i whispered to her maybe hes just here for a minute we can wait and hell leave there was a click and a mechanical hum and luellen shook her head that was the central air hes going to be here for a while and ill tell you something hell find us hell be down here in ten minutes how do you know whoever was upstairs was clumping through the kitchenheavy footsteps a man and probably a big one because because they always do its a rule luellen said something about vibrations if you hide in somebodys closet theyll look in the closet if you hide under the bed theyll look under the bed get that window open i pulled it open and luellen said help me i boosted her up and she pushed on the screen until it popped outside with a noisy crack shit i whispered no sweat the central air will cover us luellen grunted now push me up as high as you can right up against the ceiling i pushed her higher and she got her arms out on the grass her stomach was a solid slab of muscle and she kept her entire lower body as rigid as a pipe as i fed her over the glass and out onto the lawn she was a small woman and the fit was tight the chances of my following her were exactly zero give me my bag she whispered down to me i handed it to her and she pushed the screen back up against the window when you hear talking you go right out through the garage out through the garage around back and wait behind the fence you hear and close this window i had no idea what she meant her oval face looked down at me and then she was gone i shut the window and locked it one second later denton started down the basement stairs luellen was right hed find me i stood back from the bathroom door and set my feet if i hit him hard and just right hed be down and id be out but if i missed he almost certainly carried a gun and he was in his own house the door to the family room opened and i started shallow breathing the doorbell rang luellen denton grunted and turned back up the steps i eased the bathroom door open from the base of the stairs i heard him open the front door and a flustered luellen asking about a park where it was tennis girlfriend apparently gave her wrong directions decided to walk smells so good with the rain denton stepped out on the front porch i crossed the kitchen to the garage door noticed with unnatural clarity the bologna sandwich on the kitchen table the three envelopes sitting next to it the sign on the wall try our famous peanut butter jelly sandwich it was like a slowmotion pan in a movie i resisted an impulse to take a bite from the sandwich silently cracked the door to the garage closed it slowly behind me walked around the ford taurus now parked in the garage and out the back in another ten seconds i was beside the house between the pool fence and the garage luellen was walking down the driveway with her bag waving and smiling at denton i heard the front door close are you following that lady the voice was only a couple of feet away and my heart almost stopped i looked down toward the fence and found a pair of small blue eyes peering between the woven boards a little girl not more than four yeah were playing a game i said what kind of game like hideandseek i said but its a secret are you sure she asked suspiciously of course im sure havent you ever seen television i left her with that to chew on figuring denton had had more than enough time to get his sandwich and head downstairs again i walked straight out the driveway looking neither right nor left into the street luellen was fifty yards in front of me when we were out of sight of the house i jogged until i caught her dont talk to me she said thanks for pulling me out of there dont talk to me im too high to talk we were back at the car in two more minutes luellen hit the coke as we pulled out from the curb goddamn that feels good the coke the whole thing going in getting out god im so high i could fly we moved into a downtown washington hotel with a handy automated switchboard that night we called into the bug at the dentons but nothing went out i lay on the bed reading an artnews and listening for the tone that signaled a data transmission luellen was washing her hair she left the bathroom door open tossed her clothes on the toilet seat and went back and forth past the open door pleasantly pink as always we slept in the same bed again that night the next morning we were in spoons and i woke up with her moving against my stomach she was still asleep i thought until she muttered geez feels like somebody dropped a pencil in the bed pencil your ass i said oh god not that she said and rolled away smiling the smile slowly faded when she saw my face and she said not yet its hard not to tease you but im afraid if we made love daces face would come up that might ruin it forever we spent the day around the hotel in the pool in a shopping arcade buying books and watching movies on television that night just after eight oclock denton went into the ncic we watched the entry transaction come up on our screen and i was flabbergasted there were virtually no screening protections at all he signed on with his own name a backup codeweaver and an account number then he was in what got ncic entry codes would prefer you do search all known execs anshiser and associated companies send codes we slept in the same bed again that night and it was easier but shorter the computer started beeping for attention shortly after seven in the morning bobby said there would be multiple dumps i plugged in the printer and routed the incoming data to paper as it arrived it was all there in the ncic files if you knew where to look anshiser was involved with the mob all the way back to his teenage years his father had been an accountanta banker and moneymover for half of the organized crime syndicates in the country he was trusted with impeccable books anshiser took his fathers methods a step further he laundered the mobs dirty cash with a variety of moneymaking and moneylosing ventures vending machine companies trashhauling concerns hotel casinos in atlantic city reno las vegas and the caribbean hotels in chicago los angeles san diego dallas miami philadelphia freeport and a half dozen other tourist destinations federal cops suspected him of recirculating bigtime drug money through his casinos the process was simple enough a drug dealer has say a suitcase full of tendollar billsan awkward way to carry your money take it to anshiser pump it through the company and out comes a handy pocketsize packet of thousands ready for a trip to the third world less of course a ten percent handling fee more sophisticated opportunities were available for investors in the trashhauling firms one deal had anshiser executives locating a failing trashhauling company with old screwedup equipment but reasonably good potential an unnamed dealer supposedly had two million in cash that he wanted to use in the us but couldnt explain to the internal revenue service he gave the two million to anshiser and got back in return fifty thousand dollars in stock in the failing trash hauler anshiser sent one of his hardnosed executives in to run the company new equipment from other anshiser trash haulers was transferred in at no charge to the new company in a very short time the dealer had stock worth a million and a half and anshiser bought him out the dealer paid his taxes and instead of two million in impossibletoexplain cash had a perfectly legitimate irssanctioned milliondollar bankroll anshisers people took out a half million and owned a thriving garbage hauler we read through all the printouts before ten oclock then went down to the shopping arcade for croissants and coffee i sat in the booth and found it hard to think i really got took i said finally luellen was watching me across the table there was so much money i didnt want anything to be wrong we should have gotten out after we bumped into ratface the first time that was never right we knew it wasnt right and i had bobby on the other end of the line and i didnt use him i should have given him an open account to keep running stuff on anshiser and everybody else involved if wed known about whitemarks snagger program we would have known something was wrong if wed known anshisers old man was in the mob we wouldve been warned pigs and wings luellen said she was looking at the light fixtures thanks i needed that stop whining for christs sake luellen snarled tell me why they sent ratface the first time i still dont understand that they had maggie right there watching us they were paranoid i said remember how shed call chicago to tell them what we were doing talking to computer people when i laid out the attack for them and they began to see what could be done in detail they really started to get worried i think they wanted a better line on us maggie told them what she could but shes not a computer tech if theyd gotten a bug on our line they couldve looked at the attack programs in detail and thats why it was such an oldfashioned bugwe were dealing with the mob not the nsa or the cia or the fbi or any other fuckin alphabet the fuckin mob luellen said she thought it was funny it doesnt seem to be a mob it seems to be a whole bunch of people who float around in rackets what do you think a mob is italians in zoot suits with violin cases under their arms i dont know this doesnt seem so organized it seems like they just know each other thats what a mob is people who know each other our mob got started because you knew me and dace she said were not exactly a mob i said dryly oh yeah then what are we i thought about it for a minute a gang i said firmly were a gang okay so were a gang she said what i dont understand is why anshiser does all this stuff hes already got more money than god i shrugged maybe he likes it maybe they dont give him a choice and it must be profitable theyve probably got a hundred of these scams going all the time i said who knows how much they take down thirty or forty or fifty million a year all of it hidden i bet there arent five people in anshisers company who know all of it anshiser dillon maggie maybe a couple more in that working group at his house so what do you think kidd she asked is this better or worse than dealing with the feds better much better i said the problem with the federal people is that once a decision is made it becomes part of the bureaucracy nobody beats a bureaucracy if they seriously want to get you theyll do it if it was the feds our best bet would be to run brazil or someplace like that but if were dealing with a company especially a oneman gang like anshisers we might be able to develop some leverage she considered it for a moment and nodded something else she said her face cold and intense when i thought it was federal people i couldnt figure out what to do about dace i mean federal people are like cops but these guys are just hoods we can get back at them for dace she said she reached out and gripped my wrist so hard that the nails bit through my skin i want them dead like dace chapter drexel the gun salesman wasnt surprised to see us back he seemed pleased trading up or adding to he asked as he opened the door adding to i said i need an m what range will you be shooting at we followed him through the living room and down the basement stairs there was no sign of his wife or daughter i dont know it could be fairly long ah you are in luck he said happily he opened the gun cabinet ive just been out to our farm i happen to have on hand a scopesighted weapon an m a to be precise i sighted it only three days ago the mount is quite sturdy he stroked the weapon a few rimes gazing at it fondly as if it were a female friend and handed it to me it was dead black and long and cold and heavy much like the one you probably used in the service he said yeah i looked through the scope at a dart board at the end of the basement i could see the dart holes there are some differences he said though you dont need to worry about them the main thing is that youll be shooting a heavier slug the sixtyeightgrain hornady hollowpoint theyll give you excellent accuracy its deadon at a hundred and fifty yards the weapon does have a tendency to ride up on full auto if youre shooting that way at a significantly closer range you could drop down to a pelvic hold and allow it to ride up that should cover all the bases or all the people i intended to kill i bought three banana clips and four cartons of shells he threw in a long cardboard box that said curtain rods on the side minimal camouflage should you be stopped for something he said sliding the weapon into the box be careful not to jar that scope it would be best to brace the box in the trunk so it wont rattle around if you have a little leisure time before you deploy you might find a quiet place and check it just in case better safe than sorry said luellen a stitch in time saves nine drexel shot back i gave him another twentyfive hundred for everything as we were going out the door he asked if wed had a chance to shoot the other weapons no we havent luellen said id like to hear how they perform if you have a chance he said pleasantly i do have a fiftypercent buyback policy for all weapons in new or nearnew condition after you are finished with them lesser amounts if there is damage thanks well keep it in mind i said that guy is a lizard luellen said as we drove away hes like a cross between beaver cleavers dad and alfred krupp i nearly drove the car over a curb alfred krupp i read books she said defensively you act like im a fuckin dummy dace had taken luellen to his cabin in west virginia only once and it was before maggie showed up luellen didnt remember mentioning it to her the cabin luellen said sat over a pool on a small stream that allegedly harbored a trout or two though dace admitted hed never seen one the nearest cabin was half a mile downstream there was nothing at all above him he liked it because it was remote luellen said the land is no good for farming the timber is all bad second growth the only thing up there are a few cabins along the stream dace said you cant even get in or out if it snows he came up here once in the winter and almost froze his ass off before he could get out the road she said wasnt on any map i wasnt so sure we stopped at the county courthouse and bought a largescale county map you were right said luellen after we unrolled it on the hood of the car this is it she traced a narrow track along greyling creek it ran through the lower reaches of the mountains between two allweather gravel roads its a good thing to know dillon will find this thing if i give maggie directions the shooters will come in the other way count on it the road to daces cabin ran parallel to the creek which lay off to the right to the left was a partly wooded ridge that rose two hundred feet to the ridgeline we followed a single strand of overhead electric wire along the road past a half dozen cabins and two brokendown barns the wire ended at daces place the cabin was high on the bank thirty feet above the stream like the other cabins along the creek daces was small and primitive built from fourbyfour timber and rough siding the roof was covered with green tar shingles a oneholer outhouse sat on the upstream side of the cabin surrounded by a screen of pines with a new moon cut in the door nearby a strand of plasticcovered rope tied between two trees served as a clothesline dace said they get terrific floods through here every few years luellen said as we pulled onto the dirt patch that served as a parking place they cut down most of the trees upstream and theres nothing to soak up the water i got out and looked around the weather had broken and though it was cool now the day was a pretty one dace had thinned the trees between the house and the creek and there was a pleasant view down to the water in minnesota and wisconsin the fishing would be prime the muskies carrying lateseason weight i needed some time on the water as i walked around the yard luellen tramped through the falling leaves to an herb garden beside the porch she turned over a rock took a bottle out of the ground unscrewed the cap and dumped a key out his emergency key she said the cabin was as simple inside as it was out there was a twoburner electric range a wood stove for heat a table a few chairs a couch a stack of old magazines and two beds and a bureau behind a partition i unloaded the luggage and we got comfortable we spent that day and the next walking the neighborhood on the hill above the road there were large areas of grassy hillside that at one time might have been pasturage there were no animals to be seen the grass was broken by patches of wild raspberries and clumps of ragged secondgrowth timber the strip below the road along the creek was heavily wooded we found an acceptable ambush site two hundred yards downstream from the cabin and an excellent one seventy yards above it the site above the cabin was better and thats where i expected to see them i want to talk to maggie there was a long pause shes here dillon said itll be a minute he put me on hold a long minute later maggie came on why did you do it i asked my voice grated out angry and cold i wasnt pretending i didnt she said urgently i knew youd think so but it was rudy he was so frightened of what we did to whitemark and what could be done to us that he panicked hes sick hes in the hospital and he may not get back out theyre not sure but they think now its a brain tumor but believe me i had nothing to do with it dillon didnt either huh luellen standing with her ear close to mine turned her head and mouthed dace what happened to dace he was killed maggie said simply her voice sounded low and hurt these assholes shot him and killed him they would have killed you too and luellen when you called dillon dillon confronted rudy the argument brought on the breakdown or whatever it is as soon as we figured out how to do it we called these men off theyre already out of the country i let the silence build until she said hello what happened to daces body is it still in the apartment no i was told they disposed of it i really dont know the details luellen squeezed my arm and closed her eyes tears started around the lashes explain how they knew where we were i said pressing how they got up past philadelphia if they werent tipped off by dillon she had the answer they put some kind of radio signal device on your car she said they couldnt follow you exactly but they knew when they were close they tracked you up north and then they said you picked a motel out in the middle of nowhere they followed the signal right in they took the beeper off the car when they got there so if they found you the police wouldnt find it on your car jesus christ do you believe me i let the silence hang for a moment then said i dont know it sounds okay but i dont know where are you i dont want to tell you that not yet ive got to talk to luellen ill call you back when she asked half an hour ill wait she said im terribly sorry about dace its awful but i had nothing to do with it goddamn it kidd youve got to believe me her voice cracked i could see her standing over the desk one hand on it for support her head bowed talking into the phone pleading ill get back i said and hung up why not tell her now luellen asked so shell think were talking about it shes going to be suspicious anyway if we hold out for a while she may be less suspicious she was awful good luellen said after a while would you have believed her if we hadnt left your car at the airport i dont know i said maybe id kind of believe her but id still be careful during most of the attack on whitemark id gone to bed late at night after three oclock one night maggie woke up and rolled onto her back as i sat on the edge of the bed pulling off my socks you wouldnt ever hurt me would you she asked the question was a stopper i turned and looked toward her in the dark hurt you you mean beat you up no you dope i mean dump me for a sixteenyearold with uppointy tits your tits are uppointy you know what i mean were not going to come to that i said i do what i do and you do what you do they dont mix neither one of us will change were too old too committed when you get back to chicago ill come and see you youll come to st paul a time or two then itll start to take up too much time therell be other people and eventually well fizzle away youre really the great romantic arent you im trying not to bullshit you i said youre not stupid you know all this but i wouldnt be surprised if you came through st paul every once in a while and got laid in between the otherpeople relationships i mean we could be friends for a longtime she might have agreed or she might have demurred or might have said something about the abstract nature of the analysis she might have laughed she didnt what she said was youd never beat me up would you we gave it a half hour sitting in a greasy spoon in a nondescript west virginia hill town idling over coffee and cheeseburgers it was the afternoon coffee hour and the local merchants drifted in said hello to each other casually looked us over and drank coffee and ate lemon meringue pie the pie was listed on the menu as the pie du jour the joke was the city folks would wonder whether it was a joke i want to talk i told maggie luellen doesnt but shell go along shes afraid of you and the anshiser people and we have a gun we bought a gun were at daces cabin in west virginia and theres only one way in and well be watching it you fly into washington rent a car and come up alone you dont believe me she said we kind of believe you were not sure about dillon i said were not going to take any chances after what happened to dace we want to talk bring the money i told her how to get to the cabin when you turn off that road follow the electric wire theres only one and it ends at daces place ill see you tomorrow afternoon she said ill bring the money youve got to believe me chapter before we left town we bought a seventydollar boom box from an appliance dealer crossing the street to a hardware store we picked up two light timers the kind used in greenhouses and two handheld cb radios as we were checking out i went back and got a shovel at a discount chain store we bought insulated coveralls in a camouflage pattern daypacks cheap rectangular sleeping bags plastic air mattresses and two pairs of binoculars at a convenience store we bought bread lunch meat mustard cupcakes and cookies and a twelvepack of coke even if the shooters were in washington they couldnt get here before dark i told luellen on the way back and i dont think theyll come in the dark in unfamiliar territory dillon will research it for them find a map and see that the road goes through the shooters will probably come in one car from the top end of the road maggie will come up the way i told her from the bottom if she comes at all you think she might not if they see this purely as a cleanup she might not risk it but i think she will theyll want to talk to find out if weve tried to protect ourselvesyou know letters to the fbi that kind of thing i dont think shes scared of me she might be scared of you she should be luellen said with a dangerous rime of bitterness in her voice shell probably have a radio in the car when she sees us shell signal that were in sight then theyll come in shell try to get us down in the vicinity of the cabin theyll hit us there talk first and then shoot or just shoot what do we do the first thing we do is cool off i looked over at her her mouth was tight and her chin was up ready for the fight if you go after her too soon we both might wind up dead im cool she said i looked at her and she gazed back unflinchingly all right youll be up on the hill above the bottom of the road covering maggie its possible that dillon wont find the map and the shooters will trail her in you see her coming you call me on the radio well work out some codes if shes alone i want her to see you just a glimpse and it has to be convincing run across an open space down toward the cabin let your upper body show wear that lightblue shirt of yours after youve given her a couple of chances to see you sneak back up the hill and get back in the camouflage what if theres somebody with her lie low and call where will you be ill be on the top end of the road i think thats where the shooters will come in the shooters i thought would show up a few minutes before maggie moving into position around the cabin they would leave their car a mile or so out and walk in following the creek they would stay off the high ground because it was too open the woods along the creek would give them good cover some seventy yards out a rough steepwalled gully too small to show on even the largestscale topo maps carried a feeder creek down the ridge the shooters could jump down the tenfoot walls wade the stream and climb the rocks on the other side or they could slip back up the road where the gully was crossed by a lowrailed wooden bridge the bridge was only twentyfive feet long and it was well out of sight of the cabin i thought they would take the chance if they crossed the bridge they were dead men id be in the brush on the hillside twentyfive yards away with the ml what about maggie i dont know i said shes not a pro so shell probably make a run for it you can try to hold her but we cant worry about her until the shooters are down you mean dead yeah what if the guys who show up are completely different people what if they arent the people who shot dace i dont know what do you think theyd be killers theyd be there to kill us she was troubled yeah we turned off the blacktop highway onto a gravel side road and she watched the landscape rolling by the tan fall grasses in the roadside ditches the fat milkweed pods the wild marijuana id let them go she said finally i nodded that would be best we lie in the briar patch like brer rabbit and we never come out at the cabin we ate and made sandwiches for the next morning we stay on the hillside tonight just in case i said well put the lights and the boom box on the timer if they come in early theyll see the lights changing around and hear the boom box go off and on not too loud half an hour before dark i took the ml and a sheet of paper outside pinned the paper to a tree and fired four shots at it from twentyfive yards id have to hold it just a bit low i fired a few more shots at a hundred yards and at and found that the rifle was as advertised deadon at when i finished i reloaded the clip and we walked up the hill and found a comfortable nest in the deep grass we were eighty yards from the cabin and a hundred feet above it in the dying light and cool still evening air the sound from the radio drifted up the hill wed chosen a rock classics station most of the music was distinctly nonclassic and in some cases barely rock but there were interludes of pink floyd and the doors and rem you remember way back when ratface first showed up and i did that tarot spread the magic spread for you and dace i asked yeah the cards that came up were the emperor and the seven of swords i just figured it out whats that the emperor is anshiser the seven of swords is a betrayal card i didnt even think about it at the time too late now we talked about the next day setting up radio voice codes and practicing them at a timer turned off the light a few minutes later the other one shut down the radio whats the worst thing that could happen tomorrow luellen said in the sudden silence i thought about it for a minute if they are deeper into killing than i think its just barely possible that theyll come over the hill with a helicopter and a half dozen guys in camies and flak jackets and automatic weapons with the experience to use them theyll take both the hillside and the woods and sweep us right out in front of them what do we do run if we can fight if we cant whats the best thing that can happen jesus luellen the best thing that can happen tomorrow is that we kill some people we sat in silence until luellen stood up and shivered and said im cold we pulled on the coveralls and lay back on the sleeping bags and looked up at the stars we were far out in the countryside away from the lights and the milky way looked like a huge illuminated milkbowl you know any of them the stars some everybody who goes outdoors knows a few the north star polaris i pointed it out and theres cassiopeia the w and thats orion the three bright stars are orions belt you know the good thing about them what the belts very close to the celestial equator when the middle star hits the horizon either coming up or down itll be almost due east of west within a degree or two did you learn this stuff when you were a teenage nerd right i laughed thats when i learned it we were quiet again for a while and finally she said in a small voice whered you put the shovel beside the outhouse i said we slept off and on until daylight my watch alarm beeped and i woke to find luellen watching me she had circles beneath her eyes but she said she was okay we ate from the cooler and drank cokes and we packed cokes into our daypacks with the extra ammo the radio handsets had pagers so we could beep each other i thought of something during the night i said theres a good chance theyll come in early earlier than we should expect like in the next hour trying to catch us offbalance but theres also the possibility that theyll come later than we expect like two oclock in the afternoon hoping that well break cover to talk it over or to eat or get a drink or pee or whatever when you get up there stay put ill call if we should move victory goes to the iron butt she waved and went off to her hiding place my ambush site was a shallow depression on the edge of the ravine behind a clump of brush and driedout weeds i retrieved a threefoot chunk of rotted log from the ravine and placed it on the edge of my hole so i could brace the m on top of it i settled in using the sleeping bag as a cushion and got comfortable the camouflage coveralls were warm and was tired i drank a coke for the caffeine and then another a fat blackandyellow bumblebee floated around me for a few seconds and i started to worry that i might be on his nest he left and i settled back again more awake now they came neither early nor late it was eighteen minutes after noon when i saw the motion in the trees below it was hard to follow and at first i was uncertain whether it was really there then i saw it again and then another movement again slow but farther up the hill and closer to me two of them at least in camouflage i let out the breath i was holding moving like molasses i eased the binoculars up to my eyes and found them they were walking unaccountably slowly until i realized they were trying to pick their way silently through the fallen leaves given the choice between the woods and the open hillside they chose the cover but the leaves underfoot were giving them fits i beeped luellen and said two two she returned with two a few minutes later she beeped back and said blonde i returned the call the blonde code meant maggie was on the way in alone as far as luellen could tell i looked at my watch two minutes since i spotted the first movement i began scanning the woods behind the two men i had already spotted looking for a backup luellen should be running down the hill the shooters were only sporadically visible as they moved closer about fifteen feet apart then one of them lifted a handset from his belt and listened i clicked around the channels on my cb but there was nothing their sets were more sophisticated than ours and probably used dedicated channels their conversation went on through several exchanges it meant i hoped that maggie had seen luellen running across the hill and believed we were at the bottom of the road the man with the handset hung it back on his belt said a few words to the other and they moved up a little quicker now they were only fifty yards away coming up to the ravine they stopped on the lip looked down at the creek talked for a moment then turned uphill as they got closer i eased the ml into position over a low tangle of vines and brought it to bear on the bridge my heart was thumping wildly and it was suddenly hard to breathe the first one stopped below the bridge where i could see only his head and waited for the second one to come up when he arrived they talked for a second and i was afraid they would decide to cross the bridge one at a time providing cover for each other then they both scrambled up on the road crouching their heads turned down toward the cabin the big guy dangled an uzi from his right hand ratface was two steps behind him carrying a police shotgun with a pistol grip below the stock with my cover the uzi was more dangerous so i decided to take the big guy first once on the road they moved fast staying low they scuttled onto the bridge using the low railing as concealment from the cabin i let the big one get twothirds of the way across the bridge held the ml at waist height and when he was about to intersect the sight i pulled the trigger an ml doesnt roar so much as clatter it clattered in my face and the first squirt pitched the big guy over i tracked back to where ratface had frozen for a split second and i was almost there when he simply leaped off the bridge head first the move was so startling that i half stood and instinctively dumped the rest of the clip under the bridge punched out the used clip and fed in a new one there was no thrashing around in the brush below the bridge and i said shit and started sliding to my right toward the road the beeper on my radio went off i said what and she said maggies out of the car and heard the shots shes just standing there well we got problems i said its the right guys but one of them jumped off the bridge and hes on the loose he may be hurt it was a hell of a fall and i sprayed the place down im coming down she said you keep an eye on maggie i said fuck that i tossed the radio on top of the backpack and crawled along the upper edge of the road until i was thirty yards from the ravine and around a shallow curve there was no sign of ratface if he was uninjured and sat tight he would be almost impossible to get at on the other hand he might be unconscious under the bridge helpless from the fall either way he might not expect me to be on his side of the road i moved up the road ran across then dropped flat on a game trail nothing moving slowly slowly i turned back toward the ravine still nothing i stopped waited moved up stopped i was fifteen yards from the bridge when maggie gave him away they had radios handsets and his had been clipped to his belt she beeped him i heard the beep high and electronic as distinct in the woods as a raven call would be in a computer lab it came from the near bank of the ravine over the lip was he still with the radio or had he dumped it there was no second beep and i crouched watching ears straining luellen broke the impasse when she came down the hill over my old position she touched a tree or stepped on some brush and ratface heard it and moved he was hurt all right his face was covered with blood one leg was apparently twisted at the knee but he still had the gun he dragged himself up beside the roadbed opposite my ambush site i waited until he was fully in the open and brought the ml down on him at the last second he apparently sensed me behind him because he twisted and threw out a hand and like dace said wait i unloaded the ml into his side and back he was dead before the bullets stopped shuddering through him luellen i shouted across the road two down are there more i dont think so i didnt see a backup maggie luellen started running along the hill parallel to the road an awkward galumphing in the camouflage suit i followed on my side we came through the bend and saw maggie running back toward her car shoot her luellen screamed i dropped to one knee and put the scope on her back she ran so well i watched as she took five steps ten long lithe strides like a college runner shoot luellen screamed again ah shit i said and took the gun down luellen looked at me looked at maggie close to her car now put up her mac and sprayed out the whole clip a macs effective range must be about thirty yards she was shooting at more than two hundred i saw one slug hit the dirt road perhaps fifty yards behind maggie the rest must have gone into the woods or the hillside maggie got back to the car climbed in and cranked it around in a circle she stopped abruptly a bag flew out of the window and she was gone gravedigging is brutal work with maggie gone i ran back to the bridge dragged both bodies into the brush above the ravine and scuffed dirt over the bloodstains while luellen picked up the brass from the m if a car came down the roadan unlikely occurrencenothing would be visible that done luellen and i climbed the hillside together all the way to the top toward the lower end of the road once over the ridgeline we doubled back toward the top end we found a good clump of trees above the road and crawled into it and lay there for three hours and never a thing moved later on we walked back down the road and looked at the bundle maggie had thrown out of the window it was the rest of the money maybe she wanted to deal luellen said doubtfully if she had to if wed come up with something she couldnt fight i said we did i guess said luellen we looked at the money for a while glumly shuffled through it and carried it back to the cabin lets get the shovel i said finally we buried ratface and his large friend a hundred feet up the hill in a small natural hollow where i could work out of sight luellen sat on the hill above me with the mac i first cut out the clumps of sod and put them to one side and then threw the dirt on a tarp i dug for two hours in the yellow sandy soil before i was both satisfied and too tired to dig anymore getting bodies up the hill was as bad as the digging i checked their pockets found car keys and wallets kept the keys but left the wallets with the bodies i dragged ratface up the hill by his coat but the big man was too heavy so i tied three loops of rope around his waist to use as a handle their heads and hands rolled loosely and their skin was as white as candle wax when i dropped them in the grave they made an untidy and unholy pile i tossed the m and both of their guns in on top of them it took another half hour to get the dirt in and the sod tramped into place should we say a prayer luellen asked as i fitted the last of the sod back in place i said nothing and finally she said ah fuck it there was some extra dirt left on the tarp and i dragged it down to the ravine and dumped it in the creek luellen loaded the car and shut down the cabin i found her wiping the table the stove and the woodwork i hope it doesnt come to that i said remember what maggie said why take a chance we left the cabin going out the back way at seven oclock the red buick was parked near the intersection of the allweather road i checked the front seat and trunk as luellen waited and found a box with fourteen thousand dollars in it i took the money and drove the car out to the main highway with luellen following we eventually left it at a turnoff by a historical marker fifteen miles from the cabin i wiped it down before we left it now what luellen asked we got their shooters they might have more but theyll be cautious and now maggie knows that we know so therell be no more bullshit is that good maybe ive got a couple of ideas ive got to get on the terminal and talk to bobby you ought to get out of here back to duluth itll all be computer stuff from here on if we travel together wed just be easier to spot you think they could spot us theyre not the cops theyre just a bunch of hoods yeah but like maggie said why take a chance youre right she said after a while but im not going back to duluth where mexico right where we were going im all packed and she started to cry we drove north through cumberland across into pennsylvania and arrived outside of pittsburgh in the early morning hours running in the end on pure adrenaline we slept late and in the evening i put her on a plane to san diego take care of yourself kidd luellen kissed me on the cheek and went through the gate unlike maggie she never looked back what need long talk call am chapter early the next morning i laid out a program for bobby big bux yes need more hacks ok k each for hacks ok k for me cash pay when we win i pay out front if we lose i might not be able to pay give po box leave terminal on answer i woke at midmorning to the terminal alarm and a squirt of dataa post office box in memphis where i could send the money and registered mail and also the names of the other two hacks they were both from california bobby called them cal tech and stanford i couldnt remember either one but bobby said that stanford met me on a vegas gaming board a few years before bobby said he would begin checking anshiser phone lines for incoming data anshiser company house show no incoming data lines must have private exchanges major pain yes most computers are hooked into the local telephone exchange in simpler days the dataline numbers were often variants of the telephone number of the company that owned the computers if the companys number was the computer number might be hackers got onto that right away whole nights were spent exploring the guts of various expensive online computers a generation of computer fanatics learned their jobs by doing it the first illegal entry i made way back in the early seventies was to a callin board that regulated the heating cooling water and other systems of one of the biggest office buildings in minneapolis i could have turned off the buildings heat in the middle of a january night but i didnt i left a note for the operator though and the next time i called entry was more difficult a little later computer security got tight enough that dataline numbers were moved well away from the companys regular phonebut still in the same exchange hackers fought back by producing autodial programs that would dial all of the ten thousand numbers in a given exchange whenever the modem got a carrier tone the computer would note it if there was no answer or a voice answer the computer would hang up and move on a computer could call a thousand numbers overnight and it was a sad night that didnt produce a dozen new computer lines eventually securityphone companies began creating their own exchanges the secret exchanges were not listed in the phone book only a few numbers out of the ten thousand possible for that special exchange would be used as data lines that meant that even if hackers knew that company x was running an open computer on a hidden exchange they would first have to find the exchange if they tried to do it randomly they would have ten thousand calls for each exchange tested most of the time it wasnt worth the effort there was a way to break the hidden exchanges bobby was deep into the phone system if he monitored a number of anshiser businesses and one called into a hidden exchange we would have it i worked through our anshiser research again and isolated five hotels most likely to use regular phone lines to transmit reports bobby would watch them for a few days and if nothing happened wed look at different ones while bobby was working i took off again heading south through kentucky and tennessee dipping into alabama and mississippi i spent a day at vicksburg down on the river painting then turned south and into louisiana the idea of new orleans was tempting but i was known there i turned back north through arkansas and into missouri each night id do between a dozen and a hundred tarot spreads figuring the possibilities the fool was back and that was okay after the tarot id call bobby for progress there was none until the fifth night when i put into a tidy little maandpa motel on the edge of the ozarks got exchange great not great dipped in have very heavy security no online help get zero think onetime codes think probes spotted traced no but guard up now onetime codes are essentially unbreakable there is no pattern and they are used only once sometimes the operators on opposite ends of a phone link literally have identical pads of words one is used then that piece of paper is ripped off and thrown away and the next one is used the words may be of any length pulled at random from a dictionary or they may be lists of numbers produced by a randomnumber generator our problems were compounded by what bobby thought was individual call monitoring when we tried to get in it set off an alarm they knew somebody was knocking on the door and without the correct codes they would be watching for us the next night we went back into the exchange intending to proceed most delicately it was empty they had changed it again unless we get codes we locked out watched anshiser vegas hotel data line there was callin callback enough data that may be twoway onetime codes maybe simultaneous voice monitoring and clearance okay hold probes need time to think call when need us sometimes in highsecurity environments a clerk from a remote computer like that of anshiser vegas would be brought into the home computer installation he would go to a companysponsored lunch and dinner with the home computer operators often with a shrink or enabler present the shrink would keep the conversation going both in person and over internal telephones when the clerk returned to his remote site he would call one of his new friends at the home base before each computer entry they would chat until his identity was confirmed some companies even used voiceprint analyzers as a backup only when the identity was confirmed would they begin the signon procedure since the procedure was a twoway affair with conversation and code going both ways it was essentially unbeatable while there might be ways to read the transmissions there was no electronic way to get inside and work with the computer itself we would need a different route how good is access to credit computers readonly or readwrite readonly good access need complete run on all anshiser lowerlevel execs with likely computer access find worst credit forward names ok tomorrow while bobby was running the credit reports i went back into the ncic computers using the codes wed stolen from denton the washington cop this time i wasnt looking for anything deep just the standard rap sheets and i wasnt looking for felonies i was looking for sleaze i came up with a half dozen possibilities when bobby sent his list of bad credit reports the next day we had one match i dumped the car in st louis and flew to miami the next afternoon our man phil denzer was in the book there was no answer at his apartment up to eleven oclock that night i found his apartment on the map in a complex in north dade county and the next morning drove up to talk to him denzer lived in a rundown complex of town houses surrounded by several acres of hot asphalt the parking lot featured redneck specials firebirds and camaros and fiveliter mustangs most of them several years old along with brokendown dodge swingers with rustedout taillights sickly yellowleafed palm trees lined the lots the town houses were arranged in a donut shape around two swimming pools it was a hot and cloudless day and a few women in bikinis and one guy wearing shorts a gold chain and loafers were arrayed on lounge chairs around the pools nobody was actually swimming i got denzers apartment number from the manager the jalousie windows on the door were cranked open and disco music poured out through the glass slats i peered in and could see a guy in a white tshirt and black slacks dancing to the music by himself practicing moves i knocked and denzer came to the door you a witness do i look like a witness he thought about it and eventually shook his head no they dress neater whatd ya want he talked past a cigarette and on his way to the door had picked up a plastic plate with a halfeaten slice of cherry pie on it which he was now holding ive got a proposition for you oh yeah you gonna make me rich there might be a few bucks in it tell me in ten words i gotta get to work thats what im interested in your work you work on a computer right his mouth actually dropped open hey i bet youre one of the guys trying to break into our system right he pointed a fork at my chest and i looked for a place to run well shit come on in he said holding the door open he was delighted i hoped youd call me but i didnt really think you would i stepped inside it was cool and damp and smelled like beer im just having a beer and piece of pie before i take off for work you want a beer sure he got one from the refrigerator popped the top and handed me the can sit down sit down he said how much can you pay me i sat on a rickety armchair that might have been stolen from a budget motel depends on what youve got i want some money up front they told us you were wellheeled a wellheeled operation is what they said how about five hundred fuck how about five grand were not that wellheeled ill give you a grand now and if its worth more ill give you another he scratched his head he had long black hair combed straight back he must have held it down with grease or wax because you could see tooth marks from his comb all right i had three thousand in my pocket i took it out and started counting he looked at it greedily i stopped counting for a second look phil i know all about your money problems but dont think about taking this away from me okay id just beat the shit out of you hey man i handed him a thousand and he counted it folded it and put it in his front pants pocket and sat back okay so heres what i know and this was why i was so happy to hear from you cause all i can tell you is that you cant get in even if you put a gun to my head and marched me in there and made me sign on and we got in it wouldnt do you any good things are so tight that almost nothing moves anymore its all voicebackup and its all oneway we dump it into a computer on the other end thats physically separated from the main data banks then theyve got operators to put all of the data up on the screen from the dump bank and they scan it for code only when theyre sure its clean they call up the main bank on their own internal line and dump it theres no way in from the outside what if you need to go interactive with something in the main banks well theyre trying not to let that happen if its really serious then theyll download the interactive program to the remote computer youll interact there they sterilize the input before they ship it back to the main banks i mean theres one way to break it you have to get to the systems programmers and that wont happen ill tell you man this is a pretty good company but theyve got some rough customers roaming around you know what i mean yeah i think so just in case you dont let me lay it out in a couple of sentences their top systems programmers are taking home maybe a hundred grand a year plus options and benefits and bonuses thats good money thats the golden goose if they get greedy and go for some small change from you theyd be fired and blackballed and maybe you know hurt the chances of those guys taking your money are slim and fat and slim is out of town he took a gulp of bud so why are you talking to me i asked because you gave me a grand and because about two seconds after you leave here im going to call them up on the phone and tell them you came to see me i wont mention the grand though ill tell them i told you to take a hike i stood up to leave you ought to think about that for a while phil like you said there are some hard guys with anshiser they might not believe you and youll wind up in an oil barrel on the bottom of biscayne bay because if you call them and they come after me before i can get out of miami international ill tell them you got ten grand and suggested a couple ways i might get in and they just wont want to take the chance with you will they i slapped him lightly on the cheek thanks for the information it was worth a grand i left him standing there with an empty beer can and two bites of pie he scared me though and an hour later i took the first plane to anywhere out of fort lauderdale as it happened it was going to tampa from there i flew to atlanta and then back to st louis what talked to anshiser guy about system its no go for now may have to find different route let us know i spent three days at lake of the ozarks fishing out of a rented boat letting the problem cook in the evenings id sit on the porch of my rented cabin look out at the lake and drink beer if i didnt find anything it wouldnt be the end of the world i could go underground for a while call emily arrange for her to take care of the cat pay the bills in a couple of years three or four years i might even be able to go back but it was a sour solution and sent me to bed half drunk i couldnt sleep on it but lay awake twisting the sheets around my legs flopping around on the bed like a beached carp on the third night i got out the cards and instead of gameplaying the problem i laid out a magic spread the celtic cross i did it three times and three times the tower of destruction came up in association with the magician the magician id always related to computer freaksthe power of thought in all its forms including mechanical the tower of destruction is usually interpreted as meaning disaster or crisis although it can mean a sudden awakening or awareness it was all hopeless bullshit i dropped the cards on the table and went for another beer walked back and looked down at them the tower showed a medieval stone tower shattered by a bolt of lightning with two men falling from the top the woman who taught me to read the cards warned me not always to depend on book interpretations or even on her interpretations sometimes she said you just have to look at the cards i looked at the cards the magician the tower the bolt of lightning sonofabitch i said what igot it you got it the answer was typically tarot outside what id considered the parameters of the problem elegant and slightly twisted it took two days to confirm that it would work it took three weeksall four of us working twelve to fourteen hours a nightto get the code written tested and shipped out for the first two weeks i wandered aimlessly up and down the mississippi river valley sleeping late painting in the afternoons writing code at night twice i sent tubes of paintings to emily in st paul to hold for me i always mailed them from places i was leaving in the third week i turned west across arkansas oklahoma a piece of texas new mexico and arizona heading for las vegas my rational tarot was talking now that the possibilities were finite and i spent a lot of time thinking about the cards the time wasnt too bad except for the loneliness i was fond of my life in st paul the apartment my friends even the cat i wanted to get back we close now youdebug last batch stanford doing that he close we should run command tests yes start tonight we ran the tests there were a few final bugs to hunt down and then the attack programs worked fine i was in phoenix in a nondescript motel off interstate it was hot and the air conditioner smelled like somebody had dropped an aging cheeseburger on the compressor unit i sat in my underwear and sweated and ran the tarot if you run the cards long enough everything comes up its all meaningless but it seemed that i saw a lot of the battle cards the five of wands the seven of wands the seven of swords none showed defeat but none projected a clear victory either i finally turned the deck around and tried to run a spread from maggies point of view thats not supposed to work i came up with an eight of swords as the outcome a woman blindfolded with her arms bound surrounded by swords stuck pointdown in the earth that was good enough and i quit the next day was a wednesday the last in october it would be getting cold up north but if i could back off the anshiser crowd i might be able to get my boat over to vilas county wisconsin for the november muskie rush its not that theres a rush of muskies theres a rush of muskie fishermen crowding in before iceup i decided to call maggie the next day chapter years before when i first started doing unconventional computer work i had taken the trouble to construct an alternate identity it wasnt particularly hard a phony birth certificate acquired in chicago along with the social security number of a dead teenager who would never use it got me a passport in the name of harry olson of eau claire a few customs stamps and stapledin visas gave the passport a wearied look presented at a wisconsin drivers examination office the passport and social security number were good for a drivers license the license and social security number produced a bank account the bank didnt ask too many questions since the documents were accompanied by a fat cashiers check that summer i rented a place on grindstone lake near hayward in the name of harry olson i spent the summer writing code painting hunting muskie and collecting my mail which included credit cards from visa amoco and exxon and the local library when i left hayward i changed the address for the credit cards to a post office in hudson wisconsin just across the st croix river from st paul i carefully used the credit cards and promptly paid the bills i renewed the drivers license and over the years collected a variety of other forms of id in harry olsons name harry olson checked into the anshiser vegas at three oclock in the afternoon the desk clerk ran the visa through the creditchecking machine smiled and handed me a room key let the bellman know if you need anything the movies are turned on for your room the key to the refreshments cabinet is on the credenza he said the bellman had a number of suggestions for the evening including a private party with a couple of showgirls i declined but gave him ten dollars let me speak to maggie kidd yeah i want to talk to maggie just a minute dillon sounded stressed but controlled i had been out of sight for a month though they suspected id tested their computer security if denzer told them about my visit to miami they would have that nothing else kidd it was a statement not a question yeah how are you she ignored the question what do you want peace and quiet thats going to be hard now yeah i know i thought we should talk facetoface where are you flagstaff ill be in vegas tomorrow ill meet you at the anshiser vegas what time in the afternoon about threethirty or four oclock ill call your room that evening i dropped seven hundred dollars at the blackjack tables blackjack can be beaten there are several methods of shifting the odds in your favor by keeping track of certain cards as theyre dealt you make your biggest bets when the deck is most in your favor the rest of the time you tread water casinos dont like cardcounters with that in mind a mathematician friend at the university of chicago once spent some time refining a common cardcounting routine in essence he built in a randomizing factor that disguised the betbuilding in my case the disguise more than worked i lost my shirt in the process of losing it i thoroughly confused the dealer she spotted me for a cardcounter i think but i was leaking money at a ferocious rate when i finally walked away her eyes followed me all the way across the casino floor as though she expected me to come back pull out a surprise bet and recoup all the losses no such luck hightech computerassisted programs sometimes get out in the real world and get their ass kicked something to lie in bed and think about as we made the torpedo run on anshiser the casino was a bad idea id picked one a few blocks from the anshiser just in case somebody was looking for my face but on the way back i almost bumped into maggie she went through the lobby with a thin darkcomplected man in an expensive bankers pinstripe his nose had been broken a long time ago well before he acquired his current sheen but he did not look at all like marys little lamb i was standing in the hotel gift shop looking at magazines and caught a flash of her in a mirrored pillar i turned away and gave them time to get through i bought a few magazines while i waited plus two paperbacks this time i would stay in the room what everything set set and checked hacks on line well trip you off exactly at then well have a cascade on the other plants timing would be delicate i debated calling her as early as but we wouldnt have that much to say to each other on the other hand she might have people scattered around the hotel shed want them together before she came into the room so when to call i rehearsed the probable moves and finally decided there would be at least ten minutes to talk and i should be able to stretch it out if need be i would call at at three oclock time started to slow down i risked a trip to the coke machine down the hall got three drank two and looked at the clock i did a few desultory tarot spreads not enough time now for the tarot to help i watched television paced more pacing a pit stop in the bathroom dumping the processed coke lastminute thoughts at i dialed the operator and got her room number she picked up the phone on the first ring this is kidd yes im here im in room its almost right straight below you ill wait five minutes then im gone and maggieyou may be tempted to send in some shooters to take care of the problem that would be a major mistake you would remember it for the rest of your life as the mistake that ruined you i dont have a gun i just want to talk okay ill be down i did have a gun the mac i glued a fat strip of velcro to the grip and stuck it on the side of the easy chair where i planned to sit it was out of sight in an unexpected place all cocked and ready it was too big and would be an awkward draw but if they came in shooting i would make it more than a simple execution that was the idea anyway after maggie hung up i unlocked the door pulled the drapes turned on the tv set and adjusted the sound until it was barely audible got the last coke and sat in the chair at there was a knock at the door come in a short toughlooking blond with a brush haircut pushed the door open with his finger while he stayed in the hall he looked at me nodded took a slow step inside glanced into the bathroom the dark man with the broken nose was behind him dressed in a different but equally conservative pinstriped suit he waited in my line of sight watching me while the blond went into the bathroom and pulled back the shower curtain the blond came back out opened the coat closet near the door looked in then came into the room the beds were on pedestals but he looked between them and behind the one next to the wall finally he turned to the dark man its okay he said the dark man stayed where he was and the blond went back to the hallway and came in with a briefcase he opened it and took out a debugging loop and started working his way around the room look itll take an hour to find a bug if i put one in we dont think you did nothing heavy anyway were just making a quick sweep wed be embarrassed if you had something as crummy as a cheap tape recorder i dont he smiled and followed the loop around the room when he was satisfied he folded it and shoved it back in the briefcase i think its clean he said the dark man stepped into the room mr olson he said nodding at me maggie was a step behind him kidd she said her face was taut not frozen but ready like an athlete on the starting blocks hows anshiser i asked the blond shut the door without locking it and the dark man sat on a corner of the bed looking at me maggie perched on the other chair hes out of it she said theyre off the tumor theory they think now it may have been a series of ministrokes over a period of time killing his brain in such tiny increments it was impossible to find theyre still not sure one of the doctors said the only way theyll ever be sure is with an autopsy hes now in what they call a vegetative state tough its a bad way to go i nodded at the dark man is this the new boss the dark man smiled his even teeth glittering against his olive skin with the broken nose and the good teeth he would be devastating with women im afraid youve got that backward mr kidd he said mildly the board has chosen ms kahn to run anshiser shes asked me to work as her executive assistant essentially i have her old job what about dillon maggie shrugged dillon is dillon he does the same thing thats all he wants to do when she first came in the room her face was deathly pale now the color was coming back and the tension was seeping out the situation was under control the red numerals of the digital clock on the bedside table said hows luellen maggie asked shes fine she went back home was she the one who shot at me back at the cabin yeah she was pissed about dace i thought it was she i knew you were in the army and when i heard that machine gun going and i didnt hear franks shotgun i had an idea what happened when i saw you coming around the corner with luellen and those guns in those camouflage suits i thought dear god hes going to shoot me in the back i thought about it i said i had the scope right on your shoulder blades she shuddered what happened to frank and leonard asked the dark man im afraid theyre uh maggie glanced at the dark man and then looked back to me most of the people involved in the decision to shoot dace now agree it was a mistake but its a mistake that will be hard to walk away from you and luellen could cause us an infinite amount of damage with a letter or a phone call and you may have reason to do it to get back for dace she said she was using her business voice the small talk was over i shook my head at her we wont do it we want to cut a deal you dont mess with us ever and well never mess with you weve got our money and its all over she glanced at the dark man again and he said ms kahn has suggested that you were too smart to expose yourself this way unless you had done something that would give you protection would you like to tell us what it is a letter with a lawyer or something a letter in a safetydeposit box ah no i glanced at the clock that im afraid could be managed people could be bought the charges denied especially if luellen and i werent around to back them up somebody might say the whole thing was a fantasy and even the people who would believe it wouldnt have any way to prove it for sure besides the instigator of the whole thing is a vegetable you cant put a vegetable on trial so what did you do maggie asked i shrugged same old shit you saw in the washington apartment a computer blitz the fact is if you mess with me or luellen our friends on the computer net will take anshiser right down the toilet right down maggie glanced at the dark man again he frowned and tipped his head back and stared at me figuring and finally said to maggie i dont know she thought she did though she had decided it was a game and looked at me with what may have been genuine regret im disappointed kidd we thought youd be better than this let me tell you what weve done we have the best peoplethe very best better than youwatching every move thats made on those computers it has been a major inconvenience and it cost us a lot of money but well get it back with the sunfire contract in any event we know youre not in there just in case we have backups of all our software and all the daily work we can shut down and sterilize our system in half an hour and be back up with completely clean software everybody who does anything on the system is logged in and out and the input is studied by the security crew there isnt any way you can reach us you just dont have the leverage for a deal she shook her head and stood up i think its time to leave she said to the dark man the clock said by the way dont try to use your telephone it wont work she said showing a few teeth i couldnt figure why you stayed in an anshiser hotel you must know we could control the place dont go i said we have more things to talk about i dont think so she said a note of triumph had crept into her voice the clock ticked over to four and she started toward the door the dark man standing to follow the blond opened the door and she walked away giving it a little extra effort as she walked at the door she paused and seemed about to say something then the lights went out everything else went with themthe clock the tv the air conditioning there was a stuttering and emergency lights came on in the hallway somewhere a smoke detector screeched and doors started popping open down the hallway i had pulled the blackout drapes over the windows to intensify the effect i waited for a few seconds and reached back and pulled the drawstring daylight flooded the room and the blond was standing just inside the door pointing a smallcaliber automatic pistol at my chest a long fat silencer was attached to the snout why dont you come back in and sit down i suggested maggie looked shocked but came back in what have you done ive shut down anshiser i said or at least my friends have what are you talking about we have the best security there was no way its awful good i agreed too good to penetrate in the time that we had so we had to do something different what did you do kidd we went into the power company computers we couldnt get every little dinky anshiser operation but we got all the good ones all the hotels all the factories your headquarters back in chicago not a single one of the big operations has power if you call up your airframe fabrication plant youll find they dont have a computer problem theyve got a problem with everything they cant run a fuckin power drill the tower of destruction the lightning bolt power plants of course and it had been shown in conjunction with the magician the computerfreak card it was all coincidence but a timely onei really dont believe in that magic shit this cant last maggie blurted yes it can believe me anshiser is shut down unless i tell my people to bring you back up youll be down for three or four days before the electric people find the fault and then the next bomb goes off if youre really efficient you might get fifteen or twenty days of work out of your companies in the next year she sank down in the chair opposite me and the dark man said sonofabitch he looked at the blond and said put it away people were shuffling through the hall in the dim light moving toward the stairwell the smoke alarm apparently triggered by the power shutdown was still screeching into the gloom the blond stepped inside and shut the door how long will it take to get us back up maggie asked probably two or three hours we have a lot of them to deal with i said but we dont want to bring them back up too soon we want to give you a chance to call around find out how bad things can get see if you can fix it yourself maggie looked at the dark man what do you think he shook his head what i thought in the first place we cut the deal and walk away and keep his phone number in case we need his help sometime no chance i said dont shut any doors he said it didnt sound like a threat it sounded like advice maggie was still looking for a way out we could go after your computer friends no the national security agency has gone looking for bobby and came up empty a bunch of hoods arent going to find him and if you come after me or luellen if theres even a hint of it bobbyll take anshiser apart what happens if youre hit by a car the dark man asked you better pray im not because youll be out of luck i said he nodded that was the kind of deal he understood one that had no options look i said to maggie in a couple of years anything i say about this whole whitemark deal or about dace will be ancient history nobody will pay any attention itll be like if you called up the fbi and said you knew who killed judge crater nobody would give a shit so if we can make it through a couple of years together youll be safe and therell be no percentage at all in coming after us youll have that whole big company to work with hes right said the dark man okay said maggie deciding she stood up again its a deal turn the power on chapter i was working on the sandbar below st paul id dragged the anchor halfway up the bar and buried it and the boat swung placidly on its line as the towboats streamed by it was hot the first real heat of the coming summer she crossed the levee pushed through the willows and walked out on the bar she was wearing gym shoes jeans and a peekaboo blouse she had a nice tan neat picture she said when she came up she said pitcher thanks how was mexico all right a lot of foreigners she laughed and i smiled and she said old joke no kidding i laid in a long vermilion horizon luellen did a critical pout cocked her head and nodded not bad she said thanks seen maggie lately not since i called younot since vegas theres a mutual lack of interest still think were safe i think so we put ourselves outside the percentages have you been back to duluth snuck in and out a week after you called moved some money around and went back she wandered around looked in the boat i saw that old man anshiser croaked yeah maggies running the place a new guy took her job dillons still number three i dropped in some very liquid ultramarine and feathered it into the vermilion i could never do that she said paint i mean like you put in that hill with purple who would think that a hill with green trees is purple but it kind of is isnt it she looked across the river at the hill yeah it is have you thought about dace at all you mean do i feel guilty yeah i stopped painting and looked at her yes i do i thought i knew what we were getting into and i didnt and dace paid but theres nothing i can do about it i could go after maggie i suppose but i cant do that either and i like it here i dont want to spend the rest of my life running from somebody the cops or the mob or whoever she nodded thats where i got to sitting on the beach i kept thinking dace would want us to do this or dace would want us to do that then one day i figured dace doesnt want us to do anything hes dead its like they turned out a tv its like thinking a tv show wants you to do something after youve turned it off i went back to painting and she watched for another minute or two then ran off down the sandbar stopping to look at the flotsam she was back in five minutes with a waspwaisted sevenounce coke bottle must be twenty years old she said i dont want to break your heart but you can still buy them like that oh yeah she looked at me suspiciously but when i nodded heaved it into the river she had a good arm the bottle hit and bobbed up its neck sticking out of the water been stealing anything i asked nope im too rich she said but im thinking about it anyway playing the ponies a little how about the nose candy yeah a little were you faithful to me down in mexico she snorted and threw a driftwood stick after the coke bottle and watched them both float away a tow jockey ran his harbor boat by heading toward the coal dump downriver are you you know involved with anybody she asked nah what are my chances of getting laid pretty good if you play your cards right i said okay she said all right she looked happy she found a flat rock and tried to skip it sidearmed out in the river it skipped once and crashed the river itself was dark and black and snaky the currents and crosscurrents bucking up along the bar we spent most of the afternoon there painting and talking and watching the clouds roll in up from the south over the mississippi
