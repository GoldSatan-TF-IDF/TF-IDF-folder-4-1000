mwalimu in the squared circle nyerere looks up through the haze of blood masking his vision and sees the huge man standing over him laughing he looks into the mans eyes and seems to see the dark heart of africa savage and untamed he cannot remember quite what he is doing here nothing hurts but as he tries to move nothing works either a black man in a white shirt a man with a familiar face seems to be pushing the huge man away maneuvering him into a corner chuckling and posturing to people that nyerere cannot see the huge man backs away and now the man in the white shirt returns and begins shouting four nyerere blinks and tries to clear his mind who is he and why is he on his back halfnaked and who are these other two men five stay down mwalimu yells a voice from behind him and now it begins to come back to him he is mwalimu six he blinks again and sees the huge electronic clock above him it is one minute and seconds into the first round he is mwalimu and if he doesnt get up his bankrupt country has lost the war seven he cannot recall the last minute and seconds in fact he cannot recall anything since he entered the ring he can taste his blood can feel it running down over his eyes and cheeks but he cannot remember how he came to be bleeding or laying on his back it is a mystery eight finally his legs are working again and he gathers them beneath him he does not know if they will bear his weight but they must be doing so for mohammed ali that is his name ali is cleaning his gloves off and staring into his eyes you should have stayed down whispers ali nyerere grunts an answer he is glad that the mouthpiece is impeding his speech for he has no idea what he is trying to say i can stop it if you want says ali nyerere grunts again and ali shrugs and stands aside as the huge man shuffles across the ring toward him still chuckling it began as a joke nobody ever took anything amin said seriously except for his victims he had launched a surprise bombing raid in the north of tanzania no one knew why for despite what they did in their own countries despite what genocide they might commit the one thing all african leaders had adhered to since independence was the sanctity of national borders so julius nyerere the mwalimu the teacher the president of tanzania had mobilized his forces and pushed amins army back into uganda not a single african nation had offered military assistance not a single western nation had offered to underwrite so much as the cost of a bullet amin had expediently converted to islam and now libyas crazed but opportunistic quaddafi was pouring money and weapons into uganda still nyereres soldiers with their tattered uniforms and ancient rifles were marching toward kampala and it seemed only a matter of time before amin was overthrown and the war would be ended and milton obote would be restored to the presidency of uganda it was a moral crusade and nyerere was convinced that amins soldiers were throwing down their weapons and fleeing because they too know that right was on tanzanias side but while right may have favored nyerere time did not he knew what the western press and even the tanzanian army did not know that within three weeks not only could his bankrupt nation no longer supply its men with weapons it could not even afford to bring them back out of uganda i challenge president nyerere in the boxing ring to fight it out there rather than that soldiers lose their lives on the field of battle the challenge made every newspaper in the western world as columnist after columnist laughed over the image of the pound amin former heavyweight champion of the kenyan army stepping into the ring to duke it out with the fivefoot oneinch pound yearold nyerere only one man did not laugh mwalimu youre crazy you know that nyerere stares calmly at the tall wellbuilt man standing before his desk it is a hot humid day typical of dar es salaam and the man is already sweating profusely i did not ask you here to judge my sanity answers nyerere but to tell me how to defeat him it cant be done youre spotting him two hundred pounds and twenty years my job as referee is to keep him from outandout killing you you frequently defeated men who were bigger and stronger than you notes nyerere gently and in the latter portion of your career younger than you as well you float like a butterfly and sting like a bee answers ali but yearold presidents dont float and little bitty guys dont sting ive been a boxer all my life have you ever fought anyone when i was younger says nyerere how much younger nyerere thinks back to the sunlit day some years ago when he pummeled his brother though he can no longer remember the reason for it in his minds eye both of them are small and thin and illnourished and the beating amounted to two punches delivered with barely enough force to stun a fly the next week he acquired the gift of literacy and he has never raised a hand in anger again words are far more powerful nyerere sighs much younger he admits aint no way says ali and then repeats aint no way this guy is not just a boxer hes crazy and crazy people dont feel no pain how would you fight him asks nyerere me says ali he starts jabbing the air with his left fist stick and run stick and run take him dancing til he drops mans got a lot of blubber on that frame he holds his arms up before his face he catches up with me i go into the ropea dope i lean back i take his punches on my forearms i let him wear himself out suddenly he straightens up and turns back to nyerere but it wont work for you hell break your arms if you try to protect yourself with them hell only have one arm free nyerere points out thats all hell need answers ali your only shot is to keep moving to tire him out he frowns but but but i aint never seen a yearold man that could tire out a man in his thirties well says nyerere with an unhappy shrug ill have to think of something think of letting your soldiers beat the shit out of his soldiers says ali that is impossible i thought they were winning said ali in fourteen days they will be out of ammunition and gasoline answers nyerere they will be unable to defend themselves and unable to retreat then give them what they need nyerere shakes his head you do not understand my nation is bankrupt there is no money to pay for ammunition hell ill loan it to you myself says ali this amin is a crazy man hes giving blacks all over the world a bad name that is out of the question says nyerere you think i aint got it says ali pugnaciously i am sure you are a very wealthy man and that your offer is sincere answers nyerere but even if you gave us the money by the time we converted it and purchased what we needed it would be too late this is the only way to save my army by letting a crazy man tear you apart by defeating him in the ring before he realizes that he can defeat my men in the field ive seen a lot of things go down in the squared circle says ali shaking his head in disbelief but this is the strangest you cannot do this says maria when she finally finds out it is done answers nyerere they are in their bedroom and he is staring out at the reflection of the moon on the indian ocean as the light dances on the water he tries to forget the darkness to the west you are not a prizefighter she says you are mwalimu no one expects you to meet this madman the press treats it as a joke i would be happy to exchange doctoral theses with him but he insists on exchanging blows says nyerere wryly he is illiterate said maria and the people will not allow it you are the man who brought us independence and who has led us ever since the people look to you for wisdom not pugilism i have never sought to live any life but that of the intellect he admits and what has it brought us while kenyatta and mobutu and even kaunda have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars we are as poor now as the day we were wed he shakes his head sadly i stand up to oppose amin and only sir seretse khama of botswana secure in his british knighthood stands with me he pauses again trying to sort it out perhaps the old mzee of kenya was right grab what you can while you can could our army be any more illequipped if i had funneled aid into a swiss account could i be any worse off than now as i prepare to face this madman in he cannot hide his distaste a boxing ring you must not face him insists maria i must or the army will perish do you think he will let the army live after he has beaten you she asks nyerere has not thought that far ahead and now a troubled frown crosses his face he had come to the office with such high hopes such dreams and ambitions let kenyatta play lackey to the capitalist west let machal sell his country to the russians tanzania would be different a proving ground for african socialism it was a dry barren country without much to offer there were the great game parks the serengeti and the ngorongoro crater in the north but fourfifths of the land was infested with the tsetse fly there were no minerals beneath the surface nairobi was already the capital city of east africa and no amount of modernization to dar es salaam could make it competitive there was precious little grazing land and even less water none of this fazed nyerere they were just more challenges to overcome and he had no doubt that he could shape them to his vision but before industrialization before prosperity before anything else came education he had gone from the bush to the presidency in a single lifetime had translated the entire body of shakespeares work into swahili had given form and structure to his countrys constitution and he knew that before everything came literacy while his people lived in grass huts other men had harnessed the atom had reached the moon had obliterated hundreds of diseases all because of the written word and so while kenyatta became the mzee the wise old man he himself became mwalimu not the president not the leader not the chief of chiefs but the teacher he would teach them to turn away from the dark heart and reach for the sunlight he created the ujamaa villages based on the israeli kibbutzim and issued the arusha declaration and channeled more than half his countrys aid money into the schools his peoples bellies might not be filled their bodies might not be covered but they could read and everything would follow from that but what followed was drought and famine and disease and more drought and more famine and more disease he went abroad and described his vision and pleaded for money what he got were ten thousand students who arrived overflowing with idealism but devoid of funds they meant well and they worked hard but they had to be fed and housed and medicated and when they could not mold the country into his utopia in the space of a year or two they departed and then came the madman the final nail in tanzanias financial coffin nyerere labeled him for what he was and found himself conspicuously alone on the continent african leaders simply didnt criticize one another and suddenly it was the mwalimu who was the pariah not the bloodthirsty butcher of uganda the east african union a fragile thing at best fell apart and while nyerere was trying to save it kenyatta the true capitalist appropriated all three countries funds and began printing his own money tanzania already near bankruptcy was left with money that was not honored anywhere beyond its borders still he struggled to meet the challenge if that was the way the mzee wanted to play the game that was fine with him he closed the border to kenya if tourists wanted to see his game parks they would have to stay in his country there would be no more round trips from nairobi if amin wanted to slaughter his people so be it he would cut off all diplomatic relations and to hell with what his neighbors thought perhaps it was better this way now with no outside influences he could concentrate entirely on creating his utopia it would be a little more difficult it would take a little longer but in the end the accomplishment would be that much more satisfying and then amins air force dropped its bombs on tanzania the insanity of it nyerere ducks a roundhouse right amin guffaws and winks to the crowd ali stands back and wishes he were somewhere else nyereres vision has cleared but blood keeps running into his left eye the fight is barely two minutes old and already he is gasping for breath he can feel every beat of his heart as if a tiny man with a hammer and chisel is imprisoned inside his chest trying to get out the weights attached to amins ankles should be slowing him down but somehow nyerere finds that he is cornered against the ropes amin fakes a punch nyerere ducks then straightens up just in time to feel the full power of the madmans fist as it smashes into his face he is down on one knee again years old and gasping for breath suddenly he realizes that no air is coming in that he is suffocating and he thinks his heart has stopped but no he can feel it still pounding then he understands his nose is broken and he is trying to breathe through his mouth and the mouthpiece is preventing it he spits the mouthpiece out and is mildly surprised to see that it is not covered with blood three amin who has been standing at the far side of the ring approaches laughing uproariously and ali stops the count and slowly escorts him back to the neutral corner the pen is mightier than the sword the words come unbidden into nyereres mind and he wants to laugh a horrible retching sound escapes his lips a sound so alien that he cannot believe it came from him ali slowly returns to him and resumes the count four stay down you old fool alis eyes seem to say nyerere grabs a rope and tries to pull himself up five i bought you all the time i could say the eyes but i cant protect you if you get up again nyerere gathers himself for the most difficult physical effort of his life six youre as crazy as he is nyerere stands up he hopes maria will be proud of him but somehow he knows that she wont amin mugging to the crowd in a grotesque imitation of ali moves in the for kill when he was a young man the president of his class at ugandas makerere university already tabbed as a future leader by his teachers and his classmates his fraternity entered a track meet and he was chosen to run the meter race i am no athlete he said i am a student i have exams to worry about a scholarship to obtain i have no time for such foolishness but they entered his name anyway and the race was the final event of the day and just before it began his brothers came up to him and told him that if he did not beat at least one of his five rivals his fraternity which held a narrow lead after all the other events would lose then you will lose said nyerere with a shrug if we do it will be your fault they told him it is just a race he said but it is important to us they said so he allowed himself to be led to the starting line and the pistol was fired and all six young men began running and he found himself trailing the field and he remained in last place all the way around the track and when he crossed the finish wire he found that his brothers had turned away from him but it was only a game he protested later what difference does it make who is the faster we are here to study laws and vectors and constitutions not to run in circles it is not that you came in last answered one of them but that you represented us and you did not try it was many days before they spoke to him again he took to running a mile every morning and every evening and when the next track meet took place he volunteered for the meter race again he was beaten by almost meters but he came in fourth and collapsed of exhaustion ten meters past the finish line and the following morning he was reelected president of his fraternity by acclamation there are seconds left in the first round and his arms are too heavy to lift amin swings a roundhouse that he ducks but it catches him on the shoulder and knocks him halfway across the ring the shoulder goes numb but it has bought him another ten seconds for the madman cannot move fast with the weights on his ankles probably could not move fast even without them besides he is enjoying himself joking with the crowd talking to ali mugging for all the cameras at ringside ali finds himself between the two men takes an extra few seconds awkwardly extricating himself ali who has never taken a false or awkward step in his life and buys nyerere almost five more seconds nyerere looks up at the clock and sees there is just under half a minute remaining amin bellows and swings a blow that will crush his skull if it lands but it doesnt the huge ugandan cannot balance properly with one hand tied behind his back and he misses and almost falls through the ropes hit him now come the yells from nyereres corner kill him mwalimu but nyerere can barely catch his breath can no longer lift his arms he blinks to clear the blood from his eyes then staggers to the far side of the ring maybe it will take amin or seconds to get up spot him reach him if he goes down again then he can be saved by the bell he will have survived the round he will have run the race vectors angles the square of the hypotenuse its all very intriguing but it wont help him become a leader he opts for law for history for philosophy how was he to know that in the long run they were the same he sits in his corner his nostrils propped open his cut man working on his eye ali comes over and peers intently at him he knocks you down once more i gotta stop it he says nyerere tries to answer through battered lips it is unintelligible just as well for all he knows he was trying to say please do ali leans closer and lowers his voice its not just a sport you know its a science too nyerere utters a questioning croak you run hes gonna catch you continues ali a ring aint a big enough place to hide in nyerere stares at him dully what is the man trying to say you gotta close with him grab him dont give him room to swing you do that maybe i wont have to go to your funeral tomorrow vectors angles philosophy all the same when youre the mwalimu and youre fighting for your life the lion some pounds of tawny fury pulls down the one ton buffalo the pound hyena runs him off his kill the pound jackal winds up eating it and nyerere clinches with the madman hangs on for dear life feels the heavy blows raining down on his back and shoulders grabs tighter ali separates them positions himself near amins right hand so that he cant release the roundhouse and nyerere grabs the giant again his head is finally clear the fourth round is coming up and he hasnt been down since the first he still cant catch his breath his legs will barely carry him to the center of the ring and the blood is once again trickling into his eye he looks at the madman who is screaming imprecations to his seconds his chest and belly rising and falling is amin tiring does it matter nyerere still hasnt landed a single blow could even a hundred blows bring the ugandan to his knees he doubts it perhaps he should have bet on the fight the odds were thousands to one that he wouldnt make it this far he could have supplied his army with the winnings and died honorably it is not the same he decides as they rub his shoulders grease his cheeks apply ice to the swelling beneath his eye he has survived the fourth round has done his best but it is not the same he could finish fourth out of six in a foot race and be reelected but if he finishes second tonight he will not have a country left to reelect him this is the real world and surviving it seems is not as important as winning ali tells him to hold on his corner tells him to retreat the cut man tells him to protect his eye but no one tells him how to win and he realizes that he will have to find out on his own goliath fell to a child even achilles had his weakness what must he do to bring the madman down he is crazy this amin he revels in torture he murders his wives rumor has it that he has even killed and eaten his infant son how do you find weakness in a barbarian like that and suddenly nyerere understands you do it by realizing that he is a barbarian ignorant illiterate superstitious there is no time now but he will hold that thought he will survive one more round of clinching and grabbing of stifling closeness to the giant whose very presence he finds degrading three more minutes of the sword and then he will apply the pen he almost doesnt make it halfway through the round amin shakes him off like a fly then lands a right to the head as he tries to clinch again consciousness begins to ebb from him but by sheer force of will he refuses to relinquish it he shakes his head spits blood on the floor of the ring and stands up once more amin lunges at him and once again he wraps his small spindly arms around the giant a snake he mumbles barely able to make himself understood a snake asks the cornerman draw it on my glove he says forcing the words out with an excruciating effort now now mutters nyerere he comes out for the seventh round his face a mask of raw bleeding tissue as amin approaches him he spits out his mouthpiece as i strike so strikes this snake he whispers protect your heart madman he repeats it in his native zanake dialect which the giant thinks is a curse amins eyes go wide with terror and he hits the giant on the left breast it is the first punch he has thrown in the entire fight and amin drops to his knees screaming one amin looks down at his unblemished chest and pendulous belly and seems surprised to find himself still alive and breathing two amin blinks once then chuckles three the giant gets to his feet and approaches nyerere try again he says loud enough for ringside to hear your snake has no fangs he puts his hand on his hips braces his legs and waits nyerere stares at him for an instant so the pen is not mightier than the sword shakespeare might have told him so im waiting bellows the giant mugging once more for the crowd nyerere realizes that it is over that he will die in the ring this night that he can no more save his army with his fists than with his depleted treasury he has fought the good fight has fought it longer than anyone thought he could at least before it is over he will have one small satisfaction he feints with his left shoulder then puts all of his strength into one final effort and delivers a right to the madmans groin the air rushes out of amins mouth with a woosh and he doubles over then drops to his knees ali pushes nyerere into a neutral corner then instructs the judges to take away a point from him on their scorecards they can take away a point nyerere thinks but they cant take away the fact that i met him on the field of battle that i lasted more than six rounds that the giant went down twice once before the pen once before the sword and both were ineffective even a mwalimu can learn one last lesson he decides and it is that sometimes even vectors and philosophy arent enough we must find another way to conquer africas dark heart the madness that pervades this troubled land i have shown those who will follow me the first step i have stood up to it faced it without flinching it will be up to someone else a wiser mwalimu than myself to learn how to overcome it i have done my best i have given my all i have made the first dent in its armor rationality cannot always triumph over madness but it must stand up and be counted as i have stood up they cannot ask any more of me finally at peace with himself he prepares for the giants final assault
