the seed from the sepulchre clark ashton smith yes i found the place said falmer its a queer sort of place pretty much as the legends describe it he spat quickly into the fire as if the act of speech had been physically distasteful to him and half averting his face from the scrutiny of thone stared with morose and somber eyes into the junglematted venezuelan darkness thone still weak and dizzy from the fever that had incapacitated him for continuing their journey to its end was curiously puzzled falmer he thought had under gone an inexplicable change during the three days of his absence a change that was too elusive in some of its phases to be fully defined or delimited other phases however were all too obvious falmer even during extreme hardship or illness had heretofore been unquenchably loquacious and cheerful now he seemed sullen uncommunicative as if preoccupied with faroff things of disagreeable import his bluff face had grown hollow even pointed and his eyes had narrowed to secretive slits thone was troubled by these changes though he tried to dismiss his impressions as mere distem pered fancies due to the influence of the ebbing fever but cant you tell me what the place was like he persisted there isnt much to tell said falmer in a queer grumbling tone just a few crumbling walls and falling pillars but didnt you find the burialpit of the indian legend where the gold was supposed to be i found it but there was no treasure falmers voice had taken on a forbidding surliness and thone decided to refrain from further questioning i guess he commented lightly that we had better stick to orchid hunting treasure trove doesnt seem to be in our line by the way did you see any unusual flowers or plants during the trip hell no falmer snapped his face had gone sud denly ashen in the firelight and his eyes had assumed a set glare that might have meant either fear or anger shut up cant you i dont want to talk ive had a headache all day some damned venezuelan fever coming on i sup pose wed better head for the orinoco tomorrow ive had all i want of this trip james falmer and roderick thone professional orchid hunters with two indian guides had been following an obscure tributary of the upper orinoco the country was rich in rare flowers and beyond its floral wealth they had been drawn by vague but persistent rumors among the local tribes concerning the existence of a ruined city somewhere on this tributary a city that contained a burial pit in which vast treasures of gold silver and jewels had been interred together with the dead of some nameless people the two men had thought it worthwhile to investi gate these rumors thone had fallen sick while they were still a full days journey from the site of the ruins and falmer had gone on in a canoe with one of the indians leaving the other to attend to thone he had returned at nightfall of the third day following his departure thone decided after a while as he lay staring at his companion that the latters taciturnity and moroseness were perhaps due to disappointment over his failure to find the treasure it must have been that together with some tropical infection working in the mans blood however he admitted doubtfully to himself it was not like falmer to be disappointed or downcast under such circumstances falmer did not speak again but sat glaring before him as if he saw something invisible to others beyond the labyrinth of firetouched boughs and lianas in which the whispering stealthy darkness crouched somehow there was a shadowy fear in his aspect thone continued to watch him and saw that the indians impassive and cryp tic were also watching him as if with some obscure expectancy the riddle was too much for thone and he gave it up after a while lapsing into restless fever turbulent slumber from which he awakened at intervals to see the set face of falmer dimmer and more distorted each time with the slowly dying fire and the invading shadows thone felt stronger in the morning his brain was clear his pulse tranquil once more and he saw with mounting concern the indisposition of falmer who seemed to rouse and exert himself with great difficulty speaking hardly a word and moving with singular stiffness and sluggishness he appeared to have forgotten his announced project of returning toward the orinoco and thone took entire charge of the preparations for departure his companions condition puzzled him more and more apparently there was no fever and the symptoms were wholly ambiguous however on general principles he administered a stiff dose of quinine to falmer before they started the paling saffron of sultry dawn sifted upon them through the jungle tops as they loaded their belongings into the dugouts and pushed off down the slow current thone sat near the bow of one of the boats with falmer in the rear and a large bundle of orchid roots and part of their equipment filling the middle the two indians occupied the other boat together with lhe rest of the supplies it was a monotonous journey the river wound like a sluggish olive snake between dark interminable walls of forest from which the goblin faces of orchids leered there were no sounds other than the splash of paddles the furious chattering of monkeys and petulant cries of fierycolored birds the sun rose above the jungle and poured down a tide of torrid brilliance thone rowed steadily looking back over his shoulder at times to address falmer with some casual remark or friendly question the latter with dazed eyes and features queerly pale and pinched in the sunlight sat dully erect and made no effort to use his paddle he offered no reply to the queries of thone but shook his head at intervals with a sort of shuddering motion that was plainly involun tary after a while he began to moan thickly as if in pain or delirium they went on in this manner for hours the heat grew more oppressive between the stifling walls of jungle thone became aware of a shriller cadence in the moans of his companion looking back he saw that falmer had removed his sunhelmet seemingly oblivious of the murderous heat and was clawing at the crown of his head with frantic fingers convulsions shook his entire body the dugout began to rock dangerously as he tossed to and fro in a paroxysm of manifest agony his voice mounted to a high unhuman shrieking thone made a quick decision there was a break in the lining palisade of somber forest and he headed the boat for shore immediately the indians followed whispering between themselves and eyeing the sick man with glances of apprehensive awe and terror that puzzled thone tremendously he felt that there was some devilish mystery about the whole affair and he could not imagine what was wrong with falmer all the known manifestations of malignant tropical diseases rose before him like a rout of hideous fantasms but among them he could not recognize the thing that had assailed his companion having gotten falmer ashore on a semicircle of liana latticed beach without the aid of the indians who seemed unwilling to approach the sick man thone administered a heavy hypodermic injection of morphine from his medicine chest this appeared to ease falmers suffering and the convulsions ceased thone taking advantage of their remission proceeded to examine the crown of falmers head he was startled to find amid the thick disheveled hair a hard and pointed lump which resembled the tip of a beginning horn rising under the stillunbroken skin as if endowed with erectile and resistless life it seemed to grow beneath his fingers at the same time abruptly and mysteriously falmer opened his eyes and appeared to regain full consciousness for a few minutes he was more his normal self than at any time since his return from the ruins he began to talk as if anxious to relieve his mind of some oppressing burden his voice was peculiarly thick and toneless but thone was able to follow his mutterings and piece them together the pit the pit said falmer the infernal thing that was in the pit in the deep sepulcher i wouldnt go back there for the treasure of a dozen el dorados i didnt tell you much about those ruins thone somehow it was hard impossibly hard to talk i guess the indian knew there was something wrong with the ruins he led me to the place but he wouldnt tell me anything about it and he waited by the riverside while i searched for the treasure great grey walls there were older than the jungle old as death and time they must have been quarried and reared by people from some lost planet they loomed and leaned at mad unnatural angles threatening to crush the trees about them and there were columns too thick swollen columns of unholy form whose abominable carvings the jungle had not wholly screened from view there was no trouble finding that accursed burial pit the pavement above had broken through quite recently i think a big tree had pried with its boalike roots between the flagstones that were buried beneath centuries of mold one of the flags had been tilted back on the pavement and another had fallen through into the pit there was a large hole whose bottom i could see dimly in the forest strangled light something glimmered palely at the bottom but i could not be sure what it was i had taken along a coil of rope as you remember i tied one end of it to a main root of the tree dropped the other through the opening and went down like a monkey when i got to the bottom i could see little at first in the gloom except the whitish glimmering all around me at my feet something that was unspeakably brittle and fri able crunched beneath me when i began to move i turned on my flashlight and saw that the place was fairly littered with bones human skeletons lay tumbled everywhere they must have been removed long ago i groped around amid the bones and dust feeling pretty much like a ghoul but couldnt find anything of value not even a bracelet or a fingerring on any of the skeletons it wasnt until i thought of climbing out that i noticed the real horror in one of the corners the comer nearest to the opening in the roof i looked up and saw it in the webby shadows ten feet above my head it hung and i had almost touched it unknowingly when i descended the rope it looked like a sort of white latticework at first then i saw that the lattice was partly formed of human bones a complete skeleton very tall and stalwart like that of a warrior a pale withered thing grew out of the skull like a set of fantastic antlers ending in myriads of long and stringy tendrils that had spread upward till they reached the roof they must have lifted the skeleton or body along with them as they climbed i examined the thing with my flashlight it must have been a plant of some sort and apparently it had started to grow in the cranium some of the branches had issued from the cloven crown others through the eye holes the mouth and the nose holes to flare upward and the roots of the blasphemous thing had gone downward trellising themselves on every bone the very toes and fingers were ringed with them and they drooped in writhing coils worst of all the ones that had issued from the toeends were rooted in a second skull which dangled just below with fragments of the brokenoff root system there was a litter of fallen bones on the floor in the corner the sight made me feel a little weak somehow and more than a little nauseated that abhorrent inexplicable mingling of the human and the plant i started to climb the rope in a feverish hurry to get out but the thing fascinated me in its abominable fashion and i couldnt help pausing to study it a little more when i had climbed halfway i leaned toward it too fast i guess and the rope began to sway bringing my face lightly against the leprous antlershaped boughs above the skull something broke possibly a sort of pod on one of the branches i found my head enveloped in a cloud of pearl grey powder very light fine and scentless the stuff settled on my hair it got into my nose and eyes nearly choking and blinding me i shook it off as well as i could then i climbed on and pulled myself through the opening as if the effort of coherent narration had been too heavy a strain falmer lapsed into disconnected mumblings the mysterious malady whatever it was returned upon him and his delirious ramblings were mixed with groans of torture but at moments he regained a flash of coherence my head my head he muttered there must be something in my brain something that grows and spreads i tell you i can feel it there i havent felt right at any time since i left the burial pit my mind has been queer ever since it must have been the spores of the ancient devilplant the spores have taken root the thing is splitting my skull going down into my brain a plant that springs out of a human cranium as if from a flower pot the dreadful convulsions began once more and falmer writhed uncontrollably in his companions arms shriek ing with agony thone sick at heart and shocked by his sufferings abandoned all effort to restrain him and took up the hypodermic with much difficulty he managed to inject a triple dose and falmer grew quiet by degrees and lay with open glassy eyes breathing stertorously thone for the first time perceived an odd protrusion of his eyeballs which seemed about to start from their sockets making it impossible for the lids to close and lending the drawn features an expression of mad horror it was as if something were pushing falmers eyes from his head thone trembling with sudden weakness and terror felt that he was involved in some unnatural web of nightmare he could not dared not believe the story falmer had told him and its implications assuring himself that his com panion had imagined it all had been ill throughout with the incubation of some strange fever he stooped over and found that the hornshaped lump on falmers head had now broken through the skin with a sense of unreality he stared at the object that his prying fingers had revealed amid the matted hair it was unmistakably a plantbud of some sort with involuted folds of pale green and bloody pink that seemed about to expand the thing issued from above the central suture of the skull a nausea swept upon thone and he recoiled from the lolling head and its baleful outgrowth averting his gaze his fever was returning there was a woeful debility in all his limbs and he heard the muttering voice of delirium through the quinineinduced ringing in his ears his eyes blurred with a deathly and miasmal mist he fought to subdue his illness and impotence he must not give way to it wholly he must go on with falmer and the indians and reach the nearest trading station many days away on the orinoco where falmer could receive aid as if through sheer volition his eyes cleared and he felt a resurgence of strength he looked around for the guides and saw with a start of uncomprehending surprise that they had vanished peering further he observed that one of the boats the dugout used by the indians had also disappeared it was plain that he and falmer had been deserted perhaps the indians had known what was wrong with the sick man and had been afraid at any rate they were gone and they had taken much of the camp equipment and most of the provisions with them thone turned once more to the supine body of falmer conquering his repugnance with effort resolutely he drew out his clasp knife and stooping over the stricken man he excised the protruding bud cutting as close to the scalp as he could with safety the thing was unnaturally tough and rubbery it exuded a thin sanguinous fluid and he shuddered when he saw its internal structure full of nervelike filaments with a core that suggested cartilage he flung it aside quickly on the river sand then lifting falmer in his arms he lurched and staggered towards the remaining boat he fell more than once and lay half swooning across the inert body alternately carrying and dragging his burden he reached the boat at last with the remainder of his failing strength he contrived to prop falmer in the stern against the pile of equipment his fever was mounting apace after much delay with tedious halfdelirious exertions he pushed off from the shore till the fever mastered him wholly and the oar slipped from oblivious fingers he awoke in the yellow glare of dawn with his brain and his senses comparatively clear his illness had left a great languor but his first thought was of falmer he twisted about nearly falling overboard in his debility and sat facing his companion falmer still reclined half sitting half lying against the pile of blankets and other impedimenta his knees were drawn up his hands clasping them as if in tetanic rigor his features had grown as stark and ghastly as those of a dead man and his whole aspect was one of mortal rigidity it was not this however that caused thone to gasp with unbelieving horror during the interim of thones delirium and his lapse into slumber the monstrous plant bud merely stimulated it would seem by the act of excision had grown again with preternatural rapidity from falmers head a loath some palegreen stem was mounting thickly and had started to branch like antlers after attaining a height of six or seven inches more dreadful than this if possible similar growths had issued from the eyes and their stems climbing verti cally across the forehead had entirely displaced the eyeballs already they were branching like the thing from the crown the antlers were all tipped with pale vermilion they appeared to quiver with repulsive animations nod ding rhythmically in the warm windless air from the mouth another stem protruded curling upward like a long and whitish tongue it had not yet begun to bifurcate thone closed his eyes to shut away the shocking vision behind his lids in a yellow dazzle of light he still saw the cadaverous features the climbing stems that quivered against the dawn like ghastly hydras of tombetiolated green they seemed to be waving toward him growing and lengthening as they waved he opened his eyes again and fancied with a start of new terror that the antlers were actually taller than they had been a few moments previous after that he sat watching them in a sort of baleful hypnosis the illusion of the plants visible growth and freer movement if it were illusion increased upon him falmer however did not stir and his parchment face appeared to shrivel and fall in as if the roots of the growth were draining his blood were devouring his very flesh in their insatiable and ghoulish hunger thone wrenched his eyes away and stared at the river shore the stream had widened and the current had grown more sluggish he sought to recognize their location looking vainly for some familiar landmark in the monotonous dullgreen cliffs of jungle that lined the margin he felt hopelessly lost and alienated he seemed to be drifting on an unknown tide of madness and nightmare accompanied by something more frightful than corruption itself his mind began to wander with an odd inconsequence coming back always in a sort of closed circle to the thing that was devouring falmer with a flash of scientific curiosity he found himself wondering to what genus it belonged it was neither fungus nor pitcher plant nor anything that he had ever encountered or heard of in his explorations it must have come as falmer had suggested from an alien world it was nothing that the earth could conceivably have nourished he felt wih a comforting assurance that falmer was dead that at least was a mercy but even as he shaped the thought he heard a low gutteral moaning and peering at falmer in a horrible startlement saw that his limbs and body were twitching slightly the twitching increased and took on a rhythmic regularity though at no time did it resemble the agonized and violent convulsions of the previous day it was plainly automatic like a sort of galvanism and thone saw that it was timed with the languorous and loathsome swaying of the plant the effect on the watcher was insidiously mesmeric and somnolent and once he caught himself beating the detestable rhythm with his foot he tried to pull himself together groping desperately for something to which his sanity could cling ineluctably his illness returned fever nausea and revulsion worse than the loathliness of death but before he yielded to it utterly he drew his loaded revolver from the holster and fired six times into falmers quivering body he knew that he had not missed but after the final bullet falmer still moaned and twitched in unison with the evil swaying of the plant and thone sliding into delirium heard still the ceaseless automatic moaning there was no time in the world of seething unreality and shoreless oblivion through which he drifted when he came to himself again he could not know if hours or weeks had elapsed but he knew at once that the boat was no longer moving and lifting himself dizzily he saw that it had floated into shallow water and mud and was nosing the beach of a tiny jungletufted isle in midriver the putrid odor of slime was about him like a stagnant pool and he heard a strident humming of insects it was either late morning or early afternoon for the sun was high in the still heavens lianas were drooping above him from the island trees like uncoiled serpents and epiphytic orchids marked with ophidian mottlings leaned toward him grotesquely from lowering boughs immense butterflies went past on sumptuously spotted wings he sat up feeling very giddy and lightheaded and faced again the horror that accompanied him the thing had grown incredibly the threeantlered stems mounting above falmers head had become gigantic and had put out masses of ropy feelers that tossed uneasily in the air as if searching for support or new provender in the topmost antlers a prodigious blossom had opened a sort of fleshy disk broad as a mans face and white as leprosy falmers features had shrunken till the outlines of every bone were visible as if beneath tightened paper he was a mere deaths head in a mask of human skin and beneath his clothing the body was little more than a skeleton he was quite still now except for the communicated quiver ing of the stems the atrocious plant had suckedhim dry had eaten his vitals and his flesh thone wanted to hurl himself forward in a mad impulse to grapple with the growth but a strange paralysis held him back the plant was like a living and sentient thing a thing that watched him that dominated him with its un clean but superior will and the huge blossom as he stared took on the dim unnatural semblance of a face it was somehow like the face of falmer but the lineaments were twisted all awry and were mingled with those of something wholly devilish and nonhuman thone could not move he could not take his eyes from the blasphe mous abnormality by some miracle his fever had left him and it did not return instead there came an eternity of frozen fright and madness in which he sat facing the mesmeric plant it towered before him from the dry dead shell that had been falmer its swollen glutted stems and branches swaying gently its huge flower leering perpetually upon him with its impious travesty of a human face he thought that he heard a low singing sound ineffably sweet but whether it emanated from the plant or was a mere hallucination of his overwrought senses he could not know the sluggish hours went by and a gruelling sun poured down its beams like molten lead from some titanic vessel of torture his head swam with weakness and the fetor laden heat but he could not relax the rigor of his posture there was no change in the nodding monstrosity which seemed to have attained its full growth above the head of its victim but after a long interim thones eyes were drawn to the shrunken hands of falmer which still clasped the drawnup knees in a spasmodic clutch through the ends of the fingers tiny white rootlets had broken and were writhing siowly in the air groping it seemed for a new source of nourishment then from the neck and chin other tips were breaking and over the whole body the clothing stirred in a curious manner as if with the crawling and lifting of hidden lizards at the same time the singing grew louder sweeter more imperious and the swaying of the great plant assumed an indescribably seductive tempo it was like the allurement of voluptuous sirens the deadly languor of dancing cobras thone felt an irresistible compulsion a summons was being laid upon him and his drugged mind and body must obey it the very fingers of falmer twist ing viperishly seemed beckoning to him suddenly he was on hs hands and knees in the bottom of the boat inch by inch with terror and fascination contending in his brain he crept forward dragging himself over the disregarded bundle of orchidplants inch by inch foot by foot till his head was against the withered hands of falmer from which hung and floated the questing roots some cataleptic spell had made him helpless he felt the rootlets as they moved like delving fingers through his hair and over his face and neck and started to strike in with agonizing needlesharp tips he could not stir he could not even close his lids in a frozen stare he saw the gold and carmine flash of a hovering butterfly as the roots began to pierce his pupils deeper and deeper went the greedy roots while new filaments grew out to enmesh him like a witchs net for a while it seemed that the dead and the living writhed together in leashed convulsions at last thone hung supine amid the lethal evergrowing web bloated and colossal the plant lived on and in its upper branches through the still stifling afternoon a second flower began to unfold
