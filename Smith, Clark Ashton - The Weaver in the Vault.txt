the weaver in the vault clark ashton smith the instructions of famorgh fiftyninth king of tasuun were minutely circumstantial and explicit and moreover were not to be disobeyed without the incurring of penalties that would make mere death a pleasant thing yanur grotara and thirlain ludoch three of the kings hardiest henchmen riding forth at morn from the palace in miraab debated with a thin semblance of jocosity whether in their case obedience or disobedience would prove the direr evil the commission they had just received from famorgh was no less singular than distasteful they were to visit chaon gacca the longforsaken seat of the kings of tasuun lying more than ninety miles to the north of miraab amid the desert hills and descending into the burial vaults beneath the ruined palace were to find and bring back to miraab whatever remained of the mummy of king tnepreez founder of the dynasty to which famorgh belonged no one had entered chaon gacca for centuries and the preservation of its dead in the catacombs was uncertain but even if only the skull of tnepreez was left or the bone of his little finger or the dust of mummia into which he had crumbled the menatarms were to fetch it carefully guarding it like a holy relic tis an errand for hyenas rather than warriors grumbled yanur in his black and spadeshaped beard by the god yululun keeper of the tombs i deem it an ill thing to disturb the peaceful dead and truly it is not well for men to enter chaon gacca where death has made his capital and has gathered all the ghouls to do him homage the king should have sent his embalmers opined grotara he was the youngest and hugest of the three being taller by a full head than yanur or thirlain ludoch and like them he was a veteran of savage wars and desperate perils yea i said it was an errand for hyenas rejoined yanur but the king knew well that there were no mortal beings in all miraab saving ourselves who would dare to enter the accursed vaults of chaon gacca two centuries ago king mandis wishing to retrieve the golden mirror of queen avaina for his favorite leman commanded two of his bravos to descend within the vaults where the mummy of avaina sits enthroned in her separate tomb holding the mirror in her withered hand and the bravos went to chaon gacca but they did not return and king mandis being warned by a soothsayer made no second attempt to procure the mirror but contented his leman with another gift yanur thy tales would gladden those who await the scything of the executioner said thirlain ludoch the oldest of the trio whose brown beard was faded to a hempen hue by desert suns but i chide thee not it is common knowledge that the catacombs are ridden with worse hauntings than those of liches or phantoms strange devils came there long ago from the mad unholy desert of dloth and i have heard it told that the kings forsook chaon gacca because of certain shadows that appeared at full noon in the palacehalls with no visible form to cast them and would not depart thereafter being changeless amid all the changings of the light and wholly undimmed by the exorcisms of priests and sorcerers men say that the flesh of any who dared to touch the shadows or to tread upon them became black and putrid like the flesh of monthold corpses all in a mere instant because of such testing when one of the shadows came and sat upon his throne the right hand of king agmeni rotted to the wrist and fell away like the sloughing of a leper and after that no man would dwell in chaon gacca verily i have heard other stories said yanur the towns abandonment was due mainly to the failure of the wells and cisterns from which the water vanished following an earthquake that left the land riven with helldeep chasms the palace of the kings was sundered to its nethermost vault by one of the chasms and king agmeni was seized by a violent madness when he inhaled the infernal vapors issuing from the rent nor was he ever wholly sane in his latter lifetime after the quitting of chaon gacca and the rearing of miraab now that is a tale that i can believe said grotara and surely i must deem that famorgh has inherited the madness of his forefather agmeni methinks that the royal house of tasuun rots and totters to its fall harlots and sorcerers swarm in the palace of famorgh like charnelworms and now in this princess lunalia of xylac whom he has taken to wife he has found a harlot and a witch in one he has sent us on this errand at the prompting of lunalia who desires the mummy of tnepreez for her own unhallowed purpose tnepreez i have heard was a great wizard in his time and lunalia would avail herself of the potent virtue of his bones and dust in the brewing of her philtres pah i like not the task of such purveyance there are mummies enow in miraab for the making of potions to madden the queens lovers famorgh is utterly besotted and befooled beware admonished thirlain ludoch for lunalia is a vampire who lusts ever for the young and strong and thy turn may come next o grotara if fortune brings us back alive from this enterprise i have seen her watching thee i would sooner mate with the wild lamia protested grotara in virtuous indignation thy aversion would help thee not said thirlain ludoch for i know others who have drunk the potions but we are now nearing the last wineshop in miraab and my throat is dusty beforehand with the very thought of this journey i shall need a whole stoup of wine from yoros to wash the dust away thou sayest sooth agreed yanur already i have become dry as the mummy of tnepreez and thou grotara i will quaff any drink if it be not the philtrebrew of queen lunalia mounted on swift untiring dromedaries and followed by a fourth camel bearing on its back a light wooden sarcophagus for the accommodation of king tnepreez the three henchmen had soon left behind them the bright and noisy streets of miraab and the fields of sesame the crofts of apricot and pomegranate lying for miles about the city before noon they had parted from the route of caravans and had taken a road that was seldom used by any but lions and jackals however the way to chaon gacca was plain for the ruts of olden chariots were still deeply marked in the desert soil where rain no longer fell at any season on the first night they slept beneath the cold and crowding stars and kept watch by turn lest a lion should come upon them unaware or a viper should crawl among them for warmth during the second day they passed amid steepening hills and deep ravines that retarded their progress here there was no rustling of serpent or lizard and naught but their own voices and the shuffling of the camels to break the silence that lay upon all things like a mute malediction sometimes on the desiccating tors above them against the darkly litten sky they saw the boughs of centurywithered cacti or the boles of trees that immemorial fires had blasted the second sunset found them in sight of chaon gacca rearing its dilapidated walls at a distance of less than four leagues in a broad open valley coming then to a wayside shrine of yuckla the small and grotesque god of laughter whose influence was believed to be mainly benignant they were glad to go no farther on that day but took shelter in the crumbling shrine for fear of the ghouls and devils who might dwell in such vicinage to those accursed ruins they had brought with them from miraab a wineskin filled with the fervent ruby wine of yoros and though the skin was now threefourths empty they poured a libation in the twilight on the broken altar and prayed to yuckla for such protection as he might give them against the demons of the night they slept on the worn and chilly flags about the altar watching by turn as before grotara who kept the third watch beheld at last the paling of the closehung stars and aroused his companions in a dawn that was like a sifting of ashes through the cinderblack darkness after a scanty meal of figs and dried goatflesh they resumed their journey guiding their camels down the valley and weaving back and forth on the bouldered slopes when they came to abysmal rents in the earth and rock their approach to the ruins was rendered slow and tortuous by such divagations the way was lined by the stocks of orchard trees that had perished long ago and by cotes and granges where even the hyena no longer made his lair because of their many detours it was hard upon noon when they rode through the hollowringing streets of the city like ragged purple cloaks the shadows of the ruining houses were drawn close to their walls and portals everywhere the havoc of earthquake was manifest and the fissured avenues and mounded mansions served to verify the tales that yanur had heard concerning the reason of the citys abandonment the palace of the kings however was still preeminent above the other buildings a tumbled pile it frowned in dark porphyry on a low acropolis amid the northern quarter for the making of this acropolis a hill of red syenite had been stripped of its covering soil in elder days and had been hewn to sheer and rounding walls circled by a road that wound slowly about it to the summit following this road and nearing the portals of the courtyard the henchmen of famorgh came to a fissure that clove their path from wall to precipice yawning far in the cliff the chasm was less than a yard in width but the dromedaries balked before it the three dismounted and leaving the camels to await their return they leapt lightly across the fissure grotara and thirlain ludoch carrying the sarcophagus and yanur bearing the wineskin they passed beneath the shattered barbican the great courtyard was heavily strewn with the wreckage of oncelofty towers and balconies over which the warriors climbed with much wariness eyeing the shadows closely and loosening their swords in the sheath as if they were surmounting the barricades of a hidden foe all three were startled by the pale and naked form of a colossean female which they saw reclining on the blocks and rubble in a portico beyond the court but drawing nearer they found that the shape was not that of a shedemon as they had apprehended but was merely a marble statue that had once stood like a caryatid among the mighty pillars following the directions given them by famorgh they entered the main hall here beneath the chasmed and collapsing roof they moved with the utmost caution fearing that a light jar a whisper would bring the suspended ruin upon their heads like an avalanche overturned tripods of greening copper tables and trivets of splintered ebony and the shards of gayly painted porcelains were mingled with the huge fragments of pedestals and fusts and entablatures and upon a shivered dais of green bloodspotted heliotrope the tarnished silver throne of the kings careened amid the mutilated sphinxes carved from jasper that kept eternal guard beside it at the further end of the hall they found an alcove still unblocked by fallen debris in which were the stairs that led downward to the catacombs they paused briefly ere beginning their descent yanur applied himself without ceremony to the skin which he carried and lightened it considerably before giving it into the hands of thirlain ludoch who had marked his potations with solicitude thirlain ludoch and grotara drank the remainder of the vintage between them and the latter did not grumble at the thick lees which fell to his lot thus replenished they lit three torches of pitchy terebinth which they had brought along in the sarcophagus yanur led the way daring the tenebrous depths with drawn sword and a torch flaming smokily in his left hand his companions followed bearing the sarcophagus in which by raising the hinged lid slightly they had socketed the other torches the potent wine of yoros mounted with them driving away their shadowy fears and apprehensions but all three were seasoned drinkers and they moved with great care and circumspection and did not stumble on the dim uncertain steps passing through a series of winecellars full of cracked and sharded jars they came at last after many zigzag plungings of the stairs to a vast corridor hewn in the nether syenite below the level of the city streets it stretched before them through illimitable gloom its walls unshattered and its roof admitting no crevicefiltered ray it seemed that they had entered some impregnable citadel of the dead on the right hand were the tombs of the elder kings on the left were the sepulchers of the queens and lateral passages led to a world of subsidiary vaults reserved for other members of the royal family at the further end of the main hall they would find the burialchamber of tnepreez yanur following the righthand wall soon came to the first tomb according to custom its portals were open and were lower than a mans stature so that all who entered must bow in humbleness to death yanur held his torch to the lintel and read stumblingly the legend graven in the stone which told that the vault was that of king acharnil father of agmeni verily he said we shall find nothing here other than the harmless dead then the wine he had drunk impelling him to a sort of bravado he stooped before the portals and thrust his flickering flambeau into the tomb of acharnil surprised he swore a loud and soldierly oath that made the others drop their burden and crowd behind him peering into the square concamerated chamber which had a kingly spaciousness they saw that it was unoccupied by any visible tenant the tall chair of mystically graven gold and ebony in which the mummy should have sat crowned and robed as in life was addorsed against the farther wall on a low dais in it there lay an empty robe of sable and carmine and a mitershaped crown of silver set with black sapphires as if the dead king had doffed them and had gone away startled with the wine dying swiftly in their brains the warriors felt the crawling chill of an unknown mystery yanur however steeled himself to enter the vault he examined the shadowy corners he lifted and shook the raiment of achamil but found no clue to the riddle of the mummys disappearance the tomb was clean of dust and there was no visible sign nor faintest odor of mortal decay yanur rejoined his comrades and the three eyed each other in eerie consternation they resumed their exploring of the hall and yanur as he came to the doorway of each tomb paused before it and thrust his flambeau into the wavering murk only to discover a vacant throne and the castoff regalia of royalty there was it seemed no reasonable explanation for the vanishing of the mummies in whose preservation the powerful spices of the orient had been employed together with natron rendering them virtually incorruptible from the circumstances it did not appear that they had been removed by human robbers who would hardly have left behind the precious jewels fabrics and metals and it was even more unlikely that they had been devoured by animals for in that case the bones would have remained and the vestments would have been torn and disordered the mythic terrors of chaon gacca began to assume a darker imminence and the seekers peered and listened fearfully as they went on in the hushed sepulchral hall presently after they had verified the vacancy of more than a dozen tombs they saw the glimmering of several steely objects before them on the floor of the corridor these on investigation proved to be two swords two helmets and cuirasses of a slightly antiquated type such as had formerly been worn by the warriors of tasuun they might well have belonged to the unreturning braves sent by king mandis to retrieve the mirror of avaina yanur grotara and thirlain ludoch viewing these sinister relics were seized by an almost frantic desire to accomplish their errand and regain the sunlight they hurried on no longer pausing to inspect the separate tombs and debating as they went the curious problem that would be presented if the mummy sought by famorgh and lunalia should have vanished like the others the king had commanded them to fetch the remains of tnepreez and they knew that no excuse or explanation of their failure to do this would be accepted under such circumstances their return to miraab would be inadvisable and the only safety would lie in flight beyond the northern desert along the route of caravans to zulbhasair or xylac it seemed that they traversed an enormous distance among the more ancient vaults here the formation of the stone was softer and more friable and the earthquake had wrought considerable damage the floor was littered with detritus the sides and roof were full of fractures and some of the chambers had partially fallen in so that their vacancy was revealed to the casual peering of yanur and his companions nearing the halls end they were confronted by a chasm dividing both floor and roof and splitting the sill and lintel of the last chamber the gulf was about four feet wide and the torch of yanur could not disclose its bottom he found the name of tnepreez on the lintel whose antique inscription telling the deeds and titles of the king had been sundered in twain by the cataclysm then walking on a narrow ledge he entered the vault grotara and thirlain ludoch crowded behind him leaving the sarcophagus in the hall the sepulchral throne of tnepreez overturned and broken was lying across the fissure that had rifted the whole tomb from side to side there was no trace of the mummy which from the chairs inverted position had doubtless fallen into those yawning depths in the hour of its overthrow before the seekers could voice their disappointment and their dismay the silence about them was broken by a dull rumbling as of distant thunder the stone trembled beneath their feet the walls shook and wavered and the rumbling noise in long shuddering undulations grew louder and more ominous the solid floor appeared to rise and flow with a continuous sickening motion and then as they turned to flee it seemed that the universe came down upon them in a roaring deluge of night and ruin grotara wakening in darkness was aware of an agonizing burden as if some monumental shaft were builded on his crushed feet and lower legs his head throbbed and ached as if from the stroke of a stunning mace he found that his arms and body were free but the pain in his extremities became insufferable causing him to swoon anew when he tried to drag them from beneath their encumbrance terror closed upon him like the clutch of ghoulish fingers as he realized his situation an earthquake such as had caused the abandonment of chaon gacca had occurred and he and his fellows were entombed in the catacombs he called aloud repeating the names of yanur and thirlain ludoch many times but there was no groan nor rustle to assure him that they still lived reaching out with his right hand he encountered numerous pieces of rubble slewing himself toward them he found several bouldersized fragments of stone and among them a smooth and roundish thing with a sharp ridge in the center which he knew for the crested helmet worn by one of his companions even with the most painful striving he could reach no further and was unable to identify the owner the metal was heavily dented and the comb was bent as if by the impact of some ponderous mass in spite of his predicament the fierce nature of grotara refused to yield itself to despair he drew himself to a sitting position and doubling forward he contrived to reach the enormous block that had fallen across his nether limbs he pushed against it with herculean effort raging like a trapped lion but the mass was immovable for hours it seemed he strove as if with some monstrous cacodemon his frenzy was calmed only by exhaustion he lay back at length and the darkness weighed upon him like a live thing and seemed to gnaw him with fangs of pain and horror delirium hovered near and he thought that he heard a dim and hideous humming far below in the stony bowels of the earth the noise grew louder as if ascending from a riven hell he became aware of a wan unreal light that wavered above him disclosing in doubtful glimpses the shattered roof the light strengthened and lifting himself a little he saw that it poured from the earthquake chasm in the floor it was a light such as he had never seen a livid luster that was not the reflection of lamp or torch or firebrand somehow as if the senses of hearing and sight were confused he identified it with the hideous humming like a sourceless dawn the luminosity crept upon the ruin wrought by the temblor grotara saw that the whole entrance of the tomb and much of its concameration had caved in a fragment striking him on the head had knocked him senseless and a huge section of the roof had fallen across his extremities the bodies of thirlain ludoch and yanur were lying close to the broadened chasm both he felt sure were dead the grizzled beard of thirlain ludoch was dark and stiff with blood that had run down from the crushed cranium and yanur was halfburied in a pile of blocks and detritus from which his torso and left arm were emergent his torch had burned itself out in his stiffly clutching fingers as if in a blackened socket all this grotara noted in a vague dreamlike manner then he perceived the real source of the strange illumination a coldly shining hueless globe round as a puffball and large as a human head had risen from the fissure and was hovering above it like a mimic moon the thing oscillated with a slight but ceaseless vibratory motion from it as if caused by this vibration the heavy humming poured and the light fell in evertrembling waves a dim awe was upon grotara but he felt no terror it seemed that the light and sound were woven upon his senses like some lethean spell rigid he sat forgetful of his pain and despair while the globe hovered for a few instants above the chasm and then floated slowly and horizontally till it hung directly over the upturned features of yanur with the same deliberate slowness the same ceaseless oscillation it descended upon the face and neck of the dead man which appeared to melt away like tallow as the globe settled lower and lower the humming deepened the globe flamed with an eerie luster and its deathlike pallor was mottled with impure iris it swelled and bloated obscenely while the whole head of the warrior shrank within the helmet and the plates of his cuirass fell in as if the very torso were shrivelling beneath them grotaras eyes beheld the horrific vision clearly but his brain was numbed as if by a merciful hemlock it was hard to remember hard to think but somehow he recalled the empty tombs the ownerless crowns and vestments the enigma of the missing mummies over which he and his companions had puzzled vainly was now resolved but the thing that battened upon yanur was beyond all mortal knowledge or surmise it was some ghoulish denizen of a nether world set free by the demons of earthquake now in the catalepsy that thralled him he saw the gradual settling of the piled dйbris in which the legs and hips of yanur were inhumed the helmet and bodymail were like empty shards the outflung arm had withered had shortened and the very bones were dwindling away appearing to melt and liquefy the globe had grown enormous it was flushed with unclean ruby like a vampire moon from it there issued palpable ropes and filaments pearly shuddering into strange colors that appeared to fasten themselves to the ruined floor and walls and roof like the weaving of a spider thickly and more thickly they multiplied forming a curtain between grotara and the chasm and falling upon thirlain ludoch and himself till he saw the sanguine burning of the globe as through arabesques of baleful opal now the web had filled the entire tomb it ran and glistened with a hundred changing hues it dripped with glories drawn from the spectrum of dissolution it bloomed with ghostly blossoms and foliages that grew and faded as if by necromancy the eyes of grotara were blinded more and more he was meshed in the weird web unearthly chill as the fingers of death its gossamers clung and quivered upon his face and hands he could not tell the duration of the weaving the term of his enthralment dimly at last he beheld the thinning of the luminous threads the retraction of the trembling arabesques the globe a thing of evil beauty alive and aware in some holocryptic fashion had risen now from the empty armor of yanur diminishing to its former size and putting off its colors of blood and opal it hung for a little above the chasm grotara felt that it was watching him was watching thirlain ludoch then like a satellite of the nether caverns it fell slowly into the fissure and the light faded from the tomb and left grotara in deepening darkness after that there were ages of fever thirst and madness of torment and slumber and recurrent strugglings against the massive block that held him prisoner he babbled insanely he howled like a wolf or lying supine and silent he heard the multitudinous muttering voices of ghouls that conspired against him gangrening swiftly his crushed extremities seemed to throb like those of a titan he drew his sword with the strength of delirium and endeavored to saw himself free at the shins only to swoon from loss of blood awakening feebly and scarce able to lift his head he saw that the light had returned and heard once more the incessant vibrant humming that filled the vault his mind was clear and a weak terror stirred within him for he knew that the weaver had risen again from the chasm and knew the reason of its coming he turned his head laboriously and watched the glowing ball as it hung and oscillated and then came down in leisurely descent on the face of thirlain ludoch again he saw it bloat obscenely like a bloodflushed moon fed with the wasting of the old warriors body again with dazzled eyes he beheld the weaving of the web of impure iris patterned with deathly splendor veiling the ruinous catacomb with its weird illusions again like a dying beetle he was meshed in its chill unearthly strands and its necromantic flowers blooming and perishing latticed the void air above him but ere the retracting of the web his delirium came upon him and brought a demonpeopled darkness and the weaver finished its toil unseen and returned unheeded to the chasm he tossed in the hells of fever or lay at the black undivined nadir of oblivion but death tarried still aloof and he lived on by sheer virtue of his youth and giant strength once more toward the end his senses cleared and he saw for the third time the unholy light and heard again the odious humming the weaver was poised above him pale shining and vibrant and he knew that it was waiting for him to die lifting his sword with weak fingers he sought to drive it away but the thing hovered alert and vigilant beyond his reach and he thought that it watched him like a vulture the sword dropped from his hand the luminous horror did not depart it drew nearer like an eyeless pertinacious face and it seemed to follow him swooping through the ultimate night as he fell deathward with none to behold the glory of its weaving with darkness before and after the weaver spun its final web in the tomb of tnepreez
