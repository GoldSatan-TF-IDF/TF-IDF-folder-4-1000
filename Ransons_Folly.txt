illustrations throw up your hands he commanded ranson faced the door spinning the revolver around his fourth finger i suppose im the ugliest bulldog in america miss dorothy snatches me up and kisses me between the ears weve got a great story we want a clear wire he played to the empty chair the men around the table turned and glanced toward the gentleman in front of the fireplace what was the object of your plot ransons folly part i the junior officers of fort crockett had organized a mess at the posttraders and a mess it certainly is said lieutenant ranson the diningtable stood between hogsheads of molasses and a blazing logfire the counter of the store was their buffet a pooltable with a cloth blotted like a map of the great lakes their sideboard and indian pete acted as butler but none of these things counted against the great fact that each evening mary cahill the daughter of the posttrader presided over the evening meal and turned it into a banquet from her high chair behind the counter with the cashregister on her one side and the weighingscales on the other she gave her little senate laws and smiled upon each and all with the kind impartiality of a comrade at least at one time she had been impartial but of late she smiled upon all save lieutenant ranson when he talked she now looked at the blazing logfire and her cheeks glowed and her eyes seemed to reflect the lifting flame for five years ever since her father brought her from the convent at st louis mary cahill had watched officers come and officers go her knowledge concerning them and their public and private affairs was vast and miscellaneous she was acquainted with the traditions of every regiment with its war record with its peacetime politics its nicknames its scandals even with the earnings of each companycanteen at fort crockett which lay under her immediate observation she knew more of what was going forward than did the regimental adjutant more even than did the colonels wife if trumpeter tyler flatted on church call if mrs stickney applied to the quartermaster for three feet of stovepipe if lieutenant curtis were granted two days leave for quailshooting mary cahill knew it and if mrs captain stairs obtained the postambulance for a drive to kiowa city when mrs captain ross wanted it for a picnic she knew what words passed between those ladies and which of the two wept she knew all of these things for each evening they were retailed to her by her boarders her boarders were very loyal to mary cahill her position was a difficult one and had it not been that the boyofficers were so understanding it would have been much more difficult for the life of a regimental post is as circumscribed as the life on a shipofwar and it would no more be possible for the ships barber to rub shoulders with the admirals epaulets than that a posttraders child should visit the ladies on the line or that the wives of the enlisted men should dine with the young girl from whom they took in washing so between the upper and the nether grindstones mary cahill was left without the society of her own sex and was of necessity forced to content herself with the society of the officers and the officers played fair loyalty to mary cahill was a tradition at fort crockett which it was the duty of each succeeding regiment to sustain moreover her father a dark sinister man alive only to moneymaking was known to handle a revolver with the alertness of a townmarshal since the day she left the convent mary cahill had held but two affections one for this grim taciturn parent who brooded over her as jealously as a lover and the other for the entire united states army the army returned her affection without the jealousy of the father and with much more than his effusiveness but when lieutenant ranson arrived from the philippines the affections of mary cahill became less generously distributed and her heart fluttered hourly between trouble and joy there were two rooms on the first floor of the posttraders this big one which only officers and their womenfolk might enter and the other the exchange of the enlisted men the two were separated by a partition of logs and hung with shelves on which were displayed calicoes tinned meats and patent medicines a door cut in one end of the partition with buffalorobes for portieres permitted cahill to pass from behind the counter of one store to behind the counter of the other on one side mary cahill served the colonels wife with many yards of silk ribbons to be converted into german favors on the other her father weighed out bears claws manufactured in hartford conn from turkeybones to make a necklace for red wing the squaw of the arrephao chieftain he waited upon everyone with gravity and in obstinate silence no one had ever seen cahill smile he himself occasionally joked with others in a grim and embarrassed manner but no one had ever joked with him it was reported that he came from new york where it was whispered he had once kept bar on the bowery for mcturk sergeant clancey of g troop was the authority for this but when presuming on that supposition he claimed acquaintanceship with cahill the posttrader spread out his hands on the counter and stared at the sergeant with cold and disconcerting eyes i never kept bar nowhere he said i never been on the bowery never been in new york never been east of denver in my life what was it you ordered well mebbe im wrong growled the sergeant but a month later when a coyote howled down near the indian village the sergeant said insinuatingly sounds just like the cry of the whyos dont it and cahill who was listening to the wolf unthinkingly nodded his head the sergeant snorted in triumph yah i told you so he cried a man thats never been on the bowery and knows the call of the whyo gang the drinks are on you cahill the posttrader did not raise his eyes but drew a damp cloth up and down the counter slowly and heavily as a man sharpens a knife on a whetstone that night as the sergeant went up the path to the post a bullet passed through his hat clancey was a forceful man and forceful men unknown to themselves make enemies so he was uncertain as to whether this came from a trooper he had borne upon too harshly or whether in the darkness he had been picked off for someone else the next night as he passed in the full light of the posttraders windows a shot came from among the dark shadows of the corral and when he immediately sought safety in numbers among the indians cowboys and troopers in the exchange he was in time to see cahill enter it from the other store wrapping up a bottle of painkiller for mrs stickneys cook but clancey was not deceived he observed with satisfaction that the soles and the heels of cahills boots were wet with the black mud of the corral the next morning when the exchange was empty the posttrader turned from arranging cans of condensed milk upon an upper shelf to face the sergeants revolver he threw up his hands to the level of his ears as though expressing sharp unbelief and waited in silence the sergeant advanced until the gun rested on the counter its muzzle pointing at the pit of cahills stomach you or me has got to leave this post said the sergeant and i cant desert so i guess its up to you what did you talk for asked cahill his attitude was still that of shocked disbelief but his tone expressed a full acceptance of the situation and a desire to temporize at first i thought it might be that new cruity in f troop explained the sergeant you came near making me kill the wrong man what harm did i do you by saying you kept bar for mcturk whats there in that to get hot about you said i run with the whyos what the h l do i care what youve done roared the sergeant i dont kmow nothing about you but i dont mean you should shoot me in the back im going to tell this to my bunky an if i get shot up the troopll know who done it and youll hang for it now what are you going to do cahill did not tell what he would do for from the other store the low voice of mary cahill called father oh father the two men dodged and eyed each other guiltily the sergeant gazed at the buffalorobe portieres with wideopened eyes cahills hands dropped from the region of his ears and fell flat upon the counter when miss mary cahill pushed aside the portieres sergeant clancey of g troop was showing her father the mechanism of the new regulationrevolver he apparently was having some difficulty with the cylinder for his face was red her father was eying the gun with the critical approval of an expert father said miss cahill petulantly why didnt you answer where is the blue stationery the sort major ogden always buys hes waiting the eyes of the posttrader did not wander from the gun before him next to the blank books mame he said on the second shelf miss cahill flashed a dazzling smile at the big sergeant and whispered so that the officer in the room behind her might not overhear is he trying to sell you government property dad dont you touch it sergeant im surprised at you tempting my poor father she pulled the two buffalorobes close around her neck so that her face only showed between them it was a sweet lovely face with frank boyish eyes when the majors gone sergeant she whispered bring your gun around my side of the store and ill buy it from you the sergeant nodded in violent assent laughing noiselessly and slapping his knee in a perfect ecstasy of delight the curtains dropped and the face disappeared the sergeant fingered the gun and cahill folded his arms defiantly well he said well asked the sergeant i should think you could see how it is said cahill without my having to tell you you mean you dont want she should know my god no not even that i kept a bar well i dont know nothing i dont mean to tell nothing anyway so if youll promise to be good ill call this off for the first time in the history of fort crockett cahill was seen to smile may i reach under the counter now he asked the sergeant grinned appreciatively and shifted his gun yes but ill keep this out until im sure its a bottle he said and laughed boisterously for an instant under the cover of the counter cahills hand touched longingly upon the gun that lay there and then passed on to the bottle beside it he drew it forth and there was the clink of glasses in the other room mary cahill winked at the major but that officer pretended to be both deaf to the clink of the glasses and blind to the wink and so the incident was closed had it not been for the folly of lieutenant ranson it would have remained closed a week before this happened a fire had started in the willow bottoms among the tepees of some kiowas and the prairie as far as one could see was bruised and black from the post it looked as though the sky had been raining ink at the time all of the regiment but g and h troops was out on a practicemarch experimenting with a newfangled tabloidration as soon as it turned the buttes it saw from where the light in the heavens came and the practicemarch became a race at the post the men had doubled out under lieutenant ranson with wet horseblankets and while he led g troop to fight the flames h troop under old major stickney burned a space around the post across which the men of g troop retreated stumbling with their ears and shoulders wrapped in the smoking blankets the sparks beat upon them and the flames followed so fast that as they ran the blazing grass burned their lacings and they kicked their gaiters ahead of them when the regiment arrived it found everybody at fort crockett talking enthusiastically of ransons conduct and resentfully of the fact that he had regarded the fire as one which had been started for his especial amusement i assure you said mrs bolland to the colonel if it hadnt been for young ranson we would have been burned in our beds but he was most aggravating he treated it as though it were fourth of july fireworks it is the only entertainment we have been able to offer him since he joined in which he has shown the slightest interest nevertheless it was generally admitted that ranson had saved the post he had been ubiquitous he had been seen galloping into the advancing flames like a stampeded colt he had reappeared like a wraith in columns of black whirling smoke at the same moment his voice issued orders from twenty places one instant he was visible beating back the fire with a wet blanket waving it above him jubilantly like a substitute at the armynavy game when his side scores and the next staggering from out of the furnace dragging an asphyxiated trooper by the collar and shrieking hospitalsteward hospitalsteward heres a man on fire put him out and send him back to me quick those who met him in the whirlwind of smoke and billowing flame related that he chuckled continuously isnt this fun he yelled at them say isnt this the best ever i wouldnt have missed this for a trip to new york when the colonel having visited the hospital and spoken cheering words to those who were sans hair sans eyebrows and with bandaged hands complimented lieutenant ranson on the paradeground before the assembled regiment ranson ran to his hut muttering strange and fearful oaths that night at mess he appealed to mary cahill for sympathy goodness mighty me he cried did you hear him wasnt it awful if id thought he was going to hand me that id have deserted whats the use of spoiling the only fun weve had that way why if id known you could get that much excitement out of this rank prairie id have put a match to it myself three months ago its the only fun ive had and he goes and preaches a funeral oration at me ranson came into the army at the time of the spanish war because it promised a new form of excitement and because everybody else he knew had gone into it too as the son of his father he was made an adjutantgeneral of volunteers with the rank of captain and unloaded on the staff of a southern brigadier who was slated never to leave charleston but ranson suspected this and after telegraphing his father for three days was attached to the philippines contingent and sailed from san francisco in time to carry messages through the surf when the volunteers moved upon manila more cabling at the cost of many mexican dollars caused him to be removed from the staff and given a second lieutenancy in a volunteer regiment and for two years he pursued the little brown men over the paddy sluices burned villages looted churches and collected bolos and altarcloths with that irresponsibility and contempt for regulations which is found chiefly in the appointment from civil life incidentally he enjoyed himself so much that he believed in the army he had found the one place where excitement is always in the air and as excitement was the breath of his nostrils he applied for a commission in the regular army on his record he was appointed a second lieutenant in the twentieth cavalry and on the return of that regiment to the states was buried alive at fort crockett after six months of this exile one night at the messtable ranson broke forth in open rebellion i tell you i cant stand it a day longer he cried im going to resign from behind the counter mary cahill heard him in horror second lieutenants crosby and curtis shuddered they were sons of officers of the regular army only six months before they themselves had been forwarded from west point done up in neat new uniforms the traditions of the academy of loyalty and discipline had been kneaded into their vertebrae in ranson they saw only the horrible result of giving commissions to civilians maybe the post will be gayer now that spring has come said curtis hopefully but with a doubtful look at the open fire i wouldnt do anything rash urged crosby miss cahill shook her head why i like it at the post she said and ive been here five years ever since i left the convent and i ranson interrupted bowing gallantly yes i know miss cahill he said but i didnt come here from a convent i came here from the bloodstained fields of war now out in the philippines theres always something doing they give you half a troop and so long as you bring back enough mausers and dont get your men cut up you can fight all over the shop and no questions asked but all i do here is take care of sick horses any vet in the states has seen as much fighting as i have in the last halfyear i might as well have had charge of horsecar stables there is some truth in that said curtis cautiously if you do resign certainly no one can accuse you of resigning in the face of the enemy enemy ye gods roared ranson why if i were to see a moro entering that door with a bolo in each fist id fall on his neck and kiss him im not trained to this garrison business you fellows are they took all the sporting blood out of you at west point one bad mark for smoking a cigarette two bad marks for failing to salute the instructor in botany and all the excitement you ever knew were charades and a cadethop a t cullum hall but you see before i went to the philippines with merritt id been there twice on a fellows yacht and wed tucked the spanish governor in his bed with his spurs on now i have to sit around and hear old bolland tell how he put down a carstrike in st louis and stickneys longwinded yarns of table mountain and the bloody angle he doesnt know the civil wars over i tell you if i cant get excitement on tap ive got to make it and if i make it out here theyll courtmartial me so theres nothing for it but to resign youd better wait till the end of the week said crosby grinning its going to be full of gayety thursday paymasters coming out with our cash and tonight that miss post from new york arrives in the up stage shes to visit the colonel so everybody will have to give her a good time yes i certainly must wait for that growled ranson there probably will be progressive euchre parties all along the line and well sit up as late as ten oclock and stick little gilt stars on ourselves crosby laughed tolerantly i see your point of view he said i remember when my father took me to monte carlo i saw you at the tables with enough money in front of you to start a bank i remember my father asked the croupiers why they allowed a child of your age to gamble i was just a kid then and so were you too i remember i thought you were the devil of a fellow ranson looked sheepishly at miss cahill and laughed well so i wasthen he said anybody would be a devil of a fellow whod been brought up as i was with a doting parent who owns a trust and doesnt know the proper value of money and yet you expect me to be happy with a fiftycent limit game and twenty miles of burned prairie i tell you ive never been broken to it i dont know what not having your own way means and discipline why every time i have to report one of my men to the colonel i send for him afterward and give him a drink and apologize to him i tell you the army doesnt mean anything to me unless theres something doing and as there is no fighting out here im for the back room of the holland house and a rubbertired automobile little old new york is good enough for me as he spoke these fateful words of mutiny lieutenant ranson raised his black eyes and snatched a swift sideglance at the face of mary cahill it was almost as though it were from her he sought his answer he could not himself have told what it was he would have her say but ever since the idea of leaving the army had come to him mary cahill and the army had become interchangeable and had grown to mean one and the same thing he fought against this condition of mind fiercely he had determined that without active service the army was intolerable but that without mary cahill civil life would also prove intolerable he assured himself did not at all follow he had laughed at the idea he had even argued it out sensibly was it reasonable to suppose he asked himself that after circling the great globe three times he should find the one girl on it who alone could make him happy sitting behind a posttraders counter on the open prairie his interest in miss cahill was the result of propinquity that was all it was due to the fact that there was no one else at hand because he was sorry for her loneliness because her absurd social ostracism had touched his sympathy how long after he reached new york would he remember the little comrade with the brave boyish eyes set in the delicate feminine head with its great waves of gorgeous hair it would not be long he guessed he might remember the way she rode her pony how she swung from her mexican saddle and caught up a gauntlet from the ground yes he certainly would remember that and he would remember the day he had galloped after her and ridden with her through the indian village and again that day when they rode to the waterfall and the lovers leap and he would remember her face at night as it bent over the books he borrowed for her which she read while they were at mess sitting in her high chair with her chin resting in her palms staring down at the book before her and the trick she had whenever he spoke of raising her head and looking into the fire her eyes lighting and her lips smiling they would be pleasant memories he was sure but once back again in the whirl and rush of the great world outside of fort crockett even as memories they would pass away mary cahill made no outward answer to the rebellious utterance of lieutenant ranson she only bent her eyes on her book and tried to think what the post would hold for her when he had carried out his threat and betaken himself into the world and out of her life forever night after night she had sat enthroned behind her barrier and listened to his talk wondering deeply he had talked of a world she knew only in novels in history and in books of travel his view of it was not an educational one he was no philosopher nor trained observer he remembered london to her the capital of the world chiefly by its restaurants cairo on account of its execrable golflinks he lived only to enjoy himself his view was that of a boy hearty and healthy and seeking only excitement and mischief she had heard his tales of his brief career at harvard of the reunions at henrys american bar of the futurity the suburban the grand prix of a yachting cruise which apparently had encountered every form of adventure from the rescuing of a stranded operacompany to the ramming of a slavers dhow the regret with which he spoke of these free days which was the regret of an exile marooned upon a desert island excited all her sympathy for an ill she had never known his discourteous scorn of the social pleasures of the post from which she herself was excluded rilled her with speculation if he could forego these functions how full and gay she argued his former life must have been his attitude helped her to bear the deprivations more easily and she as a loyal child of the army liked him also because he was no crackerbox captain but a fighter who had fought with no morbid ideas as to the rights or wrongs of the cause but for the fun of fighting and one night after he had been telling the mess of a filipino officer who alone had held back his men and himself and who at last died in his arms cursing him she went to sleep declaring to herself that lieutenant ranson was becoming too like the man she had pictured for her husband than was good for her peace of mind he had told the story as his tribute to a brave man fighting for his independence and with such regret that such a one should have died so miserably that to the embarrassment of the mess the tears rolled down his cheeks but he wiped them away with his napkin as unconcernedly as though they were caused by the pepperbox and said simply he had sporting blood he had ive never felt so bad about anything as i did about that chap whenever i think of him standing up there with his back to the cathedral all shot to pieces but giving us what for until he died it makes me cry so he added blowing his nose vigorously i wont think of it any more tears are properly a womans weapon and when a man makes use of them even in spite of himself he is taking an advantage over the other sex which is unfair and outrageous lieutenant ranson never knew the mischief the sympathy he had shown for his enemy caused in the heart of mary cahill nor that from that moment she loved him deeply the west point graduates before they answered ransons ultimatum smoked their cigarettes for some time in silence oh theres been fighting even at fort crockett said crosby in the last two years the men have been ordered out seven times havent they miss cahill when the indians got out of hand and twice after cowboys and twice after the red rider the red rider protested ranson i dont see anything exciting in rounding up one miserable horse thief only they dont round him up returned curtis crossly thats why its exciting hes the best in his business hes held up the stage six times now in a year whoever the fellow is if hes one man or a gang of men hes the nerviest roadagent since the days of abe case ranson in his then present mood was inclined toward pessimism it doesnt take any nerve to hold up a coach he contradicted curtis and crosby snorted in chorus thats what you say mocked curtis well it doesnt repeated ranson its all a game of bluff the etiquette is that the driver mustnt shoot the roadagent and that the roadagent mustnt hurt the driver and the passengers are too scared to move the moment they see a man rise out of the night they throw up their hands why even when a passenger does try to pull his gun the others wont let him each thinks sure that if theres any firing he will be the one to get hurt and besides they dont know how many more men the road agent may have behind him i dont a movement on the part of miss cahill caused him to pause abruptly miss cahill had descended from her throne and was advancing to meet the posttrader who came toward her from the exchange lightfoots squaw he said her babys worse shes sent for you miss cahill gave a gasp of sympathy snatched up her hat from the counter and the buffalo robes closed behind her ranson stooped and reached for his sombrero with the flight of miss cahill his interest in the courage of the red rider had departed also but crosby appealed to the newcomer cahill you know he said weve been talking of the man they call the red rider the chap that wears a red bandanna over his face ranson says he hasnt any nerve thats not so is it i said it didnt take any nerve to hold up a stage said ranson and it doesnt the posttrader halted on his way back to the exchange and rubbed one hand meditatively over the other arm with him speech was golden and difficult after a pause he said oh he takes his chances of course he does cried crosby encouragingly he takes the chance of being shot by the passengers and of being caught by the posse and lynched but this mans got away with it now six times in the last year and i say that takes nerve why for fifty dollars laughed ranson he checked himself and glanced over his shoulder at the retreating figure of cahill the buffalo robes fell again and the spurs of the posttrader could be heard jangling over the earthfloor of the exchange for fifty dollars repeated ranson in brisk businesslike tones ill rob the up stage tonight myself previous knowledge of his moods the sudden look of mischief in his eyes and a certain vibration in his voice caused the two lieutenants to jump simultaneously to their feet ranson they shouted ranson laughed mockingly oh im bored to death he cried what will you bet i dont he had risen with them but without waiting for their answer ran to where his horse stood at the open door he sank on his knees and began tugging violently at the stirrupstraps the two officers their eyes filled with concern pursued him across the room with cahill twenty feet away they dared not raise their voices but in pantomime they beckoned him vigorously to return ranson came at once flushed and smiling holding a hooded armystirrup in each hand never do to have them see these he said he threw the stirrups from him behind the row of hogsheads ill ride in the stirrupstraps he still spoke in the same low brisk tone crosby seized him savagely by the arm no you wont he hissed look here ranson listen to me for heavens sake dont be an ass theyll shoot you youll be killed and courtmartialed panted curtis youll go to leavenworth for the rest of your life ranson threw off the detaining hand and ran behind the counter from a lower shelf he snatched a red bandanna kerchief from another he dragged a rubber poncho and buttoned it high about his throat he picked up the steel shears which lay upon the counter and snipping two holes in the red kerchief stuck it under the brim of his sombrero it fell before his face like a curtain from his neck to his knees the poncho concealed his figure all that was visible of him was his eyes laughing through the holes in the red mask behold the red rider he groaned hold up your hands he pulled the kerchief from his face and threw the poncho over his arm do you see these shears he whispered im going to hold up the stage with em no one ever fires at a road agent they just shout dont shoot colonel and ill come down im going to bring em down with these shears crosby caught curtis by the arm laughing eagerly come to the stables quick he cried well get twenty troopers after him before he can go a half mile he turned on ranson with a triumphant chuckle youll not be dismissed this regiment if i can help it he cried ranson gave an ugly laugh like the snarl of a puppy over his bone if you try to follow me or interfere with me lieutenant crosby he said ill shoot you and your troopers with a pair of shears jeered crosby no with the gun ive got in my pocket now you listen to me im not going to use that gun on any stage filled with women driven by a man seventy years old but and i mean it if you try to stop me ill use it on you im going to show you how anyone can bluff a stage full with a pair of tin shears and a red mask for a kicker and ill shoot the man that tries to stop me ranson sprang to his horses side and stuck his toe into the empty stirrupstrap there was a scattering of pebbles a scurry of hoofs and the horse and rider became a gray blot in the moonlight the two lieutenants stood irresolute under his breath crosby was swearing fiercely curtis stood staring out of the open door will he do it he asked of course hell do it curtis crossed the room and dropped into a chair and what what had we better do he asked for some time the other made no answer his brows were knit and he tramped the room scowling at the floor then with an exclamation of alarm he stepped lightly to the door of the exchange and threw back the curtain in the other room cahill stood at its furthest corner scooping sugar from a hogshead crosbys scowl relaxed and reseating himself at the table he rolled a cigarette now if he pulls it off he whispered and gets back to quarters then its a case of alls well but if hes shot or caught and it all comes out then its up to us to prove he meant it as a practical joke it isnt our duty to report it now is it asked curtis nervously certainly not if he chooses to make an ass of himself thats none of our business unless hes found out we have heard nothing and seen nothing if hes caught then weve got to stick by him and testify that he did it on a bet hell probably win out all right there is nobody expected on the stage but that miss post and her aunt and the drivers an old hand he knows better than to fight there may be some cowboys coming up thats ransons lookout as cahill says the red rider takes his chances i wish there was something we could do now curtis protested petulantly i suppose weve just got to sit still and wait for him thats all answered crosby and then leaped to his feet whats that he asked out on the parade ground a buglecall broke suddenly on the soft spring air it rang like an alarm the noise of a man running swiftly sounded on the path and before the officers reached the doorway sergeant clancey entered it and halted at attention the colonels orders panted the sergeant and the lieutenants are to take twenty men from g and h troops and ride to kiowa to escort the paymaster the paymaster crosby cried hes not coming till thursday hes just telegraphed from kiowa city lieutenant hes ahead of his schedule he wants an escort for the money he left kiowa a few minutes ago in the up stage the two lieutenants sprang forward and shouted in chorus the stage he is in the stage sergeant clancey stared dubiously from one officer to the other he misunderstood their alarm and with the privilege of long service attempted to allay it the lieutenant knows nothing can happen to the stage till it reaches the buttes he said there has never been a holdup in the open and the escort can reach the buttes long before the stage gets here he coughed consciously colonels orders are to gallop lieutenant as the two officers rode knee to knee through the night the pay escort pounding the trail behind them crosby leaned from his saddle he has only ten minutes start of us he whispered we are certain to overtake him we cant help but do it we must do it we must if we dont and he tries to stop colonel patten and the payroll hell die two women and a deaf driver that thats a joke but an indian fighter like old patten and uncle sams money that means a finish fightand his death and disgrace he turned savagely in his saddle close up there he commanded stop that talking you keep your breath till i want it and ride hard after the officers had galloped away from the messroom and sergeant clancey had hurried after them to the stables the posttrader entered it from the exchange and barred the door which they in their haste had left open as he did this the close observer had one been present might have noted that though his movements were now alert and eager they no longer were betrayed by any sound and that his spurs had ceased to jangle yet that he purposed to ride abroad was evident from the fact that from a far corner he dragged out a heavy saddle he flung this upon the counter and swiftly stripped it of its stirrups these with more than necessary care he hid away upon the highest shelf of the shop while from the lower shelves he snatched a rubber poncho and a red kerchief for a moment as he unbarred the door the posttrader paused and cast a quick glance before and behind him and then the door closed and there was silence a minute later it was broken by the hoofs of a horse galloping swiftly along the trail to kiowa city part ii that winter miss post had been going out a great deal more than was good for her and when the spring came she broke down the family doctor recommended aiken but an aunt of miss posts mrs truesdall had been at farmington with mrs colonel bolland and urged visiting her instead the doctor agreed that the climatic conditions existing at fort crockett were quite as healthgiving as those at aiken and of the two the invalid decided that the regimental post would be more of a novelty so she and her aunt and the maid changed cars twice after leaving st louis and then staged it to kiowa city where while waiting for pop hendersons coach to fort crockett they dined with him on bacon fried bread and alkali water tinged with coffee it was at kiowa city a city of four hundred houses on blueprint paper and six on earth that miss post first felt certain that she was going to enjoy her visit it was there she first saw at large and on his native heath a blanket indian he was a tall beautiful youth with yellow ochre on his thin brown arms and blue ochre on his cheekbones who sat on pops steps gazing impassively at the stars miss post came out with her maid and fell over him the maid screamed miss post said i beg your pardon and the brave expressed his contempt by gutteral mutterings and by moving haughtily away miss post was then glad that she had not gone to aiken for the twelvemile drive through the moonlit buttes to fort crockett there was besides the women one other passenger he was a travelling salesman of the hancock uniform company and was visiting fort crockett to measure the officers for their summer tunics at dinner he passed miss post the condensed milkcan and in other ways made himself agreeable he informed her aunt that he was in the military equipment department of the army but much to that young womans distress addressed most of his remarks to the maid who to his taste was the most attractive of the three i take it he said genially to miss post that you and the young lady are sisters no said miss post we are not related it was eight oclock and the moon was full in the heavens when pop henderson hoisted them into the stage and burdened his driver hunk smith with words of advice which were intended solely for the ears of the passengers you want to be careful of that near wheeler hunk he said or hell upset you into a gully an in crossing the second ford bear to the right the waters running high and it may carry youse all down stream i dont want that these ladies should be drowned in any stage of mine an if the red rider jumps you dont put up no bluff but sit still the paymasters due in a night or two an ive no doubt at all but that the riders laying for him but if you tell him that theres no one inside but womenfolk and a tailor mebbe he wont hurt youse now ladies he added putting his head under the leather flap as though unconscious that all he had said had already reached them without wishing to make you uneasy i would advise your having your cash and jewelry ready in your hands with roadagents its mostly wisest to do what they say an to do it quick ef you give em all youve got they sometimes go away without spilling blood though such being their habits naturally disappointed he turned his face toward the shrinking figure of the military tailor you being an army man he said will of course want to protect the ladies but you mustnt do it you must keep cool ef you pull your gun like as not youll all get killed but im hoping for the best goodnight all an a pleasant journey the stage moved off with many creaks and many cracks of the whip which in part smothered hunk smiths laughter but after the first mile he being a man with feelings and a family pulled the mules to a halt the voice of the drummer could instantly be heard calling loudly from the darkness of the stage dont open those flaps if they see us theyll fire i wanted you folks to know said hunk smith leaning from the boxseat that that talk of pops was all foolishness youre as safe on this trail as in a pullman palacecar that was just his way pop will have his joke you just go to sleep now if you can and trust to me ill get you there by eleven oclock or break a trace breakin a trace is all the danger there is anyway he added cheerfully so dont fret miss post could not resist saying to mrs truesdall i told you he was joking the stage had proceeded for two hours sometimes it dropped with locked wheels down sheer walls of clay again it was dragged careening drunkenly out of fathomless pits it pitched and tossed slid and galloped danced grotesquely from one wheel to another from one stone to another recoiled out of ruts butted against rocks and swept down and out of swollen streams that gurgled between the spokes if ever i leave fort crockett gasped mrs truesdall between jolts i shall either wait until they build a railroad or walk they had all but left the hills and were approaching the level prairie that they might see the better the flaps had been rolled up and the soft dry air came freely through the open sides the mules were straining over the last hill on either side only a few of the buttes were still visible they stood out in the moonlight as cleanly cut as the bows of great battleships the trail at last was level mrs truesdalls eyes closed her head fell forward but miss post weary as she was in body could not sleep to her the nightride was full of strange and wonderful mysteries gratefully she drank in the dry scent of the prairiegrass and holding by the frame of the window leaned far out over the wheel as she did so a man sprang into the trail from behind a wall of rock and shouted hoarsely he was covered to his knees with a black mantle his face was hidden by a bloodred mask throw up your hands he commanded there was a sharp creaking as the brakes locked and from the drivers seat an amazed oath the stage stopped with a violent jerk and mrs truesdall pitched gently forward toward her niece i really believe i was asleep helen she murmured what are we waiting for i think we are held up said miss post the stage had halted beyond the wall of rock and miss post looked behind it but no other men were visible only a horse with his bridle drawn around a stone the man in the mask advanced upon the stage holding a weapon at armslength in the moonlight it flashed and glittered evilly the man was but a few feet from miss post and the light fell full upon her of him she could see only two black eyes that flashed as evilly as his weapon for a period of suspense which seemed cruelly prolonged the man stood motionless then he lowered his weapon when he opened his lips the mask stuck to them and his words came from behind it broken and smothered sorry to trouble you miss the mask said but i want that man beside you to get out miss post turned to the travelling salesman he wants you to get out she said wants me exclaimed the drummer im not armed you know in a louder voice he protested faintly i say im not armed come out demanded the mask the drummer precipitated himself violently over the knees of the ladies into the road below and held his hands high above him im not armed he said indeed im not stand over there with your back to that rock the mask ordered for a moment the road agent regarded him darkly pointing his weapon meditatively at different parts of the salesmans person he suggested a butcher designating certain choice cuts the drummers muscles jerked under the torture as though his anatomy were being prodded with an awl i want your watch said the mask the drummer reached eagerly for his waistcoat hold up your hands roared the road agent by the eternal if you play any roughhouse tricks on me ill he flourished his weapon until it flashed luminously an exclamation from hunk smith opportunely uttered saved the drummer from what was apparently instant annihilation say rider cried the driver i cant hold my arms up no longer im going to put em down but you leave me alone an ill leave you alone is that a bargain the shrouded figure whirled his weapon upon the speaker have i ever stopped you before hunk he demanded hunk at this recognition of himself as a public character softened instantly i dunno whether twas you or one of your gang but well youve still got your health havent you yes then keep quiet snarled the mask in retort hunk smith muttered audible threatenings but sank obediently into an inert heap only his eyes under cover of his sombrero roamed restlessly they noted the mcclellan saddle on the red riders horse the white patch on its near forefoot the empty stirrupstraps and at a great distance so great that the eyes only of a plainsman could have detected it a cloud of dust or smoke or mist that rode above the trail and seemed to be moving swiftly down upon them at the sight hunk shifted the tobacco in his cheek and nervously crossed his knees while a grin of ineffable cunning passed across his face with his sombrero in his hand the red rider stepped to the wheel of the stage as he did so miss post observed that above the line of his kerchief his hair was evenly and carefully parted in the middle im afraid ladies said the road agent that i have delayed you unnecessarily it seems that i have called up the wrong number he emitted a reassuring chuckle and fanning himself with his sombrero continued speaking in a tone of polite irony the wells fargo messenger is the party i am laying for hes coming over this trail with a package of diamonds thats what im after at first i thought fighting bob over there by the rock might have it on him but he doesnt act like any wells fargo express agent i have ever tackled before and i guess the laughs on me i seem to have been weeping over the wrong grave he replaced his sombrero on his head at a rakish angle and waved his hand ladies you are at liberty to proceed but instantly he stepped forward again and brought his face so close to the window that they could see the whites of his eyes before we part he murmured persuasively you wouldnt mind leaving me something as a souvenir would you he turned the skulllike openings of the mask full upon miss post mrs truesdall exclaimed hysterically why certainly not she cried heres everything i have except whats sewn inside my waist where i cant possibly get at it i assure you i cannot the proprietor of that hotel told us wed probably meet you and so i have everything ready she thrust her two hands through the window they held a roll of bills a watch and her rings miss post laughed in an ecstasy of merriment oh no aunt she protested dont no not at all the gentleman only wants a keepsake something to remember us by isnt that it she asked she regarded the bloodred mask steadily with a brilliant smile the road agent did not at once answer at her words he had started back with such sharp suspicion that one might have thought he meditated instant flight through the holes in his mask he now glared searchingly at miss post but still in silence i think this will satisfy him said miss post out of the collection in her aunts hands she picked a silver coin and held it forward something to keep as a pocketpiece she said mockingly to remind you of your kindness to three lone females in distress still silent the road agent reached for the money and then growled at her in a tone which had suddenly become gruff and overbearing it suggested to miss post the voice of the head of the family playing santa claus for the children and now you miss he demanded miss post took another coin from the heap studied its inscription and passed it through the window this one is from me she said mine is dated the moonlight she added leaning far forward and smiling out at him makes it quite easy to see the date as easy she went on picking her words as it is to see your peculiar revolver and the coatofarms on your ring she drew her head back goodnight she cooed sweetly the red rider jumped from the door an exclamation which might have been a laugh or an oath was smothered by his mask he turned swiftly upon the salesman get back into the coach he commanded and you hunk he called if you send a posse after me next night i ketch you out here alone youll lose the top of your head the salesman scrambled into the stage through the door opposite the one at which the red rider was standing and the road agent again raised his sombrero with a sweeping gesture worthy of dartagnan goodnight ladies he said goodnight sir mrs truesdall answered grimly but exuding a relieved sigh then her indignation giving her courage she leaned from the window and hurled a parthian arrow i must say she protested i think you might be in a better business the road agent waved his hand to the young lady goodby he said au revoir said miss post pleasantly goodby miss stammered the road agent i said au revoir repeated miss post the road agent apparently routed by these simple words fled muttering toward his horse hunk smith was having trouble with his brake he kicked at it and stooping pulled at it but the wheels did not move mrs truesdall fell into a fresh panic what is it now she called miserably before he answered hunk smith threw a quick glance toward the column of moving dust he was apparently reassured the brake he grunted the darned things stuck the road agent was tugging at the stone beneath which he had slipped his bridle can i help he asked politely but before he reached the stage he suddenly stopped with an imperative sweep of his arm for silence he stood motionless his body bent to the ground leaning forward and staring down the trail then he sprang upright you old fox he roared youre gaining time are you with a laugh he tore free his bridle and threw himself across his horse his legs locked under it his hands clasped its mane and with a cowboy yell he dashed past the stage in the direction of kiowa city his voice floating back in shouts of jeering laughter from behind him he heard hunk smiths voice answering his own in a cry for help and from a rapidly decreasing distance the throb of many hoofs for an instant he drew upon his rein and then with a defiant chuckle drove his spurs deep into his horses side mrs truesdall also heard the pounding of many hoofs as well as hunk smiths howls for help and feared a fresh attack oh what is it she begged soldiers from the fort hunk called excitedly and again raised his voice in a long dismal howl sounds cheery doesnt it said the salesman referring to the soldiers he explained it was his first coherent remark since the red rider had appeared and disappeared oh i hope they wont began miss post anxiously the hoofbeats changed to thunder and with the pounding on the dry trail came the jangle of stirrups and slingbelts then a voice and the coach was surrounded by dustcovered troopers and horses breathing heavily lieutenant crosby pulled up beside the window of the stage are you there colonel patten he panted he peered forward into the stage but no one answered him is the paymaster in here he demanded the voice of lieutenant curtis shouted in turn at hunk smith is the paymaster in there driver paymaster no hunk roared a drummer and three ladies weve been held up the red rider he rose and waved his whip over the top of the coach he went that way you can ketch him easy sergeant clancey and half a dozen troopers jerked at their bridles but crosby at the window shouted halt whats your name he demanded of the salesman myers stammered the drummer im from the hancock uniform curtis had spurred his horse beside that of his brother officer is colonel patten at kiowa he interrupted i cant give you any information as to that replied mr myers importantly but these ladies and i have just been held up by the red rider if youll hurry youll the two officers pulled back their horses from the stage and leaning from their saddles consulted in eager whispers their men fidgeted with their reins and stared with amazed eyes at their officers lieutenant crosby was openly smiling hes got away with it he whispered patten missed the stage thank god and hes met nothing worse than these women we must make a bluff at following him whispered curtis certainly not our orders are to report to colonel patten and act as his escort but hes not at kiowa that fellow says so he telegraphed the colonel from kiowa returned crosby how could he do that if he wasnt there he turned upon hunk smith when did you leave hendersons he demanded seven oclock answered hunk smith sulkily say if you young fellows want to catch and patten telegraphed at eight cried crosby thats it he reached kiowa after the stage had gone sergeant clancey he called the sergeant pushed out from the mass of wondering troopers when did the paymaster say he was leaving kiowa leaving at once the telegram said answered clancey meet me with escort before i reach the buttes thats the message i was told to give the lieutenant hunk smith leaned from the boxseat mebbe pops driving him over himself in the buckboard he volunteered pop often takes em over that way if they miss the stage thats how it is of course cried crosby hes on his way now in the buckboard hunk smith surveyed the troopers dismally and shook his head if he runs up against the red rider its goodby your pay boys he cried fall in there shouted crosby corporal tynan fall out with two men and escort these ladies to the fort he touched his hat to miss post and with curtis at his side sprang into the trail gallop march he commanded do you think hell tackle the buckboard too whispered curtis crosby laughed joyously and drew a long breath of relief no hes all right now he answered dont you see he doesnt know about patten or the buckboard hes probably well on his way to the post now i delayed the game at the stage there on purpose to give him a good start hes safe by now it was a close call laughed the other hes got to give us a dinner for helping him out of this wed have caught him redhanded said crosby if wed been five minutes sooner lord he gasped it makes me cold to think of it the men would have shot him off his horse but what a story for those women i hope ill be there when they tell it if ranson can keep his face straight hes a wonder for some moments they raced silently neck by neck and then curtis again leaned from his saddle i hope he has turned back to the post he said look at the men how theyre keeping watch for him theyre scouts all of them what if they are returned crosby easily ransons in uniform out for a moonlight canter you can bet a million dollars he didnt wear his red mask long after he heard us coming i suppose hell think weve followed to spoil his fun you know you said we would yes he was going to shoot us laughed crosby i wonder why he packs a gun its a silly thing to do the officers fell apart again and there was silence over the prairie save for the creaking of leather and the beat of the hoofs and then faint and far away there came the quick crack of a revolver another and then a fusillade my god gasped crosby he threw himself forwards digging his spurs into his horse and rode as though he were trying to escape from his own men no one issued an order no one looked a question each officer and enlisted man bowed his head and raced to be the first the trail was barricaded by two struggling horses and an overturned buckboard the rigid figure of a man lay flat upon his back staring at the moon another whitehaired figure staggered forward from a rock who goes there it demanded united states troops is that you colonel patten yes colonel pattens right arm was swinging limply at his side with his left hand he clasped his right shoulder the blood black in the moonlight was oozing between his fingers we were held up he said he shot the driver and the horses i fired at him but he broke my arm he shot the gun out of my hand when he reached for the satchel i tried to beat him off with my left arm but he threw me into the road he went that way toward kiowa sergeant clancey who was kneeling by the figure in the trail raised his hand in salute pop henderson lieutenant he said hes shot through the heart hes dead he took the money ten thousand dollars cried colonel patten he wore a red mask and a rubber poncho and i saw that he had no stirrups in his stirrupstraps crosby dodged as though someone had thrown a knife and then raised his hand stiffly and heavily lieutenant curtis you will remain here with colonel patten he ordered his voice was without emotion it fell flat and dead deploy as skirmishers he commanded g troop to the fight of the trail h troop to the left stop anyone you see anyone if he tries to escape cry halt twice and then fire to kill forward gallop march toward the post no shouted colonel patten he went toward kiowa crosby replied in the same dead voice he doubled after he left you colonel he has gone to the post colonel patten struggled from the supporting arms that held him and leaned eagerly forward you know him then he demanded yes cried crosby god help him spread out there you in open order and ride like hell just before the officers club closed for the night lieutenant ranson came in and seating himself at the piano picked out the queen of the philippine islands with one finger major stickney and others who were playing bridge were considerably annoyed ranson then demanded that everyone present should drink his health in champagne for the reason that it was his birthday and that he was glad he was alive and wished everyone else to feel the same way about it or for any other reason why he added generously this frontal attack upon the whistplayers upset the game entirely and ranson enthroned upon the pianostool addressed the room he held up a buckskin tobaccobag decorated with beads i got this down at the indian village tonight he said that old squaw red wing makes em for two dollars crosby paid five dollars for his in new mexico and it isnt half as good what do you think i got lost coming back and went all the way round by the buttes before i found the trail and ive only been here six months they certainly ought to make me chief of scouts there was the polite laugh which is granted to any remark made by the one who is paying for the champagne oh thats where you were was it said the postadjutant genially the colonel sent clancey after you and crosby clancey reported that he couldnt find you so we sent curtis they went to act as escort for colonel patten and the pay hes coming up tonight in the stage ranson was gazing down into his glass before he raised his head he picked several pieces of ice out of it and then drained it the paymaster hey he said hes in the stage tonight is he yes said the adjutant and then as the bugle and stamp of hoofs sounded from the parade outside and thats him now i guess he added ranson refilled his glass with infinite care and then in spite of a smile that twitched at the corners of his mouth emptied it slowly there was the jingle of spurs and a measured tramp on the veranda of the clubhouse and for the first time in its history four enlisted men carrying their krags invaded its portals they were led by lieutenant crosby his face was white under the tan and full of suffering the officers in the room received the intrusion in amazed silence crosby strode among them looking neither to the left nor right and touched lieutenant ranson upon the shoulder the colonels orders lieutenant ranson he said you are under arrest ranson leaned back against the musicrack and placed his glass upon the keyboard one leg was crossed over the other and he did not remove it then you cant take a joke he said in a low tone you had to run and tell he laughed and raised his voice so that all in the club might hear what am i arrested for crosby he asked the lines in crosbys face deepened and only those who sat near could hear him you are under arrest for attempting to kill a superior officer for the robbery of the government paytrain and for murder ranson jumped to his feet my god crosby he cried silence dont talk ordered crosby come along with me the four troopers fell in in rear of lieutenant crosby and their prisoner he drew a quick frightened breath and then throwing back his shoulders fell into step and the six men tramped from the club and out into the night part iii that night at the post there was little sleep for any one the feet of hurrying orderlies beat upon the paradeground the windows of the officers club blazed defiantly and from the darkened quarters of the enlisted men came the sound of voices snarling in violent vituperation at midnight half of ransons troop having attacked the rest of the regiment with cavalryboots were marched under arrest to the guardhouse as they passed ransons hut where he still paced the veranda a burning cigarette attesting his wakefulness they cheered him riotously at two oclock it was announced from the hospital that both patients were out of danger for it had developed that in his hurried diagnosis sergeant clancey had located hendersons heart six inches from where it should have been when one of the men who guarded ranson reported this good news the prisoner said still i hope theyll hang whoever did it they shouldnt hang a man for being a good shot and let him off because hes a bad one at the time of the holdup mary cahill had been a halfmile distant from the post at the camp of the kiowas where she had gone in answer to the cry of lightfoots squaw when she returned she found indian pete in charge of the exchange her father he told her had ridden to the indian village in search of her as he spoke the posttrader appeared im sorry i missed you his daughter called to him at the sound cahill pulled his horse sharply toward the corral i had a horsedeal on with the chief he answered over his shoulder when i got to lightfoots tent you had gone after he had dismounted and was coming toward her she noted that his right hand was bound in a handkerchief and exclaimed with apprehension it is nothing cahill protested i was foolin with one of the new regulation revolvers with my hand over the muzzle ball went through the palm miss cahill gave a tremulous cry and caught the injured hand to her lips her father snatched it from her roughly let go he growled it serves me right a few minutes later mary cahill bearing liniment for her fathers hand knocked at his bedroom and found it empty when she peered from the top of the stairs into the shopwindow below she saw him busily engaged with his one hand buckling the stirrupstraps of his saddle when she called he sprang upright with an oath he had faced her so suddenly that it sounded as though he had sworn not in surprise but at her you startled me he murmured his eyes glanced suspiciously from her to the saddle these stirrupstraps theyre too short he announced pete or somebodys been using my saddle i came to bring you this firstaid bandage for your hand said his daughter cahill gave a shrug of impatience my hands all right he said you go to bed ive got to begin taking account of stock tonight theres no time by day go to bed for nearly an hour miss cahill lay awake listening to her father moving about in the shop below never before had he spoken roughly to her and she knowing how much the thought that he had done so would distress him was herself distressed in his lonely vigil on the veranda ranson looked from the post down the hill to where the light still shone from mary cahills window he wondered if she had heard the news and if it were any thought of him that kept sleep from her you ass you idiot he muttered youve worried and troubled her she believes one of her precious army is a thief and a murderer he cursed himself picturesquely but the thought that she might possibly be concerned on his account did not he found distress him as greatly as it should on the contrary as he watched the light his heart glowed warmly and long after the light went out he still looked toward the home of the posttrader his brain filled with thoughts of his return to his former life outside the army the old life to which he vowed he would not return alone the next morning miss cahill learned the news when the junior officer came to mess and explained why ranson was not with them her only comment was to at once start for his quarters with his breakfast in a basket she could have sent it by pete but she argued when one of her officers was in trouble that was not the time to turn him over to the mercies of a servant no she assured herself it was not because the officer happened to be ranson she would have done as much or as little for any one of them when curtis and haines were ill of the grippe had she not carried them many good things of her own making but it was not an easy sacrifice as she crossed the paradeground she recognized that overnight ransons hut where he was a prisoner in his own quarters had become to the post the stormcentre of interest and to approach it was to invite the attention of the garrison at headquarters a group of officers turned and looked her way there was a flutter among the frocks on mrs bollands porch and the enlisted men smoking their pipes on the rail of the barracks whispered together when she reached ransons hut over four hundred pairs of eyes were upon her and her cheeks were flushing ranson came leaping to the gate and lifted the basket from her arm as though he were removing an operacloak he set it upon the gatepost and nervously clasped the palings of the gate with both hands he had not been to bed but that fact alone could not explain the strangeness of his manner never before had she seen him disconcerted or abashed you shouldnt have done it he stammered indeed indeed you are much too good but you shouldnt have come his voice shook slightly why not asked mary cahill i couldnt let you go hungry you know it isnt that he said its your coming here at all why only three of the fellows have been near me this morning and they only came from a sense of duty i know they did i could feel it you shouldnt have come here im not a proper person im an outlaw you might think this was a pesthouse you might think i was a leper why those stickney girls have been watching me all morning through a fieldglass he clasped and unclasped his fingers around the palings they believe i did it he protested with the bewildered accents of a child they all believe it miss cahill laughed the laugh was quieting and comforting it brought him nearer to earth and her next remark brought him still further have you had any breakfast she asked breakfast stammered ranson no the guard brought some but i couldnt eat it this thing has taken the life out of me to think sane sensible people my own people could believe that id steal that id kill a man for money yes i know said miss cahill soothingly but youve not had any sleep and you need your coffee she lifted the lid of the basket its getting cold she said dont you worry about what people think you must remember youre a prisoner now under arrest you cant expect the officers to run over here as freely as they used to what do you want she laughed do you think the colonel should parade the band and give you a serenade for a moment ranson stared at her dully and then his sense of proportion returned to him he threw back his head and laughed with her joyfully from verandas barracks and headquarters the four hundred pairs of eyes noted this evidence of heartlessness with varied emotions but unmindful of them ranson now leaned forward the eager searching look coming back into his black eyes they were so close to mary cahills that she drew away he dropped his voice to a whisper and spoke swiftly miss cahill whatever happens to me i wont forget this i wont forget your coming here and throwing heart into me you were the only one who did i havent asked you if you believe that i she raised her eyes reproachfully and smiled you know you dont have to do that she said the prisoner seized the palings as though he meant to pull apart the barrier between them he drew a long breath like one inhaling a draught of clean morning air no he said his voice ringing i dont have to do that he cast a swift glance to the left and right the sentrys bayonet was just disappearing behind the corner of the hut to the four hundred other eyes around the paradeground lieutenant ransons attitude suggested that he was explaining to cahills daughter what he wanted for his luncheon his eyes held her as firmly as though the palings he clasped were her two hands mary he said and the speaking of her name seemed to stop the beating of his heart mary he whispered as softly as though he were beginning a prayer youre the bravest the sweetest the dearest girl in all the world and ive known it for months and now you must know and therell never be any other girl in my life but you mary cahill drew away from him in doubt and wonder i didnt mean to tell you just yet he whispered but now that ive seen you i cant help it i knew it last night when i stood back there and watched your windows and couldnt think of this trouble nor of anything else but just you and youve got to promise me if i get out of this all right you must must promise me mary cahills eyes as she raised them to his were moist and glowing they promised him with a great love and tenderness but at the sight ranson protested wildly no he whispered you mustnt promise anything i shouldnt have asked it after im out of this after the courtmartial then youve got to promise that youll never never leave me miss cahill knit her hands together and turned away her head the happiness in her heart rose to her throat like a great melody and choked her before her exposed in the thin spring sunshine was the square of ugly brown cottages the bare paradeground in its centre trumpeter tyler fingering his bugle and beyond on every side an ocean of blackened prairie but she saw nothing of this she saw instead a beautiful world opening its arms to her a world smiling with sunshine glowing with color singing with love and content she turned to him with all that was in her heart showing in her face dont he begged tremblingly dont answer i couldnt bear it if you said no to me he jerked his head toward the men who guarded him wait until im tried and not in disgrace he shook the gate between them savagely as though it actually held him a prisoner mary cahill raised her head proudly you have no right youve hurt me she whispered you hurt me hurt you he cried she pressed her hands together it was impossible to tell him it was impossible to speak of what she felt of the pride of the trust and love to disclose this new and wonderful thing while the gate was between them while the sentries paced on either side while the curious eyes of the garrison were fastened upon her oh cant you see she whispered as though i cared for a courtmartial i know you you are just the same you are just what you have always been to me what you always will be to me she thrust her hand toward him and he seized it in both of his and then released it instantly and as though afraid of his own selfcontrol backed hurriedly from her and she turned and walked rapidly away captain carr who had been ransons captain in the philippines and who was much his friend had been appointed to act as his counsel when later that morning he visited his client to lay out a line of defence he found ranson inclined to treat the danger which threatened him with the most arrogant flippancy he had never seen him in a more objectionable mood you can call the charge tommyrot if you like carr protested sharply but let me tell you thats not the view any one else takes of it and if you expect the officers of the courtmartial and the civil authorities to take that view of it youve got to get down to work and help me prove that it is tommy rot that miss post as soon as she got here when she thought it was only a practical joke told them that the road agent threatened her with a pair of shears now crosby and curtis will testify that you took a pair of shears from cahills and from what miss post saw of your ring she can probably identify that too so oh we concede the shears declared ranson waving his hand grandly we admit the first holdup the devil we do returned carr now as your counsel i advise nothing of the sort you advise me to lie sir exclaimed carr a plea of not guilty is only a legal form when you consider that the first holdup in itself is enough to lose you your commission well its my commission said ranson it was only a silly joke anyway and the war department must have some sense of humor or it wouldnt have given me a commission in the first place of course well admit the first holdup but we wont stand for the second one i had no more to do with that than with the whitechapel murders how are we to prove that demanded carr wheres your alibi where were you after the first holdup i was making for home as fast as i could cut said ranson he suddenly stopped in his walk up and down the room and confronted his counsel sternly captain he demanded i wish you to instruct me on a point of law carrs brow relaxed he was relieved to find that ranson had awakened to the seriousness of the charges against him thats what im here for he said encouragingly well captain said ranson if an officer is under arrest as i am and confined to his quarters is he or is he not allowed to send to the club for a bottle of champagne really ranson cried the captain angrily you are impossible i only want to celebrate said ranson meekly im a very happy man im the happiest man on earth i want to ride across the prairie shooting off both guns and yelling like a cowboy instead of which i am locked up indoors and have to talk to you about a highway robbery which does not amuse me which does not concern me and of which i know nothing and care less now you are detailed to prove me innocent thats your duty and you ought to do your duty but dont drag me in ive got much more important things to think about bewilderment rage and despair were written upon the face of the captain ranson he roared is this a pose or are you mad cant you understand that you came very near to being hanged for murder and that you are in great danger of going to jail for theft let me put before you the extremely unpleasant position in which you have been ass enough to place yourself you dont quite seem to grasp it you tell two brotherofficers that you are going to rob the stage to do so you disguise yourself in a poncho and a red handkerchief and you remove the armystirrups from your stirrupleathers you then do rob this coach or at least hold it up and you are recognized a few minutes later in the same trail and in the same direction you have taken there is a second holdup this time of the paymaster the man who robs the paymaster wears a poncho and a red kerchief and he has no stirrups in his stirrupleathers the two holdups take place within a halfmile of each other within five minutes of each other now is it reasonable to believe that last night two men were hiding in the buttes intent upon robbery each in an army poncho each wearing a red bandanna handkerchief and each riding without stirrups between believing in such a strange coincidence and that you did it ill be hanged if i dont believe you did it i dont blame you said ranson what can i do to set your mind at rest well tell me exactly what persons knew that you meant to hold up the stage curtis and crosby no one else not even cahill no cahill came in just before i said i would stop the stage but i remember particularly that before i spoke i waited for him to get back to the exchange and crosby tells me continued carr that the instant you had gone he looked into the exchange and saw cahill at the farthest corner from the door he could have heard nothing if you ask me i think youve begun at the wrong end said ranson if i were looking for the red rider id search for him in kiowa city why because at this end no one but a few officers knew that the paymaster was coming while in kiowa everybody in the town knew it for they saw him start it would be very easy for one of those cowboys to ride ahead and lie in wait for him in the buttes there are several tough specimens in kiowa any one of them would rob a man for twenty dollars let alone ten thousand theres abe fisher and foster king and the chase boys and i believe old pop henderson himself isnt above holding up one of his own stages hes above shooting himself in the lungs said carr nonsense no i am convinced that someone followed you from this post and perhaps cahill can tell us who that was i sent for him this morning and hes waiting at my quarters now suppose i ask him to step over here so that we can discuss it together before he answered ranson hesitated with his eyes on the ground he had no way of knowing whether mary cahill had told her father anything of what he had said to her that morning but if she had done so he did not want to meet cahill in the presence of a third party for the first time since he had learned the news ill tell you what i wish you would do he said i wish youd let me see cahill first by myself what i want to see him about has nothing to do with the holdup he added it concerns only us two but id like to have it out of the way before we consult him as a witness carr rose doubtfully why certainly he said ill send him over and when youre ready for me step out on the porch and call ill be sitting on my veranda i hope youve had no quarrel with cahill i mean i hope this personal matter is nothing that will prejudice him against you ranson smiled i hope not too he said no weve not quarrelledyet he added carr still lingered cahill is like to be a very important witness for the other side i doubt it said ranson easily cahills a closemouthed chap but when he does talk he talks to the point and hell tell the truth that cant hurt us as cahill crossed the paradeground from captain carrs quarters on his way to ransons hut his brain was crowded swiftly with doubts memories and resolves for him the interview held no alarms he had no misgivings as to its outcome for his daughters sake he was determined that he himself must not be disgraced in her eyes and that to that end ranson must be sacrificed it was to make a lady of her as he understood what a lady should be that on six moonlit raids he had ventured forth in his red mask and robbed the kiowa stage that there were others who roamed abroad in the disguise of the red rider he was well aware there were nights the stage was held up when he was innocently busy behind his counter in touch with the whole garrison of these nights he made much they were alibis furnished by his rivals they served to keep suspicion from himself and he working for the same object was indefatigable in proclaiming that all the depredations of the red rider showed the handiwork of one and the same individual he comes from kiowa of course he would point out some feller who lives where the stage starts and knows when the passengers carry money you dont hear of him holding up a stage full of recruits or cowpunchers its always the drummers and the mine directors that the red rider lays for how does he know theyre in the stage if he dont see em start from kiowa ask pop henderson ask abe fisher mebbe they know more than theyd care to tell the money which at different times cahill had taken from the kiowa stage lay in a new york bank and the law of limitation made it now possible for him to return to that city and claim it already his savings were sufficient in amount to support both his daughter and himself in one of those foreign cities of which she had so often told him and for which he knew she hungered and for the last five years he had had no other object in living than to feed her wants through some strange trick of the mind he remembered suddenly and vividly a longforgotten scene in the back room of mcturks when he was mcturks bouncer the night before a girl had killed herself in this same back room she made the third who had done so in the month he recalled the faces of the reporters eyeing mcturk in cold distaste as that terror of the bowery whimpered before them on his knees but my daughters will read it he had begged suppose they believe im what you call me dont go and give me a bad name to them gentlemen it aint my fault the girls died here you wouldnt have my daughters think im to blame for that theyre ladies my daughters theyre just out of the convent and they dont know that there is such women in the world as come to this place and i cant have em turned against their old pop for gods sake gentlemen dont let my girls know cahill remembered the contempt he had felt for his employer as he pulled him to his feet but now mcturks appeal seemed just and natural his point of view was that of the loving and considerate parent in cahills mind there was no moral question involved if to make his girl rich and a lady and to lift her out of the life of the exchange was a sin the sin was his own and he was willing to stand for it and like mcturk he would see that the sin of the father was not visited upon the child ranson was rich foolishly selfishly rich his father was a united states senator with influence enough and money enough to fight the law to buy his son out of jail sooner than his daughter should know that her father was one of those who sometimes wore the mask of the red rider ranson for all he cared could go to jail or to hell with this ultimatum in his mind cahill confronted his wouldbe soninlaw with a calm and assured countenance ranson greeted him with respectful deference and while cahill seated himself ranson chatting hospitably placed cigars and glasses before him he began upon the subject that touched him the most nearly miss cahill was good enough to bring up my breakfast this morning he said has she told you of what i said to her cahill shook his head no i havent seen her weve been taking account of stock all morning then then youve heard nothing from her about me said ranson the post trader raised his head in surprise no captain carr spoke to me about your arrest and then said you wanted to see me first about something private the post trader fixed ranson with his keen unwavering eyes what might that be he asked well it doesnt matter now stammered ranson ill wait until miss cahill tells you any complaint about the food inquired the post trader ranson laughed nervously no its not that he said he rose and to protect what miss cahill evidently wished to remain a secret changed the subject you see youve lived in these parts so long mr cahill he explained and you know so many people i thought maybe you could put me on the track or give me some hint as to which of that kiowa gang really did rob the paymaster ranson was pulling the cork from the whiskey bottle and when he asked the question cahill pushed his glass from him and shook his head ranson looked up interrogatively and smiled you mean you think i did it myself he asked i didnt understand from captain carr the post trader began in heavy tones that its my opinion youre after he said i might be wanted to testify who was present last night in my store certainly thats all we want ranson answered genially i only thought you might give me a friendly pointer or two on the outside and of course if its your opinion i did the deed we certainly dont want your opinion but that neednt prevent your taking a drink with me need it dont be afraid im not trying to corrupt you and im not trying to poison a witness for the other fellows either help yourself cahill stretched out his left hand his right remained hidden in the side pocket of his coat whats the matter with your right hand ranson asked are you holding a gun on me really mr cahill youre not taking any chances are you ranson gazed about the room as though seeking an appreciative audience hes such an important witness he cried delightedly that first hes afraid ill poison him and he wont drink with me and now he covers me with a gun reluctantly cahill drew out his hand i was putting the bridle on my pony last night he said he bit me ranson exclaimed sympathetically oh thats too bad he said well you know you want to be careful a horses teeth really are poisonous he examined his own hands complacently now if i had a bandage like that on my right hand they would hang me sure no matter whether it was a bite or a burn or a bullet cahill raised the glass to his lips and sipped the whiskey critically why he asked why why didnt you know that the paymaster boasted last night to the surgeons that he hit this fellow in the hand he says cahill snorted scornfully howd he know that what makes him think so well never mind let him think so ranson answered fervently dont discourage him thats the only evidence ive got on my side he says he fired to disarm the man and that he saw him shift his gun to his left hand it was the shot that the man fired when he held his gun in his left that broke the colonels arm now everybody knows i cant hit a barn with my left and as for having any wounds concealed about my person ranson turned his hands like a conjurer to show the front and back they can search me so if the paymaster will only stick to that story that he hit the man it will help me a lot ranson seated himself on the table and swung his leg and of course it would be a big help too if you could remember who was in your exchange when i was planning to rob the coach for someone certainly must have overheard me someone must have copied my disguise and that someone is the man we must find unless he came from kiowa cahill shoved his glass from him across the table and placing his hands on his knees stared at his host coldly and defiantly his wouldbe soninlaw observed the aggressiveness of his attitude but in his fuller knowledge of their prospective relations smiled blandly mr ranson began cahill ive no feelings against you personally ive a friendly feeling for all of you young gentlemen at my mess but youre not playing fair with me i can see what you want and i can tell you that you and captain carr are not helping your case by asking me up here to drink and smoke with you when you know that im the most important witness theyve got against you ranson stared at his fatherinlawelect in genuine amazement and then laughed lightly why dear mr cahill he cried i wouldnt think of bribing you with such a bad brand of whiskey as this and i didnt know you were such an important witness as all that but of course i know whatever you say in this community goes and if your testimony is against me im sorry for it very sorry i suppose you will testify that there was no one in the exchange who could have heard my plan cahill nodded and as its not likely two men at exactly the same time should have thought of robbing the stage in exactly the same way i must have robbed it myself cahill nursed his bandaged hand with the other thats the courts business he growled i mean to tell the truth and the truth is asked ransom the truth is that last night there was no one in the exchange but you officers and me if anybodyd come in on the store side youd have seen him wouldnt you and if hed come into the exchange id have seen him but no one come in i was there alone and certainly i didnt hear your plan and i didnt rob the stage when you fellows left i went down to the indian village half the reservation can prove i was there all the evening so of the four of us that lets me out crosby and curtis were in command of the pay escort thats their alibi and as far as i can see lieutenant that puts it up to you ranson laughed and shook his head yes it certainly looks that way he said only i cant see why you need be so damned pleased about it he grinned wickedly if you werent such a respectable member of fort crockett society i might say you listened at the door and rode after me in one of your own ponchos as for the indian village thats no alibi a kiowa swear his skins as white as yours if you give him a drink and is that why i get this one cahill demanded am i a kiowa ranson laughed and shoved the bottle toward his fatherinlawelect oh cant you take a joke he said take another drink then the voice outside the hut was too low to reach the irate cahill but ranson heard it and leaped to his feet wait he commanded he ran to the door and met sergeant clancey at the threshold miss cahill lieutenant said the sergeant wants to see her father cahill had followed ranson to the door you want to see me mame he asked yes miss cahill cried and mr ransom too if i may she caught her father eagerly by the arm but her eyes were turned joyfully upon ranson they were laughing with excitement her voice was trembling and eager it is something i have discovered she cried i found it out just now and i think oh i hope it is most important i believe it will clear mr ranson she cried happily at least it will show that last night someone went out to rob the coach and went dressed as he was cahill gave a short laugh whats his name he asked mockingly have you seen him i didnt see him and i dont know his name but cahill snorted and picked up his sombrero from the table then its not so very important after all he said is that all that brought you here the main thing is that she is here said ranson for which the poor prisoner is grateful grateful to her and to the man she hasnt seen in the mask and poncho whose name she doesnt know mr cahill bad as it is i insist on your finishing your whiskey miss cahill please sit down he moved a chair toward her and as he did so looked full into her face with such love and happiness that she turned her eyes away well asked cahill i must first explain to lieutenant ranson father said his daughter that today is the day we take account of stock speaking of stock said ranson dont forget that i owe you for a red kerchief and a rubber poncho you can have them back if you like i wont need a rain coat where i am going dont said miss cahill please let me go on after i brought you your breakfast here i couldnt begin to work just at once i was thinking about something else everyone was talking of you your arrest and i couldnt settle down to take account of stock she threw a look at ranson which asked for his sympathy but when i did start i began with the ponchos and the red kerchiefs and then i found out something cahill was regarding his daughter in strange distress but ranson appeared indifferent to her words and intent only on the light and beauty in her face but he asked smiling and that was you see continued miss cahill eagerly i always keep a dozen of each article and as each one is sold i check it off in my daybook yesterday mrs bolland bought a poncho for the colonel that left eleven ponchos then a few minutes later i gave lightfoot a red kerchief for his squaw that left eleven kerchiefs stop cried ranson miss cahill he began severely i hope you do not mean to throw suspicion on the wife of my respected colonel or on mrs lightfoot the prairie flower those ladies are my personal friends i refuse to believe them guilty and have you ever seen mrs bolland on horseback you wrong her it is impossible please begged miss cahill please let me explain when you went to hold up the stage you took a poncho and a kerchief that should have left ten of each but when i counted them this morning there were nine red kerchiefs and nine ponchos ranson slapped his knee sharply good he said that is interesting what does it prove demanded cahill it proves nothing or it proves everything said miss cahill to my mind it proves without any doubt that someone overheard mr ransons plan that he dressed like him to throw suspicion on him and that this second person was the one who robbed the paymaster now father this is where you can help us you were there then try to remember it is so important who came into the store after the others had gone away cahill tossed his head like an angry bull there are fifty places in this post he protested roughly where a man can get a poncho every trooper owns his slicker but father we dont know that theirs are missing cried miss cahill and we do know that those in our store are dont think i am foolish it seemed such an important fact to me and i had hoped it would help it does help immensely cried ranson i think its a splendid clue but unfortunately i dont think we can prove anything by your father for hes just been telling me that there was no one in the place but himself no one came in and he was quite alone ranson had begun speaking eagerly but either his own words or the intentness with which cahill received them caused him to halt and hesitate absolutely alone you see said cahill thickly as soon as they had gone i rode to the indian village why no father corrected miss cahill dont you remember you told me last night that when you reached lightfoots tent i had just gone that was quite two hours after the others left the store in her earnestness miss cahill had placed her hand upon her fathers arm and clutched it eagerly and you remember no one coming in before you left she asked no one cahill had not replaced the bandaged hand in his pocket but had shoved it inside the opening of his coat as mary cahill caught his arm her fingers sank into the palm of the hand and he gave a slight grimace of pain oh father miss cahill cried your hand i am so sorry did i hurt it please let me see cahill drew back with sudden violence no he cried leave it alone come we must be going but miss cahill held the wounded hand in both her own when she turned her eyes to ranson they were filled with tender concern i hurt him she said reproachfully he shot himself last night with one of those new cylinder revolvers her father snatched the hand from her he tried to drown her voice by a sudden movement toward the door come he called do you hear me but his daughter in her sympathy continued he was holding it so she said and it went off and the bullet passed through here she laid the tip of a slim white finger on the palm of her right hand the bullet cried ranson he repeated dully the bullet there was a sudden tense silence outside they could hear the crunch of the sentrys heel in the gravel and from the baseball field back of the barracks the soft spring air was rent with the jubilant crack of the bat as it drove the ball afterward ranson remembered that while one half of his brain was terribly acute to the moment the other was wondering whether the runner had made his base it seemed an interminable time before ranson raised his eyes from miss cahills palm to her fathers face what he read in them caused cahill to drop his hand swiftly to his hip ranson saw the gesture and threw out both his hands he gave a hysterical laugh strangely boyish and immature and ran to place himself between cahill and the door drop it he whispered my god man he entreated dont make a fool of yourself mr cahill he cried aloud you cant go till you know can he mary yes mary the tone in which he repeated the name was proprietary and commanding he took her hand mr cahill he said joyously weve got something to tell you i want you to understand that in spite of all ive done i say in spite of all ive done i mean getting into this trouble and disgrace and all that ive dared to ask your daughter to marry me he turned and led miss cahill swiftly toward the veranda oh i knew he wouldnt like it he cried you see i told you so youve got to let me talk to him alone you go outside and wait i can talk better when you are not here ill soon bring him around father pleaded miss cahill timidly from behind her back ranson shook his head at the posttrader in violent pantomime shed better go outside and wait hadnt she mr cahill he directed as he was bidden the posttrader raised his head and nodded toward the door the onslaught of sudden and new conditions overwhelmed and paralyzed him father said miss cahill it isnt just as you think mr ranson did ask me to marry him in a way at least i knew what he meant but i did not say in a way that i would marry him i mean it was not settled or i would have told you you mustnt think i would have left you out of this of my happiness you who have done everything to make me happy she reproached her father with her eyes fastened on his face his own were stern fixed and miserable you will let it be wont you father she begged it it means so much i cant tell you she threw out her hand toward ranson as though designating a superior being why i cant tell him but if you are harsh with him or with me it will break my heart for as i love you father i love him and it has got to be it must be for i love him so i have always loved him father she whispered i love him so ranson humbly gratefully took the girls hand and led her gently to the veranda and closed the door upon her then he came down the room and regarded his prospective fatherinlaw with an expression of amused exasperation he thrust his hands deep into the pockets of his ridingbreeches and nodded his head well he exclaimed youve made a damned pretty mess of it havent you cahill had sunk heavily into a chair and was staring at ranson with the stupid wondering gaze of a dumb animal in pain during the moments in which the two men eyed each other ransons smile disappeared cahill raised himself slowly as though with a great effort i done it said cahill for her i done it to make her happy thats all right said ranson briskly shes going to be happy were all going to be happy an all i did cahill continued as though unconscious of the interruption was to disgrace her he rose suddenly to his feet his mental sufferings were so keen that his huge body trembled he recognized how truly he had made a mess of it he saw that all he had hoped to do for his daughter by crime would have been done for her by this marriage with ranson which would have made her a lady made her rich made her happy had it not been for his midnight raids she would have been honored loved and envied even by the wife of the colonel herself but through him disgrace had come upon her sorrow and trouble she would not be known as the daughter of senator ranson but of cahill an exmember of the whyo gang a highway robber as the daughter of a thief who was serving his time in state prison at the thought cahill stepped backward unsteadily as though he had been struck he cried suddenly aloud then his hand whipped back to his revolver but before he could use it ranson had seized his wrist with both hands the two struggled silently and fiercely the fact of opposition brought back to cahill all of his great strength no you dont ranson muttered think of your daughter man drop it i shall do it cahill panted i am thinking of my daughter its the only way out take your hands off me i shall with his knuckles ranson bored cruelly into the wounded hand and it opened and the gun dropped from it but as it did so it went off with a report that rang through the building there was an instant rush of feet upon the steps of the veranda and at the sound the two men sprang apart eyeing each other sheepishly like two discovered truants when sergeant clancey and the guard pushed through the door ranson stood facing it spinning the revolver in cowboy fashion around his fourth finger he addressed the sergeant in a tone of bitter irony oh youve come at last he demanded are you deaf why didnt you come when i called his tone showed he considered he had just cause for annoyance the gun brought me i began clancey yes i hoped it might thats why i fired it snapped ranson i want two whiskeyandsodas quick now two gasped clancey whiskeyandsodas see how fast one of you can chase over to the club and get em and next time i want a drink dont make me wake the entire garrison as the soldiers retreated ranson discovered miss cahills white face beyond them he ran and held the door open by a few inches its all right he whispered reassuringly hes nearly persuaded wait just a minute longer and hell be giving us his blessing but the pistolshot she asked i was just calling the guard the electric bells broken and your father wanted a drink thats a good sign isnt it shows hes friendly what kind did you say you wanted mr cahill scotch was it or rye ranson glanced back at the sombre silent figure of cahill and then again opened the door sufficiently for him to stick out his head sergeant he called make them both scotch long ones he shut the door and turned upon the posttrader now then fatherinlaw he said briskly youve got to cut and run and youve got to run quick well tell em youre going to fort worth to buy the engagement ring because i cant being under arrest but you go to duncan city instead and from there take the cars to run away cahill repeated dazedly but youll be courtmartialled there wont be any courtmartial cahill glanced around the room quickly i see he cried in his eagerness he was almost smiling im to leave a confession and give it to you confession what rot cried ranson they cant prove anything against me everyone knows by now that there were two men on the trail but they dont know who the other man was and no one ever must know especially mary cahill struck the table with his fist i wont stand for it he cried i got you into this and im goin yes going to jail retorted ranson youll look nice behind the bars wont you your daughter will be proud of you in a striped suit dont talk nonsense youre going to run and hide some place somewhere where mary and i can come and pay you a visit say canada no not canada id rather visit you in jail than in a montreal hotel say tangier or buenos ayres or paris yes paris is safe enough and so amusing cahill seated himself heavily i trapped you into this fix mr ranson he said you know i did and now i mean to get you out of it i aint going to leave the man my mame wants to marry with a cloud on him i aint going to let her husband be jailed ranson had run to his desk and from a drawer drew forth a roll of bills he advanced with them in his hand yes paris is certainly the place he said heres three hundred dollars ill cable you the rest youve never been to paris have you its full of beautiful sights henrys american bar for instance and the courtyard of the grand hotel and maxims all good americans go to paris when they die and all the bad ones while they are alive youll find lots of both kinds and youll sit all day on the sidewalk and drink bock and listen to hungarian bands and mary and i will join you there and take you driving in the bois now you start at once ill tell her youve gone to new york to talk it over with father and buy the ring then ill say youve gone on to paris to rent us apartments for the honeymoon ill explain it somehow thats better than going to jail isnt it and making us bow our heads in grief cahill in his turn approached the desk and seating himself before it began writing rapidly what is it asked ranson a confession said cahill his pen scratching i wont take it ranson said and i wont use it i aint going to give it to you said cahill over his shoulder i know better than that but i dont go to paris unless i leave a confession behind me call in the guard he commanded i want two witnesses ill see you hanged first said ranson cahill crossed the room to the door and throwing it open called corporal of the guard as he spoke captain carr and mrs bolland accompanied by miss post and her aunt were crossing the paradeground for a moment the posttrader surveyed them doubtfully and then stepping out upon the veranda beckoned to them heres a paper ive signed captain he said i wish youd witness my signature its my testimony for the courtmartial then someone else had better sign it said carr might look prejudiced if i did he turned to the ladies these ladies are coming in to see ranson now theyll witness it miss cahill from the other end of the veranda and the visitors entered the room together mrs truesdale cried ranson you are pouring coals of fire upon my head and miss post indeed this is too much honor after the way i threatened and tried to frighten you last night i expected you to hang me at least instead of which you have i trust come to tea nothing of the sort said mrs bolland sternly these ladies insisted on my bringing them here to say how sorry they are that they talked so much and got you into this trouble understand mr ranson the colonels wife added with dignity that i am not here officially as mrs bolland but as a friend of these ladies you are welcome in whatever form you take mrs bolland cried ranson and believe me i am in no trouble no trouble i assure you in fact i am quite the most contented man in the world mrs bolland in spite of the cloud the temporary cloud which rests upon my fair name i take great pride in announcing to you that this young lady has done me the honor to consent to become my wife her father a very old and dear friend has given his consent and i take this occasion to tell you of my good fortune both in your official capacity and as my friend there was a chorus of exclamations and congratulations in which mrs bolland showed herself to be a true wife and a social diplomatist in the posttraders daughter she instantly recognized the heiress to the ranson millions and the daughter of a senator who also was the chairman of the senate committee on brevets and promotions she fell upon miss cahills shoulder and kissed her on both cheeks turning eagerly upon mrs truesdale she said alice you can understand how i feel when i tell you that this child has always been to me like one of my own carr took ransons hand and wrung it sergeant clancey grew purple with pleasure and stole back to the veranda where he whispered joyfully to a sentry in another moment a passing private was seen racing delightedly toward the baseball field at the same moment lieutenants crosby and curtis and the regimental adjutant crossed the parade ground from the colonels quarters and ran up the steps of ransons hut the expressions of goodwill of smiling embarrassment and general satisfaction which lieutenant crosby observed on the countenances of those present seemed to give him a momentary check oh he exclaimed disappointedly someone has told you ranson laughed and took the hand which crosby held doubtfully toward him no one has told me he said ive been telling them then you havent heard crosby cried delightedly thats good i begged to be the first to let you know because i felt so badly at having doubted you you must let me congratulate you you are free free smiled ranson yes relieved from arrest crosby cried joyfully he turned and took ransons sword from the hands of the adjutant and the colonels let your troop have the band to give you a serenade but ransons face showed no sign of satisfaction wait he cried why am i relieved from arrest why because the other fellow has confessed ranson placed himself suddenly in front of mary cahill as though to shield her his eyes stole stealthily towards cahills confession still unread and still unsigned it lay unopened upon the table cahill was gazing upon ranson in blank bewilderment captain carr gasped a sigh of relief that was far from complimentary to his client who confessed he cried pop henderson said crosby pop henderson shouted cahill unmindful of his wound he struck the table savagely with his fist for the first time in the knowledge of the post he exhibited emotion pop henderson by the eternal he cried and i never guessed it yes said crosby eagerly abe fisher was in it henderson persuaded the paymaster to make the trip alone with him then he dressed up fisher to represent the red rider and sent him on ahead to hold him up they were to share the money afterward but fisher fired on pop to kill so as to have it all and pops trying to get even and what with wanting to hurt fisher and thinking he is going to die and not wishing to see you hanged hes told the truth we wired kiowa early this morning and arrested fisher theyve found the money and he has confessed too but the poncho and the red kerchief protested carr and he had no stirrups oh fisher had the makeup all right laughed crosby henderson says fishers the only original red rider and as for the stirrups im afraid thats my fault i asked the colonel if the man wasnt riding without stirrups and i guess the wish was father to the fact he only imagined he hadnt seen any stirrups the colonel was rattled so old man he added turning to ranson heres your sword again and god bless you already the post had learned the news from the band and the verandas of the enlisted men overflowed with delighted troopers from the stables and the ball field came the sound of hurrying feet and a tumult of cheers and cowboy yells across the paradeground the regimental band bore down upon ransons hut proclaiming to the garrison that there would be a hot time in the old town that night but sergeant clancey ran to meet the bandmaster and shouted in his ear hes going to marry mary cahill he cried i heard him tell the colonels wife play just because she made them googoo eyes like hell cried the bandmaster indignantly breaking in on the tune with his baton i know my business now then men he commanded ill leave my happy home for you as mrs bolland dragged miss cahill into view of the assembled troopers ranson pulled his fatherinlaw into a far corner of the room he shook the written confession in his face now will you kindly tell me what that means he demanded what sort of a gallery play were you trying to make cahill shifted his sombrero guiltily i was trying to get you out of the hole he stammered i i thought you done it you thought i done it sure i never thought nothing else then why do you say here that you did it oh because stammered cahill miserably cause of mary cause she wanted to marry you cause you were going to marry her well but what good were you going to do by shooting yourself oh then cahill jerked back his head as though casting out an unpleasant memory i thought youd caught me you too between you caught you then you did no but i tried to i heard your plan and i did follow you in the poncho and kerchief meaning to hold up the stage first and leave it to crosby and curtis to prove you did it but when i reached the coach you were there ahead of me and i rode away and put in my time at the indian village i never saw the paymasters cart never heard of it till this morning but what with mame missing the poncho out of our shop and the wound in my hand i guessed theyd all soon suspect me i saw you did so i thought id just confess to what i meant to do even if i didnt do it ranson surveyed his fatherinlaw with a delighted grin how did you get that bullethole in your hand he asked cahill laughed shamefacedly i hate to tell you that he said i got it just as i said i did my new gun went off while i was fooling with it with my hand over the muzzle and me the best shot in the territory but when i heard the paymaster claimed he shot the red rider through the palm i knew no one would believe me if i told the truth so i lied ranson glanced down at the written confession and then tore it slowly into pieces and you were sure i robbed the stage and yet you believed that id use this what sort of a soninlaw do you think youve got you thought i robbed the stage didnt you yes and you were going to stand for robbing it yourself werent you well thats the sort of soninlaw ive got the two men held out their hands at the same instant mary cahill her face glowing with pride and besieged with blushes came toward them from the veranda she was laughing and radiant but she turned her eyes on ranson with a look of tender reproach why did you desert me she said it was awful they are calling you now they are playing the conquering hero mr cahill commanded ranson go out there and make a speech he turned to mary cahill and lifted one of her hands in both of his well i am the conquering hero he said ive won the only thing worth winning dearest he whispered well run away from them in a minute and well ride to the waterfall and the lovers leap he looked down at her wistfully do you remember mary cahill raised her head and smiled he leaned toward her breathlessly why did it mean that to you too he asked she smiled up at him in assent but i didnt say anything did i whispered ranson i hardly knew you then but i knew that day that i that i would marry you or nobody else and did you think that you yes mary cahill whispered he bent his head and touched her hand with his lips then well go back this morning to the waterfall he said and tell it that its all come right and now well bow to those crazy people out there those makebelieve dreampeople who dont know that there is nothing real in this world but just you and me and that we love each other a dishevelled orderly bearing a tray with two glasses confronted ranson at the door heres the scotch and sodas lieutenant he panted i couldnt get em any sooner the men wanted to take em off me to drink miss cahills health so they shall said ranson tell them to drink the canteen dry and charge it to me whats a little thing like the regulations between friends they have taught me my manners mr cahill he called the posttrader returned from the veranda ranson solemnly handed him a glass and raised the other in the air heres hoping that the red rider rides on his raids no more he said and to the future mrs ranson to mary cahill god bless her he shattered the empty glass in the grate and took cahills hand fatherinlaw said ranson lets promise each other to lead a new and a better life the bar sinister part i the master was walking most unsteady his legs tripping each other after the fifth or sixth round my legs often go the same way but even when the masters legs bend and twist a bit you mustnt think he cant reach you indeed that is the time he kicks most frequent so i kept behind him in the shadow or ran in the middle of the street he stopped at many publichouses with swinging doors those doors that are cut so high from the sidewalk that you can look in under them and see if the master is inside at night when i peep beneath them the man at the counter will see me first and say heres the kid jerry come to take you home get a move on you and the master will stumble out and follow me its lucky for us im so white for no matter how dark the night he can always see me ahead just out of reach of his boot at night the master certainly does see most amazing sometimes he sees two or four of me and walks in a circle so that i have to take him by the leg of his trousers and lead him into the right road one night when he was very nastytempered and i was coaxing him along two men passed us and one of them says look at that brute and the other asks which and they both laugh the master he cursed them good and proper this night whenever we stopped at a publichouse the masters pals left it and went on with us to the next they spoke quite civil to me and when the master tried a flying kick they gives him a shove do you want we should lose our money says the pals i had had nothing to eat for a day and a night and just before we set out the master gives me a wash under the hydrant whenever i am locked up until all the sloppans in our alley are empty and made to take a bath and the masters pals speak civil and feel my ribs i know something is going to happen and that night when every time they see a policeman under a lamppost they dodged across the street and when at the last one of them picked me up and hid me under his jacket i began to tremble for i knew what it meant it meant that i was to fight again for the master i dont fight because i like it i fight because if i didnt the other dog would find my throat and the master would lose his stakes and i would be very sorry for him and ashamed dogs can pass me and i can pass dogs and id never pick a fight with none of them when i see two dogs standing on their hindlegs in the streets clawing each others ears and snapping for each others windpipes or howling and swearing and rolling in the mud i feel sorry they should act so and pretend not to notice if hed let me id like to pass the time of day with every dog i meet but theres something about me that no nice dog can abide when i trot up to nice dogs nodding and grinning to make friends they always tell me to be off go to the devil they bark at me get out and when i walk away they shout mongrel and gutterdog and sometimes after my back is turned they rush me i could kill most of them with three shakes breaking the backbone of the little ones and squeezing the throat of the big ones but whats the good they are nice dogs thats why i try to make up to them and though its not for them to say it i am a streetdog and if i try to push into the company of my betters i suppose its their right to teach me my place of course they dont know im the best fighting bullterrier of my weight in montreal thats why it wouldnt be right for me to take no notice of what they shout they dont know that if i once locked my jaws on them id carry away whatever i touched the night i fought kelleys white rat i wouldnt loosen up until the master made a noose in my leash and strangled me and if the handlers hadnt thrown red pepper down my nose i never would have let go of that ottawa dog i dont think the handlers treated me quite right that time but maybe they didnt know the ottawa dog was dead i did i learned my fighting from my mother when i was very young we slept in a lumberyard on the riverfront and by day hunted for food along the wharves when we got it the other trampdogs would try to take it off us and then it was wonderful to see mother fly at them and drive them away all i know of fighting i learned from mother watching her picking the ashheaps for me when i was too little to fight for myself no one ever was so good to me as mother when it snowed and the ice was in the st lawrence she used to hunt alone and bring me back new bones and shed sit and laugh to see me trying to swallow em whole i was just a puppy then my teeth was falling out when i was able to fight we kept the whole riverrange to ourselves i had the genuine long punishing jaw so mother said and there wasnt a man or a dog that dared worry us those were happy days those were and we lived well share and share alike and when we wanted a bit of fun we chased the fat old wharfrats my how they would squeal then the trouble came it was no trouble to me i was too young to care then but mother took it so to heart that she grew ailing and wouldnt go abroad with me by day it was the same old scandal that theyre always bringing up against me i was so young then that i didnt know i couldnt see any difference between mother and other mothers but one day a pack of curs we drove off snarled back some new names at her and mother dropped her head and ran just as though they had whipped us after that she wouldnt go out with me except in the dark and one day she went away and never came back and though i hunted for her in every court and alley and back street of montreal i never found her one night a month after mother ran away i asked guardian the old blind mastiff whose master is the nightwatchman on our slip what it all meant and he told me every dog in montreal knows he says except you and every master knows so i think its time you knew then he tells me that my father who had treated mother so bad was a great and noble gentleman from london your father had twentytwo registered ancestors had your father old guardian says and in him was the best bullterrier blood of england the most ancientest the most royal the winning blueribbon blood that breeds champions he had sleepy pink eyes and thin pink lips and he was as white all over as his own white teeth and under his white skin you could see his muscles hard and smooth like the links of a steel chain when your father stood still and tipped his nose in the air it was just as though he was saying oh yes you common dogs and men you may well stare it must be a rare treat for you colonials to see a real english royalty he certainly was pleased with hisself was your father he looked just as proud and haughty as one of them stone dogs in victoria park them as is cut out of white marble and youre like him says the old mastiff by that of course meaning youre white same as him thats the only likeness but you see the trouble is kid well you see kid the trouble is your mother that will do i said for i understood then without his telling me and i got up and walked away holding my head and tail high in the air but i was oh so miserable and i wanted to see mother that very minute and tell her that i didnt care mother is what i am a streetdog theres no royal blood in mothers veins nor is she like that father of mine nor and thats the worst shes not even like me for while i when im washed for a fight am as white as clean snow she and this is our trouble she my mother is a blackandtan when mother hid herself from me i was twelve months old and able to take care of myself and as after mother left me the wharves were never the same i moved uptown and met the master before he came lots of other menfolks had tried to make up to me and to whistle me home but they either tried patting me or coaxing me with a piece of meat so i didnt take to em but one day the master pulled me out of a streetfight by the hindlegs and kicked me good you want to fight do you says he ill give you all the fighting you want he says and he kicks me again so i knew he was my master and i followed him home since that day ive pulled off many fights for him and theyve brought dogs from all over the province to have a go at me but up to that night none under thirty pounds had ever downed me but that night so soon as they carried me into the ring i saw the dog was overweight and that i was no match for him it was asking too much of a puppy the master should have known i couldnt do it not that i mean to blame the master for when sober which he sometimes was though not as you might say his habit he was most kind to me and let me out to find food if i could get it and only kicked me when i didnt pick him up at night and lead him home but kicks will stiffen the muscles and starving a dog so as to get him uglytempered for a fight may make him nasty but its weakening to his insides and it causes the legs to wabble the ring was in a hall back of a publichouse there was a redhot whitewashed stove in one corner and the ring in the other i lay in the masters lap wrapped in my blanket and spite of the stove shivering awful but i always shiver before a fight i cant help gettin excited while the menfolks were aflashing their money and taking their last drink at the bar a little irish groom in gaiters came up to me and give me the back of his hand to smell and scratched me behind the ears you poor little pup says he you havent no show he says that brute in the taproom hell eat your heart out thats what you think says the master snarling ill lay you a quid the kid chews him up the groom he shook his head but kept looking at me so sorrylike that i begun to get a bit sad myself he seemed like he couldnt bear to leave off apatting of me and he says speaking low just like he would to a manfolk well goodluck to you little pup which i thought so civil of him that i reached up and licked his hand i dont do that to many men and the master he knew i didnt and took on dreadful what ave you got on the back of your hand says he jumping up soap says the groom quick as a rat thats more than youve got on yours do you want to smell of it and he sticks his fist under the masters nose but the pals pushed in between em he tried to poison the kid shouts the master oh one fight at a time says the referee get into the ring jerry were waiting so we went into the ring i never could just remember what did happen in that ring he give me no time to spring he fell on me like a horse i couldnt keep my feet against him and though as i saw he could get his hold when he liked he wanted to chew me over a bit first i was wondering if theyd be able to pry him off me when in the third round he took his hold and i began to drown just as i did when i fell into the river off the red c slip he closed deeper and deeper on my throat and everything went black and red and bursting and then when i were sure i were dead the handlers pulled him off and the master give me a kick that brought me to but i couldnt move none or even wink both eyes being shut with lumps hes a cur yells the master a sneaking cowardly cur he lost the fight for me says he because hes a cowardly cur and he kicks me again in the lower ribs so that i go sliding across the sawdust theres gratitude fer yer yells the master ive fed that dog and nussed that dog and housed him like a prince and now he puts his tail between his legs and sells me out he does hes a coward ive done with him i am id sell him for a pipeful of tobacco he picked me up by the tail and swung me for the menfolks to see does any gentleman here want to buy a dog he says to make into sausagemeat he says thats all hes good for then i heard the little irish groom say ill give you ten bob for the dog and another voice says ah dont you do it the dogs same as deadmebby he is dead ten shillings says the master and his voice sobers a bit make it two pounds and hes yours but the pals rushed in again dont you be a fool jerry they say youll be sorry for this when youre sober the kids worth a fiver one of my eyes was not so swelled up as the other and as i hung by my tail i opened it and saw one of the pals take the groom by the shoulder you ought to give im five pounds for that dog mate he says thats no ordinary dog that dogs got good blood in him that dog has why his father that very dogs father i thought he never would go on he waited like he wanted to be sure the groom was listening that very dogs father says the pal is regent royal son of champion regent monarch champion bullterrier of england for four years i was sore and torn and chewed most awful but what the pal said sounded so fine that i wanted to wag my tail only couldnt owing to my hanging from it but the master calls out yes his father was regent royal whos saying he wasnt but the pups a cowardly cur thats what his pup is and why ill tell you why because his mother was a blackandtan streetdog thats why i dont see how i get the strength but some way i threw myself out of the masters grip and fell at his feet and turned over and fastened all my teeth in his ankle just across the bone when i woke after the pals had kicked me off him i was in the smokingcar of a railroadtrain lying in the lap of the little groom and he was rubbing my open wounds with a greasy yellow stuff exquisite to the smell and most agreeable to lick off part ii well whats your name nolan well nolan these references are satisfactory said the young gentleman my new master called mr wyndham sir ill take you on as second man you can begin today my new master shuffled his feet and put his finger to his forehead thank you sir says he then he choked like he had swallowed a fishbone i have a little dawg sir says he you cant keep him says mr wyndham sir very short es only a puppy sir says my new master e wouldnt go outside the stables sir its not that says mr wyndham sir i have a large kennel of very fine dogs theyre the best of their breed in america i dont allow strange dogs on the premises the master shakes his head and motions me with his cap and i crept out from behind the door im sorry sir says the master then i cant take the place i cant get along without the dog sir mr wyndham sir looked at me that fierce that i guessed he was going to whip me so i turned over on my back and begged with my legs and tail why you beat him says mr wyndham sir very stern no fear the master says getting very red the party i bought him off taught him that he never learnt that from me he picked me up in his arms and to show mr wyndham sir how well i loved the master i bit his chin and hands mr wyndham sir turned over the letters the master had given him well these references certainly are very strong he says i guess ill let the dog stay this time only see you keep him away from the kennels or youll both go thank you sir says the master grinning like a cat when shes safe behind the arearailing hes not a bad bullterrier says mr wyndham sir feeling my head not that i know much about the smoothcoated breeds my dogs are st bernards he stopped patting me and held up my nose whats the matter with his ears he says theyre chewed to pieces is this a fighting dog he asks quick and roughlike i could have laughed if he hadnt been holding my nose i certainly would have had a good grin at him me the best under thirty pounds in the province of quebec and him asking if i was a fighting dog i ran to the master and hung down my head modestlike waiting for him to tell my list of battles but the master he coughs in his cap most painful fightin dog sir he cries lor bless you sir the kid dont know the word es just a puppy sir same as you see a pet dog so to speak es a regular old ladys lapdog the kid is well you keep him away from my st bernards says mr wyndham sir or they might make a mouthful of him yes sir that they might says the master but when we gets outside he slaps his knee and laughs inside hisself and winks at me most sociable the masters new home was in the country in a province they called long island there was a high stone wall about his home with big iron gates to it same as godfreys brewery and there was a house with five red roofs and the stables where i lived was cleaner than the aerated bakeryshop and then there was the kennels but they was like nothing else in this world that ever i see for the first days i couldnt sleep of nights for fear someone would catch me lying in such a cleanedup place and would chase me out of it and when i did fall to sleep id dream i was back in the old masters attic shivering under the rusty stove which never had no coals in it with the master flat on his back on the cold floor with his clothes on and id wake up scared and whimpering and find myself on the new masters cot with his hand on the quilt beside me and id see the glow of the big stove and hear the highquality horses belowstairs stamping in their strawlined boxes and id snoop the sweet smell of hay and harnesssoap and go to sleep again the stables was my jail so the master said but i dont ask no better home than that jail now kid says he sitting on the top of a bucket upside down youve got to understand this when i whistle it means youre not to go out of this ere yard these stables is your jail and if you leave em ill have to leave em too and over the seas in the county mayo an old mother will ave to leave her bit of a cottage for two pounds i must be sending her every month or shell have naught to eat nor no thatch over er head so i cant lose my place kid an see you dont lose it for me you must keep away from the kennels says he theyre not for the likes of you the kennels are for the quality i wouldnt take a litter of them woolly dogs for one wag of your tail kid but for all that they are your betters same as the gentry up in the big house are my betters i know my place and keep away from the gentry and you keep away from the champions so i never goes out of the stables all day i just lay in the sun on the stone flags licking my jaws and watching the grooms wash down the carriages and the only care i had was to see they didnt get gay and turn the hose on me there wasnt even a single rat to plague me such stables i never did see nolan says the headgroom some day that dog of yours will give you the slip you cant keep a streetdog tied up all his life its against his natur the headgroom is a nice old gentleman but he doesnt know everything just as though id been a streetdog because i liked it as if id rather poke for my vittles in ashheaps than have em handed me in a washbasin and would sooner bite and fight than be polite and sociable if id had mother there i couldnt have asked for nothing more but id think of her snooping in the gutters or freezing of nights under the bridges or whats worse of all running through the hot streets with her tongue down so wild and crazy for a drink that the people would shout mad dog at her and stone her waters so good that i dont blame the menfolks for locking it up inside their houses but when the hot days come i think they might remember that those are the dogdays and leave a little water outside in a trough like they do for the horses then we wouldnt go mad and the policemen wouldnt shoot us i had so much of everything i wanted that it made me think a lot of the days when i hadnt nothing and if i could have given what i had to mother as she used to share with me id have been the happiest dog in the land not that i wasnt happy then and most grateful to the master too and if id only minded him the trouble wouldnt have come again but one day the coachman says that the little lady they called miss dorothy had come back from school and that same morning she runs over to the stables to pat her ponies and she sees me oh what a nice little white little dog said she whose little dog are you says she thats my dog miss says the master is name is kid and i ran up to her most polite and licks her fingers for i never see so pretty and kind a lady you must come with me and call on my new puppies says she picking me up in her arms and starting off with me oh but please miss cries nolan mr wyndham give orders that the kids not to go to the kennels thatll be all right says the little lady theyre my kennels too and the puppies will like to play with him you wouldnt believe me if i was to tell you of the style of them qualitydogs if i hadnt seen it myself i wouldnt have believed it neither the viceroy of canada dont live no better there was forty of them but each one had his own house and a yard most exclusive and a cot and a drinkingbasin all to hisself they had servants standing round waiting to feed em when they was hungry and valets to wash em and they had their hair combed and brushed like the grooms must when they go out on the box even the puppies had overcoats with their names on em in blue letters and the name of each of those they called champions was painted up fine over his front door just like it was a publichouse or a veterinarys they were the biggest st bernards i ever did see i could have walked under them if theyd have let me but they were very proud and haughty dogs and looked only once at me and then sniffed in the air the little ladys own dog was an old gentleman bulldog hed come along with us and when he notices how taken aback i was with all i see e turned quite kind and affable and showed me about jimmy jocks miss dorothy called him but owing to his weight he walked most dignified and slow waddling like a duck as you might say and looked much too proud and handsome for such a silly name thats the runway and thats the trophy house says he to me and that over there is the hospital where you have to go if you get distemper and the vet gives you beastly medicine and which of these is your ouse sir asks i wishing to be respectful but he looked that hurt and haughty i dont live in the kennels says he most contemptuous i am a housedog i sleep in miss dorothys room and at lunch im let in with the family if the visitors dont mind they most always do but theyre too polite to say so besides says he smiling most condescending visitors are always afraid of me its because im so ugly says he i suppose says he screwing up his wrinkles and speaking very slow and impressive i suppose im the ugliest bulldog in america and as he seemed to be so pleased to think hisself so i said yes sir you certainly are the ugliest ever i see at which he nodded his head most approving but i couldnt hurt em as you say he goes on though i hadnt said nothing like that being too polite im too old he says i havent any teeth the last time one of those grizzly bears said he glaring at the big st bernards took a hold of me he nearly was my death says he i thought his eyes would pop out of his head he seemed so wrought up about it he rolled me around in the dirt he did says jimmy jocks an i couldnt get up it was low says jimmy jocks making a face like he had a bad taste in his mouth low thats what i call it bad form you understand young man not done in our circles and and low he growled way down in his stomach and puffed hisself out panting and blowing like he had been on a run im not a streetfighter he says scowling at a st bernard marked champion and when my rheumatism is not troubling me he says i endeavor to be civil to all dogs so long as they are gentlemen yes sir said i for even to me he had been most affable at this we had come to a little house off by itself and jimmy jocks invites me in this is their trophyroom he says where they keep their prizes mine he says rather grandlike are on the sideboard not knowing what a sideboard might be i said indeed sir that must be very gratifying but he only wrinkled up his chops as much as to say it is my right the trophyroom was as wonderful as any publichouse i ever see on the walls was pictures of nothing but beautiful st bernard dogs and rows and rows of blue and red and yellow ribbons and when i asked jimmy jocks why they was so many more of blue than of the others he laughs and says because these kennels always win and there was many shining cups on the shelves which jimmy jocks told me were prizes won by the champions now sir might i ask you sir says i wot is a champion at that he panted and breathed so hard i thought he would bust hisself my dear young friend says he wherever have you been educated a champion is a a champion he says he must win nine blue ribbons in the open class you follow me that is against all comers then he has the title before his name and they put his photograph in the sporting papers you know of course that i am a champion says he i am champion woodstock wizard iii and the two other woodstock wizards my father and uncle were both champions but i thought your name was jimmy jocks i said he laughs right out at that thats my kennel name not my registered name he says why you certainly know that every dog has two names now whats your registered name and number for instance says he ive only got one name i says just kid woodstock wizard puffs at that and wrinkles up his forehead and pops out his eyes who are your people says he where is your home at the stable sir i said my master is the second groom at that woodstock wizard iii looks at me for quite a bit without winking and stares all around the room over my head oh well says he at last youre a very civil young dog says he and i blame no one for what he cant help which i thought most fair and liberal and i have known many bullterriers that were champions says he though as a rule they mostly run with fireengines and to fighting for me i wouldnt care to run through the streets after a hosecart nor to fight says he but each to his taste i could not help thinking that if woodstock wizard iii tried to follow a fireengine he would die of apoplexy and that seeing hed lost his teeth it was lucky he had no taste for fighting but after his being so condescending i didnt say nothing anyway says he every smoothcoated dog is better than any hairy old camel like those st bernards and if ever youre hungry down at the stables young man come up to the house and ill give you a bone i cant eat them myself but i bury them around the garden from force of habit and in case a friend should drop in ah i see my mistress coming he says and i bid you goodday i regret he says that our different social position prevents our meeting frequent for youre a worthy young dog with a proper respect for your betters and in this country theres precious few of them have that then he waddles off leaving me alone and very sad for he was the first dog in many days that had spoken to me but since he showed seeing that i was a stabledog he didnt want my company i waited for him to get well away it was not a cheerful place to wait the trophy house the pictures of the champions seemed to scowl at me and ask what right had such as i even to admire them and the blue and gold ribbons and the silver cups made me very miserable i had never won no blue ribbons or silver cups only stakes for the old master to spend in the publics and i hadnt won them for being a beautiful highquality dog but just for fighting which of course as woodstock wizard iii says is low so i started for the stables with my head down and my tail between my legs feeling sorry i had ever left the master but i had more reason to be sorry before i got back to him the trophy house was quite a bit from the kennels and as i left it i see miss dorothy and woodstock wizard iii walking back toward them and that a fine big st bernard his name was champion red elfberg had broke his chain and was running their way when he reaches old jimmy jocks he lets out a roar like a grainsteamer in a fog and he makes three leaps for him old jimmy jocks was about a fourth his size but he plants his feet and curves his back and his hair goes up around his neck like a collar but he never had no show at no time for the grizzly bear as jimmy jocks had called him lights on old jimmys back and tries to break it and old jimmy jocks snaps his gums and claws the grass panting and groaning awful but he cant do nothing and the grizzly bear just rolls him under him biting and tearing cruel the odds was all that woodstock wizard iii was going to be killed i had fought enough to see that but not knowing the rules of the game among champions i didnt like to interfere between two gentlemen who might be settling a private affair and as it were take it as presuming of me so i stood by though i was shaking terrible and holding myself in like i was on a leash but at that woodstock wizard iii who was underneath sees me through the dust and calls very faint help you he says take him in the hindleg he says hes murdering me he says and then the little miss dorothy who was crying and calling to the kennelmen catches at the red elfbergs hindlegs to pull him off and the brute keeping his front pats well in jimmys stomach turns his big head and snaps at her so that was all i asked for thank you i went up under him it was really nothing he stood so high that i had only to take off about three feet from him and come in from the side and my long punishing jaw as mother was always talking about locked on his woolly throat and my back teeth met i couldnt shake him but i shook myself and every time i shook myself there was thirty pounds of weight tore at his windpipes i couldnt see nothing for his long hair but i heard jimmy jocks puffing and blowing on one side and munching the brutes leg with his old gums jimmy was an old sport that day was jimmy or woodstock wizard iii as i should say when the red elfberg was out and down i had to run or those kennelmen would have had my life they chased me right into the stables and from under the hay i watched the headgroom take down a carriagewhip and order them to the right about luckily master and the young grooms were out or that day thered have been fighting for everybody well it nearly did for me and the master mr wyndham sir comes raging to the stables and said id halfkilled his best prizewinner and had oughter be shot and he gives the master his notice but miss dorothy she follows him and says it was his red elfberg what began the fight and that id saved jimmys life and that old jimmy jocks was worth more to her than all the st bernards in the swiss mountains whereever they be and that i was her champion anyway then she cried over me most beautiful and over jimmy jocks too who was that tied up in bandages he couldnt even waddle so when he heard that side of it mr wyndham sir told us that if nolan put me on a chain we could stay so it came out all right for everybody but me i was glad the master kept his place but id never worn a chain before and it disheartened me but that was the least of it for the qualitydogs couldnt forgive my whipping their champion and they came to the fence between the kennels and the stables and laughed through the bars barking most cruel words at me i couldnt understand how they found it out but they knew after the fight jimmy jocks was most condescending to me and he said the grooms had boasted to the kennelmen that i was a son of regent royal and that when the kennelmen asked who was my mother they had had to tell them that too perhaps that was the way of it but however the scandal was out and every one of the qualitydogs knew that i was a streetdog and the son of a blackandtan these misalliances will occur said jimmy jocks in his oldfashioned way but no wellbred dog says he looking most scornful at the st bernards who were howling behind the palings would refer to your misfortune before you certainly not cast it in your face i myself remember your fathers father when he made his debut at the crystal palace he took four blue ribbons and three specials but no sooner than jimmy would leave me the st bernards would take to howling again insulting mother and insulting me and when i tore at my chain they seeing they were safe would howl the more it was never the same after that the laughs and the jeers cut into my heart and the chain bore heavy on my spirit i was so sad that sometimes i wished i was back in the gutter again where no one was better than me and some nights i wished i was dead if it hadnt been for the master being so kind and that it would have looked like i was blaming mother i would have twisted my leash and hanged myself about a month after my fight the word was passed through the kennels that the new york show was coming and such goings on as followed i never did see if each of them had been matched to fight for a thousand pounds and the gate they couldnt have trained more conscientious but perhaps thats just my envy the kennelmen rubbed em and scrubbed em and trims their hair and curls and combs it and some dogs they fatted and some they starved no one talked of nothing but the show and the chances our kennels had against the other kennels and if this one of our champions would win over that one and whether them as hoped to be champions had better show in the open or the limit class and whether this dog would beat his own dad or whether his little puppy sister couldnt beat the two of them even the grooms had their money up and day or night you heard nothing but praises of our dogs until i being so far out of it couldnt have felt meaner if i had been running the streets with a can to my tail i knew shows were not for such as me and so i lay all day stretched at the end of my chain pretending i was asleep and only too glad that they had something so important to think of that they could leave me alone but one day before the show opened miss dorothy came to the stables with mr wyndham sir and seeing me chained up and so miserable she takes me in her arms you poor little tyke says she its cruel to tie him up so hes eating his heart out nolan she says i dont know nothing about bullterriers says she but i think kids got good points says she and you ought to show him jimmy jocks has three legs on the rensselaer cup now and im going to show him this time so that he can get the fourth and if you wish ill enter your dog too how would you like that kid says she how would you like to see the most beautiful dogs in the world maybe youd meet a pal or two says she it would cheer you up wouldnt it kid says she but i was so upset i could only wag my tail most violent he says it would says she though being that excited i hadnt said nothing so mr wyndham sir laughs and takes out a piece of blue paper and sits down at the headgrooms table whats the name of the father of your dog nolan says he and nolan says the man i got him off told me he was a son of champion regent royal sir but it dont seem likely does it says nolan it does not says mr wyndham sir shortlike arent you sure nolan says miss dorothy no miss says the master sire unknown says mr wyndham sir and writes it down date of birth asks mr wyndham sir i i unknown sir says nolan and mr wyndham sir writes it down breeder says mr wyndham sir unknown says nolan getting very red around the jaws and i drops my head and tail and mr wyndham sir writes that down mothers name says mr wyndham sir she was a unknown says the master and i licks his hand dam unknown says mr wyndham sir and writes it down then he takes the paper and reads out loud sire unknown dam unknown breeder unknown date of birth unknown youd better call him the great unknown says he whos paying his entrancefee i am says miss dorothy two weeks after we all got on a train for new york jimmy jocks and me following nolan in the smokingcar and twentytwo of the st bernards in boxes and crates and on chains and leashes such a barking and howling i never did hear and when they sees me going too they laughs fit to kill wot is this a circus says the railroadman but i had no heart in it i hated to go i knew i was no show dog even though miss dorothy and the master did their best to keep me from shaming them for before we set out miss dorothy brings a man from town who scrubbed and rubbed me and sandpapered my tail which hurt most awful and shaved my ears with the masters razor so you could most see clear through em and sprinkles me over with pipeclay till i shines like a tommys crossbelts upon my word says jimmy jocks when he first sees me what a swell you are youre the image of your granddad when he made his debut at the crystal palace he took four firsts and three specials but i knew he was only trying to throw heart into me they might scrub and they might rub and they might pipeclay but they couldnt pipeclay the insides of me and they was blackandtan then we came to a garden which it was not but the biggest hall in the world inside there was lines of benches a few miles long and on them sat every dog in the world if all the dogsnatchers in montreal had worked night and day for a year they couldnt have caught so many dogs and they was all shouting and barking and howling so vicious that my heart stopped beating for at first i thought they was all enraged at my presuming to intrude but after i got in my place they kept at it just the same barking at every dog as he come in daring him to fight and ordering him out and asking him what breed of dog he thought he was anyway jimmy jocks was chained just behind me and he said he never see so fine a show thats a hot class youre in my lad he says looking over into my street where there were thirty bullterriers they was all as white as cream and each so beautiful that if i could have broke my chain i would have run all the way home and hid myself under the horsetrough all night long they talked and sang and passed greetings with old pals and the homesick puppies howled dismal them that couldnt sleep wouldnt let no others sleep and all the electric lights burned in the roof and in my eyes i could hear jimmy jocks snoring peaceful but i could only doze by jerks and when i dozed i dreamed horrible all the dogs in the hall seemed coming at me for daring to intrude with their jaws red and open and their eyes blazing like the lights in the roof youre a streetdog get out you streetdog they yells and as they drives me out the pipeclay drops off me and they laugh and shriek and when i looks down i see that i have turned into a blackandtan they was most awful dreams and next morning when miss dorothy comes and gives me water in a pan i begs and begs her to take me home but she cant understand how well kid is she says and when i jumps into the masters arms and pulls to break my chain he says if he knew all as he had against him miss he wouldnt be so gay and from a book they reads out the names of the beautiful highbred terriers which i have got to meet and i cant make em understand that i only want to run away and hide myself where no one will see me then suddenly men comes hurrying down our street and begins to brush the beautiful bullterriers and nolan rubs me with a towel so excited that his hands trembles awful and miss dorothy tweaks my ears between her gloves so that the blood runs to em and they turn pink and stand up straight and sharp now then nolan says she her voice shaking just like his fingers keep his head up and never let the judge lose sight of him when i hears that my legs breaks under me for i knows all about judges twice the old master goes up before the judge for fighting me with other dogs and the judge promises him if he ever does it again hell chain him up in jail i knew hed find me out a judge cant be fooled by no pipeclay he can see right through you and he reads your insides the judgingring which is where the judge holds out was so like a fightingpit that when i came in it and find six other dogs there i springs into position so that when they lets us go i can defend myself but the master smoothes down my hair and whispers hold ard kid hold ard this aint a fight says he look your prettiest he whispers please kid look your prettiest and he pulls my leash so tight that i cant touch my pats to the sawdust and my nose goes up in the air there was millions of people awatching us from the railings and three of our kennelmen too making fun of nolan and me and miss dorothy with her chin just reaching to the rail and her eyes so big that i thought she was agoing to cry it was awful to think that when the judge stood up and exposed me all those people and miss dorothy would be there to see me driven from the show the judge he was a fiercelooking man with specs on his nose and a red beard when i first come in he didnt see me owing to my being too quick for him and dodging behind the master but when the master drags me round and i pulls at the sawdust to keep back the judge looks at us carelesslike and then stops and glares through his specs and i knew it was all up with me are there any more asks the judge to the gentleman at the gate but never taking his specs from me the man at the gate looks in his book seven in the noviceclass says he theyre all here you can go ahead and he shuts the gate the judge he doesnt hesitate a moment he just waves his hand toward the corner of the ring take him away he says to the master over there and keep him away and he turns and looks most solemn at the six beautiful bullterriers i dont know how i crawled to that corner i wanted to scratch under the sawdust and dig myself a grave the kennelmen they slapped the rail with their hands and laughed at the master like they would fall over they pointed at me in the corner and their sides just shaked but little miss dorothy she presses her lips tight against the rail and i see tears rolling from her eyes the master he hangs his head like he had been whipped i felt most sorry for him than all he was so red and he was letting on not to see the kennelmen and blinking his eyes if the judge had ordered me right out it wouldnt have disgraced us so but it was keeping me there while he was judging the highbred dogs that hurt so hard with all those people staring too and his doing it so quick without no doubt nor questions you cant fool the judges they see insides you but he couldnt make up his mind about them highbred dogs he scowls at em and he glares at em first with his head on the one side and then on the other and he feels of em and orders em to run about and nolan leans against the rails with his head hung down and pats me and miss dorothy comes over beside him but dont say nothing only wipes her eye with her finger a man on the other side of the rail he says to the master the judge dont like your dog no says the master have you ever shown him before says the man no says the master and ill never show him again hes my dog says the master an he suits me and i dont care what no judges think and when he says them kind words i licks his hand most grateful the judge had two of the six dogs on a little platform in the middle of the ring and he had chased the four other dogs into the corners where they was licking their chops and letting on they didnt care same as nolan was the two dogs on the platform was so beautiful that the judge hisself couldnt tell which was the best of em even when he stoops down and holds their heads together but at last he gives a sigh and brushes the sawdust off his knees and goes to the table in the ring where there was a man keeping score and heaps and heaps of blue and gold and red and yellow ribbons and the judge picks up a bunch of em and walks to the two gentlemen who was holding the beautiful dogs and he says to each whats his number and he hands each gentleman a ribbon and then he turned sharp and comes straight at the master whats his number says the judge and master was so scared that he couldnt make no answer but miss dorothy claps her hands and cries out like she was laughing three twentysix and the judge writes it down and shoves master the blue ribbon i bit the master and i jumps and bit miss dorothy and i waggled so hard that the master couldnt hold me when i get to the gate miss dorothy snatches me up and kisses me between the ears right before millions of people and they both hold me so tight that i didnt know which of them was carrying of me but one thing i knew for i listened hard as it was the judge hisself as said it did you see that puppy i gave first to says the judge to the gentleman at the gate i did he was a bit out of his class says the gategentleman he certainly was says the judge and they both laughed but i didnt care they couldnt hurt me then not with nolan holding the blue ribbon and miss dorothy hugging my ears and the kennelmen sneaking away each looking like hed been caught with his nose under the lid of the slopcan we sat down together and we all three just talked as fast as we could they was so pleased that i couldnt help feeling proud myself and i barked and jumped and leaped about so gay that all the bullterriers in our street stretched on their chains and howled at me just look at him says one of those i had beat whats he giving hisself airs about because hes got one blue ribbon says another of em why when i was a puppy i used to eat em and if that judge could ever learn to know a toy from a mastiff id have had this one but jimmy jocks he leaned over from his bench and says well done kid didnt i tell you so what he ad told me was that i might get a commended but i didnt remind him didnt i tell you says jimmy jocks that i saw your grandfather make his debut at the crystal yes sir you did sir says i for i have no love for the men of my family a gentleman with a showing leash around his neck comes up just then and looks at me very critical nice dog youve got miss wyndham says he would you care to sell him hes not my dog says miss dorothy holding me tight i wish he were hes not for sale sir says the master and i was that glad oh hes yours is he says the gentleman looking hard at nolan well ill give you a hundred dollars for him says he carelesslike thank you sir hes not for sale says nolan but his eyes get very big the gentleman he walked away but i watches him and he talks to a man in a golfcap and by and by the man comes along our street looking at all the dogs and stops in front of me this your dog says he to nolan pity hes so leggy says he if he had a good tail and a longer stop and his ears were set higher hed be a good dog as he is ill give you fifty dollars for him but before the master could speak miss dorothy laughs and says youre mr polks kennelman i believe well you tell mr polk from me that the dogs not for sale now any more than he was five minutes ago and that when he is hell have to bid against me for him the man looks foolish at that but he turns to nolan quicklike ill give you three hundred for him he says oh indeed whispers miss dorothy like she was talking to herself thats it is it and she turns and looks at me just as though she had never seen me before nolan he was a gaping too with his mouth open but he holds me tight hes not for sale he growls like he was frightened and the man looks black and walks away why nolan cries miss dorothy mr polk knows more about bullterriers than any amateur in america what can he mean why kid is no more than a puppy three hundred dollars for a puppy and he aint no thoroughbred neither cries the master hes unknown aint he kid cant help it of course but his mother miss i dropped my head i couldnt bear he should tell miss dorothy i couldnt bear she should know i had stolen my blue ribbon but the master never told for at that a gentleman runs up calling three twentysix three twentysix and miss dorothy says here he is what is it the winners class says the gentleman hurry please the judge is waiting for him nolan tries to get me off the chain onto a showing leash but he shakes so he only chokes me what is it miss he says what is it the winners class says miss dorothy the judge wants him with the winners of the other classes to decide which is the best its only a form says she he has the champions against him now yes says the gentleman as he hurries us to the ring im afraid its only a form for your dog but the judge wants all the winners puppy class even we had got to the gate and the gentleman there was writing down my number who won the open asks miss dorothy oh who would laughs the gentleman the old champion of course hes won for three years now there he is isnt he wonderful says he and he points to a dog thats standing proud and haughty on the platform in the middle of the ring i never see so beautiful a dog so fine and clean and noble so white like he had rolled hisself in flour holding his nose up and his eyes shut same as though no one was worth looking at aside of him we other dogs even though we had a blue ribbon apiece seemed like lumps of mud he was a royal gentleman a king he was his master didnt have to hold his head with no leash he held it hisself standing as still as an iron dog on a lawn like he knew all the people was looking at him and so they was and no one around the ring pointed at no other dog but him oh what a picture cried miss dorothy hes like a marble figure by a great artist one who loved dogs who is he says she looking in her book i dont keep up with terriers oh you know him says the gentleman he is the champion of champions regent royal the masters face went red and this is regent royals son cries he and he pulls me quick into the ring and plants me on the platform next my father i trembled so that i near fall my legs twisted like a leash but my father he never looked at me he only smiled the same sleepy smile and he still keep his eyes halfshut like as no one no not even his son was worth his lookin at the judge he didnt let me stay beside my father but one by one he placed the other dogs next to him and measured and felt and pulled at them and each one he put down but he never put my father down and then he comes over and picks up me and sets me back on the platform shoulder to shoulder with the champion regent royal and goes down on his knees and looks into our eyes the gentleman with my father he laughs and says to the judge thinking of keeping us here all day john but the judge he doesnt hear him and goes behind us and runs his hand down my side and holds back my ears and takes my jaws between his fingers the crowd around the ring is very deep now and nobody says nothing the gentleman at the scoretable he is leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and his eyes very wide and the gentleman at the gate is whispering quick to miss dorothy who has turned white i stood as stiff as stone i didnt even breathe but out of the corner of my eye i could see my father licking his pink chops and yawning just a little like he was bored the judge he had stopped looking fierce and was looking solemn something inside him seemed a troubling him awful the more he stares at us now the more solemn he gets and when he touches us he does it gentle like he was patting us for a long time he kneels in the sawdust looking at my father and at me and no one around the ring says nothing to nobody then the judge takes a breath and touches me sudden its his he says but he lays his hand just as quick on my father im sorry says he the gentleman holding my father cries do you mean to tell me and the judge he answers i mean the other is the better dog he takes my fathers head between his hands and looks down at him most sorrowful the king is dead says he long live the king goodby regent he says the crowd around the railings clapped their hands and some laughed scornful and everyone talks fast and i start for the gate so dizzy that i cant see my way but my father pushes in front of me walking very daintily and smiling sleepy same as he had just been waked with his head high and his eyes shut looking at nobody so that is how i came by my inheritance as miss dorothy calls it and just for that though i couldnt feel where i was any different the crowd follows me to my bench and pats me and coos at me like i was a baby in a babycarriage and the handlers have to hold em back so that the gentlemen from the papers can make pictures of me and nolan walks me up and down so proud and the men shakes their heads and says he certainly is the true type he is and the pretty ladies asks miss dorothy who sits beside me letting me lick her gloves to show the crowd what friends we is arent you afraid hell bite you and jimmy jocks calls to me didnt i tell you so i always knew you were one of us blood will out kid blood will out i saw your grandfather says he make his debut at the crystal palace but he was never the dog you are after that if i could have asked for it there was nothing i couldnt get you might have thought i was a snowdog and they was afeerd id melt if i wet my pats nolan gave me a hot bath and chained me to the stove if i couldnt eat my food being stuffed full by the cook for i am a housedog now and let in to lunch whether there is visitors or not nolan would run to bring the vet it was all tommyrot as jimmy says but meant most kind i couldnt scratch myself comfortable without nolan giving me nasty drinks and rubbing me outside till it burnt awful and i wasnt let to eat bones for fear of spoiling my beautiful mouth what mother used to call my punishing jaw and my food was cooked special on a gasstove and miss dorothy gives me an overcoat cut very stylish like the champions to wear when we goes out carriagedriving after the next show where i takes three blue ribbons four silver cups two medals and brings home fortyfive dollars for nolan they gives me a registered name same as jimmys miss dorothy wanted to call me regent heir apparent but i was that glad when nolan says no kid dont owe nothing to his father only to you and hisself so if you please miss well call him wyndham kid and so they did and you can see it on my overcoat in blue letters and painted top of my kennel it was all too hard to understand for days i just sat and wondered if i was really me and how it all come about and why everybody was so kind but oh it was so good they was for if they hadnt been id never have got the thing i most wished after but because they was kind and not liking to deny me nothing they gave it me and it was more to me than anything in the world it came about one day when we was out driving we was in the cart they calls the dogcart because its the one miss dorothy keeps to take jimmy and me for an airing nolan was up behind and me in my new overcoat was sitting beside miss dorothy i was admiring the view and thinking how good it was to have a horse pull you about so that you neednt get yourself splashed and have to be washed when i hears a dog calling loud for help and i pricks up my ears and looks over the horses head and i sees something that makes me tremble down to my toes in the road before us three big dogs was chasing a little old ladydog she had a string to her tail where some boys had tied a can and she was dirty with mud and ashes and torn most awful she was too far done up to get away and too old to help herself but she was making a fight for her life snapping her old gums savage and dying game all this i see in a wink and then the three dogs pinned her down and i cant stand it no longer and clears the wheel and lands in the road on my head it was my stylish overcoat done that and i curse it proper but i gets my pats again quick and makes a rush for the fighting behind me i hear miss dorothy cry theyll kill that old dog wait take my whip beat them off her the kid can take care of himself and i hear nolan fall into the road and the horse come to a stop the old ladydog was down and the three was eating her vicious but as i come up scattering the pebbles she hears and thinking its one more of them she lifts her head and my heart breaks open like someone had sunk his teeth in it for under the ashes and the dirt and the blood i can see who it is and i know that my mother has come back to me i gives a yell that throws them three dogs off their legs mother i cries im the kid i cries im coming to you mother im coming and i shoots over her at the throat of the big dog and the other two they sinks their teeth into that stylish overcoat and tears it off me and that sets me free and i lets them have it i never had so fine a fight as that what with mother being there to see and not having been let to mix up in no fights since i become a prizewinner it just naturally did me good and it wasnt three shakes before i had em yelping quick as a wink mother she jumps in to help me and i just laughed to see her it was so like old times and nolan he made me laugh too he was like a hen on a bank shaking the butt of his whip but not daring to cut in for fear of hitting me stop it kid he says stop it do you want to be all torn up says he think of the boston show next week says he think of chicago think of danbury dont you never want to be a champion how was i to think of all them places when i had three dogs to cut up at the same time but in a minute two of em begs for mercy and mother and me lets em run away the big one he aint able to run away then mother and me we dances and jumps and barks and laughs and bites each other and rolls each other in the road there never was two dogs so happy as we and nolan he whistles and calls and begs me to come to him but i just laugh and play larks with mother now you come with me says i to my new home and never try to run away again and i shows her our house with the five red roofs set on the top of the hill but mother trembles awful and says theyd never let the likes of me in such a place does the viceroy live there kid says she and i laugh at her no i do i says and if they wont let you live there too you and me will go back to the streets together for we must never be parted no more so we trots up the hill side by side with nolan trying to catch me and miss dorothy laughing at him from the cart the kids made friends with the poor old dog says she maybe he knew her long ago when he ran the streets himself put her in here beside me and see if he doesnt follow so when i hears that i tells mother to go with nolan and sit in the cart but she says no that shed soil the pretty ladys frock but i tells her to do as i say and so nolan lifts her trembling still into the cart and i runs alongside barking joyful when we drives into the stables i takes mother to my kennel and tells her to go inside it and make herself at home oh but he wont let me says she who wont let you says i keeping my eye on nolan and growling a bit nasty just to show i was meaning to have my way why wyndham kid says she looking up at the name on my kennel but im wyndham kid says i you cries mother you is my little kid the great wyndham kid the dogs all talk about and at that she being very old and sick and hungry and nervous as mothers are just drops down in the straw and weeps bitter well there aint much more than that to tell miss dorothy she settled it if the kid wants the poor old thing in the stables says she let her stay you see says she shes a blackandtan and his mother was a blackandtan and maybe thats what makes kid feel so friendly toward her says she indeed for me says nolan she can have the best there is id never drive out no dog that asks for a crust nor a shelter he says but what will mr wyndham do hell do what i say says miss dorothy and if i say shes to stay she will stay and i say shes to stay and so mother and nolan and me found a home mother was scared at first not being used to kind people but she was so gentle and loving that the grooms got fonder of her than of me and tried to make me jealous by patting of her and giving her the pick of the vittles but that was the wrong way to hurt my feelings thats all i think mother is so happy here that i tell her we ought to call it the happy hunting grounds because no one hunts you and there is nothing to hunt it just all comes to you and so we live in peace mother sleeping all day in the sun or behind the stove in the headgrooms office being fed twice a day regular by nolan and all the day by the other grooms most irregular and as for me i go hurrying around the country to the benchshows winning money and cups for nolan and taking the blue ribbons away from father a derelict when the warships of a navy lie cleared for action outside a harbor and the warships of the country with which they are at war lie cleared for action inside the harbor there is likely to be trouble trouble between warships is news and wherever there is news there is always a representative of the consolidated press as long as sampson blockaded havana and the army beat time back of the tampa bay hotel the central office for news was at key west but when cervera slipped into santiago harbor and sampson stationed his battleships at its mouth key west lost her only excuse for existence and the pressboats burled their bows in the waters of the florida straits and raced for the cablestation at port antonio it was then that keating the star man of the consolidated press syndicate was forced to abandon his young bride and the rooms he had engaged for her at the key west hotel and accompany his tug to the distant island of jamaica keating was a good and faithful servant to the consolidated press he was a correspondent after its own making an industrious collector of facts the consolidated press did not ask him to comment on what it sent him to see it did not require nor desire his editorial opinions or impressions it was no part of his work to go into the motives which led to the event of news interest which he was sent to report nor to point out what there was of it which was dramatic pathetic or outrageous the consolidated press being a mighty corporation which daily fed seven hundred different newspapers could not hope to please the policy of each so it compromised by giving the facts of the day fairly set down without heat prejudice or enthusiasm this was an excellent arrangement for the papers that subscribed for the service of the consolidated press but it was death to the literary strivings of the consolidated press correspondents we do not want descriptive writing was the warning which the manager of the great syndicate was always flashing to its correspondents we do not pay you to send us penpictures or prose poems we want the facts all the facts and nothing but the facts and so when at a presidential convention a theatrical speaker sat down after calling james g blaine a plumed knight each of the special correspondents present wrote two columns in an effort to describe how the people who heard the speech behaved in consequence but the consolidated press man telegraphed at the conclusion of these remarks the cheering lasted sixteen minutes no event of news value was too insignificant to escape the watchfulness of the consolidated press none so great that it could not handle it from its inception up to the moment when it ceased to be quoted in the newsmarket of the world each night from thousands of spots all over the surface of the globe it received thousands of facts of cold accomplished facts it knew that a tidal wave had swept through china a cabinet had changed in chili in texas an express train had been held up and robbed spike kennedy had defeated the dutchman in new orleans the oregon had coaled outside of rio janeiro harbor the cape verde fleet had been seen at anchor off cadiz it had been located in the harbor of san juan porto rico it had been sighted steaming slowly past fortress monroe and the navy department reported that the st paul had discovered the lost squadron of spain in the harbor of santiago this last fact was the one which sent keating to jamaica where he was sent was a matter of indifference to keating he had worn the collar of the consolidated press for so long a time that he was callous a board meeting a mine disaster an indian uprising it was all one to keating he collected facts and his salary he had no enthusiasms he held no illusions the prestige of the mammoth syndicate he represented gained him an audience where men who wrote for one paper only were repulsed on the threshold senators governors the presidents of great trusts and railroad systems who fled from the reporter of a local paper as from a leper would send for keating and dictate to him whatever it was they wanted the people of the united states to believe for when they talked to keating they talked to many millions of readers keating in turn wrote out what they had said to him and transmitted it without color or bias to the clearinghouse of the consolidated press his stories as all newspaper writings are called by men who write them were as picturesque reading as the quotations of a stockticker the personal equation appeared no more offensively than it does in a page of typewriting in his work consequently he was dear to the heart of the consolidated press and as a safe man was sent to the beautiful harbor of santiago to a spot where there were warships cleared for action cubans in ambush naked marines fighting for a foothold at guantanamo palmtrees and coralreefs in order that he might look for facts there was not a newspaper man left at key west who did not writhe with envy and anger when he heard of it when the wire was closed for the night and they had gathered at josh kerrys keating was the stormcentre of their indignation what a chance they protested what a story its the chance of a lifetime they shook their heads mournfully and lashed themselves with pictures of its possibilities and just fancy its being wasted on old keating said the journal man why everythings likely to happen out there and whatever does happen hell make it read like a congressional record why when i heard of it i cabled the office that if the paper would send me id not ask for any salary for six months and keatings kicking because he has to go growled the sun man yes he is i saw him last night and he was sore because hed just moved his wife down here he said if hed known this was coming hed have let her stay in new york he says hell lose money on this assignment having to support himself and his wife in two different places norris the star man of the world howled with indignation good lord he said is that all he sees in it why there never was such a chance i tell you some day soon all of those warships will let loose at each other and there will be the best story that ever came over the wire and if there isnt its a regular loaf anyway its a picnic thats what it is at the expense of the consolidated press why he ought to pay them to let him go cant you see him confound him sitting under a palmtree in white flannels with a glass of jamaica rum in his fist while were dodging yellow fever on this coralreef and losing our salaries on a crooked roulettewheel i wonder what jamaica rum is like as a steady drink mused the exbaseball reporter who had been converted into a warcorrespondent by the purchase of a white yachtingcap it wont be long before keating finds out said the journal man oh i didnt know that ventured the new reporter who had just come south from boston i thought he didnt drink i never see keating in here with the rest of the boys you wouldnt said norris he only comes in here by himself and he drinks by himself hes one of those confidential drunkards you give some men whiskey and its like throwing kerosene on a fire isnt it it makes them wave their arms about and talk loud and break things but you give it to another man and its like throwing kerosene on a cork mat it just soaks in thats what keating is hes a sort of a cork mat i shouldnt think the c p would stand for that said the boston man it wouldnt if it ever interfered with his work but hes never fallen down on a story yet and the sort of stuff he writes is machinemade a man can write c p stuff in his sleep one of the world men looked up and laughed i wonder if hell run across channing out there he said the men at the table smiled a kindly indulgent smile the name seemed to act upon their indignation as a shower upon the close air of a summerday thats so said norris he wrote me last month from portauprince that he was moving on to jamaica he wrote me from that club there at the end of the wharf he said he was at that moment introducing the president to a new cocktail and as he had no money to pay his passage to kingston he was trying to persuade him to send him on there as his haitian consul he said in case he couldnt get appointed consul he had an offer to go as cook on a fruittramp the men around the table laughed it was the pleased proud laugh that flutters the family dinnertable when the infant son and heir says something precocious and impudent who is channing asked the boston man there was a pause and the correspondents looked at norris channing is a sort of a derelict he said he drifted into new york last christmas from the omaha bee hes been on pretty nearly every paper in the country whats he doing in haiti he went there on the admiral decatur to write a filibustering story about carrying arms across to cuba then the war broke out and hes been trying to get back to key west and now of course hell make for kingston he cabled me yesterday at my expense to try and get him a job on our paper if the war hadnt come on he had a plan to beat his way around the world and hed have done it too i never saw a man who wouldnt help charlie along or lend him a dollar he glanced at the faces about him and winked at the boston man they all of them look guilty dont they he said charlie channing murmured the baseball reporter gently as though he were pronouncing the name of a girl he raised his glass heres to charlie channing he repeated norris set down his empty glass and showed it to the boston man thats his only enemy he said write heavens how that man can write and hed almost rather do anything else there isnt a paper in new york that wasnt glad to get him but they couldnt keep him a week it was no use talking to him talk ive talked to him until three oclock in the morning why it was i made him send his first chinatown story to the international magazine and they took it like a flash and wrote him for more but he blew in the check they sent him and didnt even answer their letter he said after hed had the fun of writing a story he didnt care whether it was published in a sunday paper or in white vellum or never published at all and so long as he knew he wrote it he didnt care whether anyone else knew it or not why when that english reviewer whats his name that friend of kiplings passed through new york he said to a lot of us at the press club youve got a young man here on park row an opiumeater i should say by the look of him who if he would work and leave whiskey alone would make us all sweat thats just what he said and hes the best in england charlies a genius growled the baseball reporter defiantly i say hes a genius the boston man shook his head my boy he began sententiously genius is nothing more than hard work and a man norris slapped the table with his hand oh no its not he jeered fiercely and dont you go off believing it is neither ive worked ive worked twelve hours a day keating even has worked eighteen hours a day all his life but we never wrote the passing of the highbinders nor the ships that never came home nor tales of the tenderloin and we never will im a better newsgatherer than charlie i can collect facts and i can put them together well enough too so that if a man starts to read my story hell probably follow it to the bottom of the column and he may turn over the page too but i cant say the things because i cant see the things that charlie sees why one night we sent him out on a big railroadstory it was a beat wed got it by accident and we had it all to ourselves but charlie came across a blind beggar on broadway with a dead dog the dog had been run over and the blind beggar couldnt find his way home without him and was sitting on the curbstone weeping over the mongrel well when charlie came back to the office he said he couldnt find out anything about that railroad deal but that hed write them a dogstory of course they were raging crazy but he sat down just as though it was no concern of his and sure enough he wrote the dogstory and the next day over five hundred people stopped in at the office on their way downtown and left dimes and dollars to buy that man a new dog now hard work wont do that keating had been taking breakfast in the wardroom of h m s indefatigable as an acquaintance the officers had not found him an undoubted acquisition but he was the representative of seven hundred papers and when the indefatigables icemachine broke he had loaned the officers mess a hundred pounds of it from his own boat the cruisers gig carried keating to the wharf the crew tossed their oars and the boatswain touched his cap and asked mechanically shall i return to the ship sir channing stretched on the beach with his back to a palmtree observed the approach of keating with cheerful approbation it is gratifying to me he said to see the press treated with such consideration you came in just like cleopatra in her barge if the flag had been flying and you hadnt steered so badly i should have thought you were at least an admiral how many guns does the british navy give a consolidated press reporter when he comes over the side keating dropped to the sand and crossing his legs under him began tossing shells at the water they gave this one a damned good breakfast he said and some very excellent white wine of course the icemachine was broken it always is but then chablis never should be iced if its the real thing chablis ice hah snorted channing listen to him do you know what i had for breakfast keating turned away uncomfortably and looked toward the ships in the harbor well never mind said channing yawning luxuriously the sun is bright the sea is blue and the confidences of this old palm are soothing hes a great old gossip this palm he looked up into the rustling fronds and smiled he whispers me to sleep he went on or he talks me awake talks about all sorts of things things he has seen cyclones wrecks and strange ships and cuban refugees and spanish spies and lovers that meet here on moonlight nights its always moonlight in port antonio isnt it you ought to know youve been here longer than i said keating and how do you like it now that you have got to know it better pretty heavenly eh pretty heavenly snorted keating pretty much the other place what good am i doing whats the sense of keeping me here cervera isnt going to come out and the people at washington wont let sampson go in why those ships have been there a month now and theyll be there just where they are now when you and i are bald im no use here all i do is to thrash across there every day and eat up more coal than the whole squadron burns in a month why that tug of mines costing the c p six hundred dollars a day and im not sending them news enough to pay for setting it up have you seen em yet seen what your stories no the ships yes scudder took me across once in the iduna i havent got a paper yet so i couldnt write anything but well youve seen all there is to it then you wouldnt see any more if you went over every day its just the same old harbormouth and the same old morro castle and same old ships drifting up and down the brooklyn full of smokestacks and the new york with her two bridges and all the rest of them looking just as theyve looked for the last four weeks theres nothing in that why dont they send me to tampa with the army and shafter thats where the story is oh i dont know said channing shaking his head i thought it was bully bully what was bully oh the picture said channing doubtfully and and what it meant what struck me about it was that it was so hot and lazy and peaceful that they seemed to be just drifting about just what you complain of i dont know what i expected to see i think i expected theyd be racing around in circles tearing up the water and throwing broadsides at morro castle as fast as firecrackers but they lay broiling there in the heat just as though they were becalmed they seemed to be asleep on their anchorchains it reminded me of a big bulldog lying in the sun with his head on his paws and his eyes shut you think hes asleep and you try to tiptoe past him but when youre in reach of his chain hes at your throat what it seemed so funny to think of our being really at war i mean the united states and with such an oldestablished firm as spain it seems so presumptuous in a young republic as though we were strutting around singing im getting a big boy now i felt like saying oh come off and stop playing youre a world power and get back into your red sash and knickerbockers or youll get spanked it seems as though we must be such a lot of amateurs but when i went over the side of the new york i felt like kneeling down on her deck and begging every jackey to kick me i felt about as useless as a fly on a locomotiveengine amateurs why they might have been in the business since the days of the ark all of them might have been descended from bloody pirates they twisted those eightinch guns around for us just as though they were bicycles and the whole ship moved and breathed and thought too like a human being and all the captains of the other warships about her were watching for her to give the word all of them stripped and eager and ready like a lot of jockeys holding in the big racehorses and each of them with his eyes on the starter and i liked the way they all talk about sampson and the way the ships move over the stations like parts of one machine just as he had told them to do scudder introduced me to him and he listened while we did the talking but it was easy to see who was the man in the conning tower keating my boy channing cried sitting upright in his enthusiasm hes put a combinationlock on that harbor that cant be picked and itll work whether sampsons asleep in his berth or fifteen miles away or killed on the bridge he doesnt have to worry he knows his trap will work he ought to he set it keating shrugged his shoulders tolerantly oh i see that side of it he assented i see all there is in it for you the sort of stuff you write sundayspecial stuff but theres no news in it im not paid to write mailletters and im not down here to interview palmtrees either why you old fraud laughed channing you know youre having the time of your life here youre the pet of kingston society you know you are i only wish i were half as popular i dont seem to belong do i i guess its my clothes that english colonel at kingston always scowls at me as though hed like to put me in irons and whenever i meet our consul he sees something very peculiar on the horizonline keating frowned for a moment in silence and then coughed consciously channing he began uncomfortably you ought to brace up brace up asked channing well it isnt fair to the rest of us protested keating launching into his grievance theres only a few of us here and we we think you ought to see that and not give the crowd a bad name all the other correspondents have some regard for for their position and for the paper but you loaf around here looking like an old tramp like any old beachcomber and it queers the rest of us why those english artillerymen at the club asked me about you and when i told them you were a new york correspondent they made all sorts of jokes about american newspapers and what could i say channing eyed the other man with keen delight i see by jove im sorry he said but the next moment he laughed and then apologized remorsefully indeed i beg your pardon he begged but it struck me as a sort of i had no idea you fellows were such swells i knew i was a social outcast but i didnt know my being a social outcast was hurting anyone else tell me some more well thats all said keating suspiciously the fellows asked me to speak to you about it and to tell you to take a brace now for instance we have a sort of messtable at the hotels and wed like to ask you to belong but well you see how it is we have the officers to lunch whenever theyre on shore and youre so disreputable keating scowled at channing and concluded impotently why dont you get yourself some decent clothes and and a new hat channing removed his hat to his knee and stroked it with affectionate pity it is a shocking bad hat he said well go on oh its none of my business exclaimed keating impatiently im just telling you what theyre saying now theres the cuban refugees for instance no one knows what theyre doing here or whether theyre real cubans or spaniards well what of it why the way you go round with them and visit them its no wonder they say youre a spy channing stared incredulously and then threw back his head and laughed with a shout of delight they dont do they he asked yes they do since you think its so funny if it hadnt been for us the day you went over to guantanamo the marines would have had you arrested and courtmartialed channings face clouded with a quick frown oh he exclaimed in a hurt voice they couldnt have thought that well no keating admitted grudgingly not after the fight perhaps but before that when you were snooping around the camp like a cuban after rations channing recognized the picture with a laugh i do he said i do but you should have had me courtmartialed and shot it would have made a good story our reporter shot as a spy his last words were what were my last words keating keating turned upon him with impatience but why do you do it he demanded why dont you act like the rest of us why do you hang out with all those filibusters and runaway cubans they have been very kind to me said channing soberly they are a very courteous race and they have ideas of hospitality which make the average new yorker look like a dog hiding a bone oh i suppose you mean that for us demanded keating thats a slap at me eh channing gave a sigh and threw himself back against the trunk of the palm with his hands clasped behind his head oh i wasnt thinking of you at all keating he said i dont consider you in the least he stretched himself and yawned wearily ive got troubles of my own he sat up suddenly and adjusted the objectionable hat to his head why dont you wire the c p he asked briskly and see if they dont want an extra man it wont cost you anything to wire and i need the job and i havent the money to cable the consolidated press began keating jealously why well you know what the consolidated press is they dont want descriptive writers and ive got all the men i need keating rose and stood hesitating in some embarrassment ill tell you what i could do channing he said i could take you on as a stoker or steward say theyre always deserting and mutinying i have to carry a gun on me to make them mind how would you like that forty dollars a month and eat with the crew for a moment channing stood in silence smoothing the sand with the sole of his shoe when he raised his head his face was flushing oh thank you he said i think ill keep on trying for a paper ill try a little longer i want to see something of this war of course and if im not too lazy id like to write something about it but well im much obliged to you anyway of course if it were my money id take you on at once said keating hurriedly channing smiled and nodded youre very kind he answered well goodby a halfhour later in the smokingroom of the hotel keating addressed himself to a group of correspondents there is no doing anything with that man channing he said in a tone of offended pride i offered him a good job and he wouldnt take it because he got a story in the international magazine hes stuck on himself and he wont hustle for news he wants to write pipedreams what the public wants just now is news thats it said one of the group and we must give it to them even if we have to fake it great events followed each other with great rapidity the army ceased beating time shook itself together adjusted its armor and moved and to the delight of the flotilla of pressboats at port antonio moved not as it had at first intended to the north coast of cuba but to santiago where its transports were within reach of their megaphones why everythings coming our way now exclaimed the world manager in ecstasy weve got the transports to starboard at siboney and the warships to port at santiago and all well need to do is to sit on the deck with a fieldglass and take down the news with both hands channing followed these events with envy once or twice as a special favor the pressboats carried him across to siboney and daiquiri and he was able to write stories of what he saw there of the landing of the army of the wounded after the guasimas fight and of the fevercamp at siboney his friends on the pressboats sent this work home by mail on the chance that the sunday editor might take it at space rates but mail matter moved slowly and the army moved quickly and events crowded so closely upon each other that channings stories when they reached new york were ancient history and were unpublished and what was of more importance to him unpaid for he had no money now and he had become a beachcomber in the real sense of the word he slept the warm nights away among the bananas and cocoanuts on the fruit companys wharf and by calling alternately on his cuban exiles and the different pressboats he was able to obtain a meal a day without arousing any suspicions in the minds of his hosts that it was his only one he was sitting on the stringer of the pierhead one morning waiting for a pressboat from the front when the three friends ran in and lowered her dingy and the world manager came ashore clasping a precious bundle of closely written cableforms channing scrambled to his feet and hailed him have you heard from the chief about me yet he asked the world man frowned and stammered and then taking channing by the arm hurried with him toward the cableoffice charlie i think theyre crazy up there he began they think they know it all here i am on the spot but they think you mean they wont have me said channing but why he asked patiently they used to give me all the space i wanted yes i know confound them and so they should now said the world man with sympathetic indignation but heres their cable you can see its not my fault he read the message aloud channing no not safe take reliable man from siboney he folded the cablegram around a dozen others and stuck it back in his hippocket what queered you charlie he explained importantly was that last break of yours new years when you didnt turn up for a week it was once too often and the chiefs had it in for you ever since you remember channing screwed up his lips in an effort of recollection yes i remember he answered slowly it began on new years eve in perrys drugstore and i woke up a week later in a hack in boston so i didnt have such a run for my money did i not good enough to have to pay for it like this i tell you he burst out suddenly i feel like hell being left out of this war with all the rest of the boys working so hard if it werent playing it low down on the fellows that have been in it from the start id like to enlist but they enlisted for glory and id only do it because i cant see the war any other way and it doesnt seem fair to them what do you think oh dont do that protested the world manager you stick to your own trade well get you something to do have you tried the consolidated press yet channing smiled grimly at the recollection yes i tried it first it would be throwing pearls to swine to have you write for them i know but theyre using so many men now i should think you could get on their boat no i saw keating channing explained he said i could come along as a stoker and i guess ill take him up it seems keating said what exclaimed the world man keating why he stands to lose his own job if he isnt careful if it wasnt that hes just married the c p boys would have reported him a dozen times reported him what for why you know his old complaint oh that said channing my old complaint he added well yes but keating hasnt been sober for two weeks and hed have fallen down on the guasimas story if those men hadnt pulled him through they had to because theyre in the syndicate he ought to go shoot himself hes only been married three months and hes handling the biggest piece of news the countrys had in thirty years and he cant talk straight theres a time for everything i say growled the world man it takes it out of a man this boatwork channing ventured in extenuation its very hard on him you bet it is agreed the world manager with enthusiasm sloshing about in those waves seasick mostly and wet all the time and with a mutinous crew and so afraid youll miss something that you cant write what you have got then he added as an afterthought and our cruisers thinking youre a spanish torpedoboat and chucking shells at you no wonder keating drinks channing said gravely you make it seem almost necessary many thousand american soldiers had lost themselves in a jungle and had broken out of it at the foot of san juan hill not wishing to return into the jungle they took the hill on the day they did this channing had the good fortune to be in siboney the world man had carried him there and asked him to wait around the waterfront while he went up to the real front thirteen miles inland channings duty was to signal the pressboat when the first despatchrider rode in with word that the battle was on the world man would have liked to ask channing to act as his despatchrider but he did not do so because the despatchriders were either jamaica negroes or newsboys from park row and he remembered that keating had asked channing to be his stoker channing tramped through the damp illsmelling sand of the beach sick with selfpity on the other side of those glaring inscrutable mountains a battle glorious dramatic and terrible was going forward and he was thirteen miles away he was at the base with the supplies the sick and the skulkers it was cruelly hot the heatwaves flashed over the sea until the transports in the harbor quivered like pictures on a biograph from the refuse of company kitchens from reeking huts from thousands of empty cans rose foul enervating odors which deadened the senses like a drug the atmosphere steamed with a heavy moist humidity channing staggered and sank down suddenly on a pile of railroadties in front of the commissarys depot there were some cubans seated near him dividing their government rations and the sight reminded him that he had had nothing to eat he walked over to the wide door of the freightdepot where a whitehaired kindly faced and perspiring officer was with his own hands serving out canned beef to a line of cubans the officers flannel shirt was open at the throat the shoulderstraps of a colonel were fastened to it by safetypins channing smiled at him uneasily could i draw on you for some rations he asked im from the three friends im not one of their regular accredited correspondents he added conscientiously im just helping them for today havent you got a correspondents pass asked the officer he was busily pouring square hardtack down the throat of a saddlebag a cuban soldier held open before him no said channing turning away im just helping the officer looked after him and what he saw caused him to reach under the counter for a tin cup and a bottle of limejuice here he said drink this whats the matter with you fever come in here out of that sun you can lie down on my cot if you like channing took the tin cup and swallowed a warm mixture of boiled water and acrid limejuice thank you he said but i must keep watch for the first news from the front a man riding a government mule appeared on the bridge of the lower trail and came toward them at a gallop he was followed and surrounded by a hurrying mob of volunteers hospital stewards and cubans the colonel vaulted the counter and ran to meet him this looks like news from the front now he cried the man on the mule was from civil life his eyes bulged from their sockets and his face was purple the sweat ran over it and glistened on the cords of his thick neck theyre driving us back he shrieked chaffees killed an roosevelts killed an the whole armys beaten he waved his arms wildly toward the glaring inscrutable mountains the volunteers and stevedores and cubans heard him openmouthed and with panicstricken eyes in the pitiless sunlight he was a hideous and awful spectacle theyre driving us into the sea he foamed weve got to get out of here theyre just behind me the armys running for its life theyre running away channing saw the man dimly through a cloud that came between him and the yellow sunlight the man in the saddle swayed the group about him swayed like persons on the floor of a vast ballroom inside he burned with a mad fierce hatred for this shrieking figure in the saddle he raised the tin cup and hurled it so that it hit the mans purple face you lie channing shouted staggering you lie youre a damned coward you lie he heard his voice repeating this in different places at greater distances then the cloud closed about him shutting out the man in the saddle and the glaring inscrutable mountains and the ground at his feet rose and struck him in the face channing knew he was on a boat because it lifted and sank with him and he could hear the rush of her engines when he opened his eyes he was in the wheelhouse of the three friends and her captain was at the wheel smiling down at him channing raised himself on his elbow the despatchrider he asked thats all right said the captain soothingly dont you worry he come along same time you fell and brought you out to us what ailed you sunstroke channing sat up i guess so he said when the three friends reached port antonio channing sought out the pile of coffeebags on which he slept at night and dropped upon them before this he had been careful to avoid the place in the daytime so that no one might guess that it was there that he slept at night but this day he felt that if he should drop in the gutter he would not care whether anyone saw him there or not his limbs were hot and heavy and refused to support him his bones burned like quicklime the next morning with the fever still upon him he hurried restlessly between the wharves and the cableoffice seeking for news there was much of it it was great and trying news the situation outside of santiago was grim and critical the men who had climbed san juan hill were clinging to it like sailors shipwrecked on a reef unwilling to remain but unable to depart if they attacked the city cervera promised to send it crashing about their ears they would enter santiago only to find it in ruins if they abandoned the hill killed and wounded would have been sacrificed in vain the warcritics of the pressboats and of the twitchell house saw but two courses left open either sampson must force the harbor and destroy the squadron and so make it possible for the army to enter the city or the army must be reinforced with artillery and troops in sufficient numbers to make it independent of sampson and indifferent to cervera on the night of july d a thousand lies a thousand rumors a thousand prophecies rolled through the streets of port antonio were filed at the cableoffice and flashed to the bulletinboards of new york city that morning so they told the batteries on morro castle had sunk three of sampsons ships the batteries on morro castle had surrendered to sampson general miles with reinforcements had sailed from charleston eighty guns had started from tampa bay they would occupy the mountains opposite santiago and shell the spanish fleet the authorities at washington had at last consented to allow sampson to run the forts and mines and attack the spanish fleet the army had not been fed for two days the spaniards had cut it off from its base at siboney the army would eat its fourth of july dinner in the governors palace the army was in full retreat the army was to attack at daybreak when channing turned in under the fruitshed on the night of july d there was but one pressboat remaining in the harbor that was the consolidated press boat and keating himself was on the wharf signalling for his dingy channing sprang to his feet and ran toward him calling him by name the thought that he must for another day remain so near the march of great events and yet not see and feel them for himself was intolerable he felt if it would pay his passage to the coast of cuba there was no sacrifice to which he would not stoop keating watched him approach but without sign of recognition his eyes were heavy and bloodshot keating channing begged as he halted panting wont you take me with you ill not be in the way and ill stoke or wait on table or anything you want if youll only take me keatings eyes opened and closed sleepily he removed an unlit cigar from his mouth and shook the wet end of it at channing as though it were an accusing finger i know your game he murmured thickly you havent got a boat and you want to steal a ride on mine for your paper you cant do it you see you cant do it one of the crew of the dingy climbed up the gangway of the wharf and took keating by the elbow he looked at him and then at channing and winked he was apparently accustomed to this complication i havent got a paper keating channing argued soothingly who have you got to help you he asked it came to him that there might be on the boat some philip sober to whom he could appeal from philip drunk i havent got anyone to help me keating answered with dignity i dont need anyone to help me he placed his hand heavily and familiarly on the shoulder of the deckhand you see that man he asked you see tha man do you well tha man hes too good for me an you tha man used to be the best reporter in new york city an he was too good to hustle for news an now hes now he cant get a job see nobodyll have him see hes got to come and be a stoker he stamped his foot with indignation you come an be a stoker he commanded how long you think im going to wait for a stoker you stoker come on board and be a stoker channing smiled guiltily at his good fortune he jumped into the bow of the dingy and keating fell heavily in the stern the captain of the pressboat helped keating safely to a bunk in the cabin and received his instructions to proceed to santiago harbor then he joined channing mr keating is feeling bad tonight that bombardment off morro he explained tactfully was too exciting we always let him sleep going across and when we get there hes fresh as a daisy whats this he tells me of your doing stoking i thought there might be another fight tomorrow so i said id come as a stoker the captain grinned our sam that deckhand was telling me he said mr keating put it on you sort of to spite you is that so oh i wanted to come said channing the captain laughed comprehendingly i guess well be in a bad way he said when we need you in the engineroom he settled himself for conversation with his feet against the rail and his thumbs in his suspenders the lamps of port antonio were sinking into the water the moonlight was flooding the deck that was quite something of a bombardment sampson put up against morro castle this morning he began critically he spoke of bombardments from the full experience of a man who had seen shells strike off coney island from the provinggrounds at sandy hook but channing heard him eagerly he begged the tugboatcaptain to tell him what it looked like and as the captain told him he filled it in and saw it as it really was perhaps theyll bombard again tomorrow he hazarded hopefully we cant tell till we see how theyre placed on the station the captain answered if theres any firing we ought to hear it about eight oclock tomorrow morning well hear em before we see em channings conscience began to tweak him it was time he thought that keating should be aroused and brought up to the reviving air of the sea but when he reached the foot of the companionladder he found that keating was already awake and in the act of drawing the cork from a bottle his irritation against channing had evaporated and he greeted him with sleepy goodhumor why its ol charlie channing he exclaimed drowsily channing advanced upon him swiftly here youve had enough of that he commanded well be off morro by breakfasttime you dont want that keating giggling foolishly pushed him from him and retreated with the bottle toward his berth he lurched into it rolled over with his face to the ships side and began breathing heavily you leave me lone he murmured from the darkness of the bunk you mind your own business you leave me lone channing returned to the bow and placed the situation before the captain that gentleman did not hesitate he disappeared down the companionway and when an instant later he returned hurled a bottle over the ships side the next morning when channing came on deck the land was just in sight a rampart of dark green mountains rising in heavy masses against the bright glaring blue of the sky he strained his eyes for the first sight of the ships and his ears for the faintest echoes of distant firing but there was no sound save the swift rush of the waters at the bow the sea lay smooth and flat before him the sun flashed upon it the calm and hush of early morning hung over the whole coast of cuba an hour later the captain came forward and stood at his elbow hows keating channing asked i tried to wake him but i couldnt the captain kept his binoculars to his eyes and shut his lips grimly mr keatings very bad he said he had another bottle hidden somewhere and all last night he broke off with a relieved sigh its lucky for him he added lowering the glasses that therell be no fight today channing gave a gasp of disappointment what do you mean he protested you can look for yourself said the captain handing him the glasses theyre at their same old stations therell be no bombardment today thats the iowa nearest us the oregons to starboard of her and the next is the indiana that little fellow close under the land is the gloucester he glanced up at the mast to see that the pressboats signal was conspicuous they were drawing within range with the naked eye channing could see the monster mousecolored warships basking in the sun solemn and motionless in a great crescent with its one horn resting off the harbormouth they made great blots on the sparkling glancing surface of the water above each superstructure their fightingtops giant davits funnels and gibbetlike yards twisted into the air fantastic and incomprehensible but the bulk below seemed to rest solidly on the bottom of the ocean like an island of lead the muzzles of their guns peered from the turrets as from ramparts of rock channing gave a sigh of admiration dont tell me they move he said theyre not ships theyre fortresses on the shore there was no sign of human life nor of human habitation except for the spanish flag floating over the streaked walls of morro and the tiny blockhouse on every mountaintop the squadron might have been anchored off a deserted coast the hills rose from the waters edge like a wall their peaks green and glaring in the sun their valleys dark with shadows nothing moved upon the white beach at their feet no smoke rose from their ridges not even a palm stirred the great range slept in a blue haze of heat but only a few miles distant masked by its frowning front lay a gayly colored redroofed city besieged by encircling regiments a broad bay holding a squadron of great warships and gliding catlike through its choked undergrowth and crouched among the fronds of its motionless palms were the ragged patriots of the cuban army silent watchful waiting but the great range gave no sign it frowned in the sunlight grim and impenetrable its sunday exclaimed the captain he pointed with his finger at the decks of the battleships where hundreds of snowwhite figures had gone to quarters its church service he said or its general inspection channing looked at his watch it was thirty minutes past nine its church service he said i can see them carrying out the chaplains readingdesk on the indiana the pressboat pushed her way nearer into the circle of battleships until their leadenhued hulls towered high above her on the deck of each the ships company stood ranged in motionless ranks the calm of a sabbath morning hung about them the sun fell upon them like a benediction and so still was the air that those on the pressboat could hear from the stripped and naked decks the voices of the men answering the rollcall in rising monotone one two three four one two three four the whiteclad sailors might have been a chorus of surpliced choirboys but up above them the battleflags slumbering at the mastheads stirred restlessly and whimpered in their sleep out through the crack in the wall of mountains where the sea runs in to meet the waters of santiago harbor and from behind the shield of morro castle a great gray ship like a great gray rat stuck out her nose and peered about her and then struck boldly for the open sea high before her she bore the gold and bloodred flag of spain and like a fugitive leaping from behind his prisonwalls she raced forward for her freedom to give battle to meet her death a shell from the iowa shrieked its warning in a shrill crescendo a flutter of flags painted their message against the sky the enemys ships are coming out they signalled and the ranks of whiteclad figures which the moment before stood motionless on the decks broke into thousands of separate beings who flung themselves panting down the hatchways or sprang cheering to the fightingtops heavily but swiftly as islands slip into the water when a volcano shakes the oceanbed the great battleships buried their bows in the sea their sides ripped apart with flame and smoke the thunder of their guns roared and beat against the mountains and from the shore the spanish forts roared back at them until the air between was split and riven the spanish warships were already scudding clouds of smoke pierced with flashes of red flame and as they fled fighting their batteries rattled with unceasing feverish fury but the guns of the american ships straining in pursuit answered steadily carefully with relentless accuracy with cruel persistence at regular intervals they boomed above the hurricane of sound like great bells tolling for the dead it seemed to channing that he had lived through many years that the strain of the spectacle would leave its mark upon his nerves forever he had been buffeted and beaten by a storm of all the great emotions pride of race and country pity for the dead agony for the dying who clung to blistering armorplates or sank to suffocation in the sea the lust of the hunter when the hunted thing is a fellowman the joys of danger and of excitement when the shells lashed the waves about him and the triumph of victory final overwhelming and complete four of the enemys squadron had struck their colors two were on the beach broken and burning two had sunk to the bottom of the sea two were in abject flight three battleships were hammering them with thirteeninch guns the battle was won its all over channing said his tone questioned his own words the captain of the tugboat was staring at the face of his silver watch as though it were a thing bewitched he was pale and panting he looked at channing piteously as though he doubted his own senses and turned the face of the watch toward him twenty minutes channing said good god twenty minutes he had been to hell and back again in twenty minutes he had seen an empire which had begun with christopher columbus and which had spread over two continents wiped off the map in twenty minutes the captain gave a sudden cry of concern mr keating he gasped oh lord but i forgot mr keating where is mr keating i went below twice channing answered hes insensible see what you can do with him but first take me to the iowa the consolidated press will want the facts in the dark cabin the captain found keating on the floor where channing had dragged him and dripping with the water which channing had thrown in his face he was breathing heavily comfortably he was not concerned with battles with a megaphone channing gathered his facts from an officer of the iowa who looked like a chimneysweep and who was surrounded by a crew of halfnaked pirates with bodies streaked with sweat and powder then he ordered all steam for port antonio and going forward to the chartroom seated himself at the captains desk and pushing the captains charts to the floor spread out his elbows and began to write the story of his life in the joy of creating it he was lost to all about him he did not know that the engines driven to the breakingpoint were filling the ship with their groans and protests that the deck beneath his feet was quivering like the floor of a planingmill nor that his fever was rising again and feeding on his veins the turmoil of leaping engines and of throbbing pulses was confused with the story he was writing and while his mind was inflamed with pictures of warring battleships his body was swept by the fever which overran him like an army of tiny mice touching his hot skin with cold tingling taps of their scampering feet from time to time the captain stopped at the door of the chartroom and observed him in silent admiration to the man who with difficulty composed a letter to his family the fact that channing was writing something to be read by millions of people and more rapidly than he could have spoken the same words seemed a superhuman effort he even hesitated to interrupt it by an offer of food but the fever would not let channing taste of the food when they placed it at his elbow and even as he pushed it away his mind was still fixed upon the paragraph before him he wrote sprawling across the desk covering page upon page with giant hieroglyphics lighting cigarette after cigarette at the end of the last one but with his thoughts far away and as he performed the act staring uncomprehendingly at the captains colored calendar pinned on the wall before him for many months later the battle of santiago was associated in his mind with a calendar for the month of july illuminated by a colored picture of six white kittens in a basket at three oclock channing ceased writing and stood up shivering and shaking with a violent chill he cursed himself for this weakness and called aloud for the captain i cant stop now he cried he seized the rough fist of the captain as a child clings to the hand of his nurse give me something he begged medicine quinine give me something to keep my head straight until its finished go quick he commanded his teeth were chattering and his body jerked with sharp uncontrollable shudders the captain ran muttering to his medicinechest weve got one drunken man on board he said to the mate and now weve got a crazy one you mark my words hell go off his head at sunset but at sunset channing called to him and addressed him sanely he held in his hand a mass of papers carefully numbered and arranged and he gave them up to the captain as though it hurt him to part with them theres the story he said youve got to do the rest i cant iim going to be very ill he was swaying as he spoke his eyes burned with the fever and his eyelids closed of themselves he looked as though he had been heavily drugged you put that on the wire at port antonio he commanded faintly pay the tolls to kingston from there they are to send it by way of panama you understand by the panama wire panama gasped the captain good lord thats two dollars a word he shook out the pages in his hand until he found the last one and theres sixtyeight pages here he expostulated why the tolls will be five thousand dollars channing dropped feebly to the bench of the chartroom and fell in a heap shivering and trembling i guess its worth it he murmured drowsily the captain was still staring at the last page but but look here he cried youve youve signed mr keatings name to it james r keating youve signed his name to it channing raised his head from his folded arms and stared at him dully you dont want to get keating in trouble do you he asked with patience you dont want the c p to know why he couldnt write the best story of the war do you want him to lose his job of course you dont well then let it go as his story i wont tell and see you dont tell and keating wont remember his head sank back again upon his crossed arms its not a bad story he murmured but the captain shook his head his loyalty to his employer was still uppermost it doesnt seem right he protested its a sort of a liberty isnt it signing another mans name to it its a sort of forgery channing made no answer his eyes were shut and he was shivering violently hugging himself in his arms a quarter of an hour later when the captain returned with fresh quinine channing sat upright and saluted him your information sir he said addressing the open door politely is of the greatest value tell the executive officer to proceed under full steam to panama he will first fire a shot across her bows and then sink her he sprang upright and stood for a moment sustained by the false strength of the fever to panama you hear me he shouted he beat the floor with his foot faster faster faster he cried weve got a great story we want a clear wire we want the wire clear from panama to city hall its the greatest story ever written full of facts facts facts facts for the consolidated press and keating wrote it i tell you keating wrote it i saw him write it i was a stoker on the same ship the mate and crew came running forward and stood gaping stupidly through the doors and windows of the chartroom channing welcomed them joyously and then crumpled up in a heap and pitched forward into the arms of the captain his head swung weakly from shoulder to shoulder i beg your pardon he muttered i beg your pardon captain but your engineroom is too hot im only a stoker and i know my place sir but i tell you your engineroom is too hot its a burning hell sir its a hell the captain nodded to the crew and they closed in on him and bore him struggling feebly to a bunk in the cabin below in the berth opposite keating was snoring peacefully after the six weeks siege the fruit companys doctor told channing he was cured and that he might walk abroad in this first walk he found that during his illness port antonio had reverted to her original condition of complete isolation from the world the pressboats had left her wharves the correspondents had departed from the veranda of her only hotel the war was over and the peace commissioners had sailed for paris channing expressed his great gratitude to the people of the hotel and to the fruit companys doctor he made it clear to them that if they ever hoped to be paid those lesser debts than that of gratitude which he still owed them they must return him to new york and newspaper row it was either that he said or if they preferred he would remain and work out his indebtedness checking bunches of bananas at twenty dollars a month the fruit company decided it would be paid more quickly if channing worked at his own trade and accordingly sent him north in one of its steamers she landed him in boston and he borrowed five dollars from the chief engineer to pay his way to new york it was late in the evening of the same day when he stepped out of the smokingcar into the roar and riot of the grand central station he had no baggage to detain him and as he had no money either he made his way to an italian restaurant where he knew they would trust him to pay later for what he ate it was a place where the newspaper men were accustomed to meet men who knew him and who until he found work would lend him money to buy a bath clean clothes and a hall bedroom norris the world man greeted him as he entered the door of the restaurant and hailed him with a cry of mingled fright and pleasure why we didnt know but you were dead he exclaimed the boys said when they left kingston you werent expected to live did you ever get the money and things we sent you by the red cross boat channing glanced at himself and laughed do i look it he asked he was wearing the same clothes in which he had slept under the fruitsheds at port antonio they had been soaked and stained by the nightdews and by the sweat of the fever well its great luck your turning up here just now norris assured him heartily that is if youre as hungry as the rest of the boys are who have had the fever you struck it just right were giving a big dinner here tonight he explained one of marias best you come in with me its a celebration for old keating a farewell blowout channing started and laughed keating he asked thats funny he said i havent seen him since since before i was ill yes old jimmie keating youve got nothing against him have you channing shook his head vehemently and norris glanced back complacently toward the door of the diningroom from whence came the sound of intimate revelry you might have had once norris said laughing we were all up against him once but since hes turned out such a wonder and a warhero were going to recognize it theyre always saying we newspaper men have it in for each other and so were just giving him this subscriptiondinner to show its not so hes going abroad you know he sails tomorrow morning no i didnt know said channing of course not how could you well the consolidated presss sending him and his wife to paris hes to cover the peace negotiations there its really a honeymoontrip at the expense of the c p its their reward for his work for his santiago story and the beat and all that channings face expressed his bewilderment norris drew back dramatically dont tell me he exclaimed that you havent heard about that channing laughed a short frightened laugh and moved nearer to the street no he said no i hadnt yes but good lord it was the story of the war you never read such a story and he got it through by panama a day ahead of all the other stories and nobody read them anyway why captain mahan said it was naval history and the evening post had an editorial on it and said it was the only piece of literature the war has produced we never thought keating had it in him did you the consolidated press people felt so good over it that theyve promised when he comes back from paris theyll make him their washington correspondent hes their star reporter now it just shows you that the occasion produces the man come on in and have a drink with him channing pulled his arm away and threw a frightened look toward the open door of the diningroom through the layers of tobaccosmoke he saw keating seated at the head of a long crowded table smiling cleareyed and alert oh no i couldnt he said with sudden panic i cant drink doctor wont let me i wasnt coming in i was just passing when i saw you goodnight im much obliged goodnight but the hospitable norris would not be denied oh come in and say goodby to him anyhow he insisted you neednt stay no i cant channing protested i theyd make me drink or eat and the doctor says i cant you mustnt tempt me you say goodby to him for me he urged and norris tell him tell him that i asked you to say to him its all right thats all just that its all right hell understand there was the sound of mens feet scraping on the floor and of chairs being moved from their places norris started away eagerly i guess theyre drinking his health he said i must go ill tell him what you said its all right thats enough is it theres nothing more channing shook his head and moved away from the only place where he was sure to find food and a welcome that night theres nothing more he said as he stepped from the door and stood irresolutely in the twilight of the street he heard the voices of the men who had gathered in keatings honor upraised in a joyous chorus for hes a jolly good fellow they sang for hes a jolly good fellow which nobody can deny la lettre damour when bardini who led the hungarian band at the savoy restaurant was promoted to play at the casino at trouville his place was taken by the second violin the second violin was a boy and when he greeted his brother tziganes and the habitues of the restaurant with an apologetic and deprecatory bow he showed that he was fully conscious of the inadequacy of his years the maitre dhotel glided from table to table busying himself in explanations the boys name is edouard he comes from budapest he said the season is too late to make it worth the while of the management to engage a new chef dorchestre so this boy will play he plays very good but he is not like bardini he was not in the least like bardini in appearance bardini suggested a roumanian gypsy or a portuguese sailor his skin was deeply tanned his hair was plastered on his low forehead in thick oily curls and his body through much rich living on the scraps that fell from the tables of girots and the casino des fleurs was stout and gross he was the typical leader of an orchestra condemned to entertain a noisy restaurant his school of music was the school of maxims to his skill with the violin he had added the arts of the head waiter and he and the cook ran a race for popularity he pampering to one taste and the cook with his sauces pampering to another when so commanded his pride as an artist did not prevent him from breaking off in the middle of schuberts serenade to play daisy bell nor was he above breaking it off on his own accord to salute the american patron as he entered with the belle of new york or any one of the gaiety girls hurrying in late for supper with the soldiers in the park when he walked slowly through the restaurant pausing at each table his eyes even while they ogled the women to whom he played followed the brother tzigane who was passing the plate and noted which of the patrons gave silver and which gave gold edouard the second violin was all that bardini was not consequently he was entirely unsuited to lead an orchestra in a restaurant indeed so little did he understand of what was required of him that on the only occasion when bardini sent him to pass the plate he was so unsophisticated as not to hide the sixpences and shillings under the napkin and so leave only the halfcrowns and gold pieces exposed and instead of smiling mockingly at those who gave the sixpences and waiting for them to give more he even looked grateful and at the same time deeply ashamed he differed from bardini also in that he was very thin and tall with the serious smoothshaven face of a priest except for his fantastic costume there was nothing about him to recall the poses of the musician his hair was neither long nor curly it lay straight across his forehead and flat on either side and when he played his eyes neither sought out the admiring auditor nor invited his applause on the contrary they looked steadfastly ahead it was as though they belonged to someone apart who was listening intently to the music but in the waits between the numbers the boys eyes turned from table to table observing the people in his audience he knew nearly all of them by sight the head waiters who brought him their commands and his brothermusicians had often discussed them in his hearing they represented every city of the world every part of the social edifice there were those who came to look at the spectacle and those who came to be looked at those who gave a dinner for the sake of the diners those who dined for the dinner alone to some the restaurant was a club others ventured in counting the cost taking it seriously even considering that it conferred upon them some social distinction there were pretty women in paint and spangles with conscious halfgrown boys just up from oxford companypromoters dining and wining possible subscribers or guineapigs into an acquiescent state guardsmen giving a dinner of farewell to brotherofficers departing for the soudan or the cape wideeyed americans just off the steamer in high dresses great ladies in low dresses and lofty tiaras and ladies of the stage utterly unconscious of the boon they were conferring on the people about them who an hour before had paid ten shillings to look at them from the stalls edouard as he sat with his violin on his knee his fingers fretting the silent strings observed them all without envy and without interest had he been able to choose it would not have been to such a welldressed mob as this that he would have given his music for at times a burst of laughter killed a phrase that was sacred to him and sometimes the murmur of the voices and the clatter of the waiters would drown him out altogether but the artist in him forced him to play all things well and for his own comfort he would assure himself that no doubt somewhere in the room someone was listening someone who thought more of the strange elusive melodies of the hungarian folksongs than of the chefs entrees and that for this unknown one he must be true to himself and true to his work covertly he would seek out some face to which he could make the violin speak not openly and impertinently as did bardini but secretly and for sympathy so that only one could understand it pleased young edouard to see such a one raise her head as though she had heard her name spoken and hold it poised to listen and turn slowly in her chair so completely engaged that she forgot the man at her elbow and the food before her was taken away untouched it delighted him to think that she knew that the music was speaking to her alone but he would not have had her think that the musician spoke too it was the soul of the music not his soul that was reaching out to the pretty stranger when his soul spoke through the music it would not be so he assured himself to such chatterers as gathered on the terrace of the savoy restaurant mrs warriner and her daughter were on their way home or to one of their homes this one was up the hills of lenox they had been in egypt and up the nile and for the last two months had been slowly working their way north through greece and italy they were in london at the savoy waiting for their sailingday and on the night of their arrival young corbin was giving them a dinner for three months mrs warriner and himself had alternated in giving each other dinners in every part of southern europe and the gloom which hung over this one was not due to the fact that the diners had become wearied of one anothers society but that the opportunities still left to them for this exchange of hospitality were almost at an end that night for the hundredth time young corbin had decided it would have been much better for him if they had come to an end many weeks previous for the part he played in the trio was a difficult one it was that of the lover who will not take no for an answer the lover who will take no and goes on his way disconsolate may live to love another day and everyone is content but the one who will not have no who will not hear of it nor consider it has much to answer for in making life a burden to himself and all around him when corbin joined the warriners on their trip up the nile it was considered by all of them in their ignorance a happy accident other mothers more worldly than mrs warriner with daughters less attractive gave her undeserved credit for having lured into her party one of the young men of boston who was most to be desired as a soninlaw but the mind of mrs warriner so far as mr corbin was concerned was quite free from any such consideration so was the mind of the young bachelor certainly miss warriner held no tender thoughts concerning him the families of the warriners and the corbins had been friends ever since the cowpath crossed the common before corbin entered harvard miss warriner and he had belonged to the same dancingclass later she had danced with him at four classdays and many times between when he graduated she had gone abroad with her mother and he had joined the somerset club and played polo at prides crossing and talked vaguely of becoming a lawyer and of reentering harvard by the door of the law school chiefly it was supposed that he might have another year of the football team he was very young in spirit very big and athletic very rich and without a care or serious thought miss warriner was to him then no more than a friend to her he was a boy one of many nice cultivated harvard boys who occasionally called upon her and talked football on the face of things she was not the sort of girl he should have loved but for some saving clause in him he should have loved and married one of the many other girls who had belonged to the same dancingclass who would have been known as mrs tom corbin who would have been sought after as a chaperone and who would have stood up in her cart when he played polo and shouted at him across the field to ride him off miss warriner on the contrary was much older than he in everything but years and was conscious of the fact she was a serious selfcentred young person and satisfied with her own thoughts unless her companion gave her better ones she concerned herself with the character and ideas of her friends if a young man lacked ideas the fact that he possessed wealth and good manners could not save him if these attributes had been pointed out to her as part of his assets she would have been surprised she was not impressed with her own good looks and fortune she took them for granted so why should they count with her in other people miss warriner made an error of analysis in regard to mr corbin in judging his brain by his topics of conversation his conversation was limited to the a b cs of life with which up to the time of his meeting her his brain had been fed when however she began to cram it full with all the other letters of the alphabet it showed itself just as capable of digesting the economic conditions of egypt as it had previously succeeded in mastering the chesslike problems of the game of football young corbin had not considered the home beautiful nor municipal government nor how the other half lives as topics that were worth his while but when miss warriner showed her interest in them her doing so made them worth his while and he fell upon them greedily he even went much further than she had gone and was not content merely to theorize and to discuss social questions from the safe distance of the deck of a dahabiyeh on the nile but proposed to at once put her theories into practice to this end he offered her a house in the slums of boston rent free where she could start her college settlement he made out lists of the men he thought would like to teach there and he volunteered to pay the expenses of the experiment until it failed or succeeded when her interest changed to the tombs of the rameses and the succession of the ancient dynasties he spent hours studying his baedeker that he might keep in step with her and when she abandoned ancient for modern egypt and became deeply charmed with the intricacies of the dual control and of the mixed courts he interviewed subalterns pashas and missionaries in a gallant effort to comprehend the social and political difficulties of the white men who had occupied the land of the sphinx who had funded her debt irrigated her deserts and made a mummy fight one night as the dahabiyeh lay moored beneath a group of palms in the moonlight miss warriner gave him praise for offering her the house in the slums for her experiment he assured her that he was entirely selfish that he did so because he believed her settlement would be a benefit to the neighborhood in which he owned some property when she then accused him of giving sordid reasons for what was his genuine philanthropy he told her flatly that he neither cared for the higher education of the slums nor the increased value of his rents but for her and to please her and that he loved her and would love her always in answer to this miss warriner told him gently but firmly that she could not love him but that she liked him and admired him even though she was disappointed to find that his sudden interest in matters more serious than polo had been assumed to please her she added that she would always be his friend this she thought ended the matter it was unfortunate that they should be shipbound on the nile but she trusted to his tact and good sense to save them both from embarrassment she was not prepared however to see him come on deck very late the next morning after apparently a long sleep as keen as cheerful and as smiling as he had been before the blow had fallen it piqued her a little and partly because of that and partly because she really was relieved to find him in such a humor she congratulated him on his most evident happiness why not he asked suddenly growing sober i love you that is enough to make any man happy isnt it you neednt love me but you cant prevent my going on loving you well i am very sorry she sighed in much perplexity you neednt be he answered reassuringly im more sorry for you than i am for myself you are going to have a terrible time until you marry me they were at thebes and he went off that afternoon to the temple of luxor with her mother and made violent use of the sacred altars the beauty of cleopatra the eternity of the scarabea and the indestructibility of the pyramids to suggest faintly to mrs warriner how much he loved her daughter he shook his hand at the crouching sphinxes and said mrs warriner in forty centuries they have never looked down upon a man as proud as i am and i am told they have seen napoleon but i need help she wont help me so you must its no use arguing against me when this nile dries up i shall have ceased loving your daughter did you tell helen what you have told me did you talk to her so asked mrs warriner no not last night said corbin but i will in time after she gets more used to the idea unfortunately for the peace of mr corbin and all concerned miss warriner did not become reconciled to the idea on the contrary she resented it greatly she had looked at the possibility of something to be carried out later much later perhaps not at all it did not seem possible that before she had really begun to enjoy life it should be subjected to such a change she saw that it was obviously the thing that should happen if the match had been arranged by the entire city of boston it could not have been more obvious but she argued with him that marriage was a mutual selfsacrifice and that until she felt ready to make her share of the sacrifice it was impossible for her to consent he combated her arguments which he refused to consider as arguments and demolished them one by one but the objection which he destroyed before he went to sleep at night was replaced the next day by another and his cause never advanced each day he found the citadel he was besieging girt in by new and intricate defences the reason was simple enough the girl was not in love with him her objections her arguments her reasons were as absurd as he proved them to be but they were insurmountable because they were really various disguises of the fact that she did not care for him they were disguises to herself as well as to him he was so altogether a good fellow so earnest honest and desperate a lover that the primary fact that she did not want his love did not present itself and she kept casting about in her mind for excuses and reasons to explain her lack of feeling he wooed her in every obvious way that would present itself to a boy of deep feeling of quick mind and an unlimited letter of credit he created wants in order to gratify them later he suggested her need of things which he had already ordered which before she had been enticed into expressing a wish for them were then speeding across the continent toward her every hour brought her some fresh and ingenuous sign of his thought and of his devotion he treated these tributes as a matter of course if she failed to observe them and to see his handiwork in them he let them fall to the ground unnoticed his love itself was his argumentinchief it was its own excuse it needed no allies i love you was his first and last word it puzzled her to find that she could not care when she was alone she asked herself what there was in him of which she disapproved and she could only answer that there was nothing she asked herself what other men there were who pleased her more and she could think of none on the contrary she found him entirely charming as a friend but his love distressed her greatly it was a foreign language she could not comprehend it when he allowed it to appear it completely disguised him in her eyes it annoyed her so much that at times she considered herself a much illused young person it was in this way that the matter stood between them when their long journey was ended and they reached london he was miserable desperate and hopeless the girl was firm in that she would not marry him and her mother who respected both the depth of corbins feelings and her daughters reticence and who had watched the struggle with a troubled heart was only thankful that they were to part and that it was at an end corbin had no idea where he would go nor what he would do he recognized that to cross the ocean with them would only subject his love to fresh distress and humiliation and he had determined to put as much space between him and miss warriner as the surface of the globe permitted the philippines seemed to offer a picturesque retreat for a broken life he decided he would go there and enlist and have himself shot he was uncertain whether he would follow in the steps of his revolutionary ancestors and join the men who were struggling for their liberty and independence or his fellowamericans but that he would get shot by one side or the other he was determined and then in days to come she would think perhaps of the young man on the other side of the globe buried in the wet ricefields with the palms fanning him through his eternal sleep and she might be sorry then that she had not listened to his troubled heart the picture gave him some small comfort and that night when he ordered dinner for them at the savoy his manner showed the inspired resolve of one who is soon to mount the scaffold unafraid and with a rose between his lips edouard the first violin saw miss warriner when she entered and took her place facing him at one of the tables in the centre of the room he was sitting with his violin on his knees touching the strings with his fingertips when he saw her he choked the neck of the violin with his hand as though it had been the hand of a friend which he had grasped in a sudden ecstasy of delight the effect her appearance had made upon him was so remarkable that he glanced quickly over his shoulder to see if he had betrayed himself by some sign or gesture but the other musicians were concerned with their own gossip and he felt free to turn again and from under his halfclosed eyelids to observe her covertly there was nothing to explain why miss warriner in particular should have so disturbed him the english women seated about her were as fair she showed no great sorrow in her face her beauty was not of the type which carried observers by assault and yet not one of the many beautiful women who on one night or another passed before edouard in the soft light of the red shades had ever stirred him so strangely had ever depressed him with such a tender melancholy and filled his soul the soul of a hungarian and a musician with such loneliness and unrest he knew that so far as he was concerned she was as distant as the venus in the louvre she was for him a beautiful unapproachable statue placed by some social convention upon a pedestal as he looked at her he felt hotly the degradation of his silly uniform of the striped sash around his waist the tawdry braids and the tasselled boots he felt as he had often felt before but now more keenly than ever the prostitution of his art in this temple of the senses this home of epicures where people met to feast their eyes and charm their palates he could not put his feelings into words and he knew that if by some upheaval of the social world he should be thrown into her presence he would still be bound he would not be able to speak or write what she inspired in him but and at the thought he breathed quickly and raised his shoulders with a touch of pride he could tell her in his own way after his own fashion he could express what he felt better even than those other men could tell what they feel these men for whose amusement he performed nightly to whom it was granted to sit at her side who spoke the language of her class and of her own people edouard was not given to analyzing his emotions like the music of his tzigane ancestors they came to him sweeping every chord in his nature beating rapidly to the time of the schardash or with the fitfulness of the gypsy folksongs sinking his spirits into melancholy so he did not stop to question why this one face so suddenly inspired him he only knew that he felt grateful that he was impatient to pay his tribute of admiration that he was glad he was an artist who could give his feelings voice in the long programme of selected airs he remembered that there was one which would give him this chance to speak in the playing of which he could put all his skill and all his soul an air which carried with it infinite sadness and the touch of a caress the other numbers on the programme had been chosen to please the patrons of a restaurant this one la lettre damour was included in the list for his own satisfaction he had put it there to please himself tonight he would play it to please her to this unknown girl who had so suddenly awakened and inspired him as he waited for this chance to come he watched her noting her every movement her troubled smile her air of being apart and above her surroundings he noticed too the set face of the young man at her side and with the discernment of one whose own interest is captive saw the halfconcealed longing in his eyes he felt a quick antipathy to this young man his assured position at the girls side accentuated how far he himself was removed from her he resented also the manner of the young man to the waiters and he wondered hotly if in the mind of this favored youth the musician who played for his entertainment was regarded any more highly than the servant who received his orders to this feeling of resentment was added one of contempt for as he read the tableau at the table below him the young man was the devotee of the young girl at his side and if one could judge from her averted eyes from her silent assent to his questions from the fact that she withdrew from the talk between him and the older woman his devotion was not welcome this reading of the pantomime pleased edouard greatly nothing could have so crowned the feeling which the beauty of the stranger stirred in him as the thought that another loved her as well as himself and that the other who started with all things in his favor met with none from her edouard assured himself that this was so because he had often heard his people boast that men not of their country could not feel as they could feel if he had ever considered them at all it was as cold and conscious creatures who taught themselves to cover up what they felt so that when their emotions strove to assert themselves they were found through long disuse to be dumb and inarticulate edouard rejoiced that to the men of his race it was given to feel and suffer much he was sure that beneath the calmness of her beauty this woman before him could feel deeply he read in her eyes the sympathy of a great soul she made him think of a madonna in the church of st sophia at budapest he saw in her a woman who could love greatly when he considered how impossible it was for the young man at her side ever to experience the great emotions which alone could reach her his contempt for him rose almost to pity his violin with his power to feel and with his knowledge of technic added could send his message as far as sound could carry he could afford to be generous and when he rose to play la lettre damour it was with the elation of a knight entering the lists with the ardor of a lover singing beneath his ladys window la lettre damour is a composition written to a slow measure and filled with chords of exquisite pathos it comes hesitatingly like the confession of a lover who loves so deeply that he halts to find words with which to express his feelings it moves in broken phrases each note rising in intensity and growing in beauty it is not a burst of passionate appeal but a plea tender beseeching and throbbing with melancholy as he played edouard stepped down from the dais on which the musicians sat and advanced slowly between the tables it was late and the majority of those who had been dining had departed to the theatres those who remained were lingering over their coffee and were smoking their voices were lowered to a polite monotone the rush of the waiters had ceased and the previous chatter had sunk to a subdued murmur into this the quivering sigh of edouards violin penetrated like a sunbeam feeling its way into a darkened room and at the sound the voices one by one detached themselves from the general chorus until lacking support it ceased altogether some were silent that they might hear the better others who preferred their own talk were silent out of regard for those who desired to listen and a waiter who was so indiscreet as to clatter a tray of glasses was hushed on the instant the tribute of attention lent to edouard an added power his head lifted on his shoulders with pride his bow cut deeper and firmer and with more delicate shading the notes rose in thrilling plaintive sadness and flooded the hot air with melody edouard made his way to within a short distance of the table at which miss warriner was seated and halted there as though he had found his audience he did not look at her although she sat directly facing him but it was evident to all that she was the one to whom his effort was directed and corbin who was seated with his back to edouard recognized this and turned in his chair the body of the young musician was trembling with the feeling which found its outlet through the violin he was in ecstasy over his power and its accomplishment the strings of the violin pulsated to the beating of his heart and he felt that surely by now the emotion which shook him must have reached the girl who had given it life and for one swift second his eyes sought hers what he saw was the same beautiful face which had inspired him but unmoved cold and unresponsive as his eyes followed hers she raised her head and looked listlessly around the room and then turned and glanced up at him with a careless and critical scrutiny if his music had been the music of an organ in the street and he the man who raised his hat for coppers she could not have been less moved the discovery struck edouard like a cold blast from an open door his fingers faltered on the neck of his violin his bow wavered drunkenly across the strings and he turned away his eyes to shut out the vision of his failure seeking relief and sympathy and in their swift passage they encountered those of corbin looking up at him his eyes aglow with wonder feeling and sorrow they seemed to hold him to account they begged they demanded of him not to break the spell and in response the hot blood in the veins of the musician surged back his pride flared up again his eyes turned on corbins like those of a dog to his masters under their spell the music soared trembling paused and soared again thrilling those who heard it with its grief and tenderness edouards heart leaped with triumph the man knows he whispered to the violin he understands us he knows the people leaning with their elbows on the tables before them the waiters listening with tolerant smiles the musicians following edouard with anxious pride saw only a young man with his arm thrown heavily across the back of his chair who was looking up at edouard with a steady searching gaze but edouard saw in him both a disciple and a master he saw that this man was lifted up and carried with him that he understood the message of the music the notes of the violin sank lower and lower until they melted into the silence of the room and the people freed of the spell the music had put upon them applauded generously edouard placed his violin under his arm and with his eyes which had never left corbins face still fastened upon his bowed low to him and corbin raised his head and nodded gravely it was as though they were the only people in the room as edouard retreated his face was shining with triumph for he knew that the other had understood him and that the other knew that he knew that night until he fell asleep and all of the day following the beautiful face of miss warriner troubled edouard and the thought of her alternately thrilled and depressed him one moment he mocked at himself for presuming to think that his simple art could reach the depths of such a nature and the next he stirred himself to hope that he should see her once again and that he should succeed where he had failed the music had moved corbin so deeply that when he awoke the day following the effect of it still hung upon him it seemed to him as though all he had been trying to tell miss warriner of his love for her and which he had failed to make her understand in the last three months had been expressed in the one moment of this song it was that in it which had so enchanted him it was as though he had listened to his own deepest and most sacred thoughts uttered for the first time convincingly and by a stranger why was it he asked himself that this unknown youth could translate anothers feelings into music when he himself could not put them into words he was walking in piccadilly deep in this thought when a question came to him which caused him to turn rapidly into green park where he could consider it undisturbed the doubt which had so suddenly presented itself was in some degree the same one which had stirred edouard was it that he was really unable to express his feelings or was it that miss warriner could not understand them was it really something lacking in him or was it not something lacking in her he flushed at the disloyalty of the thought and put it from him but as his memory reached back over the past three months the question returned again and again with fresh force and would not be denied he called himself a fatuous conceited fool because he could not make a woman love him other men could do so that was really the answer he was not the man but the answer did not seem final what after all was the thing his love sought a woman only or a woman capable of deep and great feeling even if he could not inspire such emotions even if another could he would still be content and proud to love a woman capable of such deep feelings but if she were without them at the thought corbin stared blankly before him as though he had stumbled against a stone wall what sign had she ever given him that she could care greatly was not any form of emotion always distasteful to her was not her mind always occupied with abstract questions was she not always engaged in her own selfimprovement with schemes it is true for bettering the world but did her heart ever ache once for the individual what was it then he loved something he imagined this girl to be or was he in love with the fact that his own nature had been so mightily stirred was it not the joy of caring greatly which had carried him along and if this was so was he now to continue to proffer this devotion to one who could not feel to a statue to an idol were not the very things which rendered her beautiful the offerings which he himself had hung upon her altar did the qualities he really loved in her exist was he not on the brink of casting his love before one who could neither feel it for him nor for any other man he stood up trembling and frightened even though the girl had rejected him again and again he felt a hateful sense of disloyalty he was ashamed to confess it to himself and he vowed hotly that he must be wrong that he would not believe he would still worship her fight for her and force her to care for him mrs warriner and her daughter were to sail on the morrow and that night they met corbin at dinner for the last time after many days although selfaccused he felt deeply conscious of his recent lack of faith and in the few hours still left him he determined to atone for the temporary halt in his allegiance they had never found him more eager tactful and considerate than he was that evening the eyes of mrs warriner softened as she watched him as one day had succeeded another her admiration and liking for him had increased until now she felt as though his cause was hers as though she was not parting from a friend but from a son but the calmness of her daughter was impenetrable from her manner it was impossible to learn whether the approaching separation was a relief or a regret to edouard the return of the beautiful girl to the restaurant appeared not as an accident but as a marked favor vouchsafed to him by fate he had been given a second chance he read it as a sign that he should take heart and hope he felt that fortune was indeed kind he determined that he would play to her again and that this time he would not fail as the first notes of la lettre damour brought a pause of silence in the restaurant corbin who was talking at the moment interrupted himself abruptly and turned in his chair all through the evening he had been conscious of the near presence of the young musician he had not forgotten how on the night before his own feelings had been interpreted in la lettre damour and for some time he had been debating in his mind as to whether he would request edouard to play the air again or let the evening pass without again submitting himself to so supreme an assault upon his feelings now the question had been settled for him and he found that it had been decided as he secretly desired it was impossible to believe that edouard was the same young man who had played the same air on the night previous for edouard no longer considered that he was present on sufferance he invited and challenged the attention of the room his music commanded it to silence it dominated all who heard it as he again slowly approached the table where miss warriner was seated the eyes of everyone were turned upon him the pathos the tenderness of his message seemed to speak to each the fact that he dared to offer such a wealth of deep feeling to such an audience was in itself enough to engage the attention of all a group of guardsmen their faces flushed with burgundy and pulling heavily on black cigars stared at him sleepily and then sat up erect and alert watching him with intent wideopen eyes and at tables which had been marked by the laughter of those seated about them there fell a sudden silence those who fully understood the value of the music withdrew into themselves submitting thankfully to its spell others less susceptible gathered from the bearing of those about them that something of moment was going forward but it was recognized by each from the most severe english matron present down to the youngest omnibusboy among the waiters that it was a lovestory which was being told to them and that in this public place the deepest most sacred and most beautiful of emotions were finding noble utterance the music filled corbin with desperate longing and regret it was so truly the translation of his own feelings that he was alternately touched with selfpity and inspired to fresh resolve it seemed to assure him that love such as his could not endure without some return it emboldened him to make still another and a final appeal mrs warriner with all the other people in the room was watching edouard and so unobserved and hidden by the flowers upon the table corbin leaned toward miss warriner and bent his head close to hers his eyes were burning with feeling his voice thrilled in unison to the plaint of the violin he gave a toss of his head in the direction from whence the music came that is what i have been trying to tell you he whispered his voice was hoarse and shaken that is how i care but that mans genius is telling you for me at last you must understand in his eagerness his words followed each other brokenly and impetuously that is love he whispered that is the real voice of love in all its tenderness and might and it is love itself dont you understand it now he demanded miss warriner raised her head and frowned she stared at edouard with a pained expression of perplexity and doubt he shows no lack of feeling she said critically but his technic is not equal to ysayes good god corbin gasped he sank away from miss warriner and stared at her with incredulous eyes his technic he repeated is not equal to ysayes he gave a laugh which might have been a sob and sat up suddenly with his head erect and his shoulders squared he had the shaken look of one who has recovered from a dangerous illness but when he spoke again it was in the accents of everyday politeness at an early hour the following morning mrs warriner and her daughter left waterloo station on the steamertrain for southampton and corbin attended them up to the moment of the trains departure he concerned himself for their comfort as conscientiously as he had always done throughout the last three months when he had been their travellingcompanion nothing could have been more friendly more sympathetic than his manner this effort which mrs warriner was sure cost him much touched her deeply but when he shook miss warriners hand and she said goodby and write to us before you go to the philippines corbin for the first time stammered in some embarrassment goodby he said i i am not sure that i shall go he dined at the savoy again that night in company with some englishmen they sat at a table in the corner where they could observe the whole extent of the room and their talk was eager and their laughter constant and hearty it was only when the boy who led the orchestra began to walk among the tables playing an air of peculiar sadness that corbins manner lost its vivacity and he sank into a sudden silence with his eyes fixed on the table before him thats odd said one of his companions i say corbin look at that chap whats he doing corbin raised his eyes he saw edouard standing at the same table at which for the last two nights miss warriner had been seated what is it he asked why that violin chap said the englishman dont you see hes been playing to the only vacant table in the room and to an empty chair in the fog i the grill is the club most difficult of access in the world to be placed on its rolls distinguishes the new member as greatly as though he had received a vacant garter or had been caricatured in vanity fair men who belong to the grill club never mention that fact if you were to ask one of them which clubs he frequents he will name all save that particular one he is afraid if he told you he belonged to the grill that it would sound like boasting the grill club dates back to the days when shakespeares theatre stood on the present site of the times office it has a golden grill which charles the second presented to the club and the original manuscript of tom and jerry in london which was bequeathed to it by pierce egan himself the members when they write letters at the club still use sand to blot the ink the grill enjoys the distinction of having blackballed without political prejudice a prime minister of each party at the same sitting at which one of these fell it elected on account of his brogue and his bulls quiller q c who was then a penniless barrister when paul preval the french artist who came to london by royal command to paint a portrait of the prince of wales was made an honorary member only foreigners may be honorary members he said as he signed his first winecard i would rather see my name on that than on a picture in the louvre at which quiller remarked that is a devil of a compliment because the only men who can read their names in the louvre today have been dead fifty years on the night after the great fog of there were five members in the club four of them busy with supper and one reading in front of the fireplace there is only one room to the club and one long table at the far end of the room the fire of the grill glows red and when the fat falls blazes into flame and at the other there is a broad bowwindow of diamond panes which looks down upon the street the four men at the table were strangers to each other but as they picked at the grilled bones and sipped their scotch and soda they conversed with such charming animation that a visitor to the club which does not tolerate visitors would have counted them as friends of long acquaintance certainly not as englishmen who had met for the first time and without the form of an introduction but it is the etiquette and tradition of the grill that whoever enters it must speak with whomever he finds there it is to enforce this rule that there is but one long table and whether there are twenty men at it or two the waiters supporting the rule will place them side by side for this reason the four strangers at supper were seated together with the candles grouped about them and the long length of the table cutting a white path through the outer gloom i repeat said the gentleman with the black pearl stud that the days for romantic adventure and deeds of foolish daring have passed and that the fault lies with ourselves voyages to the pole i do not catalogue as adventures that african explorer young chetney who turned up yesterday after he was supposed to have died in uganda did nothing adventurous he made maps and explored the sources of rivers he was in constant danger but the presence of danger does not constitute adventure were that so the chemist who studies high explosives or who investigates deadly poisons passes through adventures daily no adventures are for the adventurous but one no longer ventures the spirit of it has died of inertia we are grown too practical too just above all too sensible in this room for instance members of this club have at the swords point disputed the proper scanning of one of popes couplets over so weighty a matter as spilled burgundy on a gentlemans cuff ten men fought across this table each with his rapier in one hand and a candle in the other all ten were wounded the question of the spilled burgundy concerned but two of them the eight others engaged because they were men of spirit they were indeed the first gentlemen of the day tonight were you to spill burgundy on my cuff were you even to insult me grossly these gentlemen would not consider it incumbent upon them to kill each other they would separate us and tomorrow morning appear as witnesses against us at bow street we have here tonight in the persons of sir andrew and myself an illustration of how the ways have changed the men around the table turned and glanced toward the gentleman in front of the fireplace he was an elderly and somewhat portly person with a kindly wrinkled countenance which wore continually a smile of almost childish confidence and goodnature it was a face which the illustrated prints had made intimately familiar he held a book from him at armslength as if to adjust his eyesight and his brows were knit with interest now were this the eighteenth century continued the gentleman with the black pearl when sir andrew left the club tonight i would have him bound and gagged and thrown into a sedan chair the watch would not interfere the passersby would take to their heels my hired bullies and ruffians would convey him to some lonely spot where we would guard him until morning nothing would come of it except added reputation to myself as a gentleman of adventurous spirit and possibly an essay in the tatler with stars for names entitled let us say the budget and the baronet but to what end sir inquired the youngest of the members and why sir andrew of all persons why should you select him for this adventure the gentleman with the black pearl shrugged his shoulders it would prevent him speaking in the house tonight the navy increase bill he added gloomily it is a government measure and sir andrew speaks for it and so great is his influence and so large his following that if he does the gentleman laughed ruefully if he does it will go through now had i the spirit of our ancestors he exclaimed i would bring chloroform from the nearest chemists and drug him in that chair i would tumble his unconscious form into a hansomcab and hold him prisoner until daylight if i did i would save the british taxpayer the cost of five more battleships many millions of pounds the gentleman again turned and surveyed the baronet with freshened interest the honorary member of the grill whose accent already had betrayed him as an american laughed softly to look at him now he said one would not guess he was deeply concerned with the affairs of state the others nodded silently he has not lifted his eyes from that book since we first entered added the youngest member he surely cannot mean to speak tonight oh yes he will speak muttered the one with the black pearl moodily during these last hours of the session the house sits late but when the navy bill comes up on its third reading he will be in his place and he will pass it the fourth member a stout and florid gentleman of a somewhat sporting appearance in a short smokingjacket and black tie sighed enviously fancy one of us being as cool as that if he knew he had to stand up within an hour and rattle off a speech in parliament id be in a devil of a funk myself and yet he is as keen over that book hes reading as though he had nothing before him until bedtime yes see how eager he is whispered the youngest member he does not lift his eyes even now when he cuts the pages it is probably an admiralty report or some other weighty work of statistics which bears upon his speech the gentleman with the black pearl laughed morosely the weighty work in which the eminent statesman is so deeply engrossed he said is called the great rand robbery it is a detective novel for sale at all bookstalls the american raised his eyebrows in disbelief the great rand robbery he repeated incredulously what an odd taste it is not a taste it is his vice returned the gentleman with the pearl stud it is his one dissipation he is noted for it you as a stranger could hardly be expected to know of this idiosyncrasy mr gladstone sought relaxation in the greek poets sir andrew finds his in gaboriau since i have been a member of parliament i have never seen him in the library without a shilling shocker in his hands he brings them even into the sacred precincts of the house and from the government benches reads them concealed inside his hat once started on a tale of murder robbery and sudden death nothing can tear him from it not even the call of the divisionbell nor of hunger nor the prayers of the party whip he gave up his country house because when he journeyed to it in the train he would become so absorbed in his detectivestories that he was invariably carried past his station the member of parliament twisted his pearl stud nervously and bit at the edge of his mustache if it only were the first pages of the rand robbery that he were reading he murmured bitterly instead of the last with such another book as that i swear i could hold him here until morning there would be no need of chloroform to keep him from the house the eyes of all were fastened upon sir andrew and each saw with fascination that with his forefinger he was now separating the last two pages of the book the member of parliament struck the table softly with his open palm i would give a hundred pounds he whispered if i could place in his hands at this moment a new story of sherlock holmes a thousand pounds he added wildly five thousand pounds the american observed the speaker sharply as though the words bore to him some special application and then at an idea which apparently had but just come to him smiled in great embarrassment sir andrew ceased reading but as though still under the influence of the book sat looking blankly into the open fire for a brief space no one moved until the baronet withdrew his eyes and with a sudden start of recollection felt anxiously for his watch he scanned its face eagerly and scrambled to his feet the voice of the american instantly broke the silence in a high nervous accent and yet sherlock holmes himself he cried could not decipher the mystery which tonight baffles the police of london at these unexpected words which carried in them something of the tone of a challenge the gentlemen about the table started as suddenly as though the american had fired a pistol in the air and sir andrew halted abruptly and stood observing him with grave surprise the gentleman with the black pearl was the first to recover yes yes he said eagerly throwing himself across the table a mystery that baffles the police of london i have heard nothing of it tell us at once pray do tell us at once the american flushed uncomfortably and picked uneasily at the tablecloth no one but the police has heard of it he murmured and they only through me it is a remarkable crime to which unfortunately i am the only person who can bear witness because i am the only witness i am in spite of my immunity as a diplomat detained in london by the authorities of scotland yard my name he said inclining his head politely is sears lieutenant ripley sears of the united states navy at present naval attache to the court of russia had i not been detained today by the police i would have started this morning for petersburg the gentleman with the black pearl interrupted with so pronounced an exclamation of excitement and delight that the american stammered and ceased speaking do you hear sir andrew cried the member of parliament jubilantly an american diplomat halted by our police because he is the only witness of a most remarkable crime the most remarkable crime i believe you said sir he added bending eagerly toward the naval officer which has occurred in london in many years the american moved his head in assent and glanced at the two other members they were looking doubtfully at him and the face of each showed that he was greatly perplexed sir andrew advanced to within the light of the candles and drew a chair toward him the crime must be exceptional indeed he said to justify the police in interfering with a representative of a friendly power if i were not forced to leave at once i should take the liberty of asking you to tell us the details the gentleman with the pearl pushed the chair toward sir andrew and motioned him to be seated you cannot leave us now he exclaimed mr sears is just about to tell us of this remarkable crime he nodded vigorously at the naval officer and the american after first glancing doubtfully toward the servants at the far end of the room and leaned forward across the table the others drew their chairs nearer and bent toward him the baronet glanced irresolutely at his watch and with an exclamation of annoyance snapped down the lid they can wait he muttered he seated himself quickly and nodded at lieutenant sears if you will be so kind as to begin sir he said impatiently of course said the american you understand that i understand that i am speaking to gentlemen the confidences of this club are inviolate until the police give the facts to the public press i must consider you my confederates you have heard nothing you know no one connected with this mystery even i must remain anonymous the gentlemen seated around him nodded gravely of course the baronet assented with eagerness of course we will refer to it said the gentleman with the black pearl as the story of the naval attache i arrived in london two days ago said the american and i engaged a room at the bath hotel i know very few people in london and even the members of our embassy were strangers to me but in hong kong i had become great pals with an officer in your navy who has since retired and who is now living in a small house in rutland gardens opposite the knightsbridge barracks i telegraphed him that i was in london and yesterday morning i received a most hearty invitation to dine with him the same evening at his house he is a bachelor so we dined alone and talked over all our old days on the asiatic station and of the changes which had come to us since we had last met there as i was leaving the next morning for my post at petersburg and had many letters to write i told him about ten oclock that i must get back to the hotel and he sent out his servant to call a hansom for the next quarter of an hour as we sat talking we could hear the cabwhistle sounding violently from the doorstep but apparently with no result it cannot be that the cabmen are on strike my friend said as he rose and walked to the window he pulled back the curtains and at once called to me you have never seen a london fog have you he asked well come here this is one of the best or rather one of the worst of them i joined him at the window but i could see nothing had i not known that the house looked out upon the street i would have believed that i was facing a dead wall i raised the sash and stretched out my head but still i could see nothing even the light of the streetlamps opposite and in the upper windows of the barracks had been smothered in the yellow mist the lights of the room in which i stood penetrated the fog only to the distance of a few inches from my eyes below me the servant was still sounding his whistle but i could afford to wait no longer and told my friend that i would try and find the way to my hotel on foot he objected but the letters i had to write were for the navy department and besides i had always heard that to be out in a london fog was the most wonderful experience and i was curious to investigate one for myself my friend went with me to his front door and laid down a course for me to follow i was first to walk straight across the street to the brick wall of the knightsbridge barracks i was then to feel my way along the wall until i came to a row of houses set back from the sidewalk they would bring me to a cross street on the other side of this street was a row of shops which i was to follow until they joined the iron railings of hyde park i was to keep to the railings until i reached the gates at hyde park corner where i was to lay a diagonal course across piccadilly and tack in toward the railings of green park at the end of these railings going east i would find the walsingham and my own hotel to a sailor the course did not seem difficult so i bade my friend goodnight and walked forward until my feet touched the paving i continued upon it until i reached the curbing of the sidewalk a few steps further and my hands struck the wall of the barracks i turned in the direction from which i had just come and saw a square of faint light cut in the yellow fog i shouted all right and the voice of my friend answered good luck to you the light from his open door disappeared with a bang and i was left alone in a dripping yellow darkness i have been in the navy for ten years but i have never known such a fog as that of last night not even among the icebergs of behring sea there one at least could see the light of the binnacle but last night i could not even distinguish the hand by which i guided myself along the barrackwall at sea a fog is a natural phenomenon it is as familiar as the rainbow which follows a storm it is as proper that a fog should spread upon the waters as that steam shall rise from a kettle but a fog which springs from the paved streets that rolls between solid housefronts that forces cabs to move at half speed that drowns policemen and extinguishes the electric lights of the musichall that to me is incomprehensible it is as out of place as a tidal wave on broadway as i felt my way along the wall i encountered other men who were coming from the opposite direction and each time when we hailed each other i stepped away from the wall to make room for them to pass but the third time i did this when i reached out my hand the wall had disappeared and the further i moved to find it the further i seemed to be sinking into space i had the unpleasant conviction that at any moment i might step over a precipice since i had set out i had heard no traffic in the street and now although i listened some minutes i could only distinguish the occasional footfalls of pedestrians several times i called aloud and once a jocular gentleman answered me but only to ask me where i thought he was and then even he was swallowed up in the silence just above me i could make out a jet of gas which i guessed came from a streetlamp and i moved over to that and while i tried to recover my bearings kept my hand on the iron post except for this nicker of gas no larger than the tip of my finger i could distinguish nothing about me for the rest the mist hung between me and the world like a damp and heavy blanket i could hear voices but i could not tell from whence they came and the scrape of a foot moving cautiously or a muffled cry as someone stumbled were the only sounds that reached me i decided that until someone took me in i had best remain where i was and it must have been for ten minutes that i waited by the lamp straining my ears and hailing distant footfalls in a house near me some people were dancing to the music of a hungarian band i even fancied i could hear the windows shake to the rhythm of their feet but i could not make out from which part of the compass the sounds came and sometimes as the music rose it seemed close at my hand and again to be floating high in the air above my head although i was surrounded by thousands of householders i was as completely lost as though i had been set down by night in the sahara desert there seemed to be no reason in waiting longer for an escort so i again set out and at once bumped against a low iron fence at first i believed this to be an area railing but on following it i found that it stretched for a long distance and that it was pierced at regular intervals with gates i was standing uncertainly with my hand on one of these when a square of light suddenly opened in the night and in it i saw as you see a picture thrown by a biograph in a darkened theatre a young gentleman in evening dress and back of him the lights of a hall i guessed from its elevation and distance from the sidewalk that this light must come from the door of a house set back from the street and i determined to approach it and ask the young man to tell me where i was but in fumbling with the lock of the gate i instinctively bent my head and when i raised it again the door had partly closed leaving only a narrow shaft of light whether the young man had reentered the house or had left it i could not tell but i hastened to open the gate and as i stepped forward i found myself upon an asphalt walk at the same instant there was the sound of quick steps upon the path and someone rushed past me i called to him but he made no reply and i heard the gate click and the footsteps hurrying away upon the sidewalk under other circumstances the young mans rudeness and his recklessness in dashing so hurriedly through the mist would have struck me as peculiar but everything was so distorted by the fog that at the moment i did not consider it the door was still as he had left it partly open i went up the path and after much fumbling found the knob of the doorbell and gave it a sharp pull the bell answered me from a great depth and distance but no movement followed from inside the house and although i pulled the bell again and again i could hear nothing save the dripping of the mist about me i was anxious to be on my way but unless i knew where i was going there was little chance of my making any speed and i was determined that until i learned my bearings i would not venture back into the fog so i pushed the door open and stepped into the house i found myself in a long and narrow hall upon which doors opened from either side at the end of the hall was a staircase with a balustrade which ended in a sweeping curve the balustrade was covered with heavy persian rugs and the walls of the hall were also hung with them the door on my left was closed but the one nearer me on the right was open and as i stepped opposite to it i saw that it was a sort of reception or waitingroom and that it was empty the door below it was also open and with the idea that i would surely find someone there i walked on up the hall i was in evening dress and i felt i did not look like a burglar so i had no great fear that should i encounter one of the inmates of the house he would shoot me on sight the second door in the hall opened into a diningroom this was also empty one person had been dining at the table but the cloth had not been cleared away and a flickering candle showed halffilled wineglasses and the ashes of cigarettes the greater part of the room was in complete darkness by this time i had grown conscious of the fact that i was wandering about in a strange house and that apparently i was alone in it the silence of the place began to try my nerves and in a sudden unexplainable panic i started for the open street but as i turned i saw a man sitting on a bench which the curve of the balustrade had hidden from me his eyes were shut and he was sleeping soundly the moment before i had been bewildered because i could see no one but at sight of this man i was much more bewildered he was a very large man a giant in height with long yellow hair which hung below his shoulders he was dressed in a red silk shirt that was belted at the waist and hung outside black velvet trousers which in turn were stuffed into high black boots i recognized the costume at once as that of a russian servant but what a russian servant in his native livery could be doing in a private house in knightsbridge was incomprehensible i advanced and touched the man on the shoulder and after an effort he awoke and on seeing me sprang to his feet and began bowing rapidly and making deprecatory gestures i had picked up enough russian in petersburg to make out that the man was apologizing for having fallen asleep and i also was able to explain to him that i desired to see his master he nodded vigorously and said will the excellency come this way the princess is here i distinctly made out the word princess and i was a good deal embarrassed i had thought it would be easy enough to explain my intrusion to a man but how a woman would look at it was another matter and as i followed him down the hall i was somewhat puzzled as we advanced he noticed that the front door was standing open and with an exclamation of surprise hastened toward it and closed it then he rapped twice on the door of what was apparently the drawingroom there was no reply to his knock and he tapped again and then timidly and cringing subserviently opened the door and stepped inside he withdrew himself at once and stared stupidly at me shaking his head she is not there he said he stood for a moment gazing blankly through the open door and then hastened toward the diningroom the solitary candle which still burned there seemed to assure him that the room also was empty he came back and bowed me toward the drawingroom she is above he said i will inform the princess of the excellencys presence before i could stop him he had turned and was running up the staircase leaving me alone at the open door of the drawingroom i decided that the adventure had gone quite far enough and if i had been able to explain to the russian that i had lost my way in the fog and only wanted to get back into the street again i would have left the house on the instant of course when i first rang the bell of the house i had no other expectation than that it would be answered by a parlormaid who would direct me on my way i certainly could not then foresee that i would disturb a russian princess in her boudoir or that i might be thrown out by her athletic bodyguard still i thought i ought not now to leave the house without making some apology and if the worst should come i could show my card they could hardly believe that a member of an embassy had any designs upon the hatrack the room in which i stood was dimly lighted but i could see that like the hall it was hung with heavy persian rugs the corners were filled with palms and there was the unmistakable odor in the air of russian cigarettes and strange dry scents that carried me back to the bazaars of vladivostock near the front windows was a grand piano and at the other end of the room a heavily carved screen of some black wood picked out with ivory the screen was overhung with a canopy of silken draperies and formed a sort of alcove in front of the alcove was spread the white skin of a polar bear and set on that was one of those low turkish coffeetables it held a lighted spiritlamp and two gold coffeecups i had heard no movement from above stairs and it must have been fully three minutes that i stood waiting noting these details of the room and wondering at the delay and at the strange silence and then suddenly as my eye grew more used to the halflight i saw projecting from behind the screen as though it were stretched along the back of a divan the hand of a man and the lower part of his arm i was as startled as though i had come across a footprint on a deserted island evidently the man had been sitting there since i had come into the room even since i had entered the house and he had heard the servant knocking upon the door why he had not declared himself i could not understand but i supposed that possibly he was a guest with no reason to interest himself in the princesss other visitors or perhaps for some reason he did not wish to be observed i could see nothing of him except his hand but i had an unpleasant feeling that he had been peering at me through the carving in the screen and that he still was doing so i moved my feet noisily on the floor and said tentatively i beg your pardon there was no reply and the hand did not stir apparently the man was bent upon ignoring me but as all i wished was to apologize for my intrusion and to leave the house i walked up to the alcove and peered around it inside the screen was a divan piled with cushions and on the end of it nearer me the man was sitting he was a young englishman with lightyellow hair and a deeply bronzed face he was seated with his arms stretched out along the back of the divan and with his head resting against a cushion his attitude was one of complete ease but his mouth had fallen open and his eyes were set with an expression of utter horror at the first glance i saw that he was quite dead for a flash of time i was too startled to act but in the same flash i was convinced that the man had met his death from no accident that he had not died through any ordinary failure of the laws of nature the expression on his face was much too terrible to be misinterpreted it spoke as eloquently as words it told me that before the end had come he had watched his death approach and threaten him i was so sure he had been murdered that i instinctively looked on the floor for the weapon and at the same moment out of concern for my own safety quickly behind me but the silence of the house continued unbroken i have seen a great number of dead men i was on the asiatic station during the japanesechinese war i was in port arthur after the massacre so a dead man for the single reason that he is dead does not repel me and though i knew that there was no hope that this man was alive still for decencys sake i felt his pulse and while i kept my ears alert for any sound from the floors above me i pulled open his shirt and placed my hand upon his heart my fingers instantly touched upon the opening of a wound and as i withdrew them i found them wet with blood he was in evening dress and in the wide bosom of his shirt i found a narrow slit so narrow that in the dim light it was scarcely discernible the wound was no wider than the smallest blade of a pocketknife but when i stripped the shirt away from the chest and left it bare i found that the weapon narrow as it was had been long enough to reach his heart there is no need to tell you how i felt as i stood by the body of this boy for he was hardly older than a boy or of the thoughts that came into my head i was bitterly sorry for this stranger bitterly indignant at his murderer and at the same time selfishly concerned for my own safety and for the notoriety which i saw was sure to follow my instinct was to leave the body where it lay and to hide myself in the fog but i also felt that since a succession of accidents had made me the only witness to a crime my duty was to make myself a good witness and to assist to establish the facts of this murder that it might possibly be a suicide and not a murder did not disturb me for a moment the fact that the weapon had disappeared and the expression on the boys face were enough to convince at least me that he had had no hand in his own death i judged it therefore of the first importance to discover who was in the house or if they had escaped from it who had been in the house before i entered it i had seen one man leave it but all i could tell of him was that he was a young man that he was in evening dress and that he had fled in such haste that he had not stopped to close the door behind him the russian servant i had found apparently asleep and unless he acted a part with supreme skill he was a stupid and ignorant boor and as innocent of the murder as myself there was still the russian princess whom he had expected to find or had pretended to expect to find in the same room with the murdered man i judged that she must now be either upstairs with the servant or that she had without his knowledge already fled from the house when i recalled his apparently genuine surprise at not finding her in the drawingroom this latter supposition seemed the more probable nevertheless i decided that it was my duty to make a search and after a second hurried look for the weapon among the cushions of the divan and upon the floor i cautiously crossed the hall and entered the diningroom the single candle was still flickering in the draught and showed only the white cloth the rest of the room was draped in shadows i picked up the candle and lifting it high above my head moved around the corner of the table either my nerves were on such a stretch that no shock could strain them further or my mind was inoculated to horrors for i did not cry out at what i saw nor retreat from it immediately at my feet was the body of a beautiful woman lying at full length upon the floor her arms flung out on either side of her and her white face and shoulders gleaming dully in the unsteady light of the candle around her throat was a great chain of diamonds and the light played upon these and made them flash and blaze in tiny flames but the woman who wore them was dead and i was so certain as to how she had died that without an instants hesitation i dropped on my knees beside her and placed my hands above her heart my fingers again touched the thin slit of a wound i had no doubt in my mind but that this was the russian princess and when i lowered the candle to her face i was assured that this was so her features showed the finest lines of both the slav and the jewess the eyes were black the hair blueblack and wonderfully heavy and her skin even in death was rich in color she was a surpassingly beautiful woman i rose and tried to light another candle with the one i held but i found that my hand was so unsteady that i could not keep the wicks together it was my intention to again search for this strange dagger which had been used to kill both the english boy and the beautiful princess but before i could light the second candle i heard footsteps descending the stairs and the russian servant appeared in the doorway my face was in darkness or i am sure that at the sight of it he would have taken alarm for at that moment i was not sure but that this man himself was the murderer his own face was plainly visible to me in the light from the hall and i could see that it wore an expression of dull bewilderment i stepped quickly toward him and took a firm hold upon his wrist she is not there he said the princess has gone they have all gone who have gone i demanded who else has been here the two englishmen he said what two englishmen i demanded what are their names the man now saw by my manner that some question of great moment hung upon his answer and he began to protest that he did not know the names of the visitors and that until that evening he had never seen them i guessed that it was my tone which frightened him so i took my hand off his wrist and spoke less eagerly how long have they been here i asked and when did they go he pointed behind him toward the drawingroom one sat there with the princess he said the other came after i had placed the coffee in the drawingroom the two englishmen talked together and the princess returned here to the table she sat there in that chair and i brought her cognac and cigarettes then i sat outside upon the bench it was a feastday and i had been drinking pardon excellency but i fell asleep when i woke your excellency was standing by me but the princess and the two englishmen had gone that is all i know i believed that the man was telling me the truth his fright had passed and he was now apparently puzzled but not alarmed you must remember the names of the englishmen i urged try to think when you announced them to the princess what name did you give at this question he exclaimed with pleasure and beckoning to me ran hurriedly down the hall and into the drawingroom in the corner furthest from the screen was the piano and on it was a silver tray he picked this up and smiling with pride at his own intelligence pointed at two cards that lay upon it i took them up and read the names engraved upon them the american paused abruptly and glanced at the faces about him i read the names he repeated he spoke with great reluctance continue cried the baronet sharply i read the names said the american with evident distaste and the family name of each was the same they were the names of two brothers one is well known to you it is that of the african explorer of whom this gentleman was just speaking i mean the earl of chetney the other was the name of his brother lord arthur chetney the men at the table fell back as though a trapdoor had fallen open at their feet lord chetney they exclaimed in chorus they glanced at each other and back to the american with every expression of concern and disbelief it is impossible cried the baronet why my dear sir young chetney only arrived from africa yesterday it was so stated in the evening papers the jaw of the american set in a resolute square and he pressed his lips together you are perfectly right sir he said lord chetney did arrive in london yesterday morning and yesterday night i found his dead body the youngest member present was the first to recover he seemed much less concerned over the identity of the murdered man than at the interruption of the narrative oh please let him go on he cried what happened then you say you found two visitingcards how do you know which card was that of the murdered man the american before he answered waited until the chorus of exclamations had ceased then he continued as though he had not been interrupted the instant i read the names upon the cards he said i ran to the screen and kneeling beside the dead man began a search through his pockets my hand at once fell upon a cardcase and i found on all the cards it contained the title of the earl of chetney his watch and cigarettecase also bore his name these evidences and the fact of his bronzed skin and that his cheekbones were worn with fever convinced me that the dead man was the african explorer and the boy who had fled past me in the night was arthur his younger brother i was so intent upon my search that i had forgotten the servant and i was still on my knees when i heard a cry behind me i turned and saw the man gazing down at the body in abject horror before i could rise he gave another cry of terror and flinging himself into the hall raced toward the door to the street i leaped after him shouting to him to halt but before i could reach the hall he had torn open the door and i saw him spring out into the yellow fog i cleared the steps in a jump and ran down the gardenwalk but just as the gate clicked in front of me i had it open on the instant and following the sound of the mans footsteps i raced after him across the open street he also could hear me and he instantly stopped running and there was absolute silence he was so near that i almost fancied i could hear him panting and i held my own breath to listen but i could distinguish nothing but the dripping of the mist about us and from far off the music of the hungarian band which i had heard when i first lost myself all i could see was the square of light from the door i had left open behind me and a lamp in the hall beyond it flickering in the draught but even as i watched it the flame of the lamp was blown violently to and fro and the door caught in the same current of air closed slowly i knew if it shut i could not again enter the house and i rushed madly toward it i believe i even shouted out as though it were something human which i could compel to obey me and then i caught my foot against the curb and smashed into the sidewalk when i rose to my feet i was dizzy and half stunned and though i thought then that i was moving toward the door i know now that i probably turned directly from it for as i groped about in the night calling frantically for the police my fingers touched nothing but the dripping fog and the iron railings for which i sought seemed to have melted away for many minutes i beat the mist with my arms like one at blind mans buff turning sharply in circles cursing aloud at my stupidity and crying continually for help at last a voice answered me from the fog and i found myself held in the circle of a policemans lantern that is the end of my adventure what i have to tell you now is what i learned from the police at the stationhouse to which the man guided me i related what you have just heard i told them that the house they must at once find was one set back from the street within a radius of two hundred yards from the knightsbridge barracks that within fifty yards of it someone was giving a dance to the music of a hungarian band and that the railings before it were as high as a mans waist and filed to a point with that to work upon twenty men were at once ordered out into the fog to search for the house and inspector lyle himself was despatched to the home of lord edam chetneys father with a warrant for lord arthurs arrest i was thanked and dismissed on my own recognizance this morning inspector lyle called on me and from him i learned the police theory of the scene i have just described apparently i had wandered very far in the fog for up to noon today the house had not been found nor had they been able to arrest lord arthur he did not return to his fathers house last night and there is no trace of him but from what the police knew of the past lives of the people i found in that lost house they have evolved a theory and their theory is that the murders were committed by lord arthur the infatuation of his elder brother lord chetney for a russian princess so inspector lyle tells me is well known to everyone about two years ago the princess zichy as she calls herself and he were constantly together and chetney informed his friends that they were about to be married the woman was notorious in two continents and when lord edam heard of his sons infatuation he appealed to the police for her record it is through his having applied to them that they know so much concerning her and her relations with the chetneys from the police lord edam learned that madame zichy had once been a spy in the employ of the russian third section but that lately she had been repudiated by her own government and was living by her wits by blackmail and by her beauty lord edam laid this record before his son but chetney either knew it already or the woman persuaded him not to believe in it and the father and son parted in great anger two days later the marquis altered his will leaving all of his money to the younger brother arthur the title and some of the landed property he could not keep from chetney but he swore if his son saw the woman again that the will should stand as it was and he would be left without a penny this was about eighteen months ago when apparently chetney tired of the princess and suddenly went off to shoot and explore in central africa no word came from him except that twice he was reported as having died of fever in the jungle and finally two traders reached the coast who said they had seen his body this was accepted by all as conclusive and young arthur was recognized as the heir to the edam millions on the strength of this supposition he at once began to borrow enormous sums from the moneylenders this is of great importance as the police believe it was these debts which drove him to the murder of his brother yesterday as you know lord chetney suddenly returned from the grave and it was the fact that for two years he had been considered as dead which lent such importance to his return and which gave rise to those columns of detail concerning him which appeared in all the afternoon papers but obviously during his absence he had not tired of the princess zichy for we know that a few hours after he reached london he sought her out his brother who had also learned of his reappearance through the papers probably suspected which would be the house he would first visit and followed him there arriving so the russian servant tells us while the two were at coffee in the drawingroom the princess then we also learn from the servant withdrew to the diningroom leaving the brothers together what happened one can only guess lord arthur knew now that when it was discovered he was no longer the heir the moneylenders would come down upon him the police believe that he at once sought out his brother to beg for money to cover the postobits but that considering the sum he needed was several hundreds of thousands of pounds chetney refused to give it him no one knew that arthur had gone to seek out his brother they were alone it is possible then that in a passion of disappointment and crazed with the disgrace which he saw before him young arthur made himself the heir beyond further question the death of his brother would have availed nothing if the woman remained alive it is then possible that he crossed the hall and with the same weapon which made him lord edams heir destroyed the solitary witness to the murder the only other person who could have seen it was sleeping in a drunken stupor to which fact undoubtedly he owed his life and yet concluded the naval attache leaning forward and marking each word with his finger lord arthur blundered fatally in his haste he left the door of the house open so giving access to the first passerby and he forgot that when he entered it he had handed his card to the servant that piece of paper may yet send him to the gallows in the meantime he has disappeared completely and somewhere in one of the millions of streets of this great capital in a locked and empty house lies the body of his brother and of the woman his brother loved undiscovered unburied and with their murder unavenged in the discussion which followed the conclusion of the story of the naval attache the gentleman with the pearl took no part instead he arose and beckoning a servant to a far corner of the room whispered earnestly to him until a sudden movement on the part of sir andrew caused him to return hurriedly to the table there are several points in mr searss story i want explained he cried be seated sir andrew he begged let us have the opinion of an expert i do not care what the police think i want to know what you think but sir andrew rose reluctantly from his chair i should like nothing better than to discuss this he said but it is most important that i proceed to the house i should have been there some time ago he turned toward the servant and directed him to call a hansom the gentleman with the pearl stud looked appealingly at the naval attache there are surely many details that you have not told us he urged some you have forgotten the baronet interrupted quickly i trust not he said for i could not possibly stop to hear them the story is finished declared the naval attache until lord arthur is arrested or the bodies are found there is nothing more to tell of either chetney or the princess zichy of lord chetney perhaps not interrupted the sportinglooking gentleman with the black tie but therell always be something to tell of the princess zichy i know enough stories about her to fill a book she was a most remarkable woman the speaker dropped the end of his cigar into his coffeecup and taking his case from his pocket selected a fresh one as he did so he laughed and held up the case that the others might see it it was an ordinary cigarcase of wellworn pigskin with a silver clasp the only time i ever met her he said she tried to rob me of this the baronet regarded him closely she tried to rob you he repeated tried to rob me of this continued the gentleman in the black tie and of the czarinas diamonds his tone was one of mingled admiration and injury the czarinas diamonds exclaimed the baronet he glanced quickly and suspiciously at the speaker and then at the others about the table but their faces gave evidence of no other emotion than that of ordinary interest yes the czarinas diamonds repeated the man with the black tie it was a necklace of diamonds i was told to take them to the russian ambassador in paris who was to deliver them at moscow i am a queens messenger he added oh i see exclaimed sir andrew in a tone of relief and you say that this same princess zichy one of the victims of this double murder endeavored to rob you of of that cigarcase and the czarinas diamonds answered the queens messenger imperturbably its not much of a story but it gives you an idea of the womans character the robbery took place between paris and marseilles the baronet interrupted him with an abrupt movement no no he cried shaking his head in protest do not tempt me i really cannot listen i must be at the house in ten minutes i am sorry said the queens messenger he turned to those seated about him i wonder if the other gentlemen he inquired tentatively there was a chorus of polite murmurs and the queens messenger bowing his head in acknowledgment took a preparatory sip from his glass at the same moment the servant to whom the man with the black pearl had spoken slipped a piece of paper into his hand he glanced at it frowned and threw it under the table the servant bowed to the baronet your hansom is waiting sir andrew he said the necklace was worth twenty thousand pounds began the queens messenger it was a present from the queen of england to celebrate the baronet gave an exclamation of angry annoyance upon my word this is most provoking he interrupted i really ought not to stay but i certainly mean to hear this he turned irritably to the servant tell the hansom to wait he commanded and with an air of a boy who is playing truant slipped guiltily into his chair the gentleman with the black pearl smiled blandly and rapped upon the table order gentlemen he said order for the story of the queens messenger and the czarinas diamonds ii the necklace was a present from the queen of england to the czarina of russia began the queens messenger it was to celebrate the occasion of the czars coronation our foreign office knew that the russian ambassador in paris was to proceed to moscow for that ceremony and i was directed to go to paris and turn over the necklace to him but when i reached paris i found he had not expected me for a week later and was taking a few days vacation at nice his people asked me to leave the necklace with them at the embassy but i had been charged to get a receipt for it from the ambassador himself so i started at once for nice the fact that monte carlo is not two thousand miles from nice may have had something to do with making me carry out my instructions so carefully now how the princess zichy came to find out about the necklace i dont know but i can guess as you have just heard she was at one time a spy in the service of the russian government and after they dismissed her she kept up her acquaintance with many of the russian agents in london it is probable that through one of them she learned that the necklace was to be sent to moscow and which one of the queens messengers had been detailed to take it there still i doubt if even that knowledge would have helped her if she had not also known something which i supposed no one else in the world knew but myself and one other man and curiously enough the other man was a queens messenger too and a friend of mine you must know that up to the time of this robbery i had always concealed my despatches in a manner peculiarly my own i got the idea from that play called a scrap of paper in it a man wants to hide a certain compromising document he knows that all his rooms will be secretly searched for it so he puts it in a torn envelope and sticks it up where anyone can see it on his mantleshelf the result is that the woman who is ransacking the house to find it looks in all the unlikely places but passes over the scrap of paper that is just under her nose sometimes the papers and packages they give us to carry about europe are of very great value and sometimes they are special makes of cigarettes and orders to courtdressmakers sometimes we know what we are carrying and sometimes we do not if it is a large sum of money or a treaty they generally tell us but as a rule we have no knowledge of what the package contains so to be on the safe side we naturally take just as great care of it as though we knew it held the terms of an ultimatum or the crownjewels as a rule my confreres carry the official packages in a despatchbox which is just as obvious as a ladys jewelbag in the hands of her maid everyone knows they are carrying something of value they put a premium on dishonesty well after i saw the scrapofpaper play i determined to put the government valuables in the most unlikely place that anyone would look for them so i used to hide the documents they gave me inside my ridingboots and small articles such as money or jewels i carried in an old cigarcase after i took to using my case for that purpose i bought a new one exactly like it for my cigars but to avoid mistakes i had my initials placed on both sides of the new one and the moment i touched the case even in the dark i could tell which it was by the raised initials no one knew of this except the queens messenger of whom i spoke we once left paris together on the orient express i was going to constantinople and he was to stop off at vienna on the journey i told him of my peculiar way of hiding things and showed him my cigarcase if i recollect rightly on that trip it held the grand cross of st michael and st george which the queen was sending to our ambassador the messenger was very much entertained at my scheme and some months later when he met the princess he told her about it as an amusing story of course he had no idea she was a russian spy he didnt know anything at all about her except that she was a very attractive woman it was indiscreet but he could not possibly have guessed that she could ever make any use of what he told her later after the robbery i remembered that i had informed this young chap of my secret hidingplace and when i saw him again i questioned him about it he was greatly distressed and said he had never seen the importance of the secret he remembered he had told several people of it and among others the princess zichy in that way i found out that it was she who had robbed me and i know that from the moment i left london she was following me and that she knew then that the diamonds were concealed in my cigarcase my train for nice left paris at ten in the morning when i travel at night i generally tell the chef de gare that i am a queens messenger and he gives me a compartment to myself but in the daytime i take whatever offers on this morning i had found an empty compartment and i had tipped the guard to keep everyone else out not from any fear of losing the diamonds but because i wanted to smoke he had locked the door and as the last bell had rung i supposed i was to travel alone so i began to arrange my traps and make myself comfortable the diamonds in the cigarcase were in the inside pocket of my waistcoat and as they made a bulky package i took them out intending to put them in my handbag it is a small satchel like a bookmakers or those handbags that couriers carry i wear it slung from a strap across my shoulders and no matter whether i am sitting or walking it never leaves me i took the cigarcase which held the necklace from my inside pocket and the case which held the cigars out of the satchel and while i was searching through it for a box of matches i laid the two cases beside me on the seat at that moment the train started but at the same instant there was a rattle at the lock of the compartment and a couple of porters lifted and shoved a woman through the door and hurled her rugs and umbrellas in after her instinctively i reached for the diamonds i shoved them quickly into the satchel and pushing them far down to the bottom of the bag snapped the springlock then i put the cigars in the pocket of my coat but with the thought that now that i had a woman as a travelling companion i would probably not be allowed to enjoy them one of her pieces of luggage had fallen at my feet and a roll of rugs had landed at my side i thought if i hid the fact that the lady was not welcome and at once endeavored to be civil she might permit me to smoke so i picked her handbag off the floor and asked her where i might place it as i spoke i looked at her for the first time and saw that she was a most remarkably handsome woman she smiled charmingly and begged me not to disturb myself then she arranged her own things about her and opening her dressingbag took out a gold cigarettecase do you object to smoke she asked i laughed and assured her i had been in great terror lest she might object to it herself if you like cigarettes she said will you try some of these they are rolled especially for my husband in russia and they are supposed to be very good i thanked her and took one from her case and i found it so much better than my own that i continued to smoke her cigarettes throughout the rest of the journey i must say that we got on very well i judged from the coronet on her cigarettecase and from her manner which was quite as well bred as that of any woman i ever met that she was someone of importance and though she seemed almost too goodlooking to be respectable i determined that she was some grande dame who was so assured of her position that she could afford to be unconventional at first she read her novel and then she made some comment on the scenery and finally we began to discuss the current politics of the continent she talked of all the cities in europe and seemed to know everyone worth knowing but she volunteered nothing about herself except that she frequently made use of the expression when my husband was stationed at vienna or when my husband was promoted to rome once she said to me i have often seen you at monte carlo i saw you when you won the pigeonchampionship i told her that i was not a pigeonshot and she gave a little start of surprise oh i beg your pardon she said i thought you were morton hamilton the english champion as a matter of fact i do look like hamilton but i know now that her object was to make me think that she had no idea as to who i really was she neednt have acted at all for i certainly had no suspicions of her and was only too pleased to have so charming a companion the one thing that should have made me suspicious was the fact that at every station she made some trivial excuse to get me out of the compartment she pretended that her maid was travelling back of us in one of the secondclass carriages and kept saying she could not imagine why the woman did not come to look after her and if the maid did not turn up at the next stop would i be so very kind as to get out and bring her whatever it was she pretended she wanted i had taken my dressingcase from the rack to get out a novel and had left it on the seat opposite to mine and at the end of the compartment farthest from her and once when i came back from buying her a cup of chocolate or from some other foolerrand i found her standing at my end of the compartment with both hands on the dressingbag she looked at me without so much as winking an eye and shoved the case carefully into a corner your bag slipped off on the floor she said if youve got any bottles in it you had better look and see that theyre not broken and i give you my word i was such an ass that i did open the case and looked all through it she must have thought i was a juggins i get hot all over whenever i remember it but in spite of my dulness and her cleverness she couldnt gain anything by sending me away because what she wanted was in the handbag and every time she sent me away the handbag went with me after the incident of the dressingcase her manner changed either in my absence she had had time to look through it or when i was examining it for broken bottles she had seen everything it held from that moment she must have been certain that the cigarcase in which she knew i carried the diamonds was in the bag that was fastened to my body and from that time on she probably was plotting how to get it from me her anxiety became most apparent she dropped the greatlady manner and her charming condescension went with it she ceased talking and when i spoke answered me irritably or at random no doubt her mind was entirely occupied with her plan the end of our journey was drawing rapidly nearer and her time for action was being cut down with the speed of the expresstrain even i unsuspicious as i was noticed that something was very wrong with her i really believe that before we reached marseilles if i had not through my own stupidity given her the chance she wanted she might have stuck a knife in me and rolled me out on the rails but as it was i only thought that the long journey had tired her i suggested that it was a very trying trip and asked her if she would allow me to offer her some of my cognac she thanked me and said no and then suddenly her eyes lighted and she exclaimed yes thank you if you will be so kind my flask was in the handbag and i placed it on my lap and with my thumb slipped back the catch as i keep my tickets and railroadguide in the bag i am so constantly opening it that i never bother to lock it and the fact that it is strapped to me has always been sufficient protection but i can appreciate now what a satisfaction and what a torment too it must have been to that woman when she saw that the bag opened without a key while we were crossing the mountains i had felt rather chilly and had been wearing a light racingcoat but after the lamps were lighted the compartment became very hot and stuffy and i found the coat uncomfortable so i stood up and after first slipping the strap of the bag over my head i placed the bag in the seat next me and pulled off the racingcoat i dont blame myself for being careless the bag was still within reach of my hand and nothing would have happened if at that exact moment the train had not stopped at arles it was the combination of my removing the bag and our entering the station at the same instant which gave the princess zichy the chance she wanted to rob me i neednt say that she was clever enough to take it the train ran into the station at full speed and came to a sudden stop i had just thrown my coat into the rack and had reached out my hand for the bag in another instant i would have had the strap around my shoulder but at that moment the princess threw open the door of the compartment and beckoned wildly at the people on the platform natalie she called natalie here i am come here this way she turned upon me in the greatest excitement my maid she cried she is looking for me she passed the window without seeing me go please and bring her back she continued pointing out of the door and beckoning me with her other hand there certainly was something about that womans tone which made one jump when she was giving orders you had no chance to think of anything else so i rushed out on my errand of mercy and then rushed back again to ask what the maid looked like in black she answered rising and blocking the door of the compartment all in black with a bonnet the train waited three minutes at arles and in that time i suppose i must have rushed up to over twenty women and asked are you natalie the only reason i wasnt punched with an umbrella or handed over to the police was that they probably thought i was crazy when i jumped back into the compartment the princess was seated where i had left her but her eyes were burning with happiness she placed her hand on my arm almost affectionately and said in a hysterical way you are very kind to me i am so sorry to have troubled you i protested that every woman on the platform was dressed in black indeed i am so sorry she said laughing and she continued to laugh until she began to breathe so quickly that i thought she was going to faint i can see now that the last part of that journey must have been a terrible halfhour for her she had the cigarcase safe enough but she knew that she herself was not safe she understood if i were to open my bag even at the last minute and miss the case i would know positively that she had taken it i had placed the diamonds in the bag at the very moment she entered the compartment and no one but our two selves had occupied it since she knew that when we reached marseilles she would either be twenty thousand pounds richer than when she left paris or that she would go to jail that was the situation as she must have read it and i dont envy her her state of mind during that last halfhour it must have been hell i saw that something was wrong and in my innocence i even wondered if possibly my cognac had not been a little too strong for she suddenly developed into a most brilliant conversationalist and applauded and laughed at everything i said and fired off questions at me like a machinegun so that i had no time to think of anything but of what she was saying whenever i stirred she stopped her chattering and leaned toward me and watched me like a cat over a mousehole i wondered how i could have considered her an agreeable travellingcompanion i thought i would have preferred to be locked in with a lunatic i dont like to think how she would have acted if i had made a move to examine the bag but as i had it safely strapped around me again i did not open it and i reached marseilles alive as we drew into the station she shook hands with me and grinned at me like a cheshire cat i cannot tell you she said how much i have to thank you for what do you think of that for impudence i offered to put her in a carriage but she said she must find natalie and that she hoped we would meet again at the hotel so i drove off by myself wondering who she was and whether natalie was not her keeper i had to wait several hours for the train to nice and as i wanted to stroll around the city i thought i had better put the diamonds in the safe of the hotel as soon as i reached my room i locked the door placed the handbag on the table and opened it i felt among the things at the top of it but failed to touch the cigarcase i shoved my hand in deeper and stirred the things about but still i did not reach it a cold wave swept down my spine and a sort of emptiness came to the pit of my stomach then i turned redhot and the sweat sprung out all over me i wet my lips with my tongue and said to myself dont be an ass pull yourself together pull yourself together take the things out one at a time its there of course its there dont be an ass so i put a brake on my nerves and began very carefully to pick out the things one by one but after another second i could not stand it and i rushed across the room and threw out everything on the bed but the diamonds were not among them i pulled the things about and tore them open and shuffled and rearranged and sorted them but it was no use the cigarcase was gone i threw everything in the dressingcase out on the floor although i knew it was useless to look for it there i knew that i had put it in the bag i sat down and tried to think i remembered i had put it in the satchel at paris just as that woman had entered the compartment and i had been alone with her ever since so it was she who had robbed me but how it had never left my shoulder and then i remembered that it had that i had taken it off when i had changed my coat and for the few moments that i was searching for natalie i remembered that the woman had sent me on that goosechase and that at every other station she had tried to get rid of me on some foolerrand i gave a roar like a mad bull and i jumped down the stairs six steps at a time i demanded at the office if a distinguished lady of title possibly a russian had just entered the hotel as i expected she had not i sprang into a cab and inquired at two other hotels and then i saw the folly of trying to catch her without outside help and i ordered the fellow to gallop to the office of the chief of police i told my story and the ass in charge asked me to calm myself and wanted to take notes i told him this was no time for taking notes but for doing something he got wrathy at that and i demanded to be taken at once to his chief the chief he said was very busy and could not see me so i showed him my silver greyhound in eleven years i had never used it but once before i stated in pretty vigorous language that i was a queens messenger and that if the chief of police did not see me instantly he would lose his official head at that the fellow jumped off his high horse and ran with me to his chief a smart young chap a colonel in the army and a very intelligent man i explained that i had been robbed in a french railwaycarriage of a diamondnecklace belonging to the queen of england which her majesty was sending as a present to the czarina of russia i pointed out to him that if he succeeded in capturing the thief he would be made for life and would receive the gratitude of three great powers he wasnt the sort that thinks second thoughts are best he saw russian and french decorations sprouting all over his chest and he hit a bell and pressed buttons and yelled out orders like the captain of a pennysteamer in a fog he sent her description to all the citygates and ordered all cabmen and railwayporters to search all trains leaving marseilles he ordered all passengers on outgoing vessels to be examined and telegraphed the proprietors of every hotel and pension to send him a complete list of their guests within the hour while i was standing there he must have given at least a hundred orders and sent out enough commissaires sergeants de ville gendarmes bicyclepolice and plainclothes johnnies to have captured the entire german army when they had gone he assured me that the woman was as good as arrested already indeed officially she was arrested for she had no more chance of escape from marseilles than from the chateau dif he told me to return to my hotel and possess my soul in peace within an hour he assured me he would acquaint me with her arrest i thanked him and complimented him on his energy and left him but i didnt share in his confidence i felt that she was a very clever woman and a match for any and all of us it was all very well for him to be jubilant he had not lost the diamonds and had everything to gain if he found them while i even if he did recover the necklace would only be where i was before i lost them and if he did not recover it i was a ruined man it was an awful facer for me i had always prided myself on my record in eleven years i had never mislaid an envelope nor missed taking the first train and now i had failed in the most important mission that had ever been intrusted to me and it wasnt a thing that could be hushed up either it was too conspicuous too spectacular it was sure to invite the widest notoriety i saw myself ridiculed all over the continent and perhaps dismissed even suspected of having taken the thing myself i was walking in front of a lighted cafe and i felt so sick and miserable that i stopped for a pickmeup then i considered that if i took one drink i would probably in my present state of mind not want to stop under twenty and i decided i had better leave it alone but my nerves were jumping like a frightened rabbit and i felt i must have something to quiet them or i would go crazy i reached for my cigarettecase but a cigarette seemed hardly adequate so i put it back again and took out this cigarcase in which i keep only the strongest and blackest cigars i opened it and stuck in my fingers but instead of a cigar they touched on a thin leather envelope my heart stood perfectly still i did not dare to look but i dug my fingernails into the leather and i felt layers of thin paper then a layer of cotton and then they scratched on the facets of the czarinas diamonds i stumbled as though i had been hit in the face and fell back into one of the chairs on the sidewalk i tore off the wrappings and spread out the diamonds on the cafetable i could not believe they were real i twisted the necklace between my fingers and crushed it between my palms and tossed it up in the air i believe i almost kissed it the women in the cafe stood up on the chairs to see better and laughed and screamed and the people crowded so close around me that the waiters had to form a bodyguard the proprietor thought there was a fight and called for the police i was so happy i didnt care i laughed too and gave the proprietor a fivepound note and told him to stand everyone a drink then i tumbled into a fiacre and galloped off to my friend the chief of police i felt very sorry for him he had been so happy at the chance i gave him and he was sure to be disappointed when he learned i had sent him off on a false alarm but now that i had found the necklace i did not want him to find the woman indeed i was most anxious that she should get clear away for if she were caught the truth would come out and i was likely to get a sharp reprimand and sure to be laughed at i could see now how it had happened in my haste to hide the diamonds when the woman was hustled into the carriage i had shoved the cigars into the satchel and the diamonds into the pocket of my coat now that i had the diamonds safe again it seemed a very natural mistake but i doubted if the foreign office would think so i was afraid it might not appreciate the beautiful simplicity of my secret hidingplace so when i reached the policestation and found that the woman was still at large i was more than relieved as i expected the chief was extremely chagrined when he learned of my mistake and that there was nothing for him to do but i was feeling so happy myself that i hated to have anyone else miserable so i suggested that this attempt to steal the czarinas necklace might be only the first of a series of such attempts by an unscrupulous gang and that i might still be in danger i winked at the chief and the chief smiled at me and we went to nice together in a salooncar with a guard of twelve carabineers and twelve plainclothes men and the chief and i drank champagne all the way we marched together up to the hotel where the russian ambassador was stopping closely surrounded by our escort of carabineers and delivered the necklace with the most profound ceremony the old ambassador was immensely impressed and when we hinted that already i had been made the object of an attack by robbers he assured us that his imperial majesty would not prove ungrateful i wrote a swinging personal letter about the invaluable services of the chief to the french minister of foreign affairs and they gave him enough russian and french medals to satisfy even a french soldier so though he never caught the woman he received his just reward the queens messenger paused and surveyed the faces of those about him in some embarrassment but the worst of it is he added that the story must have got about for while the princess obtained nothing from me but a cigarcase and five excellent cigars a few weeks after the coronation the czar sent me a gold cigarcase with his monogram in diamonds and i dont know yet whether that was a coincidence or whether the czar wanted me to know that he knew that i had been carrying the czarinas diamonds in my pigskin cigarcase what do you fellows think iii sir andrew rose with disapproval written in every lineament i thought your story would bear upon the murder he said had i imagined it would have nothing whatsoever to do with it i would not have remained he pushed back his chair and bowed stiffly i wish you good night he said there was a chorus of remonstrance and under cover of this and the baronets answering protests a servant for the second time slipped a piece of paper into the hand of the gentleman with the pearl stud he read the lines written upon it and tore it into tiny fragments the youngest member who had remained an interested but silent listener to the tale of the queens messenger raised his hand commandingly sir andrew he cried in justice to lord arthur chetney i must ask you to be seated he has been accused in our hearing of a most serious crime and i insist that you remain until you have heard me clear his character you cried the baronet yes answered the young man briskly i would have spoken sooner he explained but that i thought this gentleman he inclined his head toward the queens messenger was about to contribute some facts of which i was ignorant he however has told us nothing and so i will take up the tale at the point where lieutenant sears laid it down and give you those details of which lieutenant sears is ignorant it seems strange to you that i should be able to add the sequel to this story but the coincidence is easily explained i am the junior member of the law firm of chudleigh chudleigh we have been solicitors for the chetneys for the last two hundred years nothing no matter how unimportant which concerns lord edam and his two sons is unknown to us and naturally we are acquainted with every detail of the terrible catastrophe of last night the baronet bewildered but eager sank back into his chair will you be long sir he demanded i shall endeavor to be brief said the young solicitor and he added in a tone which gave his words almost the weight of a threat i promise to be interesting there is no need to promise that said sir andrew i find it much too interesting as it is he glanced ruefully at the clock and turned his eyes quickly from it tell the driver of that hansom he called to the servant that i take him by the hour for the last three days began young mr chudleigh as you have probably read in the daily papers the marquis of edam has been at the point of death and his physicians have never left his house every hour he seemed to grow weaker but although his bodily strength is apparently leaving him forever his mind has remained clear and active late yesterday evening word was received at our office that he wished my father to come at once to chetney house and to bring with him certain papers what these papers were is not essential i mention them only to explain how it was that last night i happened to be at lord edams bedside i accompanied my father to chetney house but at the time we reached there lord edam was sleeping and his physicians refused to have him awakened my father urged that he should be allowed to receive lord edams instructions concerning the documents but the physicians would not disturb him and we all gathered in the library to wait until he should awake of his own accord it was about one oclock in the morning while we were still there that inspector lyle and the officers from scotland yard came to arrest lord arthur on the charge of murdering his brother you can imagine our dismay and distress like everyone else i had learned from the afternoon papers that lord chetney was not dead but that he had returned to england and on arriving at chetney house i had been told that lord arthur had gone to the bath hotel to look for his brother and to inform him that if he wished to see their father alive he must come to him at once although it was now past one oclock arthur had not returned none of us knew where madame zichy lived so we could not go to recover lord chetneys body we spent a most miserable night hastening to the window whenever a cab came into the square in the hope that it was arthur returning and endeavoring to explain away the facts that pointed to him as the murderer i am a friend of arthurs i was with him at harrow and at oxford and i refused to believe for an instant that he was capable of such a crime but as a lawyer i could not help but see that the circumstantial evidence was strongly against him toward early morning lord edam awoke and in so much better a state of health that he refused to make the changes in the papers which he had intended declaring that he was no nearer death than ourselves under other circumstances this happy change in him would have relieved us greatly but none of us could think of anything save the death of his elder son and of the charge which hung over arthur as long as inspector lyle remained in the house my father decided that i as one of the legal advisers of the family should also remain there but there was little for either of us to do arthur did not return and nothing occurred until late this morning when lyle received word that the russian servant had been arrested he at once drove to scotland yard to question him he came back to us in an hour and informed me that the servant had refused to tell anything of what had happened the night before or of himself or of the princess zichy he would not even give them the address of her house he is in abject terror lyle said i assured him that he was not suspected of the crime but he would tell me nothing there were no other developments until two oclock this afternoon when word was brought to us that arthur had been found and that he was lying in the accidentward of st georges hospital lyle and i drove there together and found him propped up in bed with his head bound in a bandage he had been brought to the hospital the night before by the driver of a hansom that had run over him in the fog the cabhorse had kicked him on the head and he had been carried in unconscious there was nothing on him to tell who he was and it was not until he came to his senses this afternoon that the hospital authorities had been able to send word to his people lyle at once informed him that he was under arrest and with what he was charged and though the inspector warned him to say nothing which might be used against him i as his solicitor instructed him to speak freely and to tell us all he knew of the occurrences of last night it was evident to anyone that the fact of his brothers death was of much greater concern to him than that he was accused of his murder that arthur said contemptuously that is damned nonsense it is monstrous and cruel we parted better friends than we have been in years i will tell you all that happened not to clear myself but to help you to find out the truth his story is as follows yesterday afternoon owing to his constant attendance on his father he did not look at the evening papers and it was not until after dinner when the butler brought him one and told him of its contents that he learned that his brother was alive and at the bath hotel he drove there at once but was told that about eight oclock his brother had gone out but without giving any clew to his destination as chetney had not at once come to see his father arthur decided that he was still angry with him and his mind turning naturally to the cause of their quarrel determined him to look for chetney at the home of the princess zichy her house had been pointed out to him and though he had never visited it he had passed it many times and knew its exact location he accordingly drove in that direction as far as the fog would permit the hansom to go and walked the rest of the way reaching the house about nine oclock he rang and was admitted by the russian servant the man took his card into the drawingroom and at once his brother ran out and welcomed him he was followed by the princess zichy who also received arthur most cordially you brothers will have much to talk about she said i am going to the diningroom when you have finished let me know as soon as she had left them arthur told his brother that their father was not expected to outlive the night and that he must come to him at once this is not the moment to remember your quarrel arthur said to him you have come back from the dead only in time to make your peace with him before he dies arthur says that at this chetney was greatly moved you entirely misunderstand me arthur he returned i did not know the governor was ill or i would have gone to him the instant i arrived my only reason for not doing so was because i thought he was still angry with me i shall return with you immediately as soon as i have said goodby to the princess it is a final goodby after tonight i shall never see her again do you mean that arthur cried yes chetney answered when i returned to london i had no intention of seeking her again and i am here only through a mistake he then told arthur that he had separated from the princess even before he went to central africa and that moreover while at cairo on his way south he had learned certain facts concerning her life there during the previous season which made it impossible for him to ever wish to see her again their separation was final and complete she deceived me cruelly he said i cannot tell you how cruelly during the two years when i was trying to obtain my fathers consent to our marriage she was in love with a russian diplomat during all that time he was secretly visiting her here in london and her trip to cairo was only an excuse to meet him there yet you are here with her tonight arthur protested only a few hours after your return that is easily explained chetney answered as i finished dinner tonight at the hotel i received a note from her from this address in it she said she had just learned of my arrival and begged me to come to her at once she wrote that she was in great and present trouble dying of an incurable illness and without friends or money she begged me for the sake of old times to come to her assistance during the last two years in the jungle all my former feeling for zichy has utterly passed away but no one could have dismissed the appeal she made in that letter so i came here and found her as you have seen her quite as beautiful as she ever was in very good health and from the look of the house in no need of money i asked her what she meant by writing me that she was dying in a garret and she laughed and said she had done so because she was afraid unless i thought she needed help i would not try to see her that was where we were when you arrived and now chetney added i will say goodby to her and you had better return home no you can trust me i shall follow you at once she has no influence over me now but i believe in spite of the way she has used me that she is after her queer fashion still fond of me and when she learns that this goodby is final there may be a scene and it is not fair to her that you should be here so go home at once and tell the governor that i am following you in ten minutes that said arthur is the way we parted i never left him on more friendly terms i was happy to see him alive again i was happy to think he had returned in time to make up his quarrel with my father and i was happy that at last he was shut of that woman i was never better pleased with him in my life he turned to inspector lyle who was sitting at the foot of the bed taking notes of all he told us why in the name of commonsense he cried should i have chosen that moment of all others to send my brother back to the grave for a moment the inspector did not answer him i do not know if any of you gentlemen are acquainted with inspector lyle but if you are not i can assure you that he is a very remarkable man our firm often applies to him for aid and he has never failed us my father has the greatest possible respect for him where he has the advantage over the ordinary policeofficial is in the fact that he possesses imagination he imagines himself to be the criminal imagines how he would act under the same circumstances and he imagines to such purpose that he generally finds the man he wants i have often told lyle that if he had not been a detective he would have made a great success as a poet or a playwright when arthur turned on him lyle hesitated for a moment and then told him exactly what was the case against him ever since your brother was reported as having died in africa he said your lordship has been collecting money on postobits lord chetneys arrival last night turned them into wastepaper you were suddenly in debt for thousands of pounds for much more than you could ever possibly pay no one knew that you and your brother had met at madame zichys but you knew that your father was not expected to outlive the night and that if your brother were dead also you would be saved from complete ruin and that you would become the marquis of edam oh that is how you have worked it out is it arthur cried and for me to become lord edam was it necessary that the woman should die too they will say lyle answered that she was a witness to the murder that she would have told then why did i not kill the servant as well arthur said he was asleep and saw nothing and you believe that arthur demanded it is not a question of what i believe lyle said gravely it is a question for your peers the man is insolent arthur cried the thing is monstrous horrible before we could stop him he sprang out of his cot and began pulling on his clothes when the nurses tried to hold him down he fought with them do you think you can keep me here he shouted when they are plotting to hang me i am going with you to that house he cried at lyle when you find those bodies i shall be beside you it is my right he is my brother he has been murdered and i can tell you who murdered him that woman murdered him she first ruined his life and now she has killed him for the last five years she has been plotting to make herself his wife and last night when he told her he had discovered the truth about the russian and that she would never see him again she flew into a passion and stabbed him and then in terror of the gallows killed herself she murdered him i tell you and i promise you that we will find the knife she used near her perhaps still in her hand what will you say to that lyle turned his head away and stared down at the floor i might say he answered that you placed it there arthur gave a cry of anger and sprang at him and then pitched forward into his arms the blood was running from the cut under the bandage and he had fainted lyle carried him back to the bed again and we left him with the police and the doctors and drove at once to the address he had given us we found the house not three minutes walk from st georges hospital it stands in trevor terrace that little row of houses set back from knightsbridge with one end in hill street as we left the hospital lyle had said to me you must not blame me for treating him as i did all is fair in this work and if by angering that boy i could have made him commit himself i was right in trying to do so though i assure you no one would be better pleased than myself if i could prove his theory to be correct but we cannot tell everything depends upon what we see for ourselves within the next few minutes when we reached the house lyle broke open the fastenings of one of the windows on the groundfloor and hidden by the trees in the garden we scrambled in we found ourselves in the receptionroom which was the first room on the right of the hall the gas was still burning behind the colored glass and red silk shades and when the daylight streamed in after us it gave the hall a hideously dissipated look like the foyer of a theatre at a matinee or the entrance to an allday gamblinghall the house was oppressively silent and because we knew why it was so silent we spoke in whispers when lyle turned the handle of the drawingroom door i felt as though someone had put his hand upon my throat but i followed close at his shoulder and saw in the subdued light of manytinted lamps the body of chetney at the foot of the divan just as lieutenant sears had described it in the drawingroom we found the body of the princess zichy her arms thrown out and the blood from her heart frozen in a tiny line across her bare shoulder but neither of us although we searched the floor on our hands and knees could find the weapon which had killed her for arthurs sake i said i would have given a thousand pounds if we had found the knife in her hand as he said we would that we have not found it there lyle answered is to my mind the strongest proof that he is telling the truth that he left the house before the murder took place he is not a fool and had he stabbed his brother and this woman he would have seen that by placing the knife near her he could help to make it appear as if she had killed chetney and then committed suicide besides lord arthur insisted that the evidence in his behalf would be our finding the knife here he would not have urged that if he knew we would not find it if he knew he himself had carried it away this is no suicide a suicide does not rise and hide the weapon with which he kills himself and then lie down again no this has been a double murder and we must look outside of the house for the murderer while he was speaking lyle and i had been searching every corner studying the details of each room i was so afraid that without telling me he would make some deductions prejudicial to arthur that i never left his side i was determined to see everything that he saw and if possible to prevent his interpreting it in the wrong way he finally finished his examination and we sat down together in the drawingroom and he took out his notebook and read aloud all that mr sears had told him of the murder and what we had just learned from arthur we compared the two accounts word for word and weighed statement with statement but i could not determine from anything lyle said which of the two versions he had decided to believe we are trying to build a house of blocks he exclaimed with half of the blocks missing we have been considering two theories he went on one that lord arthur is responsible for both murders and the other that the dead woman in there is responsible for one of them and has committed suicide but until the russian servant is ready to talk i shall refuse to believe in the guilt of either what can you prove by him i asked he was drunk and asleep he saw nothing lyle hesitated and then as though he had made up his mind to be quite frank with me spoke freely i do not know that he was either drunk or asleep he answered lieutenant sears describes him as a stupid boor i am not satisfied that he is not a clever actor what was his position in this house what was his real duty here suppose it was not to guard this woman but to watch her let us imagine that it was not the woman he served but a master and see where that leads us for this house has a master a mysterious absentee landlord who lives in st petersburg the unknown russian who came between chetney and zichy and because of whom chetney left her he is the man who bought this house for madame zichy who sent these rugs and curtains from st petersburg to furnish it for her after his own tastes and i believe it was he also who placed the russian servant here ostensibly to serve the princess but in reality to spy upon her at scotland yard we do not know who this gentleman is the russian police confess to equal ignorance concerning him when lord chetney went to africa madame zichy lived in st petersburg but there her receptions and dinners were so crowded with members of the nobility and of the army and diplomats that among so many visitors the police could not learn which was the one for whom she most greatly cared lyle pointed at the modern french paintings and the heavy silk rugs which hung upon the walls the unknown is a man of taste and of some fortune he said not the sort of man to send a stupid peasant to guard the woman he loves so i am not content to believe with mr sears that the servant is a boor i believe him instead to be a very clever ruffian i believe him to be the protector of his masters honor or let us say of his masters property whether that property be silver plate or the woman his master loves last night after lord arthur had gone away the servant was left alone in this house with lord chetney and madame zichy from where he sat in the hall he could hear lord chetney bidding her farewell for if my idea of him is correct he understands english quite as well as you or i let us imagine that he heard her entreating chetney not to leave her reminding him of his former wish to marry her and let us suppose that he hears chetney denounce her and tell her that at cairo he has learned of this russian admirer the servants master he hears the woman declare that she has had no admirer but himself that this unknown russian was and is nothing to her that there is no man she loves but him and that she cannot live knowing that he is alive without his love suppose chetney believed her suppose his former infatuation for her returned and that in a moment of weakness he forgave her and took her in his arms that is the moment the russian master has feared it is to guard against it that he has placed his watchdog over the princess and how do we know but that when the moment came the watchdog served his master as he saw his duty and killed them both what do you think lyle demanded would not that explain both murders i was only too willing to hear any theory which pointed to anyone else as the criminal than arthur but lyles explanation was too utterly fantastic i told him that he certainly showed imagination but that he could not hang a man for what he imagined he had done no lyle answered but i can frighten him by telling him what i think he has done and now when i again question the russian servant i will make it quite clear to him that i believe he is the murderer i think that will open his mouth a man will at least talk to defend himself come he said we must return at once to scotland yard and see him there is nothing more to do here he arose and i followed him into the hall and in another minute we would have been on our way to scotland yard but just as he opened the streetdoor a postman halted at the gate of the garden and began fumbling with the latch lyle stopped with an exclamation of chagrin how stupid of me he exclaimed he turned quickly and pointed to a narrow slit cut in the brass plate of the front door the house has a private letterbox he said and i had not thought to look in it if we had gone out as we came in by the window i would never have seen it the moment i entered the house i should have thought of securing the letters which came this morning i have been grossly careless he stepped back into the hall and pulled at the lid of the letterbox which hung on the inside of the door but it was tightly locked at the same moment the postman came up the steps holding a letter without a word lyle took it from his hand and began to examine it it was addressed to the princess zichy and on the back of the envelope was the name of a west end dressmaker that is of no use to me lyle said he took out his card and showed it to the postman i am inspector lyle from scotland yard he said the people in this house are under arrest everything it contains is now in my keeping did you deliver any other letters here this morning the man looked frightened but answered promptly that he was now upon his third round he had made one postal delivery at seven that morning and another at eleven how many letters did you leave here lyle asked about six altogether the man answered did you put them through the door into the letterbox the postman said yes i always slip them into the box and ring and go away the servants collect them from the inside have you noticed if any of the letters you leave here bear a russian postagestamp lyle asked the man answered oh yes sir a great many from the same person would you say the writing seems to be the same the man answered they come regularly about once a week one of those i delivered this morning had a russian postmark that will do said lyle eagerly thank you thank you very much he ran back into the hall and pulling out his penknife began to pick at the lock of the letterbox i have been supremely careless he said in great excitement twice before when people i wanted had flown from a house i have been able to follow them by putting a guard over their mailbox these letters which arrive regularly every week from russia in the same handwriting they can come but from one person at least we shall now know the name of the master of this house undoubtedly it is one of his letters that the man placed here this morning we may make a most important discovery as he was talking he was picking at the lock with his knife but he was so impatient to reach the letters that he pressed too heavily on the blade and it broke in his hand i took a step backward and drove my heel into the lock and burst it open the lid flew back and we pressed forward and each ran his hand down into the letterbox for a moment we were both too startled to move the box was empty i do not know how long we stood staring stupidly at each other but it was lyle who was the first to recover he seized me by the arm and pointed excitedly into the empty box do you appreciate what that means he cried it means that someone has been here ahead of us someone has entered this house not three hours before we came since eleven oclock this morning it was the russian servant i exclaimed the russian servant has been under arrest at scotland yard lyle cried he could not have taken the letters lord arthur has been in his cot at the hospital that is his alibi there is someone else someone we do not suspect and that someone is the murderer he came back here either to obtain those letters because he knew they would convict him or to remove something he had left here at the time of the murder something incriminating the weapon perhaps or some personal article a cigarettecase a handkerchief with his name upon it or a pair of gloves whatever it was it must have been damning evidence against him to have made him take so desperate a chance how do we know i whispered that he is not hidden here now no ill swear he is not lyle answered i may have bungled in some things but i have searched this house thoroughly nevertheless he added we must go over it again from the cellar to the roof we have the real clew now and we must forget the others and work only it as he spoke he began again to search the drawingroom turning over even the books on the tables and the music on the piano whoever the man is he said over his shoulder we know that he has a key to the front door and a key to the letterbox that shows us he is either an inmate of the house or that he comes here when he wishes the russian says that he was the only servant in the house certainly we have found no evidence to show that any other servant slept here there could be but one other person who would possess a key to the house and the letterbox and he lives in st petersburg at the time of the murder he was two thousand miles away lyle interrupted himself suddenly with a sharp cry and turned upon me with his eyes flashing but was he he cried was he how do we know that last night he was not in london in this very house when zichy and chetney met he stood staring at me without seeing me muttering and arguing with himself dont speak to me he cried as i ventured to interrupt him i can see it now it is all plain it was not the servant but his master the russian himself and it was he who came back for the letters he came back for them because he knew they would convict him we must find them we must have those letters if we find the one with the russian postmark we shall have found the murderer he spoke like a madman and as he spoke he ran around the room with one hand held out in front of him as you have seen a mindreader at a theatre seeking for something hidden in the stalls he pulled the old letters from the writingdesk and ran them over as swiftly as a gambler deals out cards he dropped on his knees before the fireplace and dragged out the dead coals with his bare fingers and then with a low worried cry like a hound on a scent he ran back to the wastepaper basket and lifting the papers from it shook them out upon the floor instantly he gave a shout of triumph and separating a number of torn pieces from the others held them up before me look he cried do you see here are five letters torn across in two places the russian did not stop to read them for as you see he has left them still sealed i have been wrong he did not return for the letters he could not have known their value he must have returned for some other reason and as he was leaving saw the letterbox and taking out the letters held them together so and tore them twice across and then as the fire had gone out tossed them into this basket look he cried here in the upper corner of this piece is a russian stamp this is his own letter unopened we examined the russian stamp and found it had been cancelled in st petersburg four days ago the back of the envelope bore the postmark of the branchstation in upper sloane street and was dated this morning the envelope was of official blue paper and we had no difficulty in finding the other two parts of it we drew the torn pieces of the letter from them and joined them together side by side there were but two lines of writing and this was the message i leave petersburg on the nighttrain and i shall see you at trevor terrace after dinner monday evening that was last night lyle cried he arrived twelve hours ahead of his letter but it came in time it came in time to hang him the baronet struck the table with his hand the name he demanded how was it signed what was the mans name the young solicitor rose to his feet and leaning forward stretched out his arm there was no name he cried the letter was signed with only two initials but engraved at the top of the sheet was the mans address that address was the american embassy st petersburg bureau of the naval attache and the initials he shouted his voice rising into an exultant and bitter cry were those of the gentleman who sits opposite who told us that he was the first to find the murdered bodies the naval attache to russia lieutenant sears a strained and awful hush followed the solicitors words which seemed to vibrate like a twanging bowstring that had just hurled its bolt sir andrew pale and staring drew away with an exclamation of repulsion his eyes were fastened upon the naval attache with fascinated horror but the american emitted a sigh of great content and sank comfortably into the arms of his chair he clapped his hands softly together capital he murmured i give you my word i never guessed what you were driving at you fooled me ill be hanged if you didnt you certainly fooled me the man with the pearl stud leaned forward with a nervous gesture hush be careful he whispered but at that instant for the third time a servant hastening through the room handed him a piece of paper which he scanned eagerly the message on the paper read the light over the commons is out the house has risen the man with the black pearl gave a mighty shout and tossed the paper from him upon the table hurrah he cried the house is up weve won he caught up his glass and slapped the naval attache violently upon the shoulder he nodded joyously at him at the solicitor and at the queens messenger gentlemen to you he cried my thanks and my congratulations he drank deep from the glass and breathed forth a long sigh of satisfaction and relief but i say protested the queens messenger shaking his finger violently at the solicitor that story wont do you didnt play fair and and you talked so fast i couldnt make out what it was all about ill bet you that evidence wouldnt hold in a court of law you couldnt hang a cat on such evidence your story is condemned tommyrot now my story might have happened my story bore the mark in the joy of creation the storytellers had forgotten their audience until a sudden exclamation from sir andrew caused them to turn guiltily toward him his face was knit with lines of anger doubt and amazement what does this mean he cried is this a jest or are you mad if you know this man is a murderer why is he at large is this a game you have been playing explain yourselves at once what does it mean the american with first a glance at the others rose and bowed courteously i am not a murderer sir andrew believe me he said you need not be alarmed as a matter of fact at this moment i am much more afraid of you than you could possibly be of me i beg you please to be indulgent i assure you we meant no disrespect we have been matching stories that is all pretending that we are people we are not endeavoring to entertain you with better detectivetales than for instance the last one you read the great rand robbery the baronet brushed his hand nervously across his forehead do you mean to tell me he exclaimed that none of this has happened that lord chetney is not dead that his solicitor did not find a letter of yours written from your post in petersburg and that just now when he charged you with murder he was in jest i am really very sorry said the american but you see sir he could not have found a letter written by me in st petersburg because i have never been in petersburg until this week i have never been outside of my own country i am not a naval officer i am a writer of short stories and tonight when this gentleman told me that you were fond of detectivestories i thought it would be amusing to tell you one of my own one i had just mapped out this afternoon but lord chetney is a real person interrupted the baronet and he did go to africa two years ago and he was supposed to have died there and his brother lord arthur has been the heir and yesterday chetney did return i read it in the papers so did i assented the american soothingly and it struck me as being a very good plot for a story i mean his unexpected return from the dead and the probable disappointment of the younger brother so i decided that the younger brother had better murder the older one the princess zichy i invented out of a clear sky the fog i did not have to invent since last night i know all that there is to know about a london fog i was lost in one for three hours the baronet turned grimly upon the queens messenger but this gentleman he protested he is not a writer of short stories he is a member of the foreign office i have often seen him in whitehall and according to him the princess zichy is not an invention he says she is very well known that she tried to rob him the servant of the foreign office looked unhappily at the cabinet minister and puffed nervously on his cigar its true sir andrew that i am a queens messenger he said appealingly and a russian woman once did try to rob a queens messenger in a railway carriage only it did not happen to me but to a pal of mine the only russian princess i ever knew called herself zabrisky you may have seen her she used to do a dive from the roof of the aquarium sir andrew with a snort of indignation fronted the young solicitor and i suppose yours was a cockandbull story too he said of course it must have been since lord chetney is not dead but dont tell me he protested that you are not chudleighs son either im sorry said the youngest member smiling in some embarrassment but my name is not chudleigh i assure you though that i know the family very well and that i am on very good terms with them you should be exclaimed the baronet and judging from the liberties you take with the chetneys you had better be on very good terms with them too the young man leaned back and glanced toward the servants at the far end of the room it has been so long since i have been in the club he said that i doubt if even the waiters remember me perhaps joseph may he added joseph he called and at the word a servant stepped briskly forward the young man pointed to the stuffed head of a great lion which was suspended above the fireplace joseph he said i want you to tell these gentlemen who shot that lion who presented it to the grill joseph unused to acting as master of ceremonies to members of the club shifted nervously from one foot to the other why you you did he stammered of course i did exclaimed the young man i mean what is the name of the man who shot it tell the gentlemen who i am they wouldnt believe me who you are my lord said joseph you are lord edams son the earl of chetney you must admit said lord chetney when the noise had died away that i couldnt remain dead while my little brother was accused of murder i had to do something family pride demanded it now arthur as the younger brother cant afford to be squeamish but personally i should hate to have a brother of mine hanged for murder you certainly showed no scruples against hanging me said the american but in the face of your evidence i admit my guilt and i sentence myself to pay the full penalty of the law as we are made to pay it in my own country the order of this court is he announced that joseph shall bring me a winecard and that i sign it for five bottles of the clubs best champagne oh no protested the man with the pearl stud it is not for you to sign it in my opinion it is sir andrew who should pay the costs it is time you knew he said turning to that gentleman that unconsciously you have been the victim of what i may call a patriotic conspiracy these stories have had a more serious purpose than merely to amuse they have been told with the worthy object of detaining you from the house of commons i must explain to you that all through this evening i have had a servant waiting in trafalgar square with instructions to bring me word as soon as the light over the house of commons had ceased to burn the light is now out and the object for which we plotted is attained the baronet glanced keenly at the man with the black pearl and then quickly at his watch the smile disappeared from his lips and his face was set in stern and forbidding lines and may i know he asked icily what was the object of your plot a most worthy one the other retorted our object was to keep you from advocating the expenditure of many millions of the peoples money upon more battleships in a word we have been working together to prevent you from passing the navy increase bill sir andrews face bloomed with brilliant color his body shook with suppressed emotion my dear sir he cried you should spend more time at the house and less at your club the navy bill was brought up on its third reading at eight oclock this evening i spoke for three hours in its favor my only reason for wishing to return again to the house tonight was to sup on the terrace with my old friend admiral simons for my work at the house was completed five hours ago when the navy increase bill was passed by an overwhelming majority the baronet rose and bowed i have to thank you sir he said for a most interesting evening the american shoved the winecard which joseph had given him toward the gentleman with the black pearl you sign it he said
