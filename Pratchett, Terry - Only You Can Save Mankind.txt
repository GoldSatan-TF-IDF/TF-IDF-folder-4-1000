others would have time to turn and youd end up in the sights of three of them hed died six times already and it was only five oclock his hands flew over the keyboard stars roared past as he accelerated out of the melee itd leave him short of fuel but by the time they caught up the shields would be back and hed be ready and two of them would already have taken damage and here they come missiles away wow lucky hit on the first one die die die red fireball swsssh take shield loss while concentrating fire on the next one swsssh and now the last one was running but he could outrun it hit the accelerator ggrrrrrsshhh and just keep it in his sights while he poured shot after shot into swssh ah the huge bulk of their capital ship was in the corner of the screen level here we come careful careful there were no more ships now so all he had to do was keep out of its range and then sweep in and we wish to talk johnny blinked at the message on the screen we wish to talk the ship roared by eeeywwwnn he reached out for the throttle key and slowed himself down and then turned and got the big red shape in his sights again we wish to talk his finger hovered on the fire button then with out really looking he moved it over to the keyboard and pressed pause then he read the manual only you can save mankind it said on the cover full sound and graphics the ultimate game a screewee heavy cruiser it said on page could be taken out with seventysix laser shots once youd cleared the fighter escort and found a handy spot where the screewees guns couldnt get you it was just a matter of time we wish to talk even with the pause on the message still flashed on the screen there was nothing in the manual about messages johnny riffled through the pages it must be one of the new features the game was packed with he put down the book put his hands on the keys and cautiously tapped out die alein scum no we do not wish to die we wish to talk it wasnt supposed to be like this was it wobbler johnson whod given him the disc and photocopied the manual on his dads copier had said that once youd completed level you got given an extra points and the scroll of valour and moved on to the arcturus sector where there were different ships and more of them johnny wanted the scroll of valour johnny fired the laser one more time swsssh he didnt really know why it was just because you had the joystick and there was the fire button and that was what it was for after all there wasnt a dont fire button we surrender please he reached over and very carefully pressed the save game button the computer whined and clicked and then was silent he didnt play again the whole evening he did his homework it was geography you had to colour in great britain and put a dot on the map of the world where you thought it was the screewee captain thumped her desk with one of her forelegs what the first officer swallowed and tried to keep her tail held at a respectful angle he just vanished again maam she said but did he accept no maam the captain drummed the fingers of three hands on the table she looked slightly like a newt but mainly like an alligator but we didnt fire on him no maam and you sent my message yes ma am and every time weve killed him he comes back he caught up with wobbler in break wobbler was the kind of boy whos always picked last when you had to pick teams although that was all right at the moment as the pe teacher didnt believe in teams because they encouraged competition he wobbled it was glandular he said he wobbled especially when he ran bits of wobbler headed in various directions it was only on average that he was running in any particular direction but he was good at games they just werent the ones that people thought you ought to be good at if ever there was an interschools firstoneto breaktheunbreakablecopyprotectionongalactic thrusters wobbler wouldnt just be in the team hed be picking the team yo wobbler said johnny its not cool to say yo any more said wobbler is it rad to say cool said johnny cools always cool and noone says rad any more either wobbler looked around conspiratorially and then fished a package from his bag this is cool have a go at this what is it said johnny i cracked fighter star terafiomber said wobbler only dont tell anyone right just type fsb its not much good really the space bar drops the bombs and well just press the keys youll see what they do listen you know only you can save mankind still playing that are you you didnt you know do anything to it did you um before you gave me a copy no it wasnt even protected didnt have to do anything except copy the manual why you did play it didnt you a bit wobbler only played games once wobbler could watch a game for a couple of minutes and then pick up the joystick and get top score and then never play it again nothing funny happened like what said wobbler like johnny hesitated he could tell wobbler and then wobbler would laugh or not believe him or say it was just some bug or something some kind of trick or a virus wobbler had discs full of computer viruses he didnt do anything with them he just col lected them like stamps or something he could tell wobbler and then somehow it wouldnt be real oh you know funny like what weird um lifelike i suppose its sposed to be just like the real thing it says i hope youve read the manual properly my dad spent a whole coffee break copying that johnny gave a sickly grin yes right better read it then thanks for star fighter pilot terabomber my dad brought me back alabama smith and the jewels of fate from the states you can have a copy if you give me the disc back right said johnny its ok right said johnny he never had the heart to tell wobbler that he didnt play half the games wobbler passed on you couldnt not if you wanted time to sleep and eat meals but that was all right because wobbler never asked as far as wobbler was concerned computer games werent there for playing they were for breaking into rewrit ing so that you got extra lives or whatever and then copying and giving away to everyone basically there were two sides to the world there was the entire computer games software industry engaged in a tremendous effort to stamp out piracy and there was wobbler currently wobbler was in front did you do my history said wobbler here said johnny what it was like to be a peasant during the english civil war three pages thanks said wobbler that was quick oh in geog last term we had to do one about what its like being a peasant in bolivig i just got rid of the llamas and put in stuff about kings having their heads chopped off you have to bung in that kind of stuff and then you just have to keep complaining about the weather and the crops and you cant go wrong in peasant essays johnny lay on his bed reading only you can save mankind he could just about remember the days when you could still get games where the instructions consisted of something that said press for left and for right and fire for fire but now you had to read a whole little book which was all about the game it was really the manual but they called it the novel partly it was an antiwobbler thing someone in america or somewhere thought it was dead clever to make the game ask you little questions like whats the first word on line on page of the manual and then reset the machine if you didnt answer them right so theyd obviously never heard of wobblers dads offices photocopier so there was this book the screewee had turned up out of nowhere and bombed some planets with humans on them nearly all the starships had been blown up so there was only this one left the experimental one it was all that stood against the screewee hordes and only you that is to say john maxwell aged twelve in between the time you get home from school and get something to eat and do your homework can save mankind nowhere did it say what you were supposed to do if the screewee hordes didnt want to fight he switched on the computer and pressed the load game key there was the ship again right in the middle of his sights he picked up the joystick thoughtfully there was an immediate message on the screen well not exactly a message more a picture half a dozen little eggshaped blobs with tails they didnt move what kind of message is that he thought perhaps there was a special message he ought to send die creep didnt seem to fit properly at the moment he typed whats hpaening immediately a reply appeared on the screen in yellow letters we surrender do not shoot see we show you pictures of our children he typed is this a trick wobbler it took a little while before the reply came am not trick wobbler we give in no more war johnny thought for a while and then typed youre not supoosed to give ni want to go home johnny typed it says in the book you blue up a lot of planets lies johnny stared at the screen what he wanted to type was no i mean this cant happen youre aliens you cant not want to be shot at no other game aliens have ever stopped aliening across the screen they never said we dont want to go and then he thought they never had the chance they couldnt but games are a lot better now they never made things like the old megazoids seem real with stories about them and fullcolour graphics this is probably that virtual reality theyre always talking about on the television he typed it is only a game after all what is a game he typed who are you the screen flickered something a bit like a newt but more like an alligator looked back at him i am the captain said the yellow letters do not shoot johnny typed i shoot at you and you shoto at me that is the game but we die johnny typed sometimes i die i die a lot but you live again johnny stared at the words for a moment then he typed dont you no how could this be when we die we die for ever johnny typed desperately no thats not right because in the first mission theres three ships you have to blow up before the first planet ive played it lots of times and theres always three ships there thfferent ships johnny thought for a while and then typed what happens if i switch of tthe machine we do not understand the question this is daft thought johnny its just a very unusual game its a special mission or something he typed why should i trust you look behind you johnny sat bolt upright in his chair then he let him self swivel around very cautiously of course there was noone there why should there be anyone there it was a game the newt face had disappeared from the screen leav ing the familiar picture of the inside of the starfighter and there was the radar screen covered in yellow dots yellow for the enemy johnny picked up the joystick and turned the star fighter around the entire screewee fleet was there ship after ship was hanging in space behind him little fighters big cruisers massive battleships if they all had him in their sights and if they he didnt want to die hang on hang on you dont die you just play the game again this was nuts it was time to stop it he typed all right what happens now we want to go home he typed all right no problem you give us safe conduct he typed ok yes the screen went blank and that was it no music no congratulations youve got the highest score just the little prompt flashing on and off what did safe conduct mean anyway operate controls to play game you never said to your parents hey i really need a computer because that way i can play megasteroids no you said i really need a computer because of school its educational anyway there had to be a good side to the trying times everyone was going through in this house if you hung around in your room and generally kept your head down stuff like computers sort of happened it made everyone feel better and it was quite useful for school sometimes johnny had written what it felt like to be different sorts of peasants on it and printed them out on the printer although he had to rewrite them in his handwriting because although the school taught keyboard skills and new technology you got into trouble if you used keyboard skills and new technology actually to do anything funnily enough it wasnt much good for maths hed always had trouble with algebra because they wouldnt let you get away with what it feels like to be x but he had an arrangement with bigmac about that because bigmac got the same feeling when he looked at an essay project as johnny did when he was faced with a quadratic equation anyway it didnt matter that much if you kept your head down they were generally so grateful that you were not eg causing policemen to come to the school or actually nailing a teacher to anything that you got left alone but mainly the computer was good for games if you turned the volume control up you didnt have to hear the shouting the screewee mother ship was in uproar there was still a haze of smoke in the air from the last bombard ment and indistinct figures pattered back and forth trying to fix things up well enough to survive the journey the captain sat back in her chair on the huge shadowy bridge she was yellow under the eyes a sure sign of lack of sleep so much to be done half the fighters were damaged and the main ships were in none too good condition and there was hardly any room and certainly no food for all the survivors they were taking on board she looked up there was the gunnery officer this is not a wise move he said it is the only one i have said the captain wearily no we must fight on and then we die said the captain we fight and then we die thats how it goes then we die gloriously theres an important word in that sentence said the captain and its not the word gloriously the gunnery officer went light green with rage hes attacked hundreds of our ships and then he stopped none of the others have said the gunnery officer theyre humans you cant trust a human they shoot everything the captain rested her snout on one hand he doesnt she said he listened he talked none of the others did he may be the one the gunnery officer placed his upper two front hands on the desk and glared at her well he said ive talked to the other officers i dont believe in legends when the full enormity of what you have done is understood you will be relieved of your command she turned tired eyes towards him good she said but right now i am captain i am responsible do you understand have you got the faintest idea of what that means now go he didnt like it but he couldnt disobey i can have him shot she thought itd be a good idea bound to save trouble later on itll be no on the list of things to do she turned back to continue staring at the stars out side on the huge screen that filled one wall the enemy ship still hung there what kind of person is it she thought despicable though they are theres so few of them but they keep coming back whats their secret but you can be sure of one thing they surely only send their bravest and their best the advantage of the trying times was that helping yourself from the fridge was ok there didnt seem to be any proper mealtimes any more in any case or any real cooking johnny made himself spaghetti and baked beans there was no sound from the livingroom although the tv was on then he watched a bit of television in his room hed been given the old one when they got the new one it wasnt very big and you had to get up and walk over to it every time you wanted to change channels or the volume or whatever but these were trying times there was a film on the news showing some missiles streaking over some city it was quite good then he went to bed he was not entirely surprised to wake up at the controls of a starfighter it had been like that with captain zoom you couldnt get it out of your head after an evenings concentrated playing you were climbing ladders and dodging laserzap bolts all night it was a pretty good dream even so he could fell the seat under him and the cabin smelled of hot oil and overheated plastic and unwashed people it looked pretty much like the one he saw on the screen every evening except that there was a thin film of grease and dirt over everything but there was the radar screen and the weapons console and the joystick hey much better than the computer the cabin was full of noises the click and whirr of fans the hum and buzz of instruments and better graphics you get much better graphics in your dreams the screewee fleet hung in the air hung in space in front of him wow although dreams ought to be a bit more exciting you got chased in dreams things happened to you sitting in the cockpit of a starfighter bristling with weapons was fun but things ought to happen he wandered if he should launch a missile or something no hang on theyd surrendered and there was that thing about safe conduct his hands wandered over the switches in front of him they were a bit different from the computer keyboard but this one are you receiving me the face of the captain appeared on the communications screen yes said johnny we are ready ready said johnny what for lead the way said the captain the voice came out of a grille beside the screen it must be being translated by something johnny thought i shouldnt think giant newts speak english where to he said where are we going to earth earth hang on thats where i live people can get into serious trouble showing huge alien fleets where they live the grille hummed and buzzed for a while then the captain said apology that is a direct translation we call the planet that is our home earth when i speak in sree wee your computer finds the word in your language that means the same thing the actual word in scree wee sounds like there was a noise like someone taking their foot out of a wet cowpat i will show our home to you a red circle suddenly developed on the navigation screen johnny knew about that you just moved a green circle over it the computer went binleabinleabinlea and youd set your course theyve shown me where they live the thought sunk in they trust me as he moved his fighter forwards the entire alien fleet pulled in behind him they eclipsed the stars the cabin hummed and buzzed quietly to itself well at least it didnt look too hard a green dot appeared ahead of him he watched it get bigger and recognized the shape of a starflghter just like his but it was a little hard to make it out this was because it was halfhidden by laser bolts it was firing at him as it came and it was travelling so fast it was very nearly catch ing up with its own fire johnny jerked the joystick and his ship rolled out of the way as the the enemy starfighter roared past and barrelled on towards the screewee ships the whole sky full of screewee ships which had surrendered to him but people out there were still playing the game no listen to me theyre not fighting any more the starfighter turned in a wide curve and headed diiectly for the command ship johnny saw it launch a missile someone sitting at a keyboard somewhere had launched a missile listen youve got to stop its not listening to me he thought you dont listen to the enemy the enemys there to be shot at thats why its the enemy thats what the enemys for he swung around to follow the starship which had slowed down it was pouring shot after shot into the command ship which wasnt firing back johnny stared in horror the ship rocked under the hail of fire the gunnery officer crawled across the shaking floor and pulled himself up beside the captains chair fool fool i told you this would happen i demand that we return fire the captain was watching the chosen ones ship it hadnt moved no she said we have to give him a chance we must not fire on human ships a chance how much of a chance do we have i shall give the order to the captain moved very fast when her hand stopped she was holding a gun very close to the gun nery officers head it was really only a ceremonial weapon normally screewee fought only with their claws but its shape said very clearly that things came out of the hole in the front end with the very definite purpose of travelling fast through the air and then kill ing people no she said the gunnery officers face went blue a sure sign of terror but he had enough courage left to say you would not dare fire its a game thought johnny theres not a real person in that ship its someone playing a game its all a game its just things happening on a screen somewhere no i mean yes but at the same time its all happening here his own ship leapt forward it was easy it was so easy just line up circles on the screen binkabinkabinka and then press the fire button until every weapon on the ship was empty hed done it many times before the invader hadnt even seen him it launched some missiles and then blew up in an impressive display of graphics thats all it is johnny told himself just things on a screen its not real theres no arms and feet spinning away through the wreckage its all a game the missiles arrived the whole cockpit went blinding white he was aware just for a moment of cold space around him with things in it a bookcase a chair a bed he was sitting in front of the computer the screen was blank he was holding the joystick so hard that he had to concentrate to let go of it the clock by his bed said because it was broken but it meant hed have to get up in another hour or so he sat with his quilt around him watching the television until the alarm went off there were some more pictures of missiles and bullets streaking over a city they looked pretty much the same as the ones hed seen last night but were probably back by popular demand he felt sick yoless could help johnny decided he normally hung out with wobbler and bigmac on the bit of wall behind thi school library they werent exactly a gang if you take a big bag of crisps and shake them up all the little bits end up in one corner yoless was called yoless because he never said yo hed given up objecting to the name by now at least it was better than nearly crucial which was the last nickname and mc spanner which was the one before that johnny was the official nickname generator yoless said hed never said crucial either he pointed out that johnny was white and never said yerwhat yerwhat yerwhat or arsnal ars nal and anyway you shouldnt makejokes about racial stereotyping johnny didnt go into too much detail he just talked about the dream and not about the messages on the screen yoless listened carefully yoless listened to everything carefully it woried teachers the way he listened carefully to everything they said they always suspected he was trying to catch them out he said what youve got here is a projection of a psychological conflict thats all want a cheese ring whats that its just crunchy cheesyflavoured i mean the other thing you said yoless passed the packet on to bigmac well your mum and dad are splitting up right wellknown fact could be its a bit of a trying time said johnny okay and theres nothing you can do about it shouldnt think so said johnny and this definitely affects you said yoless i suppose so said johnny cautiously i know i have to do a lot of my own cooking right so you project your um suppressed emotions on to a computer game happens all the time said yoless whose mother was a nurse and who wanted to be a doctor if he grew up you cant solve the real problems so you turn them into problems you can solve like if this was thirty years ago youd probably dream about fighting dragons or something its a projected fantasy saving hundreds of intelligent newts doesnt sound very easy to solve said johnny dunno said bigmac happily ratatatatblam no more problem bigmac wore large boots and camouflage trousers all the time you could spot him a mile off by his camouflage trousers the thing is said yoless its not real reals real but stuff on a screen isnt ive cracked stellar smashers said wobbler you can have that if you want everyone says its a lot better nooo said johnny i think ill stick with this one for a while see if i can get to level twentyone if you get to level twentyone and blow up the whole fleet you get a special number on the screen and if you write off to gobi software you get a five pound token said wobbler it was in computer weekly johnny thought about the captain a whole five pounds he said gosh it was games in the afternoon bigmac was the only one who played hed never been keen until theyd introduced hockey you got a club to hit people he said yoless didnt do sport because of intellectual incom patibility wobbler didnt do sport because the sports master had asked him not to johnny didnt do sport because he had a permanent note and noone cared much anyway so he went home early and spent the afternoon reading the manual he didnt touch the computer before tea there was an extended news which meant that cobbers was postponed there were the same pictures of missiles streaking across a city that hed seen the night before except that now there were more jour nalists in sandcoloured shirts with lots of pockets talking excitedly about them he heard his mother downstairs complain about cobbers and by the sound of the raised voices that started trying times again there was some history homework about christopher columbus he looked him up in the encyclopedia and copied out four hundred words which usually worked he drew a picture of columbus as well and coloured it in after a while he realized that he was putting off swit ching the computer on it came to something he thought when you did school work rather than play games it wouldnt hurt to at least have a game of pacman or something trouble was the ghosts would probably stay in the middle of the screen and refuse to come out and be eaten he didnt think he could cope with that hed got enough to worry about as it was on top of it all his father came upstairs to be fatherly this happened about once a fortnight there didnt seem to be any way of stopping it you had to put up with twenty minutes of being asked about how you were getting on at school and had you really thought about what you wanted to be when you grew up the thing to do was not encourage things but as politely as possible his father sat on the edge of the bed and looked around the room as though hed never seen it before after the normal questions about teachers johnny hadnt had since the first year his father stared at nothing much for a while and then said things have been a bit tricky lately i expect youve noticed no its been a bit tricky at work not a good time to start a new business yes everything all right yes nothing you want to talk about no i dont think so his father looked around the room again then he said remember last year when we all went down to falmouth for the week yes you enjoyed that didnt you hed got sunburnt and twisted his ankle on some rocks and he had to get up at every morning even though it was supposed to be a holiday and the only tv in the hotel was in front of some old woman who never let go of the remotecontrol yes we ought to go again his father was staring at him yes said johnny that would be nice howre you getting on with space invaders sorry space invaders on the computer johnny turned to look at the blank screen whatre space invaders he said isnt that what theyre called any more space invaders you used to get them in pubs and things oh before you were born rows of spiky triangular green aliens with six legs kept on coming down the screen and we had to shoot them johnny gave this some thought what happened when youd shot them all then oh you got some more his father stood up i expect its all more complicated now though yes done your homework have you yes what was it history had to write about christopher columbus hmm you could put in that he didnt set out to discover america he was really looking far asia and found america by accident yes it says that in the encyclopedia glad to see youre using it yes its very interesting good right right then well im going to have another look at those accounts right if theres anything you want to talk about you know all right johnny waited until he heard the livingroom door shut again he wondered if he ought to have asked where the instruction manual for the dishwasher was he switched on the computer after a while the screen for only you can save mankind came on he watched the introductory bit moodily and then picked up the joystick there werent any aliens for a little while he thought hed done something wrong he started the game again there were still no aliens all there was was the blackness of space sprinkled with a few twinkling stars he flew around until he was out of fuel no screewee no dots on the radar screen no game theyd gone cereal killers there was more news these days than normal half the time the tv was showing pictures of tanks and maps of deserts with green and red arrows all over them while in the corner of the screen would be a photo of a journalist with a phone to his ear talking in a crackly voice it crackled in the background while johnny phoned up wobbler yes can i speak to wob to stephen please mutter clonk bump scuffle yes its me wobbler yes have you had a look at only you can save mankind lately no hey listen ive found a way to could you have a go with it right now please pause you all right what you sound a bit weird look go and have a go with the game will you it was an hour before wobbler phoned back johnny waited on the stairs can i speak its me theres no aliens right yes probably something built into the game you can do that you know a kind of time bomb thing maybe its programmed to make all the aliens vanish on a certain date what for make things more interesting i expect probably gobi software will be putting adverts in the computer papers about it you all right your voice sounds a bit squeaky no problem you coming down to the mall tomorrow yeah see you then chow johnny stared at the dead phone of course there were things like that on computers thered been some thing in the papers about it a friday the th virus or something something in the program kept an eye on the date and when it was friday the th it was sup posed to do something nasty to computers all over the country there had been stories about evil computer hackers menacing society and wobbler had come to school in homemade dark glasses for a week johnny went back and watched the screen for a while stars occasionally went past wobbler had written an actual computer game like this once it was called journey to alpha centauri it was a screen with some dots on it because he said it happened in real time which noone had ever heard of until computers hed seen on tv that it took three thousand years to get to alpha centauri he had writ ten it so that if anyone kept their computer on for three thousand years theyd be rewarded by a little dot appearing in the middle of the screen and then a message saying welcome to alpha centauri now go home johnny watched the screen for a bit longer once or twice he nudged the joystick to go on a different course it didnt make much difference space looked the same from every direction hello anybody there he whispered he watched some television before he went to bed there were some more missiles and someone going on about some other missiles which were supposed to knock down the first type of missile the fleet travelled in the shape of a giant cone hun dreds of miles long the captain looked back at it there were scores of mother ships hundreds of fighters more and more kept joining them as news of the surrender spread the chosen ones ship flew a little way ahead of the fleet it wasnt answering messages but noone was shooting at them there hadnt been a human ship visible for hours perhaps the captain thought its really working were leaving them behind johnny woke up in the game it was hard to sleep in the starship the seat started out as the most comfortable thing in the whole world but it was amazing how uncomfortable it became after a few hours and the lavatory was a complicated arrangement of tubes and trapdoors and it wasnt he was beginning to notice entirely smellproof thats what the computer games couldnt give you the smell of space it had its own kind of smell like a machines armpit you didnt get dirty because there was no dirt but there was a sort of grimy cleanliness about everything the radar went ping after a while he could see a dot ahead of him it wasnt moving much and it certainly wasnt firing he left the fleet and went to investigate it was a huge ship or at least it had been once quite a lot of it had been melted off it drifted along absolutely dead tumbling very gently it was green and vaguely triangular except for six legs or possibly arms three of them were broken stubs it looked like a cross between a spider and an octopus designed by a computer and made out of hun dreds of cubes bolted together as the giant hulk turned he could see huge gashes in it with melted edges there was a suggestion of floors inside he switched on the radio captain yes can you see this thing here what is it we find them sometimes we think they belonged to an ancient race now extinct we dont know what they called themselves or where they came from the ships are very old the dead ship turned slowly there was another long burn down the other side i think they were called space invaders said johnny the human name for them yes i thought so johnny was glad he couldnt see the captains face he thought noone knows where they came from or even what they called themselves and now noone ever will the radar went ping again there was a human ship heading towards the fleet at high speed this time he didnt hesitate the point was the screewee werent very good at fighting after the first few games it was quite easy to beat them they couldnt seem to get the hang of it they didnt know how to be sneaky or when to dodge it was the same with all of them come to think of it johnny had played lots of games with words like space and battle and cosmic in the titles and all the aliens were the sort you could beat after a few weeks playing this player didnt stand a chance against a real human you got six missiles johnny had two streaking away before the enemy was much larger than a dot then he just kept his finger on the fire button until there was nothing left to fire a spreading cloud of wreckage and that was it it wasnt as if anyone would die after all whoever had been in there would just have to start the game again it felt real but that was just the dream dreams always felt real he turned his attention to the thing by the control chair it had a nozzle which filled a paper cup with something like thin vegetable soup and a slot which pushed out very large plastic bags containing very small things like sandwiches the bags had to be big to get all the list of additives on they contained absolutely everything necessary to keep a star warrior healthy not happy but healthy hed taken one mouthful when something slammed into the ship a red glare filled the cabin alarms started to blare he looked up in time to see a ship curving away for another run he hadnt even glanced at the radar hed been eating his tea he spun the ship the multivitamin sandwich flew around into the wiring somewhere it was coming back to get him he prodded furiously at the control panel hang on what was the worst that could happen to him he could wake up in bed he took his time he dodged he weaved another missile hit the ship as the attacker roared past johnny fired with everything another cloud of wreckage no problem but it must have fired a missile just before he got it there was another red flash the lights went out the ship jumped his head bounced off the seatback and banged on to the control panel he opened his eyes right and you wake up back in your bedroom a light winked at him there was something beeping bound to be the alarm clock thats how dreams end he lifted his head the flashing light was oblong he tried to focus there were shapes there but they werent saying they were spelling out air leak and behind the insistent beeping was a terrible hissing sound no no he thought this doesnt happen he pushed himself up there were lots of red lights he pressed some buttons hurriedly but this had no effect at all except to make some more lights go red he didnt know much about the controls of a star ship other than fast slow left right and fire but there were whole rows of flashing alarms which suggested that a lot of things he didnt know about were going wrong he stared at some red letters which said secondary pumps failure he didnt know what the secondary pumps were either but he wished he really wished they hadnt failed his head ached he reached up and there was real blood on his hand and he knew that he was going to die really die no he thought please im john maxwell please im twelve im not dying in a spaceship the beeping got louder he looked at the sign again it was flashing about time he thought as he passed out and woke up he was at the computer again it wasnt switched on and he was freezing cold he had a headache but a tentative feel said there was no blood it was just a headache he stared into the dark black screen and wondered what it felt like to be a screewee it felt like that except that you didnt wake up it was always air leak or alert alert alert beep ing on and off and then perhaps the freezing cold of space and then nothing he had breakfast you got a free alien in every pack of sugarglazed snappiflakes it was a new thing or an old thing being tried again the one that ended up in his bowl was orange and had three eyes and four arms and it was holding a ray gun in each hand his father hadnt got up his mother was watching the little television in the kitchen where a very large man disguised as an entire desert was pointing to a lot of red and blue arrows on a map he went down to neil armstrong mall he took the plastic alien with him thatd be the way to invade a planet one alien in every box wait until they were in every cupboard in the country send out the signal and bazaam cereal killers maybe on some other planet somewhere you got a free human in every packet of ammoniacoated snappi crystals hey zorks collect the whole set and thered be all these little plastic people holding guns of course you just had to walk down the street to see that of course everyone had a gun he looked out of the bus window that was it really noone would bother to put plastic aliens inside the plastic cereal if they were just you know doing everyday things holding the cosmiczippo raytm hedge clippers getting on the megadeathtm bus hanging out at the star thruster mall the trouble with all the aliens hed seen was that they either wanted to eat you or play music at you until you became better people you never got the sort that just wanted to do something ordinary like borrow the lawn mower wobbler and yoless and bigmac were trying to hang out by the ornamental fountain but really they were just hanging around yoless was wearing the same grey trousers he wore to school you couldnt hang out in grey trousers and wobbler still wore his sunglasses except they werent real sunglasses because he had to wear ordinary glasses anyway they were those clipon sunglasses for tourists also they werent the same size as the glasses underneath and had rubbed red marks on his nose and he wore an anorak wobbler was probably the only person in the universe who still wore an anorak and bigmac in addition to his camou flage trousers and terminator tshirt with blackbury skins on the back in biro had got hold of a belt made entirely of cartridge cases he looked stupid yo duds said johnny weve been here ages said yoless i went one stop past on the bus and had to walk back said johnny thinking about other things whats happening do you mean whats happening or sort of hey my man whats happening said wobbler whats happening said johnny i want to go into j j software said wobbler they might have got cosmic coffee mats in it got a review in bazzammm and they said its got an unbreak able copy protection did they say it was any good said bigmac who cares youll get caught one day said yoless then you get given a job in silicon valley designing antipiracy software said wobbler behind his two thicknesses of glasses his eyes lit up wobbler thought that california was where good people went when they died no you dont you just get in trouble and you get sued said yoless and the police take all your com puters away there was something in the paper they wandered aimlessly towards the computer shop i saw this film once right where there were these computer games and if you were really good the aliens came and got you and you had to fly a spaceship and fight a whole bad alien fleet said bigmac did you beat it i mean in the film the alien fleet got beaten bigmac gave johnny an odd look of course sure there wouldnt be any point other wise would there only you can save mankind said johnny what its the game said wobbler but it always says something like that on the boxes you get games in said johnny except if you get them from wobbler he added to himself when you just get a disc well yeah something like that why not i mean they never say only you are going to be put inside a billion pounds worth of machine with more switches than youve ever seen and be blown to bits by a thousand skilled enemy pilots because you dont really know how to fly it they wandered past mr zippys ice cream extravaganza cant see that catching on said wobbler cant see them ever selling a game called get shot to pieces you still having trouble at home said yoless its all gone quiet said johnny that can be worse than shouting yes its not that bad when your mum and dad split up said wobbler although you get to see more museums than is good for you still found no aliens said yoless um not in the game still dreaming about them said wobbler sort of someone handing out leaflets about big savings on double glazing gave one in desperation to yoless he took it gravely thanked them folded it in two and put it in his pocket yoless always filed this sort of thing you never knew when it might come in handy he said one day he might want to doubleglaze his sur gery and hed be in a good position to compare offers anyone see the war on the box last night said bigmac way to go eh way to go where said yoless were really kicking some butt some but what said wobbler well give them the motherinlaw of all battles eh said bigmac still trying to stir some patriotism nah its not like real fighting said wobbler its just tv fighting wish i was in the army said bigmac wistfully blam he shot the doubleglazing lady who didnt notice bigmac had a habit of firing imaginary guns other people played air guitar he shot air rifles couple more years he said thats all you ought to write to stormin norman said wobbler ask him to keep the war going until you get there hes done pretty well for someone called norman said yoless i mean norman not very macho is it its like bruce or rodney he had to be norman said wobbler otherwise he couldnt be stormin you couldnt have stormin bruce come on j j software was always packed on a saturday morn ing there were always a couple of computers running games and always a cluster of people gathered round them noone knew who j j were since the shop was run by mr patel who had eyes like a hawk he always watched wobbler very carefully on the fairly accurate basis that wobbler distributed more games than he did and didnt even charge anyone for them the four of them split up bigmac wasnt much interested in games and yoless went down to look at the videos wobbler had found someone who knew even more complicated stuff about computers than he did himself johnny mooched along the racks of games i wonder if the screewee do this he thought or people on jupiter or somewhere go down to a shop and buy shoot the human games and have films where theres a human running around the place ter rorizing a spaceship he became aware of a raised voice at the counter you didnt often get girls in j j software once quite a long time ago during a bit of time shed set aside for parenting johnnys mother had tried playing a game it had been quite a simple one you had to shoot asteroids and flying saucers and things it had been embarrassing it had been amazing that the flying saucers had even bothered to shoot back more likely they should have parked and all the aliens could have looked out of the windows and made rude noises women didnt have a clue a girl was complaining to mr patel about a game shed bought everyone knew you couldnt do that even if youd opened the box and it was full of nothing but mouse droppings mr patel took the view that once the transparent wrapper had come off even the pope wouldnt be allowed to return a game not even if he got god to come in as well this was because hed met people like wobbler before the boys watched in fascinated horror she kept tapping the offending box with a finger and who wants to see nothing but stars she said ive seen stars before actually it says on the box that you fight dozens of different kinds of alien ships there isnt even one mr patel muttered something johnny wasnt close enough to hear but the girls voice had a kind of pene trating quality like a corkscrew when she spoke in italics you could hear them oh no you cant say that because how can i tell if it works without trying it that comes under the sale of goods act the awed watchers were astonished to see a slightly hunted look in mr patels eyes up until now hed never met anyone who could pronounce brackets he muttered something else copy it why should i copy it ive bought it it says on the box you meet fascinating alien races well all i got was one ship and some stupid message on the screen and then it ran away i dont call that fascinating alien races message ran away johnny sidled closer mr patel muttered something else and then turned to one of the shelves the shop watched in amazement there was a new game in his hand he was actually going to make an exchange this was like genghis khan deciding not to attack a city but stay at home and watch the football instead then he held up his hand nodded at the girl and stalked over to one of the shops own computers the ones with so many fingermarks on the keys that you couldnt read them any more everyone watched in silence as he loaded up the copy of the game that the girl had brought back the music came on the title scrolled up the screen like the one in star wars it was the usual stuff the mighty screewee fleet have attacked the federation whatever that was and only you and then there was space it was computer space a sort of black with the occasional star rolling past there ought to be six ships on the first mission said someone behind johnny mr patel scowled at him he pressed a key cautiously youve just fired a torpedo at nothing mr patel said wobbler finally mr patel gave up he waved his hands in the air how dyou find the things to shoot he said they find you said someone you should be dead by now see said the girl you get nothing but space i left it on for hours and there was just space maybe youre not persevering you kids dont know the meaning of the word persevere said mr patel wobbler looked over the shopkeepers head to johnny and raised his eyebrows its like persistently trying said johnny helpfully oh right well i persistently tried the other night and i didnt find any either mr patel carefully unwrapped the new copy of the game the shop watched as he slotted the disc into the computer then let us see what the game looks like before mr wobbler plays his little tricks he said there was the title screen there was the story such as it was and the instructions and space soon we shall see said mr patel and then more space this one was only delivered yesterday lots more space that was the thing about space mr patel picked up the box and looked at it carefully but theyd all seen him take off the polythene theyve gone thought johnny even on the new games theyve all gone people were laughing but wobbler and yoless were staring at him noone really dies i reckon said bigmac i reckon yes said yoless i reckon ronald mcdonald is like jesus christ bigmac did that kind of thing sometimes he came out with the kind of big slow statement that suggested some sort of deep thinking had been going on for some time it was like mountains johnny knew they were made by continents banging together but noone ever saw it happening yes said yoless in a kind voice and why do you think this well look at all the advertising said bigmac wav ing a fry in the general direction of the rest of the burger bar theres this happy land you go to where theres lakes of banana milkshake and and trees covered in fries and and then theres the hamburglar hes the devil mr zippys advertised by a giant talking ice cream said wobbler i dont like that said yoless i wouldnt trust an ice cream thats trying to get you to eat ice creams occasionally they talked like this for hours when there was something they didnt want to talk about but now they seemed to have run out of things to say they all looked silently at johnny whod hardly touched his burger look i dont know whats happening he said gobi softwarere going to be really pissed off when they find out what youve done said wobbler grinning i didnt do anything said johnny its not my fault could be a virus said yoless nah said wobbler ive got loads of viruses they just muck up the computer they dont muck up your head they could do said yoless with flashing lights and stuff kind of like hypnosis you said before i was making it all up you said i was projecting fantasies that was before old patel went through half a dozen boxes im glad i saw that you know she actually got another copy and her money back actually johnny smiled uncomfortably wobbler drummed his fingers on the table or partly on the table and partly in a pool of barbecue sauce no i still reckon its just something gobi software did to all the games cor i like the virus idea though he said humans catching viruses off of computers nice one its not like that said johnny they used to do this thing with films where theyd put in just one frame of something like an ice cream or something and itd enter peoples brains without them knowing it and theyd all want ice cream said yoless subliminal advertising it was called thatd be quite easy to do on a computer johnny thought about the captain showing him pictures of her children that didnt sound like hyp nosis he didnt know what it did sound like but it didnt sound like hypnosis perhaps theyre real aliens and theyre in control of your computer said yoless ooo eee ooo said bigmac waving his hands in the air and speaking in a hollow voice johnny maxwell did not know it but he had just strayed into the toilet zone deedledeedle deedledeedle deedledeedle after all youre supposed to be leading them to earth yoless went on but thats just their own name for their own world said johnny youve only got their word for it and theyre newts too you could be bringing them here they all looked up in case they could see through the ceiling t f insurance services and the roof to a huge alien fleet in the sky above youre just getting carried away said wobbler you cant invade a planet with a lot of aliens out of a computer game they live on a screen theyre not real whatre you going to do about it anyway said yoless just keep doing it i suppose said johnny who was that girl in patels dont know said wobbler saw her in there once before playing cosmic trek girls arent much good at computer games because they havent got such a good grasp of spatial something or other like we have he went on airily you know they cant think in three dimensions or something they havent got the instincts for it the captains a female said johnny its probably different for giant alligators said wobbler bigmac sucked a sachet of tomato ketchup do you think it might still be going when im old enough to join the army he said thoughtfully no said yoless stormin brucell get it all sorted out hell kick some butt they chorused some but what like tired monks they went to the cinema in the afternoon alabama smith and the emperors crown was showing on screen wobbler said it was racist but yoless said he quite enjoyed it they discussed whether it could still be racist if yoless enjoyed it johnny bought popcorn all round that was another thing about trying times pocket money was erratic but you tended to get more of it he had spaghetti hoops when he got home and watched tv for a while the pyramidshaped man disguised as a desert seemed to be on a lot now he told jokes sometimes the journalists laughed a bit johnny quite liked stormin norman he looked the sort of man who could talk to the captain then there was a programme about saving whales they thought it was a good idea then you could win lots of money if you could put up with the game shows host and not for example choke him with a cuddly toy and run away there was the news the walking desert again and pictures of bombs being dropped down enemy chimneys with pinpoint precision and sport and then all right lets see he switched on yes space and more space no screewee anywhere hang on he thought theyre all in the big fleet arent they following me they followed me out of out of out of game space you must be able to get there from here if you keep going long enough in the right direction too which way did i go can i catch myself up can anyone else catch me up he watched the screen for a while it was even more boring than the quiz show sooner or later hed have to go to sleep hed thought hard about this while alabama smith was being chased by bad guys through a native marketplace johnny had a theory about these marketplaces every spy film and every adventure had a chase through the native marketplace with lots of humorous rickshaws crashing into stalls and tables being knocked over and chickens squawking and the theory was it was the same marketplace every time it always looked the same there was probably a stallholder somewhere who was getting very fed up with it anyway hed take his camera he went to bed early with the camera strap wound around his wrist cameras didnt dream the ship smelled human there were no alarms no hissing noises im back thought johnny and there was the screewee fleet spread out across the sky behind him and the camera with its strap wrapped around his arm he untangled it quickly and took a photo of the fleet it whined out of the machine after a few seconds he held it under his armpit for a moment and it gradually faded up yep the fleet if he could get it back hed have proof there was a red light flashing beside the screen on the console someone wanted to talk to him he flicked the switch we saw your ship explode came the voice of the cap tain the screen crackled for a moment and then showed her face it looked concerned and then it returned again you are alive yes said johnny and then added i think so excuse me i must ask what happens to you what when you go johnny thought what do i tell her i stay awake in school i stay in my room a lot i hang out with wobbler and the others we hang around in the mall or in the park or in one anothers houses although not my house at the moment because of trying times and say things like im totally splanked even though were not sure what they mean sometimes we go to the cinema we live in blackbury most excellent city of cool i must have the most boring life in the entire universe i expect theres blobs living under rocks on neptune that have a more interesting life than me itd be too hard to explain he said i there was a ping from the radar i have to go he said feeling a bit relieved facing someone else in mortal combat was better than trying to tell a giant newt about trying times there was a ship coming in fast it didnt seem to notice him its screen must be full of screewee ships it was in the middle of his targeting grid around him the starship hummed he could feel the power under his thumb press the button and a million volts or amps or something of whitehot laser power would crackle out and his thumb trembled it didnt seem to want to move but noone dies he told himself theres just some one somewhere sitting in their room in front of a computer thats what it looks like to them its all just something on a screen noone really dies i can fire right into his retrotubes with pinpoint precision noone really dies the ship roared past him and onwards towards the fleet on the radar screen he saw two white dots which meant that it had fired a couple of missiles they streaked towards one of the smaller screewee ships with the attacker close behind them firing as he went the screewee burst into flame johnny knew you shouldnt be able to hear sound in space but he did hear it a long low rumble washing across the stars the human ship turned in a long curve and came back for another run the captains face appeared on the screen we have surrendered this must not be allowed im sorry i you must stop this now johnny let his own ship accelerate while he tried to adjust the microphone game player game player stop now stop now or or what he thought or ill shout stop again he raised his thumb over the fire button took aim at the intruder please i mean it it was plunging on towards another ship taking no notice of him all right then blinding blue light flashed across his vision he shut his eyes and still the light was there purple in the darkness when he opened them again the ship ahead of him was just an expanding cloud of glittering dust he turned in his seat the captains ship was right behind him he could see its guns glowing they never did this in the game they had much more firepower than you but they used it stupidly it had to be like that you could only win against hundreds of alien ships if they had the same grasp of gunnery techniques as the common cucumber this time every gun had fired at exactly the same time the captains face appeared on the screen i am sorry what what happened it will not happen again i promise you what happened there was silence the captain appeared to be look ing at something beyond the camera range there was an unauthorized firing she said those responsible will be dealt with i was going after that ship said johnny uncertainly yes it is to be hoped that another time you can do so before one of my ships is destroyed im sorry i i didnt want to fire its not easy shooting another ship how strange that a human should say that clearly the space invaders shot themselves what do you mean were they doing you any harm look youve got the wrong idea said johnny were not really like that excuse me things appear differently from where i sit it would have been better if she had shouted but she didnt johnny could have dealt with it if she had been angry instead she just sounded tired and sad it was the same tone of voice in which shed spoken about the space invaders wreckage but he found he was quite angry too she couldnt be talking about him he picked spiders out of the bath even if theyd got soapy and didnt have much of a chance yet shed looked at him as if he was ghengiz the hun or some one after blowing a ship into bits i didnt ask for this you know i was just playing a game ive got problems of my own i ought to be getting a good nights sleep thats very important at my age why me why not well i dont see why i should have to be told how nasty we are you shoot at us as well selfdefence no often you shoot first with humans we have often found it essential to get our selfdefence in as soon as possible well i dont like it find someone else he switched off the screen and turned his ship away from the fleet he half expected the captain to send some fighters after him but she did not she didnt do anything soon the fleet was merely a large collection of yellow dots on the radar screen hah well they could find their own way home it wasnt as if they needed him any more the game was ruined who was going to spend hours looking at stars theyd have to manage without him serve them right he was doing things for them and they were only newts occasionally a star went past you didnt get stars going past in real space but they had to put them in computer games so that people didnt think theyd got something like wobblers journey to alpha centauri interesting point where was he going the radar screen went bing there were ships heading towards him the dots were green that meant friendly but the missiles streaking ahead of them didnt look friendly at all hang on hang on what colour was he on their radar that was important friendly ships were green and enemy ships were yellow he was a starship a human starship but on thc other hand hed been on the same side as the screewee so he might show up he grabbed the microphone and got as far as um i before the rest of the sentence was spread out very thin very small against the stars he woke up it was his throat felt cold he wondered why people made such a fuss about dreams dream boat dream river dream a little dream but when you got right down to it dreams were often horrible and they felt real dreams always started out well and then they went wrong no matter what you did you couldnt trust dreams and hed left the alarm set even though this was sunday and there was nothing to do on a sunday no one else would be up for hours itd be a couple of hours even before bigmacs brother delivered the paper or at least delivered the wrong paper and he was all stiff from sitting at the computer which wasnt switched on maybe tonight hed put some stuff on the floor to wake him up he went back to bed and switched the blanket on he stared at the ceiling for a while there was still a model space shuttle up there but one of the two bits of cotton had come away from the drawing pin so it hung down in a permanent nosedive there was something in the bed he fumbled under the covers and pulled out his camera which meant some more fumbling found a rectangle of shiny paper he looked at it well yes huh whatd he expect he got up again and turned the computer on then lay in bed so that he could watch the screen still more fake stars drifted past maybe other people were doing this too all over the country all over the world maybe maybe not every computer showed the same piece of game space so that some people were closer to the fleet than others or maybe some people were just persistent like wobbler and wouldnt be beaten you saw people like that in j j software some times theyd have a go at whatever new game old patel had put on the machine get blown to bits or eaten or whatever which was what happened to you on your first time and then you couldnt get rid of them with a crowbar you learned a bit more and then you died thats how games worked people got worked up they had to beat some game in the same way that wobbler would spend weeks trying to beat a program some people took it personally when they were blown to bits so the ships hed seen then were the ones who wouldnt give up but the captain hadnt been at all grateful to him it wasnt fair making him feel like some kind of monster as if hed like shooting anyone in cold blood theyd just totally destroyed another ship ok it was attacking them after they had surrendered but after all it was a only a game except of course it wasnt a game to the screewee and theyd surrendered that didnt make them his responsibility did it not the whole time it had been ok for a little while but he was getting tired of it he padded downstairs in the darkened house and pulled the encyclopedia off its shelf under the video it had been bought last year from a man at the door whod persuaded johnnys father that it was a good encyclopedia because it had a lot of colour pictures in it it did have a lot of colour pictures in it you could grow up knowing what everything looked like if you didnt mind not knowing much about what it was after ten minutes with the index he got as far as prisoners of war and eventually to the geneva conven tion it wasnt something you could illustrate with big coloured pictures so there wasnt much about it but what there was he read with interest it was amazing hed always thought that prisoners were well prisoners you hadnt actually killed them so they ought to think themselves lucky but it turned out that you had to give them the same food as your own soldiers and look after them and generally keep them safe even if theyd just bombed a whole city you had to help them out of their crashed plane give them medicine and treat them properly johnny stared at the page it was weird the people whod written the encyclopedia it said inside the cover that they were the universal wonder knowledge data printing inc of power cable nebraska had shoved in all these pictures of parrots and stuff because they were the natural wonders of the world when what was really strange was that human beings had come up with an idea like this it was like finding a tiny bit of the middle ages in the middle of all the missiles and things johnny knew about the middle ages because of doing his essay on what it felt like to be a peasant in the middle ages when a knight fell off his horse in battle the other side werent allowed to open him up with a can opener and torture him but had to look after him and send him back home after a while although they were allowed to charge for the service on the whole the screewee were letting him off lightly according to the geneva convention he ought to be feeding all of them as well he put the book back and turned the television on that was odd someone was complaining that the enemy were putting prisoners of war in buildings that might be bombed so that they could be bombed by their own side that was a barbaric thing said the man everyone else in the studio agreed so did johnny in a way but he wondered bow he would explain something like this to the captain everything made sense a bit at a time it was just when you tried to think of it all at once that it came out wrong there was too much war on television now he felt it was time to start showing something else he went out into the kitchen and made himself some toast and then tried to scrape the burnt bits off quietly so as not to wake people up he took the toast and the encyclopedia upstairs and got back into bed to pass the time he read some more about switzer land which was where geneva was every man in the country had to do army training and keep a gun at home it said but switzerland never fought anyone perhaps that made sense somewhere and what the country used to be known for was designing intricate and ingenious mechanical masterpieces that made a little wooden bird come out and go cuckoo after a while he dozed off and didnt dream at all on the screen the fake stars drifted by after an hour or so a yellow dot appeared in the very centre after another hour it grew slightly bigger enough to be seen as a cluster of smaller yellow dots then johnnys mother who had come to see where he was tucked him up and switched it off i cannot believe this why cant we fight if not you who else there was a constant smell of smoke and burnt plastic in the ship now the captain noticed the air condi tioners couldnt get rid of it any more some of the smoke and burned plastic was the air conditioners she could feel the eyes of her officers on her she didnt know how many of them she could count on she got the feeling that she wasnt very popular she looked up into the eyes of the gunnery officer you disobeyed my orders she repeated the gunnery officer looked around the control room with an air of injured innocence but we were being attacked he said they fired the first shots i said that we would not fire said the captain try ing to ignore the background murmur of agreement i gave my word to the chosen one he was about to fire but he did not said the gunnery officer he merely watched he was about to fire about is too late the tanker kreewhea is destroyed along with half our campaign provisions i should add captain said the gunnery officer nevertheless an order was directly disobeyed the captain pointed out of the window the fleet was passing several more ships of the ancient space invader race they fought she said endlessly and look at them now and they were only the first remember what happened to the vortiroids and the meggazzoids and the glaxoticon do you want to be like them hah they were primitive very low resolution but there were many of them and they still died if we are going to die i for one would rather die fighting said the gunnery officer this time the mur mur was a lot louder you would still be dead said the captain she thought therell be a mutiny if i shoot him or imprison him i cant fine him because none of us have been paid i cant confine him to his quarters because she hated to think this we might need him at the end you are severely reprimanded she said the gunnery officer smirked it will go on your record the captain added since we will not escape alive the gunnery officer began that is my responsibility said the captain you are dismissed the gunnery officer glared at her when we get home oh said the captain now you think we will get home by early evening johnnys temperature was a hundred and two and he was suffering from what his mother called sunday night flu he was lying in the lovely warm glow that comes from knowing that whatever happens therell be no school tomorrow the backs of his eyeballs felt itchy the insides of his elbows felt hot it was what came of spending all his time in front of a computer hed been told instead of in the healthy fresh air he couldnt quite see this even in his itchy eyeball state surely the fresh air would have been worse but in his experience being ill always came of whatever youd been doing parents would probably manage to say it came of taking vitamins and wrapping up nice and warm hed probably get an appointment down at the health centre next friday since they always liked you to be good and ill by the time you came so that the doctors could be sure of what youd got he could hear the tv downstairs he spent twenty minutes wondering whether to get out of bed to switch on his old one but when he moved there were purple blurs in front of his eyes and an ongoing hum in his ears he must have managed it though because next time he looked it was on and the colours were much better than usual there were the newscasters the black one and the one who looked like his glasses fitted under his skin instead of over the top and there was the studio just like normal except that it had the words screewee war in the corner where there were usually words like budget shock or euro summit he couldnt hear what people were saying but the screen switched to a map of space it was black that was the point of space it was just infinity huge and black with one dot in it that was everything else there was one stubby red arrow in the middle of the blackness several dozen blue ones were heading towards it from the edge of the map in one corner of the map was a photo of a man talking into a phone hang on thought johnny im almost certain there wasnt a bbc reporter with the screewees theyd have said probably there isnt even a cnn one he still wasnt getting any sound but he didnt really need any it was obvious that humans were closing in on the fleet the scene changed now it showed a tent some where and there was the huge man standing in front of another copy of the map this time the sound came up he was saying that johnny hes no fighter hes no politician he goes home when the going gets tough he runs out on his obligations but apart from that hey hes a real nice kid thats not true johnny shouted it isnt said a voice behind him he didnt look around immediately by the sound of it the voice had come from his chair and that was much more impossible than the screewee being on television noone could sit in that chair it was full of old tshirts and books and supper plates and junk there was a deep sock layer and possibly the lost strawberry yoghurt noone could sit down there without special equipment the captain was though she seemed quite at home hed only ever seen her face on the screen now he could see that she was about two metres long but quite thin more like a fat snake with legs than an alligator or a newt she had two thick heavy pairs about half way down and two pairs of thinner ones at the top on a set of very complicated shoulders most of her was covered in a brown overall the bits that stuck out her head all eight hands or feet and most of her tail were yellowbronze and covered in very small scales if you parked out in the road mrs cannock opposite will be really mad johnny heard himself say she goes mad about my dad leaving his car parked out in the road and its not even a thousand metres long so this is an hallucination isnt it of course it is said the captain im not sure that real space and game space are connected except in your head i saw this film once where spaceships could go any where in the universe through wormholes in space said johnny that means ive got a wormhole in my head the captain shrugged which was a very interesting sight in a being with four arms watch this she said this is very impressive i expect this will be shown a lot she pointed at the screen it showed stars and a dot in the distance it got big er very quickly i think i know that said johnny its one of your ships the sort you get on level seven isnt it the type i think will not matter for long said the captain quietly the ship was heading away from the camera its rocket exhausts got larger and larger the camera seemed to be mounted on a missile said johnny weakly the screen went blank johnny thought of the dead space invader armada turning over and over in the frosty emptiness between the game stars i dont want to know about it said johnny i dont want you to tell me how many screewee there were on board i dont want you to tell me what happ no said the captain i expect you dont its not my fault i cant help what people are like of course not the captain had a nasty way of talking in a reason able voice we are under attack she said humans are attack ing us even though we have surrendered yes but you only surrendered to me said johnny im just me its not like surrendering to a government or something im not important on the contrary said the screewee youre the saviour of civilization youre all that stands between your world and certain oblivion you are the last hope but thats not real thats just what it says at the start of the game and you did not believe it look it always says something like that only you can save mankind said the captain yes but its not really true if not you then who else look said johnny i have saved mankind in the game anyway there arent any screewee attack ing any more people have to play it for hours to find any the captain smiled the shrug had been impressive but the captains mouth was half a metre long you humans are strange she said you are warlike but you make rules rules of war sometimes i think we dont always obey all those rules said johnny another fourarmed shrug does that matter even to have made such rules you think all of life is a game the captain pulled a small piece of silvery paper out of a pocket of her overall your attackers have left us too short of food so by your rules she said i must ask for the following fifteen tonnes of pressed wheat extractions treated with sucrose ten thousand litres of cold bovine lactation twentyfive tonnes of the baked wheat extraction containing grilled bovine flesh and trace ingredients along with chopped and fried tubers and fried and cornextractcoated rings of vegetables of the allium family one tonne of crushed mustard seeds mixed with water and permitted addi tives three tonnes of exploded corn kernels coated with lactic derivation ten thousand litres of coloured water containing sucrose and trace elements fifteen tonnes of prepared and fermented wheat extract in vegetable juice one thousand tonnes of soured lactic acid flavoured with fruit extract daily thank you what the food of your fighting men explained the captain doesnt sound like food you are right said the captain it is disgustingly lacking in fresh vegetables and dangerously high in carbohydrates and saturated fats however it appears that this is what you eat me i dont even know what that stuff is what are pressed wheat extractions treated with sucrose it said snappiflakes on the packet said the captain soured lactic acid you had a banana yoghurt johnnys lips moved as he tried to work this out the grilled bovine flesh and all that stuff a hamburger and fries with fried onion rings johnny tried to sit up are you saying that ive got to go down to the shops and get takeaway jumboburgers for an entire alien spacefleet not exactly i should think not my chief engineer wants a bucket of chicken lumps what do screewee usually eat normally we eat a kind of waterweed it contains a perfect balance of vitamins minerals and trace elements to ensure a healthy growth of scale and crest then why but as you would put it it tastes like poo oh the captain stood up it was a beautiful movement the screewee body had no angles in it apart from the elbows and knees she seemed to be able to bend wher ever she wanted and now i must return she said i hope your attack of minor germs will shortly be over i could only wish that my attack of human beings was as easily cured why arent you fighting back said johnny i know you can no you are wrong we have surrendered yes but we will not fire on human ships sooner or later it has to stop we will run instead someone gave us safe conduct the worst bit was that she didnt raise her voice or accuse him of anything she just made statements big horrible statements all right said johnny in a dull voice but i know its not real ive got the flu you get mild hallucina tions when you get the flu everyone knows that i remember i was ill once and all the floppy bunnies on the wallpaper started dancing about this is like that you cant really know about this stuff youre just in my head what difference does that make said the captain she stepped out through the wall and then poked her head back into the room remember she said only you can save mankind and i said i already screewee is only the human name for us said the captain have you ever wondered what the screewee word for screewee is he must have slept but he didnt dream he woke up in the middle of the afternoon a huge ball of incandescent nuclear fire heated to millions of degrees was shining brightly in the sky the house was empty his mother had left him a breakfast tray which was to say that shed put together a new snappiflakes packet a spoon a bowl and a note saying milk in fridge shed also put her office phone number on the bottom of the note he knew what it was anyway but sometimes she used the phone number like other people would use an elastoplast he opened the packet and fished around inside the alien was in a hygienic little paper bag it was yellow and in fact did look a bit like the captain if you almost shut your eyes he wandered aimlessly through the rooms there die of the day it was all women talking to one another on sofas he sneaked a look out into the road just in case there were halfmilelong rocketexhaust burns and then he went back upstairs and sat and stared at the silent computer ok so you switch on and theres the game somehow it felt worse thinking about playing it by just sitting in front of it now on the other hand it was daytime so most people would be at school or at least keeping a low profile somewhere johnny wasnt quite certain about game time and real time but maybe the attacks stopped when people had to go to school but no there were prob ably people playing it in america or australia or somewhere besides when you died in your sleep you woke up so what happens now if you die while youre awake but the screewee were getting slaughtered out there or in there or in here the captain was stupid not to fire back his hand switched on the computer without his mind really being aware of it the game logo appeared the music started up the same old message scrolled up the screen he knew it by heart savior of civilization certain oblivion only you can save mankind if not you who else he blinked the message had scrolled off the top of the screen he couldnt have imagined that extra last line could he and then the same old stars he didnt touch the keyboard or the joystick he wasnt certain what direction he should be going in on the whole straight on seemed best for hours he glanced at the clock it was just gone four oclock people would be home from school now theyd be watching cobbers and shell be apples and moonee ponds bigmac would be watching with his mouth open at his brothers wobbler would be watch ing while trying to rob some other poor computer games writer of his just rewards yoless probably wouldnt be paying much attention exactly itd just be on while he did his homework yoless always did his homework when he got home from school and didnt pay attention to anything else until it had been finished to his satisfaction but everyone watched cobbers except johnny today he felt vaguely proud of that the television was off he had other things to do somewhere in the last ten minutes hed made a deci sion he wasnt sure exactly what it was but hed made it so he had to see it through whatever it was he went to the bathroom and had a go with the ther mometer it was an electronic one that his mother had bought from a catalogue and it also told the time everything in the catalogue had a digital clock built in even the golf umbrella that doubled as a handy picnic table even the thing for getting fluff out of socks away with not being able to know what the time is all the time blues said johnny vaguely and stuck the thermometer in his mouth for the required twenty seconds his temperature was no wonder he felt cold he went back to bed with the thermometer still in his mouth and looked at the screen again still just stars the rest of them would probably be down at the mall now unless yoless was trying for an a with his homework hanging out waiting for another day to end he squinted at the thermometer it read o still nothing but stars on the screen chicken lumps in space he woke up the familiar smell of the starship tickled his nose he cast his eyes over the control panel he was getting a bit more familiar with it now right so he was back in real life again when he got back to when he got back to hed have to have a word with the medics about this odd recurring dream that he was a boy in no he thought im me not a pilot in a computer game if i start thinking like that then ill really die got to take charge then he noticed the other ships on the screen he was still along way from the fleet of course but there were three other ships spread out neatly behind him in convoy they were bigger and fatter than his and insofar as it was possible to do this in space they seemed to wallow rather than fly he hit the communications button a plump face appeared on the screen wobbler johnny what are you doing in my head the onscreen wobbler looked around well according to this little panel riveted on the control thingy im flying a class three light head im not sure said johnny by the main communica tion screen was another switch saying conference facility he had a feeling he knew what it did sure enough when he pressed it wobblers face drifted to the top lefthand corner of the screen yolesss face appeared in the opposite corner with johnnys own head above it the other corner stayed blank johnny tapped a button bigmac he said yoless bigmacs face appeared in the blank he appeared to be wiping his mouth checking the cargo said johnny sarcastically its full of hamburgers said bigmac in a voice like a good monk whos just arrived in heaven and found that all the sins of the flesh are allowed boxes and boxes of hamburgers i mean millions with fries and one bucket of chicken lumps it says here it says on this clipboard said yoless that im fly ing a lot of prepared corn and wheat products shall i go and see what they are ok said johnny then that means youre driving the milk tanker wobbler oh yes thats right bigmac gets burgers wobbler gets boring milk moaned wobbler yolesss face reappeared back there its breakfast cereals mainly he said in giantjumbomegacivilizationsized boxes then bigmacd better bring his ship between you and wobbler said johnny briskly we cant risk a collision snap crackle fababababboom said bigmac and wobbler how can we said yoless were not dreaming ok ok um so will we remember this when he wakes up i dont think so i think were only here as projec tions from his own subconscious mind said yoless hes just dreaming us you mean were not real said bigmac im not sure if im real said johnny it feels real said wobbler smells real too tastes real said bigmac looks real said yoless but hes only imagining were here its not really us just the us thats inside his head dont ask me thought johnny you were always best at this stuff and ive just worked out right said yoless that if we send in the boxtops from every single packet back there we can get six thousand sets of saucepans ok and twenty thousand books of football stickers and fiftyseven thousand chances to win a stylish fivedoor ford sierra the four ships lumbered on towards the distant fleet johnnys starship could easily outdistance the tankers so he flew in wide circles around them watching the radar screen there was an occasional zip and sizzle from wob blers tanker he was trying to take its computer apart just in case there were any design innovations johnny might remember when he woke up ships appeared on the screen there was the big dot of the fleet and around the edges of the screen a thought occurred to him yoless yeah have those things got any guns on er what do they look like theres probably a red button on the joystick not got one on mine what about you wobbler bigmac nope which ones the joystick said bigmac its the thing youre steering with yeah wipe the mustard off and have a look said yoless nothing on it said bigmac unarmed thought johnny and slow one hit with a missile and wobbler is sitting inside the biggest cheese in the universe what happens to people in my dream why does it always go wrong ill just go on ahead he said and pressed the fast button there were three players attacking the screewee fleet it soon became two johnny had one in his sights all the way in curving away through the smokering of the explosion and heading for the next attacker so fast that he was only just behind his own missile it was going after the captains ship and the player wasnt paying attention to his radar another explo sion already behind johnny as he looked for the third player johnny realized he wasnt thinking about it his eyes and hands were doing all the work he was just watch ing from inside the third player had spotted the tankers it saw him turned and actually managed to get some shots away oh no johnnys mind whirred like a machine judg ing speed and distance he felt the ship buck under him but he held it steady until the crosshairs merged then he pressed his thumb down until a beeping sound told him he hadnt got anything more to fire after a while the red mist cleared he found thoughts slinking back into his mind again they moved slowly uncertain of where they were like people drifting back into a bombed city picking through rubble trying to find the old familiar shapes there was a metallic taste in his mouth his elbow ached he must have banged it on something during the turn he thought no wonder we make rules the cap tain thinks its strange but we dont we know what wed be like if we didnt have rules a light flashed by the communication screen some one wanted to talk to him he flicked a switch the face of the captain appeared halt johnny what an efficient technique yes but i had to of course and i see you have brought some friends you said you needed food even more so now that last attack was severe arent you firing at all no we have surrendered i remind you besides we must not stop some of us at least will reach the border border said johnny i thought you were going to a planet we must cross the border first beyond the border we are safe even you cannot follow us if we fight all of us die if we run some of us live i dont think humans can think like that said johnny he glanced out of the cockpit the tankers were getting nearer you are mammals fast hotblooded we are amphi bians coldblooded slow logical some of us will get across we breed fast to us it makes sense to me it makes sense the captains image moved to a corner of the screen wobbler bigmac and yoless appeared in the other three quarters that was brilliant shooting said bigmac when im in the army theres a frog on my screen said wobbler its shes the captain said johnny a woman in charge said yoless no wonder the aliens always lose said wobbler you should see the side of my mums car um she can hear you i think dont use sexist language said johnny the captain smiled i invite your comrades to unload their welcome cargoes she said they found out how to do it eventually the whole of the middle of the tankers came away as one unit small screewee ships not much more than a seat and a pilots bubble and a motor nudged them into the holds of the biggest ships without them the tankers were just a cockpit and engine and a big empty network of girders johnny watched the tank from yolesss ship drift gently through the hatch of the captains ship you get them out of the packet he said and you sort of find something plastic falls into your bowl well its just a joke its not on purpose thank you if you save all the box tops you could probably win a ford sierra said yoless there was a slight tremble in his voice as he tried to sound like someone who talked to aliens every day you could get your photo in competitors journal he added that would be very useful some of the corridors in this ship are very long dont be daft said bigmac hed shed never get the spares really in that case we shall have to go for the six thou sand set of saucepans said the captain how do we get back said wobbler how did you get here wobbler frowned how did we get here he said one minute i was was and then here i was here we were come to that where did all the milk and burgers come from said bigmac its all right said yoless i told you were not really here anyway were just anxiety projections i read about it in a book thats a relief then said wobbler thats worth knowing when youre a billion miles out in space anyway so how do we get back i dont know said johnny i generally do it by dying is there some other way said yoless after a long thoughtful pause you dont have to die to get out said johnny i think you can probably just fly back im not definitely sure any harm can come to you youre not playing in your heads i mean well wobbler began but i should go soon if i was you said johnny before some more players arrive wed stay and help said wobbler but theres no guns on these things you see he sounded worried yeah silly of me not to have dreamed of any said johnny kindly yoless might be right and were just stuff in your head said wobbler but even people in dreams dont want to die i expect right you going to be in school tomorrow might be right well then chow see you you hang in there right johnny said yoless anxiously ill try to yeah give them aliens hell my man said bigmac as the tankers turned johnny could hear them still talking as the three ships accelerated away that was a foepar bigmac johnnys on the aliens side what you mean theyre on our side no theyre on their side and so is he whose side are we on then were on his side oh right er yoless what so whos on our side eh he is i suppose so is there anyone on the other side the ships became dots on the radar and then vanished off the edge of the screen where to johnny had no idea i may have wished them here or dreamed them or something but i mustnt do it again maybe theyre not really here but i dont want to see my friends die i dont want to see anybody die at least im on my side he scanned the sky after a while the captain said you are not leaving not yet until you die you mean johnny shrugged its the only way out he said fight until you die thats how all games go you just hope you can get a bit further each time there were still no more attackers on the screen the fleet looked as if it wasnt moving but it had built up quite a speed every second was taking it further from game space every second meant that fewer and fewer players would have the patience or determination to go on looking for it he helped himself to some of the horrible nourishing soup from its spigot johnny yes i believe i upset you some time ago by suggesting that humans are bloodthirsty and dangerous well yes a bit in that case i would like to say i am grateful i dont understand that you are on our side yes but im not bloodthirsty then i think perhaps a little while ago someone else must have been flying your ship no its hard to explain it to you said johnny first of all hed have to be able to explain it to himself shall i embark upon a less troubling topic of conversation you dont have to said johnny i mean youre in charge you must have things to do oh spaceships fly themselves said the captain they keep going until they hit things there is little to do tend the wounded and so on i seldom have a chance to talk to humans so what is sexist what it was a word you used oh that it just means you should treat people as people and you know not just assume girls cant do stuff we got a talk about it at school theres lots of stuff most girls cant do but youve got to pretend they can so that more of them will thats all of it really presumably theres uh stuff boys cant do oh yeah but thats just girls stuff said johnny anyway some girls go and become engineers and things so they can do proper stuff if they want transcend the limitations of their sex outdo the other sex even yes it is much the same with us some individuals show an awe inspiring desire to succeed to make a career in a field not traditionally considered to be appropriate to their gender you you mean said johnny i was referring to the gunnery officer but hes a man i mean a male yes traditionally screewee warriors are female they are more inclined to fight our ancestors used to have to fight to protect their breeding pond the males do not do battle but in his case a speck appeared on the radar johnny put down his cup and watched it carefully normally players headed straight for the fleet this one didnt it hovered right on the edge of the screen and stayed there keeping pace with the screewee ships after a while another dot appeared from the same direction and kept on coming this one at least looked like just another player there was a nasty equation at the back of johnnys mind it concerned missiles there were the six missiles per level in only you can save mankind once youd fired them that was it so the longer he stayed alive the less he had to fight with but all the attacking players would have six missiles each hed only got four now when they were gone itd just be guns one missile in the right place would blow him up losing was kind of builtin in the circumstances the attacker came on but johnny kept finding his gaze creeping to the dot at the edge of the screen somehow it had a watchful look like a shark trailing a leaky airbed he switched on the communicator attacking ship attacking ship stop now they cant speak johnny thought theyre only a player theyre not in the game they cant speak and they cant listen he found hed automatically targeted a missile on the approaching dot but that couldnt be the only way sooner or later you had to talk even if it was only because youd run out of things to throw the attacker fired a missile it streaked past johnny and away heading on into empty space not real johnny thought you have to think theyre not real otherwise you cant do it attacking ship this is your last chance look i mean it he pressed the button the ship juddered slightly as a missile took off the attacker was moving fast so was the missile they met and became an expanding red cloud it drifted around johnnys ship like a smoke ring someone somewhere was blinking at their screen and probably swearing he hoped the dot was still on the edge of the screen it was irritating him like an itch in a place he couldnt scratch because that wasnt how you were supposed to play you spotted some aliens and you shot at them that was what the game was supposed to be about lurking in the distance and just watching made him uneasy it looked like the kind of thing people would do if they were well taking it seriously the captain sat in front of her desk watching the big screen she was chewing anything was better than waterweed even she looked at the packet even sugarfrosted corn crackles in cold bovine lactation sweet and crunchy but with odd hard bits in she inserted a claw into her mouth and poked around among her teeth until she found the offending object she pulled it out and looked at it it was green and had four arms most of them were holding some sort of weapon she wondered again what these things were the chief medical officer had suggested that they were in fact some sort of vermin which invaded food sources there was a theory among the crew that they were things to do with religion offerings to food gods perhaps she put it carefully on one side of her desk in the right light she thought it looked a bit like the gun nery officer then she opened the little cage beside the bowl and let her birds out there had been things very like alligators among the screewees distant ancestors and some habits had been handed down the captain opened her mouth fully which made her lower and upper jaws move apart in a way that would make a humans eyes water the birds hopped in and began to clean her teeth one of them found a small piece of plastic raygun the watching ship was moving still keeping at a great distance travelling around the fleet in a wide cir cle it had watched one more attacker come in johnny had got rid of this one with a missile and some shots although a flashing red light on the panel was sug gesting that something somewhere wasnt working any more probably those secondary pumps again he found he was turning the ship all the time to keep the distant dot in front of him johnny it was the captain yes are you watching it yes it is moving between us and the border it is in our direct line of flight now you cant sort of steer around it there are more than three hundred ships in the fleet that may be difflcult it seems to be waiting for something ill ill risk going to have a look he let his ship overtake the fleet and run ahead of it towards the distant dot it made no attempt to get out of his way it was a starship just like his own in fact in a way it was his starship after all there was only one starship in the entire game the one you flew to save mankind everyone was flying the same one in a way it hung against the stars as lifeless as a space invader johnny moved a bit closer until he could see the cockpit and even the shape of a head inside it had a helmet on everyone did it was on the cover of the box you wore a helmet in a starship he didnt know why maybe the designers thought you were likely to fall off when you went round corners he tried the communicator again hello can you hear me there was nothing but the background hiss of the universe im pretty sure you can ive got a feeling about it the tiny blob of the helmet turned towards him you could no more see through the smoked glass of the helmet than you could through a pair of sunglasses from the outside but he knew he was being stared at what are you waiting for said johnny look i know you can hear me i dont want to have to the other ship roared into life it accelerated towards the oncoming fleet on two lances of blue light johnny swore under his breath and kicked his own engines into life there was no hope of over taking the attacker it had a head start and a starfighters top speed was a starfighters top speed it was just out of gun range he raced along behind ahead he could see some of the big capital ships of the fleet manoeuvring clumsily out of the way they spread out slowly trying to avoid colliding with one another seen from the front it was like watching the petals of a flower opening the attacker roared for the middle of the fleet then it rolled gently and fired six missiles one after another a moment later two of the small screewee fighters exploded and one of the larger ships spun around as it was hit the attacker was already heading for another fighter johnny had to admit it it was beautiful flying hed never realized before how badly most players flew they flew like people who lived on the ground from right to left and up and down woodenly like someone moving something on a screen in fact but the attacker rolled and twisted like a swallow in flight and every turn brought another screewee ship under its guns even if they had been firing back it wouldnt have been hit except by accident it pirouetted the captains face appeared on the screen you must stop this im trying im trying dont you think im trying the attacker turned johnny hadnt thought it was possible for a starship to skid but this one did it paused just for a moment as its jets slowed it down and then accelerated back the way it had come right down his sights look stop he shouted he had a missile ready why even bother to shout players couldnt hear they only saw the game on the screen who are you it was a very clear voice and very human the cap tain sounded as though shed learned the language out of a book but this voice was one that someone had really used since they were about one year old you can hear me get out of the way stupid the two pilots stared at one another across a distance that was getting smaller very very fast ive heard that before johnny thought that voice you can hear all the punctuation they didnt crash exactly there was a grinding noise as each starship scraped the length of the other ripping off fins ripping open tanks and then spun drunkenly away the control panel in front of johnny became a mass of red lights there were cracks racing across the cockpit idiot screamed the radio its all right said johnny urgently you just wake up his ship exploded the dark tower it was by the thermometer time was different in game space no matter how often you died you never got used to it it wasnt as if you got better with pract shed heard him inside the game he sat up the screewee were inside the game because it was their world wobbler and the rest hadnt really been in it he was pretty sure hed just dreamed them in because he needed someone to pilot the food tankers but hed heard her in patels that ringing sharp voice which made it very clear that its owner thought everyone in the whole world was dimwitted and had to be talked to like a baby or a foreigner on the screen empty space rolled onwards he had to find her apart from anything else noone who flew like that should be allowed anywhere near the screewee wobblerd probably know who she was he found the room moving around him when he stood up he probably really was ill he thought well not surprising what with trying times and stupid school and parents trying to be friends and now having to save an entire alien race instead of he made it to the hail and took the phone off its base and brought it back upstairs hed just extended the aerial when it rang um hello blackburytwothreeninenineeight zerowhosthatspeakingplease is that you this is me oh hello wobbler you ill or something flu look wobbler you seen the papers today no mum and dad take them to work with them wobbler thing in the papers about gobi software hang on says no encounters of the twentyfirst kind thats the headline johnny hesitated what does it say he said very cautiously what does inundated mean slike overwhelmed said johnny says that gobi software and computer games shops have been inundated with complaints about only you can save mankind because they made that offer of five pounds if you shoot all the aliens and it says people arent finding any aliens and gobi software are in trouble because of the trades descriptions act and they keep on using the word hacker said wobbler in the sneering tones of one who knows what a hacker really is and knows that most journalists dont and theres a quote from al rampa president of gobi he says theyre recalling all the games and if you send back the original discs theyll send you a token for their new game dodge city that got four stars in faazzzzaaap yes but you havent got the original discs said johnny you hardly ever have any original discs no but i know the guy whose brother bought it said wobbler happily so it was just a problem with the game right you werent mental after all i never said i was mental said johnny no but well you know said wobbler he sounded embarrassed wobbler yes you know that girl who was in patels oh her what about her dyou know who she is shes someones sister i think whose goes to some kind of special school for the termi nally clever shes called kylie or krystal or one of those madeup names what do you want to know for oh nothing just because she complained about the game in patels i suppose whose sister is she some guy called oh plonker yeah friend of bigmacs you sure youre all right yes fine cheers cheers you going to be in tomorrow spect so cheers cheers bigmac wasnt on the phone where bigmac lived people hardly even got letters even muggers were frightened to go there people talked about the joshua nclement block in the same way that they probably spanish inquisitions reception area the tower loomed all alone black against the sky like someones last tooth there wasnt much else around the place there was a row of boarded up shops but you could see where the fire had been and there was a pub made out of neon lights and red brick it was called the jolly farmer the tower had won an award in just before bits had started falling off it was always windy even on the calmest day gales whistled icily through the concrete corridors the place was some kind of wind reservation if the joshua nclement block had existed a few thousand years ago people would have come from all over the country to sacrifice to the wind god johnnys father called it rottweiler heights johnny could hear them barking as he walked up the stairs the lifts had stopped working in everyone in the tower seemed afraid and mostly they seemed afraid of one another bigmac lived on the fourteenth floor with his brother and his brothers girlfriend and a pit bull terrier called clint bigmacs brother was reliably believed to be in the job of moving video recorders around in an informal way johnny knocked cautiously hoping to be loud enough to be heard by the people but quiet enough to be missed by clint no such luck a wall of sound erupted from behind the door after a while there was the clink of a chain and the door opened a few centimetres a suspicious eye appeared at about the height an eye should be while a metre below there was a certain amount of confused activity as clint tried to get both eyes and his teeth into the same narrow crack yeah is bigmac in dunno johnny knew about this there were only four rooms in the flat bigmacs family was huge and lived all over the town and practically no member of it knew where any other member was until they were quite sure who was asking its me johnny maxwell at school clint was trying to push a fifteencentimetrewide head through a fivecentimetrewide hole oh yeah johnny felt that he was being carefully surveyed hes down the pub yeah oh right said johnny in what he hoped was a nor mal voice i mean yeah bigmac was thirteen but the landlord of the jolly farmer was reputed to serve anyone who didnt actually turn up on a tricycle his way home led back past the pub anyway he agonized a bit about going in it was all right for bigmac bigmac had been born looking seventeen but bigmac turned out to be outside anyway leaning against the bonnet of a car he had a couple of friends with him they watched johnny intently as he approached and the one who had been nonchalantly fiddling with the cars door handle stood up and glared johnny tried to swagger a bit yeah johnny said bigmac in a vague kind of way hes different here johnny thought older and harder the other youths relaxed a little bigmac knew johnny that made him acceptable for now dont often see you up here said bigmac you drinking now or what johnny got the feeling that asking for a coke would definitely be bad for his street cred he decided to ignore the question im looking for plonker he said wobbler said you know him what dyou want him for said bigmac on the wall in school or down at the mall bigmac wouldnt have even asked but there were different rules here like in school bigmac tried to hide how good he was at numbers and up here he had to hide his ability to hold a normal conversation johnny saw a way through actually im looking for his sister he said one of bigmacs friends sniggered bigmac took johnnys arm and led him a little way off whatd you come up here for he said you couldve asked me tomorrow its important bigmac you coming or what bigmac glanced over his shoulder cant he said got to sort out something else one of the kids said something to the other one and they both laughed then they got into the car after a little while it started up bumped up on to the pave ment and off again and then accelerated into the night they heard the tyres screech as it turned the corner on the wrong side of the road bigmac relaxed suddenly he was a lot less tough and a bit shorter and more like the amiable notquite thicko johnny had always known didnt you want to go with them said johnny youre a right nerd arent you said bigmac in a friendly enough voice wobbler says you have to say dweeb now not nerd said johnny i usually say dickhead come on lets go said bigmac cos therell probably be some unhappy people around here pretty soon stheir own fault for leaving a car here what dweeb you dont know nothing about real life you its just games said johnny half to himself all dif ferent sorts bigmac somewhere away in the distance a car horn wailed and was suddenly cut off bigmac stopped walking the breeze blew his tshirt against him so that ter minator was superimposed on a chest that looked like a toast rack what he said look have you ever wondered whats real and what isnt bloody stupid thing to wonder said bigmac why reals real everything else isnt what about well dreams nah theyre not real theyve got to be something otherwise you couldnt have them right said johnny desperately yeah but thats not the same as really real are people on television real course whyre we treating them as a game then you mean on the news yes thats different you cant have people going around doing what they like but we anyway space games arent real said bigmac he kept looking down the dark street johnny relaxed a little are you real dunno feel real its all crap anyway what is everything so who cares come on im going back home they strolled past what had been in an environmental green space and was now a square of dogpoisoned earth where the shopping trolleys went to die plonkers a bit of a maniac said bigmac bit of a wild man bit of a loony lives in a big posh house though where oh in tyne avenue or crescent or somewhere said bigmac a blue light lit his face for a moment as a police car flashed past the end of the road its siren deedahing into the distance bigmac froze whats his real name said johnny eh yeah carry i think bigmac was staring at the end of the road the blue light was still visible it had stopped about half a mile away they could see it reflected off an advertising hoarding just carry said johnny bigmacs face was wet in the light of the street lamps might be dunn said bigmac he shifted uneasily from one foot to the other another siren echoed around the night an ambu lance went past on the main road ghostly under its flashing light look bigmac bugger off bigmac turned and ran his doc martens crashing on the pavement johnny watched him go he thought of all the things he should have said he wasnt stupid everyone knew what happened to cars around the dark tower what could he say now and his body thought you dont say anything you do something it started running all by itself after his friend taking his brain with it despite a bedroom full of weighttraining equipment that would have been of considerable interest if the police had ever bothered much about a recent theft down at the sports centre bigmac wasnt in much of a condition he had been born out of condition johnny caught him up on the bend i told you to buggeroff nothing todo withyou said bigmac as they headed towards the distant lights they crashed it didnt they nozzers a good driver yeah good at going fast there was a crowd standing around at the traffic lights further down the road as they ran another ambulance overtook them and rocked to a halt the crowd parted johnny caught a glimpse of well not a car but maybe what a car would look like after trying to be in the same place as a liquidcement truck it had ridden up the pavement and lay on its side its load was fast becoming the biggest brick in the world in the distance there was the scream of a fire engine getting nearer he grabbed bigmacs arm pulling him around i dont think you want to go any closer he said bigmac shook himself free just as the police managed to lever the crumpled door open bigmac stared then he turned tottered over to a low garden wall by the roadside and was sick when johnny reached him his whole body was shak ing with cold and terror bugger you i could have been in that you bigmac was sick again all down the front of arnold schwarzenegger johnny took his coat off and put it over the other boys shivering shoulders they kept goin on at me i told them i said yeah yeah thats right said johnny looking around look you just sit here theres a phone you just sit there all right you just dont go away what oh yes right come on then click hello this yoless its johnny yes your mum in the hospital tonight no shes on days this week why can you get her to bring her car down to witheridge road whats up you sound as if youve been look shut up get her to do it right please its bigmac whats up with him yoless this is important this is really important you know how she goes on when i less i oh all right hey is that a siren were in a phone box youd better get her to bring a blanket or something and hurry up its dead smelly in here that was a siren wasnt it yes he put the phone down bigmac wasnt being sick any more he hadnt got anything to be sick with he was just leaning against the door shaking shell be along right away said johnny as cheer fully as he could manage shes a ward sister she knows all about this stuff outside one of the ambulances drove away firemen were all over the wreck some of them were getting equipment off the engine bigmac stared at the scene theyre probably fine lied johnny its amazing how people can johnny what noones fine who looked like that said bigmac in a flat voice there was blood all over well my brotherll kill me when he finds out he said if i have the cops round again hell throw me out of the window hell kill me if he finds out he wont then you didnt do anything we were just hanging out and you felt ill thats all hell kill me what for noone knows anything except me and i dont know anything i promise it was gone eight when johnny got home he left his coat in the shed until he could sneak it in and sponge it off and said hed been round at yolesss which was true and was a pretty good way of avoiding questions because his parents approved of yoless on racial grounds to object to him being round at yolesss would be like objecting to yoless yoless was dead handy anyway it wasnt as if anyone had cooked any dinner mrs yoless had made him a hot chocolate when he was there but he hadnt accepted a meal because that suggested you didnt have them all that often at home and you didnt do that shed put bigmac to bed bigmac with his skinhead haircut he microwaved himself something called a pouron genuine creole lasagne which said it served four por tions it did if you were dwarfs the phone went as he was carrying it upstairs it was wobbler yoless just rang me right why didnt you get them to put him in an ambulance who with there was a moment of silence from wobbler as he worked this out then he said yuk right anyway peopled ask questions bigmacs been in enough trouble as it is what with his brother and one thing and another right wow got to go now wobbler got to eat my dinner before it congeals he put the phone down on the tray and looked at it there was something else he was going to do what was it something anyway the lasagne looked real it looked as though someone had already eaten it once the captain looked up most of her officers were standing in front of her except for the gunnery officer who was looking smug they all wore rather embarrassed expressions yes said the captain to her surprise it wasnt the gunnery officer who spoke it was the navigation officer a small and inoffensive screewee who suffered from prematurely shedding scales um she said yes said the captain again um we that is all of us said the navigation officer looking as if she wished she was somewhere else we feel that uh the present course is uh an unwise one with respect she added in what way said the captain she could see the gunnery officer grinning behind the little screewee noone could grin like a screewee their mouths were built for it we uh that is all of us we are still being attacked and that last attack was a terrible one the chosen one stopped it at the cost of his own life said the captain um he will return said the navigation officer um twenty of our people will not the captain wasnt really looking at her she was staring at the gunnery officer whose grin was now wide enough to hold a set of billiard balls and probably the cue too hes been talking to them she told herself every ones on edge noone can think straight and hes talking to them i should have had him shot they wouldnt have liked it but i could probably have shouted them down so what is it you are suggesting she said um we that is all of us said the little screewee with an imploring glance at the gunnery officer we feel we should turn and fight said the captain make a last stand um yes thats right and thats the feeling of all of you the officers nodded one after another um sorry maam said the navigation officer the others stood and fought said the captain the space invaders and the others weve all seen the wrecks all they knew was how to attack they stood and fought and fought and died we are dying too um said the navigation officer i know i am sorry said the captain but many are living and every minute takes us further from danger we are so near the border if we stop you know what will happen game space will move the border will retreat the humans will find us and then they will die said the gunnery officer and we shall win we shall give the humans the mother of all battles ah yes said the captain mother and grand mother of battles battles that breed more battles and this is your leader speaking sneered the gun nery officer the leader of the fleet it is pathetic cowardly when we are home the captain began home this is our home we have no other all this talk of the border and a planet of our own have any of us seen it no its a legend wishful thinking a dream we lie to ourselves we make up stories the chosen one the hero with a thousand extra lives its all dreams we live and breed and die on our ships that is our destiny there is no choice peace talks peace shouts johnny awoke in the starship normally he was some way from the fleet but this time it was around him there were screewee ships on every side they were flying the wrong way immediately a face appeared on the screen except for a few differences on the crest and a slight orange tint to the scales it might have been the captain calling the human ship who are you i am the new captain these are my instructions what happened to the old captain she is under arrest these are my instructions arrest what for what did she do she did nothing listen to me you have sixty seconds to get beyond range of our guns for honour after that you will be fired upon with extreme force hang on the count has started but end of communication die human the screen went blank johnny stared at it it hadnt been a friendly face the voice had sounded as though it had learned human out of a book just like the real captain but in this case it had been a nasty book it also sounded as though it belonged to someone who would count to sixty like this one two three four five seven eighteen thirtyfive fortynine fifty eight fiftynine sixty firing ready or not his ship jerked forward ramming him back in his seat that was one good thing about game space you could do the kind of turns and manouevres that in real space would leave the human body looking like thin pink lino across the cabin wall the fleet slid past dwindling to a collection of dots behind him a couple of laser beams crackled past but some way away it looked as though they were trying to frighten him off rather than kill him the screewee had turned around they were head ing back deeper into game space why theyd show up on peoples screens soon there were always some players whod go looking any day now some kidd switch on his machine and thered be walltowall screewee heading straight for him they werent safe even now yes there were always some people whod go looking and there was a green dot ahead of him he recog nized the way it moved like a dog creeping around the edge of a sheep field he headed towards it now he could remember you thought better in game space too it was as if he was more him in game space krystal or kylie or one of those madeup names wobbler had said and bigmac said the other name was dunn he twirled the knob of the communicator panel krystal he tried kylie kathryn whatever there was just the hiss of the stars and then its kirsty actually dont fire said johnny quickly who are you dont fire first promise i hate dying it makes it hard to think the other ship had stopped being a dot now if she was going to fire he was as good as dead if dead was good all right she said slowly no firing peace talk now tell me who you are im a player like you said johnny no youre not none of the other players talk to me anyway youre on their side ive been watching you not exactly on their side said johnny well youre not on my side said kirsty noone is did they try to surrender to you too i heard you say in patels shop that theyd sent you a message there was another silence filled with the whispers of the universe and then a cautious voice youre not the fat one who looks as though he could do with a bra are you no listen johnny tapped his controls hurriedly the black one who looks like an accountant no look oh no not the skinny one with the big boots and the pointy head no im the one who kind of hangs around and no one notices much said johnny desperately who i didnt see anyone right that was me they surrendered to you yes number three missile went ping as it locked on to her ship now for number four but youre a nerd ping i think its dweeb now anyway im more than a dweeb ping why im a dweeb with five missiles targeted on you you said you werent going to fire i havent yet you said this was a peace talk you did anyway it is its just that im kind of shouting if he concentrated he thought he could hear music in the background when she spoke youve really got missiles targeted on me yes im amazed you thought of it so am i look i dont want to shoot anyone but i need help the fleets turned round they fired at me thats their job dweeb they fire at us we fire at them why did they stop its no fun if they dont fire back they surrendered they cant surrender its a game well they did sometimes you change the game i dont know kirsty listen i hate that name ive got to call you something said johnny what do you call yourself if you tell anyone else ill kill you i thought you were planning to do that anyway i dont mean just kill you i mean really kill you all right whats your game name sigourney youre laughing im not im not it was a sneeze honest no its a good name very appropriate its just dreaming anyway im dreaming this youre dreaming this so what doesnt make things unimportant there was some more silence with the scratchy sug gestion of music in the background and then ahha while weve been talking mr clever ive targeted missiles on you johnny shrugged even though there was no way she could see that doesnt matter i thought you would anyway so we kill each other then well have to go through all this again its stupid dont you want to find out what happens next more scratchy music i can hear scratchy music said johnny its my walkman clever i wish id thought of that i tried dreaming my camera but the pictures werent any good whatre you listening to c inlay details please keep this copy for your records there was another scratchy pause then as if shed been thinking deeply she said look we cant be in the same dream that cant happen we could find out whered you live this time the pause went on for a long time the screewee fleet appeared on the radar wed better move said johnny theyve started firing somethings happened to the captain shes the one that wanted peace in the first place look i know you live in tyne avenue or crescent or somewhere how come we live so close dunno bad luck i suppose look theyre going to be in range soon no problem then we shoot them well be killed anyway so what dyings easy i know its living thats the problem said johnny meaning it you dont sound like someone who takes the easy way c inlay details played on in the distance so what do you have in mind johnny hesitated he hadnt thought that far the new captain didnt seem to want to talk dunno i just dont want any screewee to get killed why not because when they die they die for real i just dont ok several fighters had left the fleet and were heading purposefully towards them im going to try and talk one more time he decided someone must be listening nerdy idea im not much good at the other kind johnny turned his ship and hit the gofaster button a few shots whiffled harmlessly past him and did a lot of damage to empty space and then he was heading at maximum speed towards the fleet music came over the intercom idiot dodge and dive no wonder you get shot a lot he wiggled the joystick something clipped one of the starships wings and exploded behind him and youve got the fighters after you huh you cant even save yourself johnny didnt take his eyes off the fleet which was bouncing around the sky as he flung his ship about in an effort to avoid being shot at you might try to be some help he shouted there was a boom behind him i am youre shooting them youre very hard to please actually the captain tried the door of her cabin again it was still locked and there was almost certainly a guard in the corridor outside screewee tended to obey orders even if they didnt like them the gunnery officer was very unusual that she thought bitterly is what comes of pro moting a male theyre unreliable thinkers she looked around the cabin she didnt want to be in it she wanted to be outside it but she was in it she needed a new idea humans seemed much better at ideas they always seemed to be on the verge of being totally insane but it seemed to work for them the inside of their heads would be an interesting place to visit but she wouldnt want to live there how do you think like a human go into madness first probably and then out the other side listen listen if you keep going this way youll all be killed youre going back into game space people like me will find you youll all be killed thats how it goes and then he died it was he was lying on his bed with his clothes on but he still felt cold bits and pieces of his his previous life trickled through his mind sigourney well yoless would say that explained anything and now it looked as if hed be spending every night watching the screewee get killed it was bad enough fighting off people in ones and twos but they were just the ones who were weird or lonely or bored enough to go looking wobbler said thousands of copies of the game had been sold even if most people took them back to the shops thered always be someone playing once the screewee turned up again the news would get around and then one day long after noone played the game any more thered be these broken ships turning over and over in the blankscreen darkness of game space and he couldnt stop it kir sigourney was right thats what they were there for it was tuesday too it was maths for most of the morning and then english hed better write a poem at lunchtime you could generally get away with a poem he got his jacket out of the shed and sponged it off as best he could and then propped it up by the heater then he investigated the fridge his father had been doing the shopping again you could always tell there were generally expensive things in jars and odd foreign vegetables this time there was yoghurt vindaloo and more celery noone in the house liked celery much it always ended up going brown and his father never bought bread and potatoes he seemed to think that stuff like that just grew in kitchens like mushrooms although he always bought mushrooms if they were the special expensive dried kind that looked like bits of mouldy bark and were picked by wizened old frenchmen there was a carton of milk which thumped when he shook it johnny found a cup in the ghastly cavern of the dishwasher and rinsed it under the tap at least there wasnt much that could go wrong with black coffee he quite enjoyed the time by himself in the morn ings the day was too early to have started going really wrong the war was still on television it was getting on his nerves it was worrying him youd really think every one would have had enough by now bigmac was in school hed stayed the night at yo lesss mrs yoless had washed out his clothes even the tshirt with blackbury skins on the back it was a lot cleaner than it had ever been he could feel wobbler and yoless looking at him with interest so were one or two other people later on when they were in the middle of the rush which meant that every pupil in the school had to walk all the way across the campus to be somewhere else yoless said bigmac said you pulled him out of the wreck did you what he wasnt even johnny paused it was amazing hed never thought so fast before he thought of bigmacs room with its weapons of the world posters and plastic model guns and weight training stuff he couldnt lift bigmac had been thrown out of the school roleplaying games club for getting too excited bigmac who spent all his time trying hard to be a big thicko bigmac who could work out maths problems just by looking at them bigmac who played the game of being well big tough bigmac johnny looked around bigmac was watching him it was amazing given that bigmacs ancestors were a sort of monkey how much his expression looked like the one hed first seen on the face of the captain whose ancestors were a kind of alligator it said help me cant really remember he said only my mum rang the hospital and they said there were only two boys and they were it was dark said johnny yes but if youd really its just best if everyone shuts up about it all right said johnny nodding meaningfully at bigmac she said you did everything right anyway said yoless and she said you arent being properly looked after yoless she said you ought to come round our house to eat sometimes thanks said johnny im a bit busy these days doing what said yoless johnny fumbled in his pocket what does this look like to you he said yoless took it gravely its a photograph he said just looks like a tv screen with dots on yes sighed johnny it does doesnt it he took it back and shoved it deep into his pocket yoless what if someone was you know going a bit weird in the head mental he means said wobbler behind him just a bit overstrained said johnny i mean would they know themselves well everyone thinks theyre a bit mad said yoless its part of being normal oh i dont think im mad said johnny you dont well ahaha said wobbler i mean the whole world seems kind of weird right now you watch the telly dont you how can you be the good guys if youre dropping clever bombs right down peoples chimneys and blowing people up just because theyre being bossed around by a loony shouldnt let emselves be bossed around then said bigmac johnny looked at him bigmac deflated a bit its their own fault they dont have to thats what my brother says anyway he mumbled is it said johnny bigmac shrugged oh well yes said wobbler how its hard enough to get rid of prime ministers and at least they dont have people taken out and shot not any more anyway my brothers stupid said bigmac so quietly under his breath that johnny wondered if anyone else even heard it there was a man on the box saying that the bomb aimers were so good because they all grew up playing computer games said wobbler see said johnny thats what i mean games look real real things look like games and and it all kind of runs together in my head ah said yoless knowingly thats not mental thats shamanism i read a book about it whats shamanism shamans used to be these kind of people who lived partly in a dream world and partly in the real world said wobbler like medicine men and druids and guys like that they used to be very important they used to guide people guide said johnny where to not sure anyway my mother says they were creations of satan yes but your mother says that about practically everything said wobbler this is true said yoless gravely its her hobby she said roleplaying games were creations of satan said wobbler true dead clever of him said wobbler i mean sitting down there in hell working out all the combat tables and everything i bet he used to really swear every time the dice caught fire shamanism thought johnny yes i could be a shaman a guide thats better than being mental at any rate it was maths again as far as johnny was concerned the future would be a better place if it didnt contain y xz he had problems enough without people giving him pages of this he was trying to put off the idea of ringing someone up and then there was social education normally you could ignore social education which tended to be about anything anyone had on their minds at the time or failing that aids really the day ended with maths it was just there to keep you off the streets for another threequarters of an hour he could try ringing up you just needed the phone book and a bit of thought johnny stared at the ceiling the teacher was going on about the war that was all there was to talk about these days he listened with half an ear noone liked the bombing one of the girls was nearly in tears about it supposing she was really there or supposing she said shed never heard of him bigmac was arguing that was unusual and then someone said do you think its easy do you think the pilots really just sit there like like a game do you think they laugh really laugh not just laugh because theyre still alive but laugh because its its fun when theyre being shot at for a living every day when any minute they might get blown up too do you think they dont wonder what its all about do you think they like it but we always turn it into something thats not exactly real we turn it into games and its not games we really have to find out whats real they were all looking at him anyway thats what i think said johnny on earth noone can hear you say um click yes um hello um is sig is kirsty there whos that im a friend um i dont think she knows my narne youre a friend and she doesnt know your name please oh hang on johnny stared at his bedroom wall eventually a suspicious voice said yes whos that youre sigourney you like c inlay details you fly really well you youre him johnny breathed a sigh of relief real going through the phone book had been harder than flying the starship nearly harder than dying i wasnt sure you really existed he said i wasnt sure you existed she said ive got to talk to you i mean face to face how do i know youre not some sort of maniac do i sound like some sort of maniac yes all right but apart from that there was silence for a moment then she said reluc tantly all right you can come round here what to your house its safer than in public idiot not for me johnny thought ok he said i mean you might be one of those funny people what clowns and then she said very cautiously its really you really im not sure about but me yes you got blown up yes i know i was there remember i dont die often in the game it took me ages even to find the aliens huh thought johnny it doesnt get any better with practice he said darkly tyne crescent turned out to be a pretty straight road with trees in it and the houses were big and had double garages and a timber effect on them to fool people into believing that henry viii had built them kirstys mother opened the door for him she was grinning like the captain although the captain had the excuse that she was related to crocodiles johnny felt he had the wrong clothes on or the wrong face he was shown into a large room it was mainly white expensive bookshelves lined one wall most of the floor was bare pine but varnished and polished to show that they could have afforded carpets if theyd wanted them there was a harp standing by a chair in one corner and music scattered around it on the floor johnny picked up a sheet it was headed royal college grade v well she was standing behind him the sheet slipped out of his fingers and dont say um she said sitting dawn you say um a lot arent you ever sure about things uh no hello sit down my mothers making us some tea and then staying out of the way youll probably notice that you can actually hear her staying out of the way she thinks i ought to have more friends she had red hair and the skinny look that went with it it was as if someone had grabbed the frizzy ponytail on the back of her head and pulled it tightly the game said johnny vaguely yes what im really glad youre in it too yoless said it was all in my head because of trying times he said it was just me projecting my problems i havent got any problems snapped kirsty i get on extremely well with people actually theres pro bably some simple psychic reason that youre too stupid to work out you sounded more concerned on the phone said johnny but now ive had time to think about it anyway whats it to me what happens to some dots in a machine didnt you see the space invaders said johnny yes but they were stupid thats what happens charles darwin knew about that i am a winning kind of person and what i want to know is what were you doing in my dream im not sure its a dream said johnny im not sure what it is not exactly a dream and not exactly real something in between i dont know maybe something happens in your head maybe youre in there because because well i dont know why but theres got to be a reason he ended lamely whyre you there then i want to save the screewee why because weve got a responsibility but the cap tains been i dont know locked up or something theres been some kind of mutiny its the gunnery officer hes behind it but if i if we could get her out she could probably turn the fleet around again i thought you might be able to think of some way of get ting her out johnny finished lamely we havent got a lot of game time she said kirsty she started all this she relied on me said johnny you said she said kirsty johnny stood up i thought you might be able to help he said wearily but who cares what happens to some dots that arent even real so ill just you keep saying she said kirsty you mean the captains a woman a female said johnny yes but you called the gunnery officer a he said kirsty thats right kirsty stood up thats typical thats absolutely typical of modern society he probably resents a wo a female being bet ter than him i get that all the time um said johnny he hadnt meant to say um he meant to say actually all the screewee except the gunnery officer are females but another part of his brain had thought faster and shut down his mouth before he could say it diverting the words into oblivion and shoving good old um in their place there was an article in a magazine said kirsty this whole bunch of directors of a company ganged up on this woman and sacked her just because shed become the boss it was just like me and the chess club it probably wouldnt be a good idea to tell her there was a glint in her eye no it probably wouldnt be a good idea to be honest truthfulness would have to do instead after all he hadnt actually lied its a matter of principle said kirsty you should have said so right at the start she stood up come on where are we going said johnny to my room said kirsty dont worry my parents are very liberal there were film posters all over the walls and where there werent film posters there were shelves with silver cups on there was a framed certificate for the regional winner of the smallbore rifle confederations national championships and another one for chess and another one for athletics there were a lot of medals mostly gold and one or two silver kirsty won things if there was a medal for a tidy bedroom she would have won that too you could see the floor all the way to the walls she had an electrical pencil sharpener and a computer the screen was showing the familiar message new game do you know i have an iq of one hundred and sixtyfive she said sitting down in front of the screen is that good yes and i only started playing this wretched game because my brother bought it and said i wouldnt be any good at it these things are moronic there was a notebook by the keyboard each level explained kirsty i made notes about how the ships flew and kept score of course you were taking it seriously said johnny very seriously of course i take it seriously its a game youve got to win them otherwise whats the point now can we get on to the screewee flagship um think can we get into a screewee battleship kirsty almost growled i asked you sit down and think johnny sat down i dont think we can he said im always in a star ship i think things have to look like they do on the screen hmm makes some sort of sense i suppose kirsty stuck a pencil in the sharpener which whirred for a while and we dont know what it looks like inside johnny stared at the wall among the items pinned over the bed was a card for winning the under long jump she wins everything he thought wow she actually assumes shes going to win someone who always thinks theyre going to win he stared up at the movie posters there was one hed seen many times before the famous one the slivering alien monster youd think shed have some thing like a c inlay details photo over her bed but no there was this thing dont tell me he said you want to get inside the ship and run along the corridors shooting screewee you do dont you tactically she began you cant the captain wouldnt want that not killing screewee kirsty waved her hands in the air irritably thats stupid she said how do you expect to win without killing the enemy im supposed to save them anyway theyre not exactly the enemy i cant go around killing them kirsty looked thoughtful do you know she said there was an african tribe once whose nearest word for enemy was a friend we havent met yet johnny smiled right he said thats how but they were all killed and eaten in eighteen hun dred and two said kirsty except for those who were sold as slaves the last one died in mississippi in eight een sixtyfour and he was very upset you just made that up said johnny no i won a prize for history i expect you did said johnny but im not killing anyone then you cant win i dont want to win i just dont want them to lose you really are a dweeb arent you how can anyone go through life expecting to lose all the time well ive got to havent i the world is full of peo ple like you for a start johnny realized he was getting angry again he didnt often get angry he just got quiet or miserable anger was unusual but when it came it overflowed they tried to talk to you and you didnt even listen you were the only other one that got that involved you were so mad to win you slipped into game space and youd have been so much better at saving them than me and you didnt even listen but i listened and ive spent a week trying to save mankind in my sleep its always people like me that have to do stuff like that its always the people who arent clever and who dont win things that have to get killed all the time and you just hung around and watched its just like on the television the winners have fun winner types never lose they just come second its all the other people who lose and now youre only thinking of helping the captain because you think shes like you well i dont bloody well care any more miss clever ive done my best and im going to go on doing it and theyll all come back into game space and itll be just like the space invaders all over again and ill be there every night her mouth was open there was a knock on the door and almost imme diately mothers being what they are kirstys mother pushed it open she brought in a wide grin and a tray im sure youd both like some tea she said and yes mother said kirsty and rolled her eyes theres some macaroons have you found out your friends name now john maxwell said johnny and what do your friends call you said kirstys mother sweetly sometimes they call me rubber said johnny do they whatever for mother we were talking said kirsty cobbers is on in a minute said kirstys mother i er shall watch it on the set in the kitchen shall i goodbye said kirsty meaningfully um yes said her mother and went out she dithers a lot said kirsty fancy getting married when youre twenty a complete lack of ambition she stared at johnny for a while he was keeping quiet hed been amazed to hear his own thoughts kirsty coughed she looked a little uncertain for the first time since johnny had met her well she said uh ok and we wont be able to fight all the players when they get back to game space no theres not enough missiles could we dream a few more no i thought of that you get the ship you play with i mean we know its only got six missiles ive tried dreaming more and it doesnt work hmm interesting problem sony she added quickly when she saw his expression johnny stared at the movie posters sigourney games everywhere bigmac was a tough guy in his head and this one kept sharp pencils and had to win everything and in her head shot aliens everyone had these pictures of themselves in their head except him he blinked and now his head ached there was a buzzing in his ears kirstys face drifted towards him are you all right the headache was really bad now youre ill and you look all thin when did you last eat i dunno had something last night i think last night what about breakfast and lunch oh well you know i kept thinking about youd better drink that tea and eat that macaroon phew when did you last have a bath its kind of good grief listen listen it was important to he didnt feel well at all yes we dream our way in he said what are you talking about youre swaying we go on to their ship but we agreed we dont know what it looks like inside ok good so we decide what it does look like inside right she tapped her pad irritably so what does it look like i dont know the inside of a spaceship corridors and cabins and stuff like that nuts and bolts and panels and sliding doors scotsmen saying the engines canna tak it anymoore bright blue lights hmm thats what you think is inside spaceships is it kirsty glared at him she generally glared it was her normal expression when we go to sleep i mean when i go to sleep ill try and wake up inside the ship he said how i dont know by concentrating i suppose she leaned forward for the first time since hed met her she looked concerned you dont look capable of thinking straight she said ill be all right johnny stood up in space noone is listening anyway and woke up he was lying down on something hard there was some sort of mesh just in front of his eyes he stared at it for a while there was also a faint vibration in the floor and a distant background rumbling he was obviously back in game space but he cer tainly wasnt in a starship the mesh moved the captains face appeared over the edge of the mesh upside down johnny where am i you appear to be under my bed he rolled sideways im on your ship oh yes right hah i knew i could do it he stood up and looked around the cabin it wasnt very interesting apart from the bed which was under something that looked like a sunray lamp there was only a desk and something that was probably a chair if you had four back legs and a thick tail on the desk were half a dozen plastic aliens there was also a cage with a couple of longbeaked birds in it they sat side by side on their perch and watched johnny with almost intelligent eyes right sigourney was right he did think better in game space all the decisions seemed so much clearer ok so he was on board hed rather hoped to be outside the cabin the captain was locked in but this was a start he stared at the wall there was a grille whats that he said pointing it is where the air comes in johnny pulled at the grille there was no very obvious way of removing it if it could be removed the hole behind it was easily big enough for the captain air ducts well what did he expect weve got to get this off he said before some thing dreadful happens we are imprisoned said the captain what more can happen that is dreadful have you ever heard the name sigourney said johnny cautiously no but it sounds a lovely name said the captain who is this sigourney well if she can dream her way here as well then theres going to be trouble you should see the pictures shes got on her walls what of um aliens said johnny she takes a very close interest in alien races said the captain happily um yes the mere thought of her arrival made him pull urgently at the grille um theres some thing on the inside and i cant quite get my hand through the captain watched him with interest something like wingnuts grunted johnny this is very instructive said the captain peering over his shoulder i cant get a grip you wish to turn them yes the captain waddled over to the table and opened the bird cage both of the birds hopped out on to her hand the captain said a few words in screewee the birds fluttered past johnnys head squeezed through the mesh and disappeared after a second or two he heard the squeaksqueak of nuts being undone what were they he said chee said the captain mouth birds you under stand she opened her mouth revealing several rows of yellow teeth for hygiene living toothbrushes we have always had them they are traditional very intelligent bred for it you know clever things they understand several words of screewee the squeaking went on there was a clonk and a nut rolled through the mesh the panel fell into the room johnny looked at the hole kay he said uncertainly you dont know where it goes do you no there are ventilation shafts all over the ship will you lead the way um i would be happy for you to lead the way said the captain johnny stood on the bed and crawled into the hole it went a little way and then opened on to a bigger shaft all over the ship he said yes johnny paused for a moment hed never liked nar row dark spaces oh right he said kirstys mother put down the phone theres noone answering she said i think he said his father works late and his mother sometimes works in the evening said kirsty any way the doctor said hes basically all right didnt she hes just run down she said what was the stuff she gave him she said itd make him sleep hes not getting enough sleep twelveyearold boys need a lot of sleep i know this one does said kirsty and you said hes not eating properly where did you meet him anyway um kirsty began and then smiled to herself out and about kirstys mother looked worried are you sure hes all there hes all there said kirsty climbing the stairs im not sure that hes all here but hes certainly all there she opened the door of the spare room and looked in johnny was fast asleep in a pair of her brothers pyjamas he looked very young its amazing how young twelve is when youre thirteen then she went to her own bedroom got ready for bed and slid between the sheets it was pretty early it had been a busy evening he was a loser you could tell he dressed like a loser a ditherer someone who said um a lot and went through life trying not to be noticed shed never done that shed always gone through life as if there was a big red arrow above the planet indicating precisely where she was on the other hand he tried so hard shed bet hed cried when et died she pushed herself up on one elbow and stared at the movie posters trying wasnt the point you had to win what good was anything if you didnt win stuck youre an alien said johnny aliens dont get stuck in air ducts its practically a wellknown fact he backed into a side tunnel and turned around i am sorry it occurs to me that possibly i am the wrong type of alien said the captain i can go backwards but i am forwardly disadvantaged ok back up to that second junction we passed said johnny were lost anyway no said the captain i know where we are it says here this is junction e do you know where that is no i saw a film where there was an alien crawling around inside a spaceships air ducts and it could come out wherever it liked said johnny reproachfully doubtless it had a map said the captain johnny crawled around a corner and found another grille there didnt seem to be any activity on the other side of it he unscrewed the nuts and let it fall on to the floor there was a corridor he dropped into it then turned and helped the captain through screewee might have descended from crocodiles but crocodiles preferred sandbanks they werent very good at crawl ing through narrow spaces her skin felt cold and dry like silk there were no other screewee around theyre probably at battle stations said johnny were always at battle stations said the captain bitterly brushing dust off her scales this is corridor now we must get to the bridge yes wont they just lock you up again said johnny i think not disobedience to properly constituted authority does not come easily to us the gunnery officer is very persuasive but once they see that i am free again they will give in at least the captain added most of them will the gunnery officer may prove difficult he dreams of grandeur she waddled a little way along the bare corridor keeping close to the wall johnny trailed behind her dreams are always tricky he said yes but theyll wake up when the players start shooting again wont they theyll soon see what he is leading them into we have a proverb said the captain skeejeeshe jweejeeyee it means she thought for a moment when you are riding a jee a sixlegged domesticated beast of burden capable of simple instruction but also traditionally foultempered it is easier to stay on rather than dismount equally better to trust yourself to fate than risk attack from the surefooted jeeyee which will easily outrun a screewee on foot of course it is a little snappier in our language theyd reached a corner the captain peered around it and then jerked her head back there is a guard outside the door of my cabin she said she is armed can you talk to her she is under orders i fear that i will only be allowed to say aaargh said the captain but feel free to make the attempt i have no other options oh well you only die a few hundred times thought johnny he stepped out into the corridor the guard turned to look at him and half raised a meltedlooking thing that nevertheless very clearly said gun but she looked at him in puzzlement shes never seen a human before he thought he spread his arms wide in what he hoped was an innocentlooking way and smiled which just goes to show that you shouldnt take things for granted because as the captain told him later when a screewee is about to fight she does two things she spreads her front pairs of arms wide to grip and throttle and exposes her teeth the guard raised the gun then there was a thunderous knocking on the other side of the cabin door the guard made a simple mistake she should have ignored the knocking loud and desperate though it was and concentrated on johnny but she tried to keep the gun pointing in his general direction while she pressed a panel by the door after all it was only the captain in there wasnt it and the captain was still the captain even if she was locked up she could keep an eye on both of them the door opened a little way a foot came out swinging upwards and caught the guard under the snout there was a click as all its teeth met its eyes crossed someone shouted haul the guard swayed backwards kirsty came through the door airborne and started hacking at the guards arms with her hands it dropped the gun she picked it up in one movement the guard opened its mouth to bite spread its arms to grip and throttle and then went crosseyed because the gun barrel was suddenly thrust between its teeth dont swallow said kirsty very deliberately there was a sudden very heavy silence the guard stayed very still this is a friend of mine said johnny oh yes said the captain sigourney one of your warriors is she a friend of mine at the moment said sigourney without moving her head she had tied one of the strips of webbing from the captains bed around her forehead she was breath ing heavily there was a wild glint in her eye johnny suddenly felt very sorry for the guard you know im glad shes a friend of mine said the captain he ee ogg ee said the guard its arms were tremb ling the screewee didnt sweat but this one would probably have liked to wed better tie her up and put her in the cabin said johnny ees said the guard i could just fire said sigourney wistfully no said johnny and the captain together eep said the guard oh all right sigourney relaxed the guard sagged sorry to be late said sigourney had a bit of trou ble getting to sleep the captain said something to the guard in screewee it nodded in a strangely human way and trooped obediently into the cabin where it squatted down just as obediently and let them tie its hands and feet with more bits of bed youve got a black belt in karate too i expect said johnny only purple she said but i havent been doing it long she added quickly huh is that the only kind of knot you can tie i went to karate once with bigmac said johnny trying to ignore that what happened i got my foot caught in my trousers and you are the chosen one huh they could have chosen me they tried but i was the one who listened said johnny quietly sigourney picked up the gun and cradled it in her arms well im here now she said and ready to kick some butt some but what said johnny wearily he really hated the phrase it was a game saying it tried to fool you into believing that real bullets werent going to go through real people sigourney sniffed nerd they went back into the corridor by the way said johnny what happened to me you just collapsed right there on the floor weve got a doctor living next door mum went and got her unusually bright of her really she said you were just tired out and looked as though you hadnt been eating properly this is true said the captain did i not say too much sugar and carbohydrate not enough fresh vitamins you should get out more yeah right said johnny there was something different about the corridor before it had been grey metal only interesting if you really liked looking at nuts and bolts but now it was darker with more curves the walls glistened and drip ped menace dripped something anyway the captain looked different too she hadnt changed exactly it was just that her teeth and claws were somehow more obvious a few minutes ago she had been an intelligent person who just happened to be an eightlegged crocodile now she was an eightlegged crocodile who just happened to be intelligent game space was changing now two people were sharing one dream hold on theres he began dont lets hang around said sigourney but youre johnny began dreaming it wrong he finished to himself this really is nuts he told himself as he trailed after them at home kirsty went around being miss brains in here it was all make my shorts eat my day the captain waddled at high speed along the cor ridors now steam was dribbling from somewhere making the floor misty and wet there wasnt that much in the screewee ships perhaps they ought to have sat down and worked out the inside of one in a bit more detail before theyd dreamed he thought they could have added more cabins and big screens and interesting things like that as it was all there seemed to be were these snaking cor ridors that were unpleasantly like caves bigger caves though theyd got wider mysterious passages led off in various directions sigourney crept along with her back against the wall spinning around rapidly every time they passed another passage she stiffened theres another one coming she hissed its pushing something get back she elbowed them into the wall johnny could hear the scrapescrape of claws on the floor and something rattling when it gets closer ill get it ill leap out johnny poked his head around the corner kirsty she took no notice sigourney he tried yes i know youre going to leap out said johnny but dont pull the trigger right its an alien so its an alien you dont have to shoot them all the rattling got closer there was also a faint squeaking sigourney gripped the gun excitedly and leapt out ok you oh um it was a very small screewee most of its scales were grey its crest was nearly worn away its tail just dragged behind it when it opened its mouth there were three teeth left and they were huddling together at the back it blinked owlishly at them over the top of the trolley it had been pushing apart from anything else kirsty had been aiming the gun well above its head there was one of those awkward pauses around this time said the captain behind them the crew on the bridge have a snack brought to them johnny leaned forward nodded at the little old alien and lifted the lid of the tray that was on the trolley there were a few bowls of something green and bub bling he gently lowered the lid again i think you were going to shoot the tea lady he said how was i to know kirsty demanded it could have been anything this is an alien spaceship youre not supposed to get tea ladies the captain said something in screewee to the old alien who shuffled around slowly and went off back down the corridor one wheel of the trolley kept squeaking kirsty was furious this isnt going right she hissed come on said johnny lets go to the bridge and get it over with i didnt know it was a tea lady thats your dreaming yes all right she had no right to be there i suppose even aliens get a bit thirsty in the afternoons thats not what i meant theyre supposed to be alien that means slavering and claws it doesnt mean sending out for for a coffee and a jam doughnut things are just like they are said johnny shrugging she turned on him why do you just accept everything why dont you ever try to change things theyre generally bad enough already he said she leapt ahead and peered around the next corner guards she said and these have got guns johnny looked around the corner there were two screewee standing in front of a round door they were indeed armed satisfied she snapped no hint of danish pastries anywhere right now can i actually shoot something no i keep telling you you have to give them a chance to surrender you always make it difficult she raised the gun and stepped out so did the captain she hissed a word in screewee the guards looked from her to kirsty who was squinting along her gun barrel one of them hissed something she says the gunnery officer has instructed them to shoot anyone who approaches the door said the captain ill fire if they move said kirsty i mean it the captain spoke in screewee again the guards stared at johnny they lowered their guns suspicion rose inside him what did you just tell them he said i just told them who you were said the captain you said i was the chosen one one of the guards was trying to kneel that looked very strange in a creature with four legs kirsty rolled her eyes its better than being shot at said the captain ive been shot at a lot i know what i am talking about tell her to get up said johnny what do we do now whos on the bridge most of the officers said the captain the guard says there have been arguments gunfire thats more like it said kirsty they looked at the door ok said johnny lets go the captain motioned one of the guards aside and touched a plate by the door humans johnny saw it all in one long long second firstly the bridge was big it seemed to be the size of a football pitch and at one end there was a screen which looked almost as big he felt like an ant standing in front of a tv set the screen was covered with green dots players heading for the fleet there were hundreds of them right in front of the screen was a horseshoeshaped bank of controls with a dozen seats ranged in front of it its here he thought when i was sitting in my room playing they were in here in this great shadowy room steering their ship firing back only one seat was occupied now its occupant was already standing up half turning reaching for something go ahead said kirsty make my stardate the gunnery officer froze glaring at them too late he said youre too late he waved a claw towards the screen ive taken us back to where we belong there is no time to turn us round again you must fight now he focused on johnny whats that he said the chosen one said the captain starting to walk forward the others followed her but we must fight said the gunnery officer for honour the honour of the screewee thats what we are for johnnys foot touched something he looked down now that his eyes had become accustomed to the gloom he could see that hed almost tripped over a screewee it was dead nothing with a hole like that in it could have been alive kirsty was looking down too johnny could see other shapes on the floor in the shadows hes been killing sc people he whispered shoot them in space shoot them on a screen and there was just an explosion and five points on the score total when theyd been shot from a few metres away then there was simply a reminder that someone who had been alive was now very definitely not alive any more and would never be again he looked up at the gunnery officer screewee were coldblooded and a long way from being human but this one had a look about it about him that sug gested a mind running off into madness there was a silvery sheen on his scales johnny found himself wondering if the screewee changed colour like chameleons the captain had always looked more golden when she was acting normally and became almost yellow when she was worried she was the colour of lemons now she hissed something the guards looked at her in surprise but turned and filed obediently out of the bridge then she turned to the gunnery officer you killed all of them she said softly they tried to stop me it is a matter of honour yes yes i can see that said the captain in a level voice she was shifting position slightly now moving away from the humans a screewee dies fighting or not at all shouted the gunnery officer the captains scales had faded to the colour of old paper yes i understand i understand she said and the humans understand too dont you the gunnery officer turned his head the captain spread her arms opened her mouth and leapt the male must have sensed her he turned claws whirring through the air johnny reached out and caught kirstys gun as she raised it no you might hit her whyd she do that i could easily have shot him so could the guards why just jump at him like that the fighters were a whirling ball of claws and tails its personal i think she hates him too much he said but look at the screen there were more green dots red figures that might have meant something to a screewee were scrolling up on one side too fast for a human to read he looked down at the controls theyre getting closer weve got to do something kirsty stared at the controls too the seats were made to fit a screewee so were the controls themselves well do you know what a v f t means she said fast slow fire the cigarette lighter the fighters had broken apart and were circling each other hissing the green and red light from the screen threw unpleasant shadows neither screewee was paying the humans the least attention they couldnt afford to screewee walked like ducks and looked like a cartoon of a crocodile but they fought like cats it was mainly watching and snarling with short terrible blurs of attack and defence a light started to flash on the panel and an alarm rang it rang in screewee but it was still pretty urgent even in human the captain spun around the gunnery officer jumped backwards hit the ground running and sped towards the door he was through it in a blur he cant go anywhere said the captain staggering across to the controls i can deal with him later youve got some nasty scratches said kirsty screewee blood was blue i know some first aid a lot i expect said johnny but not for screewee i imagine said the captain her chest was heaving one of her legs seemed to be at the wrong angle blue patches covered her tail you could have just shot him said kirsty it was stupid to fight like that honour snarled the captain she tripped a switch with a claw and hissed some instructions in screewee but he was right sadly i know this now there is no changing screewee nature our destiny is to fight and die i have been foolish to think otherwise she blinked take off your shirt kirsty demanded what said johnny your shirt your shirt look at her shes losing blood she needs bandaging johnny obeyed reluctantly youve got a vest on underneath only grandads wear a vest yuk dont you ever wash your clothes he did sometimes and occasionally his mother had a burst of being a mother and everything in the house got washed but usually he used the washbasket laun dry which consisted of going through the basket until he found something that didnt seem all that bad but she said you wouldnt know anything about screewee medicine he said so what even if its blue bloods still blood you should try to keep it inside kirsty helped the captain to a chair the alien was swaying a bit and her scales had gone white speckled with blue is there anything i can do said johnny kirsty glanced at him i dont know she said is there anything you can do she turned back to the captain well all die johnny thought theyre all out there waiting and heres me at the controls of the main alien ship we cant turn round now and i cant even read what it says on the controls ive done it all wrong it was all simple and now its all complicated you think about doing things in dreams but were always wrong about dreams when people talk about dreams they mean daydreams thats where youre superman or whatever thats where you win every thing in dreams everything is weird im in a dream now or something like a dream and when i wake up all the screewee will be back in game space and theyll be shot at again just like the space invaders hang on hang on he stared at the meaningless controls again on one of them the symbols s if c rearranged themselves to form main engines this is my world too its in my head he looked up at the big screen all of them theyre all there waiting in bedrooms and lounges around the world in between watching cobbers and doing their homework all waiting with their finger on the fire button and each one thinking that theyre the only one all there in front of me i wasnt expecting to do this said kirsty behind him i wasnt expecting to be bandaging aliens put a claw on this knot will you whats your pulse level i dont think we have them said the captain the ship thumped the distant background rumble of the engines was suddenly a roar the seats had bits sticking up where humans didnt expect bits to stick up johnny was sitting crosslegged on one both hands on the controls face multicoloured in the light of the screen kirsty tapped him on the shoulder what are you doing flying said johnny without turning his head he said its too late to turn round im not turning round you dont know how to fly one of these im not flying one of these im flying the whole fleet you cant understand the controls green and red light made patterns on his face as he turned to her you know everyone tells me things all the time he said well im not listening now i can read the controls why not theyre in my head now sit down i shall need you to do some things and stop talking to me as if im stupid she sat down almost hypnotized by his tone of voice but how theres a control that lets this ship steer all the others as well its used on long voyages he moved a lever and im flying them as fast as i can i dont think they can go any faster all the dials have gone into the thats screewee for red but youre heading straight for the players ive got to there isnt time to turn round wobbler had a pinup over his bed it was a closeup photograph of the intel microprocessor taken through a microscope it looked like a street map of a very complicated modern city his grandfather complained that it was unhealthy and why didnt he have a double page spread from giggles and garters instead but wobbler had a vision one day if he could master gcse maths and reliably pick up a soldering iron by the end that wasnt hot he was going to be a big man in computers a number one programmer with his hair in a ponytail at the back like they all wore never mind about yoless saying it was all run by men in suits these days one day the world would hear from wobbler johnson probably via a phoneline it didnt know was connected to its computer in the meantime he was staring at columns of numbers in an effort to make a completely illegal copy ofmrbunleygoesboing it had been given four stars and declared megabad which was what splaaaaatttd magazine still thought meant pretty good if you were under sixteen he blinked at the screen and smeared the grease on his glasses a bit more evenly and that was enough for tonight he sat back and his eye caught sight of only you can save mankind under a pile of other discs poor old rubber of course you called people men tal all the time but there was something weird about him his body walked around down on earth but his brain was probably somewhere you couldnt find with an atlas wobbler shoved the disc in the drive odd about the game though there was probably a logical reason for it thats what computers were logical start believing anything else and you were in trouble the title came up and then the bit that gobi soft ware had pinched from star wars and then his jaw dropped ships hundreds of them getting bigger and bigger yellow ships filling the screen so that it was just black and yellow and just yellow and then blinding white wobbler ducked and then a black screen almost black anyway for a moment the words hung there hi wobler and then vanished more alarms were clanging and whooping kirsty peered out from between her fingers i dont think we hit anyone said johnny tapping on the keys you flew straight through them thats right ok but theyll still come after us so now we turn round itll take a little while hows the captain a clawed hand gripped the back of his chair and her snout rested on his shoulder this is very bad said the captain our engines are not designed to run at this sort of speed for any length of time they could break down at any moment its a calculated risk said johnny really how precisely did you calculate it said the screewee well not exactly calculate i just thought it was worth a try said johnny youre turning back towards the players and were still accelerating said johnny what were you typing just then said kirsty oh nothing said johnny grinning just thought i saw someone i recognized you know as we flashed past why are you looking so happy she demanded were in terrible trouble dunno because its my trouble i suppose captain why have all those lights over there come on theyre the ships of the fleet said the captain the commanders want to know whats happening tell them to hold on to something said johnny and tell them tell them theyre going home they both looked at him oh yes very impressive said kirsty very dramatic all very shut up what shut up said johnny again his eyes not leaving the screen noone tells me to shut up im telling you now just because youve got a mind like a a hammer doesnt mean you have to treat every one else like a nail now here they come again wobbler took the disc out of the drive and looked at it then he felt around the back of his computer in case there were any extra wires that johnny he was the quiet type he always said that all he knew about computers was how to switch them on but everyone knew about computers hed probably messed around with the game and given it back pretty good wobbler wondered how hed done it he put the disc back in and started the game again only you can save mankind yeah yeah then the inside of the starship missiles guns score total yeah yeah and stars ahead the sparkly ones you got in the game hed done much better ones for voyage to alpha centauri no ships to be seen he picked up the joystick and moved it watching the stars spin as the ship turned there was a ship right behind him very much behind him dozens of ships again hundreds of ships all getting bigger much bigger very quickly very very quickly again when he got up off the floor and put the leg back on the chair the screen was all black again except for the little flashing cursor wobbler stared at it logic he said not believing in logical reasons was almost as bad as dropping hot solder on to a nylon sock there had to be a logical explanation one day hed think of one theyre following us theyre following us little coils of smoke were coming up from the con trols there were all sorts of vibrations in the floor im pretty sure we can outrun them said johnny how sure said kirsty pretty sure kirsty turned to the captain have we got any rear guns the captain nodded they can be fired from here she said but we should not do that we have surrendered remember i havent said kirsty which one fires the guns the stick with the button on the top this its just like a games joystick she said of course it is said johnny this is in our heads remember it has to be things we know the screen showed the view behind the fleet there were green ships bunched up behind them theyre coming right down our tailpipe said kirsty this is going to be really easy yes it is isnt it said johnny there was a dull edge to his voice she hesitated what do you mean she said just dots in the middle of a circle said johnny its easy bang here comes the high score bang go ahead but its game space its a game why are you acting like that its just something on a screen fine just like the real thing press the button then she gripped the stick then she paused again why do you have to spoil everything me said johnny vaguely look if youre not going to fire switch the screen back to whats ahead of us will you this dial here says were moving at e per c and thats times faster than it says we ought to be going well well i just think itd be nice not to run into an asteroid or something of course if you want us to end up five miles across and one centimetre thick keep looking back oh all right she took her finger off the screen switch and then she gasped they stared at the expanse of space ahead of them and what was in the middle of it what said kirsty after a long pause is that johnny laughed he tried to stop himself because the ship was groan ing and creaking like a tortured thing but he couldnt tears ran down his cheeks he thumped his hand help lessly on the control panel accidentally switching a few lights on and off its the border said the captain yes said johnny of course it is but its kirsty began yes said johnny the border see beyond it theyre safe of course noone crosses the border humans cant do it it cant be natural who knows this is game space after all its probably natural here i mean weve all seen it before but it is still a very long way off said the captain i fear that there was a dull explosion somewhere behind them missiles said kirsty you should have let me no listen said johnny listen what to i cant hear anything thats because somethings making a lot of silence said johnny the engines have stopped the engines have probably melted said the captain weve still got what is it momentum or inertia or one of those things said johnny well keep going until we hit something or something hits us said kirsty she looked at the border again how big is that thing she said it must be huge said johnny but theres stars beyond it not our stars i told you thats one place humans cant go they looked at one another what happens then kirsty began like someone exploring a particularly nasty hole in a tooth if were on a ship that tries to go past the border they both turned to the captain who shrugged dont ask me she said its never happened it is impossible now all three of them turned to look at the border again is it just me said kirsty or is it just a little bit bigger there was some silence still said johnny whats the worst that can happen to us then he wished he hadnt said that he remembered thinking hed hear the alarm clock waking him up that very first time and then he recalled the shock of realiz ing that he wasnt being allowed to wake up at all you know i dont want to find out he added without engines we cannot turn the ship around said the captain i am sorry you were too keen to save us it is getting bigger said kirsty you can tell if you watch the stars behind it i am sorry said the captain again at least the screewee should make it said johnny i am sorry kirsty stood up well im not she said come on she picked up the gun and strode away into the shadows johnny ran after her where do you think youre going to the escape capsule she said what escape capsule indeed said the captain scuttling after them i ask that too there is no such thing there can be if we want there to be said kirsty opening the door you said the game is made up of things we know well i know itll be right down under the ship but its my dream as well as yours right believe me therell be an escape capsule her eyes had that gleam again she hefted the gun i know it she said ive been there he remembered her room he could picture her sit ting there with a dozen sharp pencils and no friends getting top marks in her history homework while in her head she was chasing aliens i cannot understand said the captain the corridor outside was full of steam the ship might cross the border but it was going to have to have a lot of repairs before it ever came back um said johnny its a bit like the models in the cereal packets its kind of a human idea the screewee hesitated in the doorway then she turned to look at the saeen we are getting closer she said if you think there is something there then you must go now come on said kirsty uh johnny began thank you said the captain gravely i havent really done much said johnny who knows you never thought of yourself you tried to work things out you made choices and i chose well and now we must go said kirsty perhaps we shall meet again afterwards if all goes well said the captain she took one of johnnys hands in two of her own goodbye she said kirsty caught johnnys shoulder and dragged him away nice to have met you she said to the alien sort of interesting come on you some of the lights had gone out the corridors were full of steam and vague shapes kirsty ran on ahead darting from shadow to shadow well have to go down she said over her shoulder itll be there dont worry youre really into this arent you said johnny heres a ramp come on we cant have much time there was another passage below that and another ramp curling away down through the steam they came out in a room bigger than the bridge there was a very large double door at one end and banks of equipment around the walls and in the mid dle standing on three landing legs was a small ship it had a stubby heavy look there see what did i tell you said kirsty triumphantly johnny walked over to the nearest equipment panel and touched it it was sticky he looked at his fingertips it hasnt been here long he said the paints not dry a screen in the middle of the panel lit up showing the captains face how interesting she said i look down at my controls and discover a new one you have found your escape capsule it looks like it said johnny we have ten minutes until we reach the border said the captain you should have plenty of time there was a whirring noise behind johnny the escape capsules ramp was coming down i found a switch on the landing leg said kirsty he joined her the ramp was a silvery greycolour it gleamed in the misty blue light that streamed down from inside the capsule can you guess what im thinking said kirsty youre thinking we havent seen the gunnery officer lately said johnny youre thinking hell be in there somewhere hiding because this part is your dream and thats how your dream works only ill be ready for him said sigourney come on she sidled up the ramp turning constantly in a series of small excited hops to keep the gun pointed at any teeth that might suddenly appear there were two seats in the capsule in front of a very small control panel there was a big window there were a couple of small cupboards and there wasnt much of anything else kirsty pointed to a cupboard and made a gesture to johnny to open it she raised her gun he opened the door and stood back quickly kirsty seriously menaced a stack of tins she caught johnnys expression well he could have been in there she said oh yes sure admittedly hed have to stop to cut his arms and legs off and then curl up really small but he could have been in there hah smart comment why not try looking under the seat cushions its amazing what goes down behind them kirsty tried to prod behind the control panel without johnny noticing he noticed maybe aliens dont watch the same kind of films we watch he said all right all right no need to go on about it she snarled she looked at the controls and pressed a switch the hatch swung up the captains face appeared on a small screen in the middle of the panel eight minutes to the border she said right said kirsty she shoved a hand down behind her seat cushion and then looked at johnnys grin you see aliens everywhere dont you he said whats that supposed to mean nothing nothing just a thought she glowered at him there were seat belts they put them on kirsty started to drum her fingers on the panel she seemed to be looking for something how do we open the doors said johnny all right all right its got to be here somewhere she pressed a button behind them the ramp rose up and hissed into place johnny looked around there really was nowhere for anyone to hide they were aboard the escape craft they were safe he didnt feel safe he grabbed kirstys arm wait a minute he said urgently i think some things wro the screen flickered into life there was a screewee there it was the gunnery officer run and hide human scum he said they could see the screen behind him he was on the bridge you where is the captain said johnny she will be dealt with while you run away no kirsty nudged him look the screewee are safe she said the border is only a few minutes away weve done it all you cant chase around after her now shell have to take her chances thats what shed say if you asked her but i cant ask her can i he reached over and pushed a switch there was a whirring behind them as the ramp slid down im going back up there he said hell be waiting for you fine he picked up the alien gun which bits the trigger she rolled her eyes this is stupid scared are you said johnny his face was pale me she shrugged and snatched the gun ill take this she said im used to guns youll only make a mess of it just like the real thing they ran down the ramp and back to the corridor got a watch on said johnny yes weve got more than six minutes i should have known said johnny as they ran no one gets that long to escape james bond never turns up with enough time to have a cup of coffee and clean his shoes before he disarms the time bomb were playing games again calm down if we find a cat im going to kick it the corridors were darker water dripped from the ceiling there was still some steam hissing out of broken pipes they reached a junction which way kirsty pointed that way are you sure of course they disappeared into the gloom about thirty seconds later they reappeared running oh yes of course well they all look the same actually it must be this way this one did lead to the wide corridor with the door to the bridge at the far end it was open they could see the blue and white flickering of the big screen kirsty changed her grip on the gun okay she said no messing about this time right no talking all right lets go how you walk in there when he leaps out at you ill get him oh im bait am i kirsty glanced at her wrist youve got four and half minutes to think of some thing better she said oh sorry four minutes and twentyfive seconds hang on thats twenty seconds now i just hope youre good kirsty patted the gun regional champion remem ber trust me johnny walked towards the open doorway he tried to swivel his eyes both ways as he reached it four minutes and fifteen seconds said her voice far far behind him he halted on the threshold how come you werent national champion he said i had food poisoning on the day actually oh right he stepped through multitoothed death failed to happen to him he risked a better look to either side and then swallowing upwards as well nothing here he said ok im right behind you on the screen the border was already much bigger were travelling very fast he thought and its still more than four minutes away and already its filling the sky huge isnt the word for it i can see all round the room he said noone s here there was a control panel wasnt there said kirsty hang on im in the doorway now yes its got to be behind the controls go ahead im ready if it leaps out im not he thought he sidled across the floor until he could just see behind the bank of instruments theres noth hold it what i think its the captain is it alive she shes a she you know shes a she i cant tell shes just lying there ill have a look what good would that do im going to have a look all right careful then stay where i can keep an eye on you he moved forward searching the shadows around the edge of the huge room it was the captain and she was alive at least bits of what was probably her chest were going up and down he knelt beside her captain he whispered she opened one eye chosen one what happened he was waiting while i talked to you he crept in hit me whered he go then you must go not much time left the fleetis youre hurt ill get ki sigourney over here her claw gripped his arm listen to me hes going to blow up the ship the fuel the power plant hes johnny stood up is she all right kirsty called out i dont know she was standing in the doorway outlined against the light there was a shadow behind her as johnny watched it spread its arms it was bigger than a screewee should be now it wasnt a funny alligator there was still a suggestion of alligator there but now there was insect too and other things things that had never existed outside of dreams johnny shouted hes behind you then he lowered his head and ran kirsty turned you cant trust dreams if you live inside them theyll turn on you carry you along he saw kirsty turn and look up and up at the gun nery officer the screewee opened his mouth there were more teeth than hed had before rows and rows of them and every one glistening and sharp her dream johnny thought no wonder she always fights shoot it shoot it she was just staring she didnt seem to want to move youve got the gun he screamed she was like a statue shoot it kirsty shook her head vaguely and then as if shed suddenly clicked awake raised the gun ok she said now the screewee ignored her he jerked his head up and focused on johnny he hardly had eyes now the alien seemed to be looking at johnny with its teeth ah the chosen one it said it slapped kirsty out of the way she couldnt even have seen its arm move one moment she was aiming and the next she was lifted into the air and dropping in a heap a few metres away the gun clattered on to the floor and slid towards johnny chosen one hissed the screewee foolish we are what we are you disgrace your race and mine for you and her for you theres no going back kirsty was trying to get to her feet her face con torted with anger johnny reached down and picked up the gun the screewee waved two arms in a sudden move ment johnny flinched he heard from a long way away kirsty call out quick throw it to me to me the alien smiled johnny backed away a little the alien was concen trating entirely on him to me you idiot shouted kirsty you said the alien to johnny shoot me you cant such weakness like your captain a disgrace to the screewee always weak and that is why you want peace the strong never want peace johnny raised the gun the alien moved forward slowly his teeth seemed to fill the world his arms seemed longer his claws sharper you cannot it said ive watched you at least the other humans could fight we could die honourably but you you talk and talk youd do anything rather than fight youd do anything but face the truth you save mankind hah johnny stepped back again and felt the edge of the control desk behind him there was no more retreating will you surrender he said never johnny saw a movement out of the corner of his eye kirsty was going to try to leap on the thing but the alien wasnt like the guards now she wouldnt stand a chance he fired there was a small sharp explosion the screewee looked down in shock at the sudden blue stain spreading across his overall and then back up to johnny almost in bewilderment you shot me in cold blood no my bloods never cold the alien toppled forward and now he was smaller again more like a screewee and i had to said johnny you shot him said the voice behind him he looked round the captain had pulled herself to her feet yes you had to but i didnt think you could johnny looked down at the gun his knuckles were white with some difficulty he managed to persuade his fingers to let go i didnt think i could either he walked over to kirsty who was staring at the thing on the floor wow she said but quietly yes he said you yes i shot him i shot him i wish i didnt have to but i had to he was alive and now he isnt there were more alarms sounding now and red lights flashing on the control panel on the screen the border completely filled the sky can we go how much longer have we got left she looked hazily at her watch a minute and a half he was amazed he felt he was sitting inside his own head watching himself there wasnt any panic the him who was watching didnt know what to do but one outside seemed to know everything it was like a dream can you run she nodded really fast what am i saying youve probably won medals come on he pulled her after him out of the bridge and along the dark corridors kirsty was hardly concentrating any more the walls glistened less there were even nuts and bolts again they reached the capsule johnny ran from leg to leg until he found the button that let down the ramp it seemed to take ages to come down how long weve got fifty seconds up the ramp into the seats there werent many controls johnny peered at them what are you doing said kirsty like you said before looking for one marked doors open the screen flickered into life johnny the doors open from up here said the captain johnny glanced up at kirsty we didnt know that he said is the ramp back up yes doors opening there was a clonk ahead of them and a hiss as the air in the hall escaped through the widening crack the twinkling unreal stars of game space beckoned them johnnys hand hovered over the biggest red button on the panel johnny yes captain thank you you did it if not me then who hah yes and now perhaps we shall meet again goodbye we could not have done it if we had not had you to help us anything else goodbye we will not forget you johnny looked at kirsty how long ten seconds lets go he hit the button there was a boom behind them the walls flashed past and suddenly they were surrounded by sky johnny leaned back against the seat his mind was blank empty except for something which kept on replaying itself like a piece of film over and over again his memory fired the gun over and over again the alien collapsed action replay pin point precision just like the real thing kirsty nudged him can we steer it hmm what he looked vaguely at the controls well theres this joystick turn us round then i want to watch them go through yes me too the capsule turned gently in the deep void of game space right up against the border the screewee fleet hurtled past as each ship reached the border it flickered and faded do you think theyve got a planet to go to really i think they think so do you think theyll ever be back not now um look when i looked up and i saw that thing i mean it was so real and i thought but its alive its living how can i yes said johnny and then it was dead and and i didnt feel like cheering yes when its real its not easy because people die and its really over yes i know over and over dyou know what what my friend yoless thinks dreams like this are a way of dealing with real life yes i think its the other way round yoless is the black one yes we call him yoless because hes not cool anticools quite cool too is it i didnt know that is it still cool to say well wicked johnny it was never cool to say well wicked how about vode vodes cool i just made it up the capsule drifted onwards no reason why it cant be cool though right game stars glittered johnny yes how come you get on with people so well how come people always talk to you dunno because i listen i suppose and it helps to be stupid johnny still here what did you mean you know back there when you said i see aliens everywhere um cant remember you must have meant something im not even sure there are aliens only different kinds of us but i know what the important thing is the important thing is to be exactly sure about what youre doing the important thing is to remember its not a game none of it even the games the ship became a dot against the night what do we do to get home ive always had to die to get out you can get out if you win theres a green button here worth a try yes right light was streaming into the room when johnny woke up he lay in someone elses bed and looked around through halfclosed eyes it was like all spare rooms everywhere there was the lamp that was a bit oldfashioned and didnt fit in anywhere else there was the bookcase with the books that noone read much there was a lack of small things apart from an ashtray on the bedside table there was a clock but at some time in the past the mains had gone off for a while and although people must have sorted out every other clock in the house theyd forgotten about this one so it just sat and flashed continuously day and night but an absence of sound from below suggested that it was still early in the morning he snuggled down treasuring this time stolen between dreaming and waking so what next hed have to talk to kirsty who dreamed of being sigourney and forgot that she was trying to be someone who was acting and he had a suspicion that hed see his parents before long he was probably going to be talked at a lot but at least thatd make a change these were still trying times there was still school nothing actually was better probably noone was doing anything with a magic wand but the fleet had got away compared to that everything else was well not easy but less like a wall and more like steps you might never win but at least you could try if not you who else he turned over and went back to sleep the border hung in the sky huge white letters thousands of miles high they spelled game over and the fleet roared past tankers battleships fighters they soared and rolled their shadows streaking across the letters as ship after ship escaped for ever new game
