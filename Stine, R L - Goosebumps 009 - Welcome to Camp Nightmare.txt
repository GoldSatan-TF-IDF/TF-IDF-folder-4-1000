i stared out the dusty window as the camp bus bounced over the narrow winding road i could see sloping red hills in the distance beneath a bright yellow sky stumpy white trees lined the road like fence posts we were way out in the wilderness we hadnt passed a house or a farm for nearly an hour the bus seats were made of hard blue plastic when the bus hit a bump we all bounced up off our seats everyone laughed and shouted the driver kept growling at us yelling for us to pipe down there were twentytwo kids going to camp on the bus i was sitting in the back row on the aisle so i could count them all there were eighteen boys and only four girls i guessed that the boys were all going to camp nightmoon which is where i was going the girls were going to a girls camp nearby the girls sat together in the front rows and talked quietly to each other every once in a while theyd glance back quickly to check out the boys the boys were a lot louder than the girls cracking jokes laughing making funny noises shouting out dumb things it was a long bus ride but we were having a good time the boy next to me was named mike he had the window seat mike looked a little like a bulldog he was kind of chubby with a round face and pudgy arms and legs he had short spiky black hair which he scratched a lot he was wearing baggy brown shorts and a sleeveless green tshirt we had been sitting together the whole trip but mike didnt say much i figured he was shy or maybe very nervous he told me this was his first time at sleepaway camp it was my first time too and i have to admit that as the bus took me farther and farther from my home i was already starting to miss my mom and dad just a little im twelve but ive never really stayed away from home before even though the long bus ride was fun i had this sad kind of feeling and i think mike was feeling the same way he pressed his chubby face against the window glass and stared out at the red hills rolling by in the distance are you okay mike i asked yeah sure billy he replied quickly without turning around i thought about my mom and dad back at the bus station they had seemed so serious i guess they were nervous too about me going off to camp for the first time well write every day dad said do your best mom said hugging me harder than usual what a weird thing to say why didnt she say have a good time why did she say do your best as you can tell im a bit of a worrier the only other boys id met so far were the two in the seat in front of us one was named colin he had long brown hair down to his collar and he wore silver sunglasses so you couldnt see his eyes he acted kind of tough and he wore a red bandanna on his forehead he kept tying and untying the bandanna sitting next to him in the seat on the aisle was a big loud kid named jay jay talked a lot about sports and kept bragging about what a good athlete he was he liked showing off his big muscular arms especially when one of the girls turned around to check us out jay teased colin a lot and kept wrestling with him gripping colins head in a headlock and messing up colins bandanna you know just kidding around jay had wild bushy red hair that looked as if it had never been brushed he had big blue eyes he never stopped grinning and horsing around he spent the whole trip telling gross jokes and shouting things at the girls hey whats your name jay called to a blondehaired girl who sat at the front by the window she ignored him for a long time but the fourth time jay called out the question she turned around her green eyes flashing dawn she replied then she pointed to the redhaired girl next to her and this is my friend dori hey thats amazing my name is dawn too jay joked a lot of the guys laughed but dawn didnt crack a smile nice to meet you dawn she called back to him then she turned back to the front the bus bounced over a hole in the road and we all bounced with it hey look billy mike said suddenly pointing out the window mike hadnt said anything for a long time i leaned toward the window trying to see what he was pointing at i think i saw a prairie cat he said still staring hard huh really i saw a clump of low white trees and a lot of jagged red rocks but i couldnt see any prairie cats it went behind those rocks mike said still pointing then he turned toward me have you seen any towns or anything i shook my head just desert but isnt the camp supposed to be near a town mike looked worried i dont think so i told him my dad told me that camp nightmoon is past the desert way out in the woods mike thought about this for a while frowning well what if we want to call home or something he asked they probably have phones at the camp i told him i glanced up in time to see jay toss something up toward the girls at the front it looked like a green ball it hit dawn on the back of the head and stuck in her blonde hair hey dawn cried out angrily she pulled the sticky green bail from her hair what is this she turned to glare at jay jay giggled his highpitched giggle i dont know i found it stuck under the seat he called to her dawn scowled at him and heaved the green ball back it missed jay and hit the rear window where it stuck with a loud plop everyone laughed dawn and her friend dori made faces at jay colin fiddled with his red bandanna jay slumped down low and raised his knees against the seat in front of him a few rows ahead of me two grinning boys were singing a song we all knew but with really gross words replacing the original words a few other kids began to sing along suddenly without warning the bus squealed to a stop the tires skidding loudly over the road we all cried out in surprise i bounced off my seat and my chest hit the seat in front of me ugh that hurt as i slid back in the seat my heart still pounding the bus driver stood up and turned to us leaning heavily into the aisle ohh several loud gasps filled the small bus as we saw the drivers face his head was enormous and pink topped with a mop of wild bright blue hair that stood straight up he had long pointed ears hid huge red eyeballs bulged out from their dark sockets bouncing in front of his snoutlike nose sharp white fangs drooped from his gaping mouth a green liquid oozed over his heavy black lips as we goggled in silent horror the driver tilted back his monstrous head and uttered an animal roar the driver roared so loud the bus windows rattled several kids shrieked in fright mike and i both ducked down low hiding behind the seat in front of us hes turned into a monster mike whispered his eyes wide with fear then we heard laughter at the front of the bus i raised myself up in time to see the bus driver reach one hand up to his bright blue hair he tugged and his face slid right off ohhh several kids shrieked in horror but we quickly realized that the face dangling from the drivers hand was a mask he had been wearing a rubber monster mask his real face was perfectly normal i saw with relief he had pale skin short thinning black hair and tiny blue eyes he laughed shaking his head enjoying his joke this fools em every time he declared holding up the ugly mask a few kids laughed along with him but most of us were too surprised and confused to think it was funny suddenly his expression changed everybody out he ordered gruffly he pulled a lever and the door slid open with a whoosh where are we someone called out but the driver ignored the question he tossed the mask onto the drivers seat then lowering his head so he wouldnt bump the roof he quickly made his way out the door i leaned across mike and stared out the window but i couldnt see much just mile after mile of flat yellow ground broken occasionally by clumps of reel rock it looked like a desert why are we getting out here mike asked turning to me i could see he was really worried maybe this is the camp i joked mike didnt think that was funny we were all confused as we pushed and shoved our way off the bus mike and i were the last ones off since we were sitting in the back as i stepped onto the hard ground i shielded my eyes against the bright sunlight high in the afternoon sky we were in a flat open area the bus was parked beside a concrete platform about the size of a tennis court it must be some kind of bus station or something i told mike you know a dropoff point he had his hands shoved into the pockets of his shorts he kicked at the dirt but didnt say anything on the other side of the platform jay was in a shoving match with a boy i hadnt met yet colin was leaning against the side of the bus being cool the four girls were standing in a circle near the front of the platform talking quietly about something i watched the driver walk over to the side of the bus and pull open the luggage compartment he began pulling out bags and camp trunks and carrying them to the concrete platform a couple of guys had sat down on the edge of the platform to watch the driver work on the other side of the platform jay and some other guys were having a contest tossing little red pebbles as far as they could mike his hands still buried in his pockets stepped up behind the sweating bus driver hey where are we why are we stopping here mike asked him nervously the driver slid a heavy black trunk from the back of the luggage compartment he completely ignored mikes questions mike asked them again and again the driver pretended mike wasnt there mike made his way back to where i was standing walking slowly dragging his shoes across the hard ground he looked really worried i was confused but i wasnt worried i mean the bus driver was calmly going about his business unloading the bus he knew what he was doing why wont he answer me why wont he tell us anything mike demanded i felt bad that mike was so nervous but i didnt want to hear any more of his questions he was starting to make me nervous too i wandered away from him making my way along the side of the platform to where the four girls were standing across the platform jay and his buddies were still having their stonethrowing contest dawn smiled at me as i came closer then she glanced quickly away shes really pretty i thought her blonde hair gleamed in the bright sunlight are you from center city her friend dori asked squinting at me her freckled face twisted against the sun no i told her im from midlands its north of center city near outreach bay i know where midlands is dori snapped snottily the other three girls laughed i could feel myself blushing whats your name dawn asked staring at me with her green eyes billy i told her my birds name is billy she exclaimed and the girls all laughed again where are you girls going i asked quickly eager to change the subject i mean what camp camp nightmoon theres one for boys and one for girls don answered this is an allcamp nightmoon bus is your camp near ours i asked i didnt even know there was a camp nightmoon for girls dori shrugged we dont know dawn replied this is our first year all of us dori added me too i told them i wonder why we stopped here the girls all shrugged i saw that mike was lingering behind me looking even more scared i turned and made my way back to him look the driver is finished carrying out our stuff he said pointing i turned in time to see the driver slam the luggage compartment door shut whats happening mike cried is someone picking us up here why did he unload all our stuff ill go find out i said quietly i started to jog over to the driver he was standing in front of the open bus door mopping his perspiring forehead with the short sleeve of his tan drivers uniform he saw me coming and quickly climbed into the bus he slid into the drivers seat pulling a green sun visor down over his forehead as i stepped up to the door is someone coming for us i called in to him to my surprise he pulled the lever and the bus door slammed shut in my face the engine started up with a roar and a burst of gray exhaust fumes hey i screamed and pounded angrily on the glass door i had to leap back as the bus squealed away its tires spinning noisily on the hard dirt hey i shouted you dont have to run me over i stared angrily as the bus bounced onto the road and roared away then i turned back to mike he was standing beside the four girls they were all looking upset now he he left mike stammered as i approached them he just left us here in the middle of nowhere we gazed down the road at the bus until it disappeared over the darkening horizon we all grew very quiet a few seconds later we heard the frightening animal cries very close and getting closer whwhats that mike stammered we turned in the direction of the shrill cries they seemed to be coming from across the platform at first i thought that jay and colin and their friends were playing a joke on us making the animal cries to frighten us but then i saw the scared wideeyed expressions on their faces jay colin and the others had frozen in place they werent making the noises the cries grew louder closer shrill warnings and then staring into the distance beyond the platform i saw them small dark creatures keeping low rolling rapidly along the flat ground tossing their heads back and uttering excited shrieks as they came toward us what are they mike cried moving close to me are they prairie wolves don asked in a trembling voice i hope not one of the other girls called out we all climbed onto the concrete platform and were huddled behind our trunks and bags the animal cries grew louder as the creatures drew near i could see dozens of them they scurried toward us over the flat ground as if being blown by the wind help somebody help us i heard mike scream next to me jay still had two of the red rocks from his rockthrowing competition in his hand pick up rocks he was shouting frantically maybe we can scare them away the creatures stopped a few yards from the concrete platform and raised themselves up menacingly on their hind feet huddled between mike and jay i could see them clearly now they were wolves or wildcats of some sort standing upright they were nearly three feet tall they had slender almost scrawny bodies covered with spotty redbrown fur their paws had long silvery nails growing out of them their heads were nearly as slender as their bodies tiny red weasel eyes stared hungrily at us their long mouths snapped open and shut revealing double rows of silvery daggerlike teeth no no help mike dropped to his knees his entire body convulsed in a shudder of terror some of the kids were crying others gaped at the advancing creatures in stunned silence i was too scared to cry out or move or do anything i stared at the row of creatures my heart thudding my mouth as dry as cotton the creatures grew silent standing a few feet from the platform they eyed us snapping their jaws loudly hungrily white froth began to drip from their mouths they theyre going to attack a boy yelled they look hungry i heard one of the girls say the white froth poured thickly over their pointed teeth they continued to snap their jaws it sounded like a dozen steel traps being snapped shut suddenly one of them leapt onto the edge of the platform no several kids cried out in unison we huddled closer together trying to stay behind the pile of trunks and bags another creature climbed onto the platform then three more i took a step back i saw jay pull back his arm and heave a red rock at one of the frothing creatures the rock hit the platform with a crack and bounced away the creatures were not frightened they arched their backs preparing to attack they began to make a highpitched chattering sound and moved nearer nearer jay threw another rock this one hit one of the advancing creatures on the side it uttered a shrill eek of surprise but it kept moving steadily forward its red eyes trained on jay its jaws snapping hungrily go away dori cried in a trembling voice go home go away go away but her shouts had no effect the creatures advanced run i urged run we cant outrun them someone shouted the shrill cluttering grew louder deafening until it seemed as if we were surrounded by a wall of sound the ugly creatures lowered themselves to pounce run i repeated come on run my legs wouldnt cooperate they felt rubbery and weak trying to back away from the attacking creatures i toppled over backwards off the platform i saw flashing stars as the back of my head hit the hard ground theyre going to get me i realized i cant get away i heard the sirenlike attack cry i heard the scrape of the creatures long toenails over the concrete platform i heard the screams and cries of the frightened campers then as i struggled frantically to pull myself up i heard the deafening roar at first i thought it was an explosion i thought the platform had blown up but then i turned and saw the rifle another explosion of gunfire white smoke filled the air the creatures spun around and darted away silent now their scraggly fur scraping the ground as they kept low their tails between their furry legs haha look at em run the man kept the rifle poised on his shoulder as he watched the creatures retreat behind him stood a long green bus i pulled myself up and brushed myself off everyone was laughing now jumping up and down joyfully celebrating the narrow escape i was still too shaken up to celebrate theyre running like jackrabbits the man declared in a booming voice he lowered the rifle it took me a while to realize tie had come out of the camp bus to rescue us we didnt hear or see the bus pull up because of the attack cries of the animals are you okay mike i asked walking over to my frightenedlooking new friend i guess he replied uncertainly i guess im okay now dawn slapped me on the back grinning were okay she cried were all okay we gathered in front of the man with the rifle he was big and redfaced mostly bald except for a fringe of curly yellow hair around his head he had a blond mustache under an enormous beak of a nose and tiny black bird eyes beneath bushy blond eyebrows hi guys im uncle al im your friendly camp director i hope you enjoyed that welcome to camp nightmoon he boomed in a deep voice i heard muttered replies he leaned the rifle against the bus and took a few steps toward us studying our faces he was wearing white shorts and a bright green camp tshirt that stretched over his big belly two young guys also in green and white stepped out of the bus serious expressions on their faces lets load up uncle al instructed them in his deep voice he didnt apologize for being late he didnt explain about the weird animals and he didnt ask if we were okay after that scare the two counselors began dragging the camp trunks and shoving them into the luggage compartment on the bus looks like a good group this year uncle al shouted well drop you girls off first across the river then well get you boys settled in what were those awful animals dori called to uncle al he didnt seem to hear her we began climbing onto the bus i looked for mike and found him near the end of the line his face was pale and he still looked really shaken i i was really scared he admitted but were okay i reassured him now we can relax and have fun im so hungry mike complained i havent eaten all day one of the counselors overheard him you wont be hungry when you taste the camp food he told mike we piled into the bus i sat next to mike i could hear the poor guys stomach growling i suddenly realized i was starving too and i was really eager to see what camp nightmoon looked like i hoped it wouldnt be a long bus ride to get there how far away is our camp i called to uncle al who had slid into the drivers seat he didnt seem to hear me hey mike were on our way i said happily as the bus pulled onto the road mike forced a smile im so glad to get away from there to my surprise the bus ride took less than five minutes we all muttered our shock at what a short trip it was why hadnt the first bus taken us all the way a big wooden sign proclaiming camp nightmoon came into view and uncle al turned the bus onto a gravel road that led through a patch of short trees into the camp we followed the narrow winding road across a small brown river several small cabins came into view girls camp uncle al announced the bus stopped to let the four girls off dawn waved to me as she climbed down a few minutes later we pulled into the boys camp through the bus window i could see a row of small white cabins on top of a gently sloping hill stood a large whiteshingled building probably a meeting lodge or mess hall at the edge of a field three counselors all dressed in white shorts and green tshirts were working to start a fire in a large stone barbecue pit hey were going to have a cookout i exclaimed to mike i was starting to feel really excited mike smiled too he was practically drooling at the thought of food the bus came to an abrupt stop at the end of the row of small bunks uncle al pulled himself up quickly from the drivers seat and turned to us welcome to beautiful camp nightmoon he bellowed step down and line up for your bunk assignments once you get unpacked and have dinner ill see you at the campfire we pushed our way noisily out of the bus i saw jay enthusiastically slapping another boy on the back i think we were all feeling a lot better forgetting about our close call i stepped down and took a deep breath the cool air smelled really sweet and fresh i saw a long row of short evergreen trees behind the white lodge on the hill as i took my place in line i searched for the waterfront i could hear the soft rush of the river behind a thick row of evergreens but i couldnt see it mike jay colin and i were assigned to the same bunk it was bunk i thought the bunk should have a more interesting name but it just had a number bunk it was really small with a low ceiling and windows on two sides it was just big enough for six campers there were bunk beds against three walls and tall shelves on the fourth wall with a little square of space in the middle there was no bathroom i guessed it was in another building as the four of us entered the bunk we saw that one of the beds had already been claimed it had been carefully made the green blanket tucked in neatly some sports magazines and a tape player resting on top that must belong to our counselor jay said inspecting the tape player hope we dont have to wear those ugly green tshirts colin said grinning he was still wearing his silver sunglasses even though the sun was nearly down and it was just about as dark as night in the cabin jay claimed a top bunk and colin took the bed beneath his can i have a lower one mike asked me i roll around a lot at night im afraid i might fall out of a top one yeah sure no problem i replied i wanted the top bunk anyway it would be a lot more fun hope you guys dont snore colin said were not going to sleep in here anyway jay said were going to party all night he playfully slapped mike on the back so hard that mike went sprawling into the dresser hey mike whined that hurt sorry guess i dont know my own strength jay replied grinning at colin the cabin door opened and a redheaded guy with dark freckles all over his face walked in carrying a big gray plastic bag he was tall and very skinny and was wearing white shorts and a green camp tshirt hey guys he said and dropped the large bag on the cabin floor with a groan he checked us out then pointed to the bag theres your bed stuff he said make your beds try to make them as neat as mine he pointed to the bunk against the window with the tape player on it are you our counselor i asked he nodded yeah im the lucky one he turned and started to walk out whats your name jay called after him larry he said pushing open the cabin door your trunks will be here in a few minutes he told us you can fight it out over drawer space two of the drawers are stuck shut he started out the door then turned back to us keep away from my stuff the door slammed hard behind him peering out the window i watched him lope away taking long fast strides bobbing his head as he walked great guy colin muttered sarcastically real friendly jay added shaking his head then we dived into the plastic bag and pulled out sheets and wool blankets jay and colin got into a wrestling match over a blanket they claimed was softer than the others i tossed a sheet onto my mattress and started to climb up to tuck it in i was halfway up the ladder when i heard mike scream mike was right beneath me making his bed he screamed so loud i cried out and nearly fell off the ladder i leapt off the ladder my heart pounding and stepped beside him staring straight ahead his mouth wide open in horror mike backed away from his bed mike whats wrong i asked what is it ssnakes mike stammered staring straight ahead at his unmade bed as he backed away huh i followed his gaze it was too dark to see anything colin laughed not that old joke he cried larry put rubber snakes in your bed jay said grinning as he stepped up beside us theyre not rubber theyre real mike insisted his voice trembling jay laughed and shook his head i cant believe you fell for that old gag he took a few steps toward the bed then stopped hey i moved close and the two snakes came into focus raising themselves from the shadows they arched their slender heads pulling back as if preparing to attack theyre real jay cried turning back to colin two of them probably not poisonous colin said venturing closer the two let out angry hisses raising themselves high off the bed they were very long and skinny their heads were wider than their bodies their tongues flicked from side to side as they arched themselves menacingly im scared of snakes mike uttered in a soft voice theyre probably scared of you jay joked slapping mike on the back mike winced he was in no mood for jays horseplay weve got to get larry or somebody mike said no way jay insisted you can handle em mike theres only two of them jay gave mike a playful shove toward the bed he only meant to give him a scare but mike stumbled and fell onto the bed the snakes darted in unison i saw one of them clamp its teeth into mikes hand mike raised himself to his feet he didnt react at first then he uttered a highpitched shriek two drops of blood appeared on the back of his right hand he stared down at them then grabbed the hand it bit me he shrieked oh no i cried did it puncture the skin colin asked is it bleeding jay rushed forward and grabbed mikes shoulder hey man im really sorry he said i didnt mean to mike groaned in pain it really hurts he whispered he was breathing really hard his chest heaving making weird noises as he breathed the snakes coiled in the middle of his lower bunk began to hiss again youd better hurry to the nurse jay said his hand still on mikes shoulder ill come with you nno mike stammered his face was as pale as a ghost he held his hand tightly ill go find her he burst out of the cabin running at full speed the door slammed behind him hey i didnt mean to push him you know jay explained to us i could see he was really upset i was just joking just trying to scare him a little i didnt mean for him to fall or anything his voice trailed off what are we going to do about them i asked pointing at the two coiled snakes ill get larry colin offered he started toward the door no wait i called him back book theyre sitting on mikes sheet right jay and colin followed my gaze to the bed the snakes arched themselves high preparing to bite again so jay asked scratching his disheveled hair so we can wrap them up in the sheet and carry them outside i said jay stared at me wish id thought of that lets do it man youll get bit colin warned i stared at the snakes they seemed to be studying me too they cant bite us through the sheet i said they can try colin exclaimed hanging back if were fast enough i said taking a cautious step toward the bed we can wrap them up before they know whats happening the snakes hissed out a warning drawing themselves higher how did they get in here anyway colin asked maybe the camp is crawling with snakes jay said grinning maybe youve got some in your bed too colin he laughed lets get serious here i said sternly my eyes locked on the coiled snakes are we going to try this or not yeah lets do it jay answered i mean i owe it to mike colin remained silent ill bet i could grab one by the tail and swing him out through the window jay said you could grab the tail end of the other one and lets try my plan first i suggested quietly we crept over to the snakes sneaking up on them it was kind of silly since they were staring right at us i pointed to one end of the sheet which was folded up onto the bed grab it there i instructed jay then pull it up he hesitated what if i miss or you miss then were in trouble i replied grimly my eyes on the snakes i reached my hand forward to the other corner of the sheet ready on three i whispered my heart was in my mouth i could barely choke out one two three at the count of three we both grabbed for the ends of the sheet pull i cried in a shrill voice i couldnt believe was coming from me we pulled up the sheet and brought the ends together making a bundle at the bottom of the bundle the snakes wriggled frantically i heard their jaws snap they wriggled so hard the bottom of the bundle swung back and forth they dont like this jay said as we hurried to the door carrying our wriggling swaying bundle between us trying to keep our bodies as far away from it as possible i pushed open the door with my shoulder and we ran out onto the grass now what jay asked keep going i replied i could see one of the snakes poking its head out hurry we ran past the cabins toward a small clump of shrubs beyond the shrubs stood a patch of low trees when we reached the trees we swung the bundle back then heaved the whole sheet into the trees it opened as it fell to the ground the two snakes slithered out instantly and pulled themselves to shelter under the trees jay and i let out loud sighs of relief we stood there for a moment hunched over hands on our knees trying to catch our breath crouching down i looked for the snakes but they had slithered deep into the safety of the evergreens i stood up i guess we should take back mikes sheet i said he probably wont want to sleep on it jay said but he reached down and pulled it up from the grass he balled it up and tossed it to me its probably dripping with snake venom he said making a disgusted face when we got back to the cabin colin had made his bed and was busily unpacking the contents of his trunk shoving everything into the top dresser drawer he turned as we entered howd it go he asked casually horrible jay replied quickly his expression grim we both got bit twice youre a terrible liar colin told him laughing you shouldnt even try jay laughed too colin turned to me youre a hero he said thanks for all your help jay told him sarcastically colin started to reply but the cabin door opened and larry poked his freckled face in hows it going he asked youre not finished yet we had a little problem jay told him wheres the fourth guy the chubby one larry asked lowering his head so he wouldnt bump it on the doorframe as he stepped inside mike got bit by a snake i told him there were two snakes in his bed jay added larrys expression didnt change he didnt seem at all surprised so where did mike go he asked casually swatting a mosquito on his arm his hand was bleeding he went to the nurse to get it taken care of i told him huh larrys mouth dropped open he went to find the nurse i repeated larry tossed back his head and started to laugh nurse he cried laughing hard what nurse the door opened and mike returned still holding his wounded hand his face was pale his expression frightened they said there was no nurse he told me then he saw larry perched on top of his bunk larry my hand mike said he held the hand up so the counselor could see it it was stained with bright red blood larry lowered himself to the floor i think i have some bandages he told mike he pulled out a slender black case from beneath his bunk and began to search through it mike stood beside him holding up his hand drops of blood splashed on the cabin floor they said the camp doesnt have a nurse mike repeated larry shook his head if you get hurt in this camp he told mike seriously youre on your own i think my hand is swelling a little mike said larry handed him a roll of bandages the washroom is at the end of this row of cabins he told mike closing the case and shoving it back under the bed go wash the hand and bandage it hurry its almost dinnertime holding the bandages tightly in his good hand mike hurried off to follow larrys instructions by the way howd you guys get the snakes out of here larry asked glancing around the cabin we carried them out in mikes sheet jay told him he pointed at me it was billys idea larry stared hard at me hey im impressed billy he said that was pretty brave man maybe i inherited something from my parents i told him theyre scientists explorers kind of they go off for months at a time exploring the wildest places well camp nightmoon is pretty wild larry said and you guys had better be careful im warning you his expression turned serious theres no nurse at camp nightmoon uncle al doesnt believe in coddling you guys the hot dogs were all charred black but we were so hungry we didnt care i shoved three of them down in less than five minutes i dont think id ever been so hungry in all my life the campfire was in a flat clearing surrounded by a circle of round white stones behind us the large whiteshingled lodge loomed over the sloping hill ahead of us a thick line of evergreen trees formed a fence that hid the river from view through a small gap in the trees i could see a flickering campfire in the distance on the other side of the river i wondered if that was the campfire of the girls camp i thought about dawn and dori i wondered if the two camps ever got together if id ever see them again dinner around the big campfire seemed to put everyone in a good mood jay was the only one sitting near me who complained about the hot dogs being burned but i think he put away four or five of them anyway mike had trouble eating because of his bandaged hand when he dropped his first hot dog i thought he was going to burst into tears by the end of dinner he was in a much better mood his wounded hand had swelled up just a little but he said it didnt hurt as much as before the counselors were easy to spot they all wore identical white shorts and green tshirts there were eight or ten of them all young guys probably sixteen or seventeen they ate together quietly away from us campers i kept looking at larry but he never once turned around to look at any of us i was thinking about larry trying to figure out if he was shy or if he just didnt like us campers very much suddenly uncle al climbed to his feet and motioned with both hands for us all to be quiet i want to welcome you boys to camp nightmoon he began i hope youre all unpacked and comfortable in your bunks i know that most of you are firsttime campers he was speaking quickly without any pauses between sentences as if he was running through this for the thousandth time and wanted to get it over with id like to tell you some of our basic rules he continued first lights out is at nine sharp a lot of guys groaned you might think you can ignore this rule uncle al continued paying no attention to their reaction you might think you can sneak out of your cabins to meet or take a walk by the river but im warning you now that we dont allow it and we have very good ways of making sure this rule is obeyed he paused to clear his throat some boys were giggling about something across from me jay burped loudly which caused more giggles uncle al didnt seem to hear any of this on the other side of the river is the girls camp he continued loudly motioning to the trees you might be able to see their campfire well i want to make it clear that swimming or rowing over to the girls camp is strictly forbidden several boys groaned loudly this made everyone laugh even some of the counselors laughed uncle al remained grimfaced the woods around camp nightmoon are filled with grizzlies and tree bears uncle al continued they come to the river to bathe and to drink and theyre usually hungry this caused another big reaction from all of us sitting around the fading campfire someone made a loud growling sound another kid screamed then everyone laughed you wont be laughing if a bear claws your head off uncle al said sternly he turned to the group of counselors outside our circle larry kurt come over here he ordered the two counselors climbed obediently to their feet and made their way to the center of the circle beside uncle al i want you two to demonstrate to the new campers the procedure to follow when er i mean if you are attacked by a grizzly bear immediately the two counselors dropped to the ground on their stomachs they lay flat and covered the backs of their heads with their hands thats right i hope youre all paying close attention the camp director thundered at us cover your neck and head try your best not to move he motioned to the two counselors thanks guys you can get up have there ever been any bear attacks here i called out cupping my hands so uncle al could hear me he turned in my direction two last summer he replied several boys gasped it wasnt pretty uncle al continued its hard to remain still when a huge bear is pawing you and drooling all over you but if you move his voice trailed off leaving the rest to our imaginations i guess i felt a cold shiver run down my back i didnt want to think about bears and bear attacks what kind of camp did mom and dad send me to i found myself wondering i couldnt wait to call them and tell them about all that had happened already uncle al waited for everyone to get silent then pointed off to the side do you see that cabin over there he asked in the dim evening light i could make out a cabin standing halfway up the hill toward the lodge it appeared a little larger than the other cabins it seemed to be built on a slant sort of tipping on its side as if the wind had tried to blow it over i want you to make sure you see that cabin uncle al warned his voice thundering out above the crackling of the purple fire that is known as the forbidden bunk we dont talk about that bunk and we dont go near it i felt another cold shiver as i stared through the gray evening light at the shadowy tilted cabin i felt a sharp sting on the back of my neck and slapped a mosquito too late to keep it from biting me im going to repeat what i just said uncle al shouted still pointing to the dark cabin on the hill that is known as the forbidden bunk it has been closed and boarded up for many years no one is to go near that cabin no one this started everyone talking and laughing nervous laughter i think why is the forbidden bunk forbidden someone called out we never talk about it uncle al replied sharply jay leaned over and whispered in my ear lets go check it out i laughed then i turned back to jay uncertainly youre kidding right he grinned in reply and didnt say anything i turned back toward the fire uncle al was wishing us all a good stay and saying how much he was looking forward to camp this year and one more rule w he called out you must write to your parents every day every day we want them to know what a great time youre having at camp nightmoon i saw mike holding his wounded hand gingerly its starting to throb he told me sounding very frightened maybe larry has something to put on it i said lets go ask him uncle al dismissed us we all climbed to our feet stretching and yawning and started to make our way in small groups back to the bunks mike and i lingered behind hoping to talk to larry we saw him talking to the other counselors he was at least a head taller than all of them hey larry mike called but by the time we pushed our way through the groups of kids heading the other way larry had disappeared maybe hes going to our bunk to make sure we obey lights out i suggested lets go see mike replied anxiously we walked quickly past the dying campfire it had stopped crackling but still glowed a deep purplered then we headed along the curve of the hill toward bunk my hand really hurts mike groaned holding it tenderly in front of him im not just complaining its throbbing and its swelling up and im starting to have chills larry will know what to do i replied trying to sound reassuring i hope so mike said shakily we both stopped when we heard the howls hideous howls like an animal in pain but too human to be from an animal long shrill howls that cut through the air and echoed down the hill mike uttered a quiet gasp he turned to me even in the darkness i could see the fright on his face those cries he whispered theyre coming from the forbidden bunk a few minutes later mike and i trudged into the cabin jay and colin were sitting tensely on their beds wheres larry mike asked fear creeping into his voice not here colin replied where is he mike demanded shrilly ive got to find him my hand he should be here soon jay offered i could still hear the strange howls through the open window do you hear that i asked walking over to the window and listening hard probably a prairie cat colin said prairie cats dont howl mike told him prairie cats screech but they dont howl how do you know colin asked walking over to larrys bunk and sitting down on the bottom bed we studied them in school mike replied another howl made us all stop and listen it sounds like a man jay offered his eyes lighting up excitedly a man whos been locked up in the forbidden bunk for years and years mike swallowed hard do you really think so jay and colin laughed what should i do about my hand mike asked holding it up it was definitely swollen go wash it again i told him and put a fresh bandage on it i peered out the window into the darkness maybe larry will show up soon he probably knows where to get something to put on it i cant believe theres no nurse mike whined why would my parents send me to a camp where theres no nurse or infirmary or anything uncle al doesnt like to coddle us colin said repeating larrys words jay stood up and broke into an imitation of uncle al stay away from the forbidden bunk he cried in a booming deep voice he sounded a lot like him we dont talk about it and we dont ever go near it we all laughed at jays impression even mike we should go there tonight colin said enthusiastically we should check it out immediately we heard another long sorrowful howl roll down the hill from the direction of the forbidden bunk i i dont think we should mike said softly examining his hand he started to the door im going to go wash this the door slammed behind him hes scared jay scoffed im a little scared too i admitted i mean those awful howls jay and colin both laughed every camp has something like the forbidden bunk the camp director makes it up colin said yeah jay agreed camp directors love scaring kids its the only fun they have he puffed out his chest and imitated uncle al again dont go out after lights out or youll never be seen again he thundered then burst out laughing theres nothing in that forbidden bunk colin said shaking his head its probably completely empty its all just a joke you know like camp ghost stories every camp has its own ghost story how do you know i asked dropping down onto mikes bed have you been to camp before no colin replied but i have friends who told me about their camp he reached up and pulled off his silver sunglasses for the first time he had bright skyblue eyes like big blue marbles we suddenly heard the sound of a bugle repeating a slow sadsounding tune that must be the signal for lights out i said yawning i started to pull off my shoes i was too tired to change or wash up i planned to sleep in my clothes lets sneak out and explore the forbidden bunk jay urged come on we can be the first ones to do it i yawned again im really too tired i told them me too colin said he turned to jay how about tomorrow night jays face fell in disappointment tomorrow colin insisted kicking his shoes into the comer and starting to pull off his socks i wouldnt do it if i were you the voice startled all three of us we turned to the window where larrys head suddenly appeared from out of the darkness he grinned in at us id listen to uncle al if i were you he said how long had he been out there listening to us i wondered was he deliberately spying on us the door opened larry lowered his head as he loped in his grin had faded uncle al wasnt kidding around he said seriously yeah sure colin replied sarcastically he climbed up to his bed and slid beneath the wool blanket i guess the camp ghost will get us if we go out after lights out jay joked tossing a towel across the room no no ghost larry said softly but sabre will he pulled out his drawer and began searching for something inside it huh whos sabre i asked suddenly wide awake sabre is an it larry answered mysteriously sabre is a redeyed monster who eats a camper every night colin sneered he stared down at me there is no sabre larrys just giving us another phony camp story larry stopped searching his drawer and gazed up at colin no im not he insisted in a low voice im trying to save you guys some trouble im not trying to scare you then what is sabre i asked impatiently larry pulled a sweater from the drawer then pushed the drawer shut you dont want to find out he replied come on tell us what it is i begged he isnt going to colin said ill tell you guys only one thing sabre will rip your heart out larry said flatly jay snickered yeah sure im serious larry snapped im not kidding you guys he pulled the sweater over his head you dont believe me go out one night go out and meet sabre he struggled to get his arm into the sweater sleeve but before you do he warned leave me a note with your address so ill know where to send your stuff we had fun the next morning we all woke up really early the sun was just rising over the horizon to the south and the air was still cool and damp i could hear birds chirping the sound reminded me of home as i lowered myself to the floor and stretched i thought of my mom and dad and wished i could call them and tell them about the camp but it was only the second day id be too embarrassed to call them on the second day i was definitely homesick but luckily there wasnt any time to feel sad after we pulled on fresh clothes we hurried up to the lodge on the hill which served as a meeting hall theater and mess hall long tables and benches were set up in straight rows in the center of the enormous room the floorboards and walls were all dark redwood redwood ceiling beams crisscrossed high above our heads there were no windows so it felt as if we were in an enormous dark cave the clatter of dishes and cups and silverware was deafening our shouts and laughter rang off the high ceiling echoed off the hardwood walls mike shouted something to me from across the table but i couldnt hear him because of the racket some guys complained about the food but i thought it was okay we had scrambled egg squares bacon strips fried potatoes and toast with tall cups of juice i never eat a breakfast that big at home but i found that i was really starved and i gobbled it up after breakfast we lined up outside the lodge to form different activity groups the sun had climbed high in the sky it was going to be really hot our excited voices echoed off the sloping hill we were all laughing and talking feeling good larry and two other counselors clipboards in hand stood in front of us shielding their eyes from the bright sun as they divided us into groups the first group of about ten boys headed off to the river for a morning swim some people have all the luck i thought i was eager to get to the waterfront and see what the river was like as i waited for my name to be called i spotted a pay phone on the wall of the lodge my parents flashed into my mind again maybe i will call them later i decided i was so eager to describe the camp to them and tell them about my new friends okay guys follow me to the ball field larry instructed us were going to play our first game of scratchball about twelve of us including everyone from my bunk followed larry down the hill toward the flat grassy area that formed the playing field i jogged to catch up to larry who always seemed to walk at top speed stretching out his long legs as if he were in a terrible hurry are we going to swim after this i asked without slowing his pace he glanced at his clipboard yeah i guess he replied you guysll need a swim were going to work up a sweat you ever play scratchball before jay asked me as we hurried to keep up with larry yeah sure i replied we play it a lot in school larry stopped at the far corner of the wide green field where the bases and batters square had already been set up he made us line up and divided us into two teams scratchball is an easy game to learn the batter throws the ball in the air as high and as far as he can then he has to run the bases before someone on the other team catches the ball tags him with it or throws him out larry started calling out names dividing us into teams but when he called out mikes name mike stepped up to larry holding his bandaged hand tenderly i i dont think i can play larry mike stammered come on mike dont whine larry snapped but it really hurts mike insisted its throbbing like crazy larry the pain is shooting all the way up and down my side and look he raised the hand to larrys face its all swelled up larry pushed the arm away gently with his clipboard go sit in the shade he told mike shouldnt i get some medicine or something to put on it mike asked shrilly i could see the poor guy was really in bad shape just sit over there by that tree larry ordered pointing to a clump of short leafy trees at the edge of the field well talk about it later larry turned away from mike and blew a whistle to start the game ill take mikes place on the blue team he announced jogging onto the field i forgot about mike as soon as the game got underway we were having a lot of fun most of the guys were pretty good scratchball players and we played much faster than my friends do back home at the playground my first time up at the batters square i heaved the ball really high but it dropped right into a fielders hands and i was out my second time up i made it to three bases before i was tagged out larry was a great player when he came up to the batters square he tossed the ball harder than i ever saw anyone toss it it sailed over the fielders heads and as they chased after it larry rounded all the bases his long legs stretching out gracefully as he ran by the fourth inning our team the blue team was ahead twelve to six we had all played hard and were really hot and sweaty i was looking forward to that swim at the waterfront colin was on the red team i noticed that he was the only player who wasnt enjoying the game he had been tagged out twice and hed missed an easy catch in the field i realized that colin wasnt very athletic he had long skinny arms without any muscles arid he also ran awkwardly in the third inning colin got into an argument with a player on my team about whether a toss had been foul or not a few minutes later colin argued angrily with larry about a ball that he claimed should have been out he and larry shouted at each other for a few minutes it was no big deal a typical sports argument larry finally ordered colin to shut up and get back to the outfield colin grudgingly obeyed and the game continued i didnt think about it again i mean that kind of arguing happens all the time in ball games and there are guys who enjoy the arguments as much as the game but then in the next inning something strange happened that gave me a really bad feeling and made me stop and wonder just what was going on colins team came to bat colin stepped up to the batters square and prepared to toss the ball larry was playing the outfield i was standing nearby also in the field colin tossed the ball high but not very far larry and i both came running in to get it larry got there first he picked up the small hard ball on the first bounce drew back his arm and then i saw his expression change i saw his features tighten in anger i saw his eyes narrow his coppercolored eyebrows lower in concentration with a loud grunt of effort larry heaved the ball as hard as he could it struck colin in the back of the head making a loud crack sound as it hit colins silver sunglasses went flying in the air colin stopped short and uttered a short highpitched cry his arms flew up as if hed been shot then his knees buckled he collapsed in a heap facedown on the grass he didnt move the ball rolled away over the grass i cried out in shock then i saw larrys expression change again his eyes opened wide in disbelief his mouth dropped open in horror no he cried it slipped i didnt mean to throw it at him i knew larry was lying i had seen the anger on his face before he threw the ball i sank down to my knees on the ground as larry went running toward colin i felt dizzy and upset and confused i had this sick feeling in my stomach the ball slipped larry was yelling it just slipped liar i thought liar liar liar i forced myself up on my feet and hurried to join the circle of guys around colin when i got there larry was kneeling over colin raising colins head off the ground gently with both hands colins eyes were open wide he stared up at larry groggily and uttered low moans give him room larry was shouting give him room he gazed down at colin the ball slipped im real sorry the ball slipped colin moaned his eyes rolled around in his head larry pulled off colins red bandanna and mopped colins forehead with it colin moaned again his eyes closed help me carry him to the lodge larry instructed two guys from the red team the rest of you guys get changed for your swim the waterfront counselor will be waiting for you i watched as larry and the two guys hoisted colin up and started to carry him toward the lodge larry gripped him under the shoulders the two boys awkwardly took hold of his legs the sick feeling in my stomach hadnt gone away i kept picturing the intense expression of anger on larrys face as he heaved the ball at the back of colins head i knew it had been deliberate i started to follow them i dont know why i guess i was so upset i wasnt thinking clearly they were nearly to the bottom of the hill when i saw mike catch up to them he ran alongside larry holding his swollen hand can i come too mike pleaded someone has to look at my hand its really bad larry please can i come too yeah youd better i heard larry reply curtly good i thought finally someone was going to pay some attention to mikes snakebite wound ignoring the sweat pouring down my forehead i watched them make their way up the hill to the lodge this shouldnt have happened i thought suddenly feeling a chill despite the hot sun something is wrong something is terribly wrong here how was i to know that the horrors were just beginning later that afternoon jay and i were writing our letters to our parents i was feeling pretty upset about things i kept seeing the angry expression on larrys face as he heaved the ball at the back of colins head i wrote about it in my letter and i also told my mom and dad about how there was no nurse here and about the forbidden bunk jay stopped writing and looked up at me from his bunk he was really sunburned his cheeks and forehead were bright red he scratched his red hair were dropping like flies he said gesturing around the nearly empty cabin yeah i agreed wistfully i hope colin and mike are okay and then i blurted out larry deliberately hit colin huh jay stopped scratching his hair and lowered his hand to the bunk he what he deliberately threw at colins head i saw him i said my voice shaky i wasnt going to tell anyone but now i was glad i did it made me feel a little bit better to get it out but then i saw that jay didnt believe me thats impossible he said quietly larrys our counselor his hand slipped thats all i started to argue when the cabin door opened and colin entered with larry at his side colin how are you i cried jay and i both jumped up not bad colin replied he forced a thin smile i couldnt see his eyes they were hidden once again behind his silver sunglasses hes still a little wobbly but hes okay larry said cheerfully holding colins arm im sort of seeing double colin admitted i mean this cabin looks really crowded to me there are two of each of you jay and i uttered short uncomfortable laughs larry helped colin over to the lower bunk where jay had been sitting hell be just fine in a day or two larry told us yeah the headache is a little better already colin said gently rubbing the back of his head then lying down on top of the bedcovers did you see a doctor i asked huhuh just uncle al colin replied he looked it over and said id be fine i cast a suspicious glance at larry but he turned his back on us and crouched down to search for something in the duffel bag he kept under his bed wheres mike is he okay jay asked larry uhhuh larry answered without turning around hes fine but where is he i demanded larry shrugged still at the lodge i guess i dont really know but is he coming back i insisted larry shoved the bag under his bed and stood up have you guys finished your letters he asked hurry and get changed for dinner you can mail your letters at the lodge he started to the door hey dont forget tonight is tent night you guys are sleeping in a tent tonight we all groaned but larry its too cold out jay protested larry ignored him and turned away hey larry do you have anything i can put on this sunburn jay called after him no larry replied and disappeared out the door jay and i helped colin up to the lodge he was still seeing double and his headache was pretty bad the three of us sat at the end of the long table nearest the window a strong breeze blew cool air over the table which felt good on our sunburned skin we had some kind of meat with potatoes and gravy for dinner it wasnt great but i was so hungry it didnt matter colin didnt have much appetite he picked at the edges of his gray meat the mess hall was as noisy as ever kids were laughing and shouting to mends across the long tables at one table the guys were throwing breadsticks back and forth like javelins as usual the counselors dressed in their green and white ate together at a table in the far corner and ignored us campers completely the rumor spread that we were going to learn all of the camp songs after dinner guys were groaning and complaining about that about halfway through dinner jay and the boy across the table a kid named roger started horsing around trying to wrestle a breadstick from each other jay pulled hard and won the breadstick and spilled his entire cup of grape juice on my tan shorts hey i jumped up angrily staring down as the purple stain spread across the front of my shorts billy had an accident roger cried out and everyone laughed yeah he purpled in his pants jay added everyone thought that was hilarious someone threw a breadstick at me it bounced off my chest and landed on my dinner plate more laughter the food fight lasted only a few minutes then two of the counselors broke it up i decided id better run back to the bunk and change my shorts as i hurried out i could hear jay and roger calling out jokes about me i ran fullspeed down the hill toward the bunks i wanted to get back up to the mess hall in time for dessert pushing open the bunk door with my shoulder i darted across the small room to the dresser and pulled open my drawer huh to my surprise i stared into an empty drawer it had been completely cleaned out whats going on here i asked aloud wheres my stuff confused i took a step back and realized i had opened the wrong drawer this wasnt my drawer it was mikes i stared for a long while into the empty drawer mikes clothes had all been removed i turned and looked for his trunk which had been stacked on its side behind our bunk mikes trunk was gone too mike wasnt coming back i was so upset i ran back to the mess hall without changing my shorts panting loudly i made my way to the counselors table and came up behind larry he was talking to the counselor next to him a fat guy with long scraggly blond hair larry mikes gone i cried breathlessly larry didnt turn around he kept talking to the other counselor as if i werent there i grabbed larrys shoulder larry listen i cried mike hes gone larry turned around slowly his expression annoyed go back to your table billy he snapped this table is for counselors only but what about mike i insisted shrilly his stuff is gone what happened to him is he okay how should i know larry replied impatiently did they send him home i asked refusing to back away until i had some kind of an answer yeah maybe larry shrugged and lowered his gaze you spilled something on your shorts my heart was pounding so hard i could feel the blood pulsing at my temples you really dont know what happened to mike i asked feeling defeated larry shook his head im sure hes fine he replied turning back to his pals he probably went for a swim the scragglyhaired guy next to him snickered larry and some of the other counselors laughed too i didnt think it was funny i felt pretty sick and a little frightened dont the counselors at this camp care what happens to us i asked myself glumly i made my way back to the table they were passing out chocolate pudding for dessert but i wasnt hungry i told colin and jay and roger about mikes dresser drawer being cleaned out and about how larry pretended he didnt know anything about it they didnt get as upset about it as i was uncle al probably had to send mike home because of his hand colin said quietly spooning up his pudding it was pretty swollen but why wouldnt larry tell me the truth i asked my stomach still feeling as if i had eaten a giant rock for dinner why did he say he didnt know what happened to mike counselors dont like to talk about bad stuff jay said slapping the top of his pudding with his spoon it might give us poor little kids nightmares he filled his spoon with pudding tilted it back and flung a dark gob of pudding onto rogers forehead jay youre dead meat now roger cried plunging his spoon into the chocolate goo he shot a gob of it onto the front of jays sleeveless tshirt that started a pudding war that spread down the long table there was no more talk about mike after dinner uncle al talked about tent night and what a great time we were going to have sleeping in tents tonight just be very quiet so the bears cant find you he joked some joke then he and the counselors taught us the camp songs uncle al made us sing them over and over until we learned them i didnt feel much like singing but jay and roger began making up really gross words to the songs and pretty soon a whole bunch of us joined in singing our own versions of the songs as loudly as we could later we were all making our way down the hill toward our tents it was a cool clear night a wash of pale stars covered the purpleblack sky i helped colin down the hill he was still seeing double and feeling a little weak jay and roger walked a few steps ahead of us shoving each other with their shoulders first to the left then to the right suddenly jay turned back to colin and me tonights the night he whispered a devilish grin spreading across his face huh tonights what night i demanded ssshhh he raised a finger to his lips when everyones asleep roger and i are going to go check out the forbidden bunk he turned to colin you with us colin shook his head sadly i dont think i can jay walking backwards hi front of us jay locked his eyes on mine how about you billy you coming i i think ill stay with colin i told him i heard roger mutter something about me being a chicken jay looked disappointed youre going to miss out he said thats okay im kind of tired i said it was true i felt so weary after this long day every muscle ached even my hair hurt jay and roger made whispered plans all the way back to the tent at the bottom of the hill i stopped and gazed up at the forbidden bunk it appeared to lean toward me in the pale starlight i listened for the familiar howls that seemed to come from inside it but tonight there was only a heavy silence the large plastic tents were lined up in the bunk area i crawled into ours and lay down on top of my sleeping bag the ground was really hard i could see this was going to be a long night jay and colin were messing around with their sleeping bags at the back of the tent it seems weird without mike here i said feeling a sudden chill now youll have more room to put your stuff jay replied casually he sat hunched against the tent wall his expression tense his eyes on the darkness outside the tent door which was left open a few inches larry was nowhere in sight colin sat quietly he still wasnt feeling right i shifted my weight and stretched out trying to find a comfortable position i really wanted to go to sleep but i knew i wouldnt be able to sleep until after jay and roger returned from their adventure time moved slowly it was cold outside and the air was heavy and wet inside the tent i stared up at the dark plastic tent walls a bug crawled across my forehead i squashed it with my hand i could hear jay and colin whispering behind me but i couldnt make out their words jay snickered nervously i must have dozed off an insistent whispering sound woke me up it took me a while to realize it was someone whispering outside the tent i lifted my head and saw rogers face peering in i sat up alert wish us luck jay whispered good luck i whispered back my voice clogged from sleep in the darkness i saw jays large shadowy form crawl quickly to the tent door he pushed it open revealing a square of purple sky then vanished into the darkness i shivered lets sneak back to the bunk i whispered to colin its too cold out here and the ground feels like solid rock colin agreed we both scrambled out of the tent and made our way silently to our nice warm bunk inside we headed to the window to try to see jay and roger theyre going to get caught i whispered i just know it they wont get caught colin disagreed but they wont see anything either theres nothing to see up there its just a stupid cabin poking my head out the window i could hear jay and roger giggling quietly out somewhere in the dark the camp was so silent so eerily silent i could hear their whispers their legs brushing through the tall grass theyd better be quiet colin muttered leaning against the window frame theyre making too much noise they must be up to the hill by now i whispered i stuck my head out as far as i could but i couldnt see them colin started to reply but the first scream made him stop it was a scream of horror that cut through the silent air oh i cried out and pulled my head in was that jay or roger colin asked his voice trembling the second scream was more terrifying than the first before it died down i heard animal snarls loud and angry like an eruption of thunder then i heard jays desperate plea help us please somebody help us my heart thudding in my chest i lurched to the cabin door and pulled it open the hideous screams still ringing in my ears i plunged out into the darkness the dewcovered ground soaking my bare feet jay where are you i heard myself calling but i didnt recognize my shrill frightened voice and then i saw a dark form running toward me running bent over arms outstretched jay i cried what is it what happened he ran up to me still bent forward his face twisted in horror his eyes wide and unblinking his bushy hair appeared to stand straight up it it got roger he moaned his chest heaving as he struggled to straighten up what did i demanded what was it colin asked right behind me i i dont know jay stammered shutting his eyes tight it it tore roger to pieces jay uttered a loud sob then he opened his eyes and spun around in terror here it conies he shrieked now its coming after us in the pale starlight i saw jays eyes roll up in his head his knees collapsed and he began to slump to the ground i grabbed him before he fell and dragged him into the cabin colin slammed the door behind us once inside jay recovered slowly the three of us froze in place and listened hard i was still holding onto jays heaving shoulders he was as pale as a bedsheet and his breath came out in short frightened moans we listened silence the air hung hot and still nothing moved no footsteps no animal approaching just jays frightened moans and the pounding of my heart and then somewhere far hi the distance i heard the howl soft and low at first then rising on the wind a howl that chilled my blood and made me cry out its sabre dont let it get me jay shrieked covering his face with his hands he dropped to his knees on the cabin floor dont let it get me i raised my eyes to colin who was huddled against the wall away from the window we have to get larry i managed to choke out we have to get help but how colin demanded in a trembling voice dont let it get me jay repeated crumpled on the floor it isnt coming here i told him trying to sound certain trying to sound soothing were okay inside the bunk jay it isnt coming here but it got roger and jay started his entire body convulsed in a shudder of terror thinking about roger i felt a stab of fear in my chest was it really true was it true that roger had been attacked by some kind of creature that hed been slashed to pieces id heard the screams from the hillside two bloodcurdling screams theyd been so loud so horrifying hadnt anyone else in camp heard them too hadnt any other kids heard rogers cries hadnt any counselors heard i froze in place and listened silence the whisper of the breeze rustling the tree leaves no voices no cries of alarm no hurried footsteps i turned back toward the others colin had helped jay to his bunk where can larry be colin asked his eyes for once not hidden behind the silver sunglasses showed real fear where can everyone be i asked crossing my arms over my chest and starting to pace back and forth in the small space between the beds there isnt a sound out there i saw jays eyes go wide with horror he was staring at the open window the creature he cried here it conies its coming through the window all three of us gaped in horror at the open window but no creature jumped in as i stared frozen in the center of the cabin i could see only darkness and a fringe of pale stars outside in the trees crickets started up a shrill clatter there was no other sound poor jay was so frightened and upset he was seeing things somehow colin and i got him a little calmed down we made him take off his sneakers and lie down on the lower bed and we covered him up with three blankets to help him to stop trembling colin and i wanted to run for help but we were too frightened to go outside the three of us were up all night larry never showed up except for the crickets and the brush of the wind through the trees the camp was silent i think i must have finally dozed off just before dawn i had strange nightmares about fires and people trying to run away i was awakened by colin shaking me hard breakfast he said hoarsely hurry were late i sat up groggily wheres larry he never showed colin replied motioning to larrys unused bunk weve got to find him weve got to tell him what happened jay cried hurrying to the cabin door with his sneakers untied colin and i stumbled after him both of us only halfawake it was a cool gray morning the sun was trying hard to poke through high white clouds the three of us stopped halfway up the hill to the mess hall reluctantly our eyes searched the ground around the forbidden bunk i dont know what i expected to see but there was no sign of roger no sign of any struggle no dried blood on the ground the tall grass wasnt bent or matted down weird i heard jay mutter shaking his head thats weird i tugged his arm to get him moving and we hurried the rest of the way up to the lodge the mess hall was as noisy as ever kids were laughing and shouting to each other it all seemed perfectly normal i guessed that no one had made an announcement about roger yet some kids called to colin and me but we ignored them and searched for roger moving quickly through the aisles between the tables no sign of him i had a heavy queasy feeling in my stomach as we hurried to the counselors table in the corner larry glanced up from a big plate of scrambled eggs and bacon as the three of us advanced on him what happened to roger is he okay where were you last night roger and i were attacked we were afraid to go find you all three of us bombarded larry at once his face was filled with confusion and he raised both hands to silence us whoa he said take a breath guys what are you talking about about roger jay screamed his face turning bright red the creature it jumped on him and and larry glanced at the other counselors at the table who looked as confused as he did creature what creature larry demanded it attacked roger jay screamed it was coming after me and larry stared up at jay someone was attacked i dont think so jay he turned to the counselor next to him a pudgy boy named derek did you hear anything in your area derek shook his head isnt roger in your group larry asked derek derek shook his head not in my group but roger jay insisted we didnt get any report about any attack larry said interrupting if a camper was attacked by a bear or something wed hear about it and wed hear the noise derek offered you know screams or something i heard screams i told them we both heard screams colin added quickly and jay came running back crying for help well why didnt anyone else hear it larry demanded turning his gaze on jay his expression changed where did this happen when he asked suspiciously jays face darkened to a deeper red after lights out he admitted roger and i went up to the forbidden bunk and are you sure it wasnt a bear derek interrupted some bears were spotted downriver yesterday afternoon it was a creature jay screamed angrily you shouldnt have been out larry said shaking his head why wont you listen to me jay screamed roger was attacked this big thing jumped on him and we wouldve heard something derek said calmly glancing at larry yeah larry agreed the counselors were all up here at the lodge we wouldve heard any screams but larry youve got to check it out i cried jay isnt making it up it really happened okay okay larry replied raising his hands as if surrendering ill go ask uncle al about it okay hurry jay insisted please ill ask uncle al after breakfast larry said turning back to his eggs and bacon ill see you guys at morning swim later ill report what uncle al says but larry jay pleaded ill ask uncle al larry said firmly if anything happened last night hell know about it he raised a strip of bacon to his mouth and chewed on it i think you just had a bad nightmare or something he continued eyeing jay suspiciously but ill let you know what uncle al says it wasnt a nightmare jay cried shrilly larry turned his back on us and continued eating his breakfast dont you care jay screamed at him dont you care what happens to us i saw that a lot of kids had stopped eating their breakfast to gawk at us i pulled jay away and tried to get him to go to our table but he insisted on searching the entire mess hall again i know roger isnt here he insisted he he cant be for the second time the three of us made our way up and down the aisles between the tables studying every face one thing was for sure roger was nowhere to be seen the sun burned through the high clouds just as we reached the waterfront for morning swim the air was still cool the thick leafy shrubs along the riverbank glistened wetly in the white glare of sunlight i dropped my towel under a bush and turned to the gently flowing green water ill bet its cold this morning i said to colin who was retying the string on his swim trunks i just want to go back to the bunk and go to sleep colin said plucking at a knot he wasnt seeing double any longer but he was tired from being up all night several guys were already wading into the river they were complaining about the cold water splashing each other shoving each other forward wheres larry jay demanded breathlessly pushing his way through the clump of shrubs to get to us his auburn hair was a mess half of it standing straight up on the side of his head his eyes were redrimmed and bloodshot wheres larry he promised hed be here jay said frantically searching the waterfront here i am the three of us spun around as larry appeared from the bushes behind us he was wearing baggy green camp nightmoon swim trunks well jay demanded what did uncle al say about roger larrys expression was serious his eyes locked on jays uncle al and i went all around the forbidden bunk he told jay there wasnt any attack there there couldnt have been but it it got roger jay cried shrilly it slashed him i saw it larry shook his head his eyes still burning into jays thats the other thing he said softly uncle al and i went up to the office and checked the records jay and there is no camper here this year named roger not a first name or a middle name no roger no roger at all jays mouth dropped open and he uttered a low gasp the three of us stared in disbelief at larry letting this startling news sink in someones made a mistake jay said finally his voice trembling with emotion we searched the mess hall for him larry and hes gone roger isnt here he never was here larry said without any emotion at all i i just dont believe this jay cried how about a swim guys larry said motioning to the water well what do you think i demanded of larry i couldnt believe he was being so calm about this what do you think happened last night larry shrugged i dont know what to think he replied his eyes on a cluster of swimmers farthest from the shore maybe you guys are trying to pull a weird joke on me huh is that what you think jay cried that its a joke larry shrugged again swim time guys get some exercise okay jay started to say more but larry quickly turned and went running into the green water he took four or five running steps off the shore then dove pulling himself quickly through the water taking long steady strokes im not going in jay insisted angrily im going back to the bunk his face was bright red his chin was trembling i could see that he was about to cry he turned and began running through the bushes dragging his towel along the ground hey wait up colin went running after him i stood there trying to decide what to do i didnt want to follow jay to the bunk there wasnt anything i could do to help him maybe a cold swim will make me feel better i thought maybe nothing will make me feel better i told myself glumly i stared out at the other guys in the water larry and another counselor were setting up a race i could hear them discussing what kind of stroke should be used they all seem to be having a great time i thought watching them line up so why arent i why have i been so frightened and unhappy since i arrived here why dont the other campers see how weird and frightening this place is i shook my head unable to answer my questions i need a swim i decided i took a step toward the water but someone reached out from the bushes and grabbed me roughly from behind i started to scream out in protest but my attacker quickly clamped a hand over my mouth to silence me i tried to pull away but id been caught off guard as the hands tugged me i lost my balance and i was pulled back into the bushes is this a joke whats going on i wondered suddenly as i tried to tug myself free the hands let go i went sailing headfirst into a clump of fat green leaves it took me a long moment to pull myself up then i spun around to face my attacker dawn i cried ssshhhh she leapt forward and clamped a hand over my mouth again duck down she whispered urgently theyll see you i obediently ducked behind the low bush she let go of me again and moved back she was wearing a blue onepiece bathing suit it was wet her blonde hair was also wet dripping down onto her bare shoulders dawn what are you doing here i whispered settling onto my knees before dawn could reply another figure in a bathing suit moved quickly from the bushes crouching low it was dawns friend dori we swam over early this morning dori whispered nervously pushing at her curly red hair we waited here in the bushes but its not allowed i said unable to hide my confusion if youre caught we had to talk to you dawn interrupted raising her head to peek over the top of the bushes then quickly ducking back down we decided to risk it dori added what whats wrong i stammered a redandblack bug crawled up my shoulder i brushed it away the girls camp its a nightmare dori whispered everyone calls it camp nightmare instead of camp nightmoon dawn added strange things have been happening huh i gaped at her not far from us in the water i could hear the shouts and splashes of the swim race beginning what kinds of strange things scary things dori replied her expression solemn girls have disappeared dawn told me just vanished from sight and no one seems to care dori added in a trembling whisper i dont believe it i uttered the same thing has happened here at the boys camp i swallowed hard remember mike both girls nodded mike disappeared i told them they removed his stuff and he just disappeared its unbelievable dori said three girls are gone from our camp they announced that one was attacked by a bear dawn whispered what about the other two i asked just gone dawn replied the words catching in her throat i could hear whistles blowing in the water the race had ended another one was being organized the sun disappeared once again behind high white clouds shadows lengthened and grew darker i told them quickly about roger and jay and the attack at the forbidden bunk they listened in openmouthed silence just like at our camp dawn said we have to do something dori said heatedly we have to get together the boys and the girls dawn whispered peering once again over the tops of the leaves we have to make a plan you mean to escape i asked not really understanding the two girls nodded we cant stay here dawn said grimly every day another girl disappears and the counselors act as if nothing is happening i think they want us to get killed or something dori added with emotion have you written to your parents i asked we write every day dori replied but we havent heard from them i suddenly realized that i hadnt received any mail from my parents either they had both promised to write every day but i had been at camp for nearly a week and i hadnt received a single piece of mail visitors day is next week i said our parents will be here we can tell them everything it may be too late dawn said grimly everyone is so scared dori declared i havent slept in two nights i hear these horrible screams outside every night another whistle blew closer to shore i could hear the swimmers returning morning swim was ending i i dont know what to say i told them youve got to be careful dont get caught well swim back to the girls camp when everyone has left dawn said but we have to meet again billy we have to get more guys together you know maybe if we all get organized her voice trailed off theres something bad going on at this camp dori said with a shiver narrowing her eyes something evil i i know i agreed i could hear boys voices now close by just on the other side of the leafy bushes ive got to go well try to meet here again the day after tomorrow dawn whispered be careful billy you be careful i whispered dont get caught they slipped back deeper in the bushes crouching low i made my way away from the shore when i was past the clump of bushes i stood up and began to run i couldnt wait to tell colin and jay about what the girls had said i felt frightened and excited at the same time i thought maybe it would make jay feel a little better to know that the same kinds of horrible things were happening across the river at the girls camp halfway to the bunks i had an idea i stopped and turned toward the lodge i suddenly remembered seeing a pay phone on the wall on the side of the building someone had told me that phone was the only one campers were allowed to use ill call mom and dad i decided why hadnt i thought of it before i can call my parents i realized and tell them everything i could ask them to come and get me and they could get jay colin dawn and dori too behind me i saw my group heading toward the scratchball field their swimming towels slung over their shoulders i wondered if anyone had noticed that i was missing jay and colin were missing too i told myself larry and the others probably think im with them i watched them trooping across the tall grass in twos and threes then i turned and started jogging up the hill toward the lodge the idea of calling home had cheered me up already i was so eager to hear my parents voices so eager to tell them the strange things that were happening here would they believe me of course they would my parents always believed me because they trusted me as i ran up the hill the dark pay phone came into view on the white lodge wall i started to run at full speed i wanted to fly to the phone i hope mom and dad are home i thought theyve got to be home i was panting loudly as i reached the wall i lowered my hands to my knees and crouched there for a moment waiting to catch my breath then i reached up to take the receiver down and gasped the pay phone was plastic just a stage prop a phony it was a thin sheet of molded plastic held to the wall by a nail made to look just like a telephone it wasnt real it was a fake they dont want us to call out i thought with a sudden chill my heart thudding my head spinning in bitter disappointment i turned away from the wall and bumped right into uncle al billy what are you doing up here uncle aj asked he was wearing baggy green camp shorts and a sleeveless white tshirt that revealed his meaty pink arms he carried a brown clipboard filled with papers where are you supposed to be i uh wanted to make a phone call i stammered taking a step back i wanted to call my parents he eyed me suspiciously and fingered his yellow mustache really yeah just to say hi i told him but the phone uncle al followed my gaze to the plastic phone he chuckled someone put that up as a joke he said grinning at me did it fool you yeah i admitted feeling my face grow hot i raised my eyes to his where is the real phone his grin faded his expression turned serious no phone he replied sharply campers arent allowed to call out its a rule billy oh i didnt know what to say are you really homesick uncle al asked softly i nodded well go write your mom and dad a long letter he said itll make you feel a lot better okay i said i didnt think it would make me feel better but i wanted to get away from uncle al he raised his clipboard and gazed at it where are you supposed to be now he asked scratchball i think i replied i didnt feel too well see so i and when is your canoe trip he asked not listening to me he flipped through the sheets of paper on the clipboard glancing over them quickly canoe trip i hadnt heard about any canoe trip tomorrow he said answering his own question your group goes tomorrow are you excited he lowered his eyes to mine i i didnt really know about it i confessed lots of fun he exclaimed enthusiastically the river doesnt look like much up here but it gets pretty exciting a few miles down youll find yourself in some good rapids he squeezed my shoulder briefly youll enjoy it he said grinning everyone always enjoys the canoe ride great i said i tried to sound a little excited but my voice came out flat and uncertain uncle al gave me a wave with his clipboard and headed around toward the front of the lodge taking long strides i stood watching him till he disappeared around the comer of the building then i made my way down the hill to the bunk i found colin and jay on the grass at the side of the cabin colin had his shirt off and was sprawled on his back his hands behind his head jay sat crosslegged beside him nervously pulling up long slender strands of grass then tossing them down come inside i told them glancing around to make sure no one else could hear they followed me into the cabin i closed the door whats up colin asked dropping onto a lower bunk he picked up his red bandanna and twisted it in his hands i told them about dawn and dori and what they had reported about the girls camp colin and jay both reacted with shock they really swam over here and waited for you jay asked i nodded they think we have to get organized or escape or something i said they could get in big trouble if they get caught jay said thoughtfully were all in big trouble i told him we have to get out visitors day is next week colin muttered im going to write to my parents right now i said pulling out the case from under my bunk where i kept my paper and pens im going to tell them i have to come home on visitors day i guess i will too jay said tapping his fingers nervously against the bunk frame me too colin agreed its just too weird here i pulled out a couple of sheets of paper and sat down on the bed to write dawn and dori were really scared i told them so am i jay admitted i started to write my letter i wrote dear mom and dad help then stopped i raised my eyes across the cabin to jay and colin do you guys know about the canoe trip tomorrow i asked they stared back at me their expressions surprised whoa colin declared a threemile hike this afternoon and a canoe trip tomorrow it was my turn to be surprised hike what hike arent you coming on it jay asked you know that really tall counselor frank the one who wears the yellow cap colin asked he told jay and me were going on a threemile hike after lunch no one told me i replied chewing on the end of my pen maybe youre not in the hike group jay said youd better ask frank at lunch colin suggested maybe he couldnt find you maybe youre supposed to come too i groaned who wants to go on a threemile hike in this heat colin and jay both shrugged frank said wed really like it colin told me knotting and unknotting the red bandanna i just want to get out of here i said returning to my letter i wrote quickly intensely i wanted to tell my parents all the frightening strange things that had happened i wanted to make them see why i couldnt stay at camp nightmoon i had written nearly a page and a half and i was up to the part where jay and roger went out to explore the forbidden bunk when larry burst in you guys taking the day off he asked his eyes going from one of us to the other you on vacation or something just hanging out jay replied i folded up my letter and started to tuck it under my pillow i didnt want larry to see it i realized i didnt trust larry at all i had no reason to what are you doing billy he asked suspiciously his eyes stopping on the letter i was shoving under the pillow just writing home i replied softly you homesick or something he asked a grin spreading across his face maybe i muttered well its lunchtime guys he announced lets hustle okay we all climbed out of our bunks jay and colin are going on a hike with frank this afternoon i heard larry said lucky guys he turned and started out the door larry i called to him hey larry what about me am i supposed to go on the hike too not today he called back but why not i said but larry disappeared out the door i turned back to my two bunk mates lucky guys i teased them they both growled back at me in reply then we headed up the hill to lunch they served pizza for lunch which is usually my favorite but today the pizza was cold and tasted like cardboard and the cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth i wasnt really hungry i kept thinking about dawn and dori how frightened they were how desperate i wondered when id see them again i wondered if they would swim over and hide at the boys camp again before visitors day after lunch frank came by our table to pick up jay and colin i asked him if i was supposed to come too you werent on the list billy he said scratching at a mosquito bite on his neck i can only take two at a time you know the trail gets a little dangerous dangerous jay asked climbing up from the table frank grinned at him youre a big strong guy he told jay youll do okay i watched frank lead colin and jay out of the mess hall our table was empty now except for a couple of blondhaired guys i didnt know who were armwrestling down at the end near the wall i pushed my tray away and stood up i wanted to go back to the bunk and finish the letter to my parents but as i took a few steps toward the door i felt a hand on my shoulder i turned to see larry grinning down at me tennis tournament he said huh i reacted with surprise billy youre representing bunk in the tennis tournament larry said didnt you see the lineup it was posted on the announcements board but im a terrible tennis player i protested were counting on you larry replied get a racquet and get your bod to the courts i spent the afternoon playing tennis i beat a little kid in straight sets i had the feeling he had never held a tennis racquet before then i lost a long hardfought match to one of the blondhaired boys whod been armwrestling at lunch i was drowning in sweat and every muscle in my body ached when the match was over i headed to the waterfront for a refreshing swim then i returned to the bunk changed into jeans and a greenandwhite camp nightmoon tshirt and finished my letter to my parents it was nearly dinnertime jay and colin werent back from their hike yet i decided to go up to the lodge and mail my letter as i headed up the hill i saw clusters of kids hurrying to their bunks to change for dinner but no sign of my two bunk mates holding the letter tightly i headed around to the back of the lodge building where the camp office was located the door was wide open so i walked in a young woman was usually behind the counter to answer questions and to take the letters to be mailed anyone here i called leaning over the counter and peering into the tiny back room which was dark no reply hi anyone here i repeated clutching the envelope no the office was empty disappointed i started to leave then i glimpsed the large burlap bag on the floor just inside the tiny back room the mailbag i decided to put my letter in the bag with the others to be mailed i slipped around the counter and into the back room and crouched down to put my envelope into the bag to my surprise the mailbag was stuffed full with letters as i pulled the bag open and started to shove my letter inside a bunch of letters fell out onto the floor i started to scoop them up when a letter caught my eye it was one of mine addressed to my parents one i had written yesterday weird i muttered aloud bending over the bag i reached in and pulled out a big handful of letters i sifted through them quickly i found a letter colin had written i pulled out another pile and my eyes fell upon two other letters i had written nearly a week ago when i first arrived in camp i stared at them feeling a cold chill run down my back all of our letters all of the letters we had written since the first day of camp were here in this mailbag none of them had been mailed we couldnt call home and we couldnt write home frantically my hands trembling i began shoving the envelopes back into the mailbag what is going on here i wondered what is going on by the time i got into the mess hall uncle al was finishing the evening announcements i slid into my seat hoping i hadnt missed anything important i expected to see jay and colin across the table from me but their places on the bench were empty thats strange i thought still shaken from my discovery about the mailbag they should be back by now i wanted to tell them about the mail i wanted to share the news that our parents werent getting any of the letters we wrote and we werent getting any of theirs the camp had to be keeping our mail from us i suddenly realized colin and jay where are you the fried chicken was greasy and the potatoes were lumpy and tasted like paste as i forced the food down i kept turning to glance at the mess hall door expecting to see my two bunk mates but they didnt show up a heavy feeling of dread formed in my stomach through the mess hall window i could see that it was already dark outside where could they be a threemile hike and back shouldnt take this many hours i pulled myself up and made my way to the counselors table in the corner larry was having a loud argument about sports with two of the other counselors they were shouting and gesturing with their hands franks chair was empty larry did frank get back i interrupted their discussion larry turned a startled expression on his face frank he motioned to the empty chair at the table guess not he took jay and colin on the hike i said shouldnt they be back by now larry shrugged beats me he returned to his argument leaving me standing there staring at franks empty chair after the trays had been cleared we pushed the tables and benches against the wall and had indoor relay races everyone seemed to be having a great time the shouts and cheers echoed off the highraftered ceiling i was too worried about jay and colin to enjoy the games maybe they decided to camp out overnight i told myself but i had seen them leave and i knew they hadnt taken any tents or sleeping bags or other overnight supplies so where were they the games ended a little before lights out as i followed the crowd to the door larry appeared beside me were leaving early tomorrow he said first thing huh i didnt understand what he meant the canoe trip im the canoe counselor ill be taking you guys he explained seeing my confusion oh okay i replied without enthusiasm i was so worried about jay and colin id nearly forgotten about the canoe trip right after breakfast larry said wear a bathing suit bring a change of clothes meet me at the waterfront he hurried back to help the other counselors pull the tables into place after breakfast i muttered i wondered if jay and colin were also coming on the canoe trip i had forgotten to ask larry i headed quickly down the dark hill the dew had already fallen and the tall grass was slippery and wet halfway down i could see the dark outline of the forbidden bunk hunched forward as if preparing to strike forcing myself to look away i jogged the rest of the way to bunk to my surprise i could see through the window that someone was moving around inside colin and jay are back i thought eagerly i pushed open the door and burst inside hey whereve you guys been i cried i stopped short and gasped two strangers stared back at me one was sitting on the edge of colins top bunk pulling off his sneakers the other was leaning over the dresser pulling a tshirt from one of the drawers hi you in here the boy at the dresser stood up straight his eyes studying me he had very short black hair and a gold stud in one ear i swallowed hard am i in the wrong bunk is this bunk they both stared at me confused i saw that the other boy the one in colins bunk also had black hair but his was long and scraggly and fell over his forehead yeah this is bunk he said were new the shorthaired boy added im tommy and hes chris we just started today hi i said uncertainly my names billy my heart was pounding like a tomtom in my chest wheres colin and jay who chris asked they told us this bunk was mostly empty well colin and jay i started we just arrived we dont know anyone tommy interrupted he pushed the drawer shut but thats jays drawer i said bewildered pointing what did you do with jays stuff tommy gazed back at me in surprise the drawer was empty he replied almost all the drawers were empty chris added tossing his sneakers down to the floor except for the bottom two drawers thats my stuff i said my head spinning but colin and jay their stuff was here i insisted the whole cabin was empty tommy said maybe your friends got moved maybe i said weakly i sat down on the lower bunk beneath my bed my legs felt shaky a million thoughts were whirring through my mind all of them frightening this is weird i said aloud its not a bad bunk chris said pulling down his blanket and settling in kind of cozy how long you staying at camp tommy asked pulling on an oversized white tshirt all summer no i exclaimed with a shudder im not staying i sputtered i mean i mean im leaving on uh im leaving on visitors day next week chris flashed tommy a surprised glance huh when are you leaving he asked again on visitors day i repeated when my parents come up for visitors day but didnt you hear uncle als announcement before dinner tommy asked staring hard at me visitors day has been canceled i drifted in and out of a troubled sleep that night even with the blanket pulled up to my chin i felt chilled and afraid it felt so weird to have two strange guys in the bunk sleeping where jay and colin slept i was worried about my missing mends what had happened to them why hadnt they come back as i tossed restlessly in my top bunk i heard howls off in the distance animal cries probably coming from the forbidden bunk long frightening howls carried by the wind into our open bunk window at one point i thought i heard kids screaming i sat up straight suddenly alert and listened had i dreamed the frightful shrieks i was so scared and confused it was impossible to tell what was real and what was a nightmare it took hours to fall back to sleep i awoke to a gray overcast morning the air heavy and cold pulling on swim trunks and a tshirt i raced to the lodge to find larry i had to find out what had happened to jay and colin i searched everywhere for him without success larry wasnt at breakfast none of the other counselors admitted to knowing anything frank the counselor who had taken my two friends on the hike was also not there i finally found larry at the waterfront preparing a long metal canoe for our river trip larry where are they i cried out breathlessly he gazed up at me holding an armload of canoe paddles his expression turned to bewilderment huh chris and tommy theyll be here soon no i cried grabbing his arm jay and colin where are they what happened to them larry youve got to tell me i gripped his arm tightly i was gasping for breath i could feel the blood pulsing at my temples youve got to tell me i repeated shrilly he pulled away from me and let the paddles fall beside the canoe i dont know anything about them he replied quietly but larry really i dont he insisted in the same quiet voice his expression softened he placed a hand on my trembling shoulder tell you what billy he said staring hard into my eyes ill ask uncle al about it after our trip okay ill find out for you when we get back i stared back at him trying to decide if he was being honest i couldnt tell his eyes were as calm and cold as marbles he leaned forward and pushed the canoe into the shallow river water here take one of those life preservers he said pointing to a pile of blue rubber vests behind me strap it on then get in i did as he instructed i saw that i had no choice chris and tommy came running up to us a few seconds later they obediently followed larrys instructions and strapped on the lifepreserver vests a few minutes later the four of us were seated crosslegged inside the long slender canoe drifting slowly away from the shore the sky was still charcoalgray the sun hidden behind hovering dark clouds the canoe bumped over the choppy river waters the current was stronger than i had realized we began to pick up speed the low trees and shrubs along the riverbank slid past rapidly larry sat facing us in the front of the canoe he demonstrated how to paddle as the river carried us away he watched us carefully a tight frown on his face as the three of us struggled to pick up the rhythm he was showing us then when we finally seemed to catch on larry grinned and carefully turned around gripping the sides of the canoe as he shifted his position the sun is trying to come out he said his voice muffled in the strong breeze over the rippling water i glanced up the sky looked darker than before he stayed with his back to us facing forward allowing the three of us to do the paddling i had never paddled a canoe before it was harder than id imagined but as i fell into the rhythm of it with tommy and chris i began to enjoy it dark water smacked against the prow of the canoe sending up splashes of white froth the current grew stronger and we picked up speed the air was still cold but the steady work of rowing warmed me after a while i realized i was sweating we rowed past tangles of yellow and graytrunked trees the river suddenly divided in two and we shifted our paddles to take the left branch larry began paddling again working to keep us off the tall rocks that jutted between the river branches the canoe bobbed up and slapped down bobbed up and slapped down cold water poured over the sides the sky darkened even more i wondered if it was about to storm as the river widened the current grew rapid and strong i realized we didnt really need to paddle the river current was doing most of the work the river sloped down wide swirls of frothing white water made the canoe leap and bounce here come the rapids larry shouted cupping his hands around his mouth so we could hear him hang on it gets pretty wild i felt a tremor of fear as a wave of icy water splashed over me the canoe rose up on a shelf of white water then hit hard as it landed i could hear tommy and chris laughing excitedly behind me another icy wave rolled over the canoe startling me i cried out and nearly let go of my paddle tommy and chris laughed again i took a deep breath and held on tightly to the paddle struggling to keep up the rhythm hey look larry cried suddenly to my astonishment he climbed to his feet he leaned forward pointing into the swirling white water look at those fish he shouted as he leaned down the canoe was jarred by a powerful rush of current the canoe spun to the right i saw the startled look on larrys face as he lost his balance his arms shot forward and he plunged headfirst into the tossing waters noooooo i screamed i glanced back at tommy and chris who had stopped paddling and were staring into the swirling dark waters their expressions frozen in openmouthed horror larry larry i was screaming the name over and over without realizing it the canoe continued to slide rapidly down the churning waters larry didnt come up larry behind me tommy and chris also called out his name their voices shrill and frightened where was he why didnt he swim to the surface the canoe was drifting farther and farther downriver larrrrrry we have to stop i screamed we have to slow down we cant chris shouted back we dont know how still no sign of larry i realized he must be in trouble without thinking i tossed my paddle into the river climbed to my feet and plunged into the dark swirling waters to save him i jumped without thinking and swallowed a mouthful of the brown water as i went down my heart thudded in my chest as i struggled frantically to the surface sputtering and choking gasping in a deep breath i lowered my head and tried to swim against the current my sneakers felt as if they weighed a thousand pounds i realized i should have pulled them off before i jumped the water heaved and tossed i moved my arms in long desperate strokes pulling myself toward the spot where larry had fallen glancing back i saw the canoe a dark blur growing smaller and smaller wait i wanted to shout to tommy and chris wait for me to get larry but i knew that they didnt know how to slow the canoe they were helpless as the current carried them away where was larry i sucked in another mouthful of air and froze as i felt a sharp cramp in my right leg the pain shot up through my entire right side i slid under the water and waited for the pain to lessen the cramp seemed to tighten until i could barely move the leg water rushed over me i struggled to pull myself up to the surface as i choked in more air i stroked rapidly and hard pulling myself up ignoring the sharp pain in my leg hey what was that object floating just ahead of me a piece of driftwood being carried by the current brown water washed over me blinding me tossing me back sputtering i pulled myself back up water rolled down my face i struggled to see larry he came floating right to me larry larry i managed to scream but he didnt answer me i could see clearly now that he was floating face down the leg cramp miraculously vanished as i reached out with both arms and grabbed larrys shoulders i pulled ms head up from the water rolled him onto his back and wrapped my arm around his neck i was using the lifesaving technique my parents had taught me turning downriver i searched for the canoe but the current had carried it out of sight i swallowed another mouthful of icy water choking i held onto larry i kicked hard my right leg still felt tight and weak but at least the pain had gone kicking and pulling with my free hand i dragged larry toward the shore to my relief the current helped it seemed to pull in the same direction a few seconds later i was close enough to shore to stand wearily panting like a wild animal i tottered to my feet and dragged larry onto the wet mud of the shore was he dead had he drowned before i reached him i stretched him out on his back and still panting loudly struggling to catch my breath to stop my entire body from trembling i leaned over him and he opened his eyes he stared up at me blankly as if he didnt recognize me finally he whispered my name billy he choked out are we okay larry and i rested for a bit then we walked back to camp following the river upstream we were soaked clear through and drenched with mud but i didnt care we were alive we were okay i had saved larrys life we didnt talk much all the way back it was taking every ounce of strength we had just to walk i asked larry if he thought tommy and chris would be okay hope so he muttered breathing hard theyll probably ride to shore and walk back like us i took this opportunity to ask him again about jay and colin i thought maybe larry would tell me the truth since we were completely alone and since i had just saved his life but he insisted he didnt know anything about my two bunk mates as we walked he raised one hand and swore he didnt know anything at all so many frightening things have happened i muttered he nodded keeping his eyes straight ahead its been strange he agreed i waited for him to say more but he walked on in silence it took three hours to walk back we hadnt traveled downriver as far as i had thought but the muddy shore kept twisting and turning making our journey longer as the camp came into view my knees buckled and my legs nearly collapsed under me breathing hard drenched in perspiration our clothes still damp and covered in mud we trudged wearily onto the waterfront hey a voice called from the swim area uncle al dressed in baggy green sweats came hurrying across the dirt to us what happened he asked larry we had an accident i cried before larry had a chance to reply i fell in larry admitted his face reddening beneath the splattered mud billy jumped in and saved me we walked back but tommy and chris couldnt stop the canoe they drifted away i cried we both nearly drowned larry told the frowning camp director but billy he saved my life can you send someone to find tommy and chris i asked suddenly starting to shake all over from exhaustion i guess the two boys floated on downriver uncle al asked staring hard at larry scratching the back of his fringe of yellow hair larry nodded we have to find them i insisted trembling harder uncle al continued to glare at larry what about my canoe he demanded angrily thats our best canoe how am i supposed to replace it larry shrugged unhappily well have to go look for that canoe tomorrow uncle al snapped he doesnt care about the two boys i realized he doesnt care about them at all go get into dry clothes uncle al instructed larry and me he stormed off toward the lodge shaking his head i turned and started to the cabin feeling chilled my entire body still trembling i could feel a strong wave of anger sweep over me i had just saved larrys life but uncle al didnt care about that and he didnt care that two campers were lost on the river he didnt care that two campers and a counselor never returned from their hike he didnt care that boys were attacked by creatures he didnt care that kids disappeared and were never mentioned again he didnt care about any of us he only cared about his canoe my anger quickly turned to fear of course i had no way of knowing that the scariest part of my summer was still to come i was all alone in the bunk that night i pulled an extra blanket onto my bed and slid into a tight ball beneath the covers i wondered if id be able to fall asleep or if my frightened angry thoughts would keep me tossing and turning for another night but i was so weary and exhausted even the eerie mournful howls from the forbidden bunk couldnt keep me awake i fell into deep blackness and didnt wake up until i felt someone shaking my shoulders startled alert i sat straight up larry i cried my voice still clogged with sleep whats happening i squinted across the room larrys bed was rumpled the blanket balled up at the end he had obviously come in late and slept in the bunk but tommys and chriss beds were still untouched from the day before special hike larry said walking over to his bunk hurry get dressed huh i stretched and yawned outside the window it was still gray the sun hadnt risen what kind of hike uncle al called a special hike larry replied his back to me he grabbed the sheet and started to make his bed with a groan i lowered myself to the cabin floor it felt cold beneath my bare feet dont we get to rest i mean after what happened yesterday i glanced once again at tommys and chriss unused beds its not just us larry replied smoothing the sheet its the whole camp everyones going uncle al is leading it i pulled on a pair of jeans stumbling across the cabin with one leg in a sudden feeling of dread fell over me it wasnt scheduled i said darkly where is uncle al taking us larry didnt reply where i repeated shrilly he pretended he didnt hear me tommy and chris they didnt come back i asked glumly pulling on my sneakers luckily i had brought two pairs my shoes from yesterday sat in the corner still soaked through and mudcovered theyll turn up larry replied finally but he didnt sound as if he meant it i finished getting dressed then ran up the hill to get breakfast it was a warm gray morning it must have rained during the night the tall grass glistened wetly yawning and blinking against the harsh gray light campers headed quietly up the hill i saw that most of them had the same confused expression i had why were we going on this unscheduled hike so early in the morning how long was it going to be where were we going i hoped that uncle al or one of the counselors would explain everything to us at breakfast but none of them appeared in the mess hall we ate quietly without the usual joking around i found myself thinking about the terrifying canoe trip yesterday i could almost taste the brackish brown water again i saw larry floating toward me facedown floating on the churning water like a clump of seaweed i pictured myself trying to get to him struggling to swim struggling to go against the current to keep afloat in the swirls of white water and i saw the blur of the canoe as the strong river current carried it out of sight suddenly dawn and dori burst into my thoughts i wondered if they were okay i wondered if they were going to try and meet me again by the waterfront breakfast was french toast with syrup it was usually my favorite but this morning i just poked at it with my fork line up outside a counselor cried from the doorway chairs scraped loudly we all obediently climbed to our feet and began making our way outside where are they taking us why doesnt anyone tell us what this is about the sky had brightened to pink but the sun still hadnt risen over the horizon we formed a single line along the side wall of the lodge i was near the end of the line toward the bottom of the hill some kids were cracking jokes and playfully shoving each other but most were standing quietly or leaning against the wall waiting to see what was going to happen once the line was formed one of the counselors walked the length of it pointing his finger and moving his lips in concentration as he counted us he counted us twice to make sure he had the right number then uncle al appeared at the front of the line he wore a brownandgreen camouflage outfit the kind soldiers wear in movies he had on very black sunglasses even though the sun wasnt up yet he didnt say a word he signaled to larry and another counselor who were both carrying very large heavylooking brown bags over their shoulders then uncle ai strode quickly down the hill his eyes hidden behind the dark glasses his features set in a tight frown he stopped in front of the last camper this way he announced loudly pointing toward the waterfront those were his only words this way and we began to follow walking at a pretty fast clip our sneakers slid against the wet grass a few kids were giggling about something behind me to my surprise i realized i was now nearly at the front of the line i was close enough to call out to uncle al so i did where are we going i shouted he quickened his pace and didnt reply uncle al is this a long hike i called he pretended he hadnt heard i decided to give up he led us toward the waterfront then turned right thick clumps of trees stood a short way up ahead where the river narrowed glancing back to the end of the tine i saw larry and the other counselor bags on their shoulders hurrying to catch up to uncle al what is this about i wondered and as i stared at the clumps of low tangled trees up ahead a thought pushed its way into my head i can escape the thought was so frightening but suddenly so real it took a long time to form i can escape into these trees i can run away from uncle al and this frightening camp the idea was so exciting i nearly stumbled over my own feet i bumped into the kid ahead of me a big bruiser of a guy named tyler and he turned and glared at me whoa i told myself feeling my heart start to pound in my chest think about this think carefully i kept my eyes locked on the woods as we drew closer i could see that the thick trees so close together that their branches were all intertwined seemed to stretch on forever theyd never find me in there i told myself it would be really easy to hide in those woods but then what i couldnt stay in the woods forever then what staring at the trees i forced myself to concentrate forced myself to think clearly i could follow the river yes stay on the shore follow the river it was bound to come to a town eventually it had to come to a town id walk to the first town then id call my parents i can do it i thought so excited i could barely stay in line i just have to run make a dash for it when no one is looking into the woods deep into the woods we were at the edge of the trees now the sun had pulled itself up brightening the rosecolored morning sky we stood in the shadows of the trees i can do it i told myself soon my heart thudded loudly i was sweating even though the air was still cool calm down billy i warned myself just calm down wait your chance wait till the time is right then leave camp nightmare behind forever standing in the shade i studied the trees i spotted a narrow path into the woods a few yards up ahead i tried to calculate how long it would take me to reach the path probably ten seconds at most and then in another five seconds i could be into the protection of the trees i can do it i thought i can be gone in less than ten seconds i took a deep breath i braced myself i tensed my leg muscles preparing to run then i glanced to the front of the line to my horror uncle al was staring directly at me and he held a rifle in his hands i cried out when i saw the rifle in his hands had he read my thoughts did he know i was about to make a run for it a cold chill slid down my back as i gaped at the rifle as i raised my eyes to uncle als face i realized he wasnt looking at me he had turned his attention to the two counselors they had lowered the bags to the ground and were bending over them trying to get them open why did we stop tyler the kid ahead of me asked is the hike over another kid joked a few kids laughed guess we can go back now another kid said i stood watching in disbelief as larry and the other counselor began unloading rifles from the two bags line up and get one uncle al instructed us tapping the handle of his own rifle against the ground one rifle per boy come on hurry no one moved i think everyone thought uncle al was kidding or something whats wrong with you boys i said hurry he snapped angrily he grabbed up an armload of rifles and began moving down the line pushing one into each boys hands he pushed a rifle against my chest so hard i staggered back a few steps i grabbed it by the barrel before it fell to the ground whats going on tyler asked me i shrugged studying the rifle with horror id never held any kind of real gun before my parents were both opposed to firearms of all kinds a few minutes later we were all lined up in the shadow of the trees each holding a rifle uncle al stood near the middle of the line and motioned us into a tight circle so we could hear him whats going on is this target practice one boy asked larry and the other counselor snickered at that uncle als features remained hard and serious listen up he barked no more jokes this is serious business the circle of campers tightened around him we grew silent a bird squawked noisily in a nearby tree somehow it reminded me of my plan to escape was i about to be really sorry that i hadnt made a run for it two girls escaped from the girls camp last night uncle al announced in a flat businesslike tone a blonde and a redhead dawn and dori i exclaimed to myself ill bet it was them i believe uncle al continued that these are the same two girls who sneaked over to the boys camp and hid near the waterfront a few days ago yes i thought happily it is dawn and don they escaped i suddenly realized a broad smile had broken out on my face i quickly forced it away before uncle al could see my happy reaction to the news the two girls are in these woods boys theyre nearby uncle al continued he raised his rifle your guns are loaded aim carefully when you see them they wont get away from us huh i gasped in disbelief you mean were supposed to shoot them i glanced around the circle of campers they all looked as dazed and confused as i did yeah youre supposed to shoot them uncle al replied coldly i told you theyre trying to escape but we cant i cried its easy uncle al said he raised his rifle to his shoulder and pretended to fire it see nothing to it but we cant kill people i insisted kill his expression changed behind the dark glasses i didnt say anything about killing did i these guns are loaded with tranquilizer darts we just want to stop these girls not hurt them uncle al took two steps toward me the rifle still in his hands he stood over me menacingly lowering his face close to mine you got a problem with that billy he demanded he was challenging me i saw the other boys back away the woods grew silent even the bird stopped squawking you got a problem with that uncle al repeated his face so close to mine i could smell his sour breath terrified i took a step back then another why was he doing this to me why was he challenging me like this i took a deep breath and held it then i screamed as loudly as i could i i wont do it without completely realizing what i was doing i raised the rifle to my shoulder and aimed the barrel at uncle als chest youre gonna be sorry uncle al growled in a low voice he tore off the sunglasses and heaved them into the woods then he narrowed his eyes furiously at me drop the rifle billy im gonna make you sorry no i told him standing my ground youre not camp is over youre not going to do anything my legs were trembling so hard i could barely stand but i wasnt going to go hunting dawn and don i wasnt going to do anything else uncle al said ever give me the rifle billy he said in his low menacing voice he reached out a hand toward my gun hand it over boy no i cried hand it over now he ordered his eyes narrowed burning into mine now no i cried he blinked once twice then he leapt at me i took a step back with the rifle aimed at uncle al and pulled the trigger the rifle emitted a soft pop uncle al tossed his head back and laughed he let his rifle drop to the ground at his feet hey i cried out confused i kept the rifle aimed at his chest congratulations billy uncle al said grinning warmly at me you passed he stepped forward and reached out his hand to shake mine the other campers dropped their rifles glancing at them i saw that they were all grinning too larry also grinning flashed me a thumbsup sign whats going on i demanded suspiciously i slowly lowered the rifle uncle al grabbed my hand and squeezed it hard congratulations billy i knew youd pass huh i dont understand i screamed totally frustrated but instead of explaining anything to me uncle al turned to the trees and shouted okay everyone its over he passed come out and congratulate him and as i stared in disbelief my wideopen mouth hanging down around my knees people began stepping out from behind the trees first came dawn and dori you were hiding in the woods i cried they laughed in response congratulations dawn cried and then others came out grinning and congratulating me i screamed when i recognized mike he was okay beside him were jay and roger colin stepped out of the woods followed by tommy and chris all smiling and happy and okay what whats going on here i stammered i was totally stunned i felt dizzy i didnt get it i really didnt get it and then my mom and dad stepped out from the trees mom rushed up and gave me a hug dad patted the top of my head i knew youd pass billy he said i could see happy tears in his eyes finally i couldnt take it anymore i pushed mom gently away passed what i demanded what is this whats going on uncle al put his arm around my shoulder and guided me away from the group of campers mom and dad followed close behind this isnt really a summer camp uncle al explained still grinning at me his face bright pink its a governmenttesting lab huh i swallowed hard you know your parents are scientists billy uncle al continued well theyre about to leave on a very important expedition and this time they wanted to take you along with them how come you didnt tell me i asked my parents we couldnt mom exclaimed according to government rules billy uncle al continued children arent allowed to go on official expeditions unless they pass certain tests thats what youve been doing here youve been taking tests tests to see what i demanded still dazed well we wanted to see if you could obey orders uncle al explained you passed when you refused to go to the forbidden bunk he held up two fingers second we had to test your bravery you demonstrated that by rescuing larry he held up a third finger third we had to see if you knew when not to follow orders you passed that test by refusing to hunt for dawn and dori and everyone was in on it i asked all the campers the counselors everyone they were all actors uncle al nodded they all work here at the testing lab his expression turned serious you see billy your parents want to take you to a very dangerous place perhaps the most dangerous place in the known universe so we had to make sure you can handle it the most dangerous place in the universe where i asked my parents where are you taking me its a very strange planet called earth dad replied glancing at mom its very far from here but it could be exciting the inhabitants there are weird and unpredictable and no one has ever studied them laughing i stepped between my mom and dad and put my arms around them earth it sounds pretty weird but it could never be as dangerous or exciting as camp nightmoon i exclaimed well see mom replied quietly well
