terry carr is one of the true gentlemen of the science fiction field editors have trouble being beloved what they do cuts too close to the writers bones for comfort i do not believe there is an editor in the world who some writer somewhere does not wish dead on those grounds i feel sure that there must therefore be some people who hate terry carr but ive never met one perhaps the reason is that he has never been in charge of a major magazine or boss of a large book publishing company he has put in his editorial time as editorial consultant anthologist assistant to other editors proprietor of a special line of his own within a larger group and these are not the exposed mountaintops where the ravaging lightnings strike however they are good places for someone to be whose biggest interest is in finding and showcasing bright new talent thats something terry does extremely well devotees still fondly remember the carr ace special series of a decade and a half ago when terry took his chances on such unknowns as ursula k leguin joanna russ r a lafferty and a lot of others whose subsequent careers show how good an editor he really is so when terry carr asks me for something i try to deliver and when he told me he was putting together a new anthology of original stories called fellowship of the stars i was pleased to offer him this oneand delighted when he accepted it booze broads big cars the finest of food waterbeds filled with vintage champagne those were some of the things that went with tud cowpersmiths job the way he got the job was by going to a party in jackson heights the way he happened to be at the party was that he had no choice it wasnt a bad party for a loft in jackson heights it wasnt a bad loft the windows at one end looked out on the tracks of the irt el but they had been painted over with acrylics to look like stained glass every twenty minutes you got a noise like some very large person stumbling by with garbagecan lids for shoes but except for that the el might as well not have been there anyway at that end of the loft the stereo speakers stood four feet high on the floor so the noise didnt matter all that much you couldnt possibly talk at that end cowpersmith wanted eventually to talk as soon as the person he wanted to talk to showed up so he drifted to the other end there the noise was more or less bearable and there the windows were still clear they were even clean he could see through them down on a sort of communal garden three or four backyards for three or four different old apartment buildings thrown together a tiny round plastic swimming pool now iced over with leaves and boughs frozen into it bare trees that probably had looked very nice in the summer to get to the windows at that end you had to thread your way through a sort of indoor jungle potted plants presumably carried in from the garden for the cold weather and there on a chromerimmed chromelegged kitchen table the host and hostess were rolling joints they greeted cowpersmith want a hit thanks but the pot did not ease him he was looking for somebody that was the reason he was there the person he was looking for was named murray murray was an old old friend something like that what he basically was was somebody who owed cowpersmith fifty dollars from a time when fifty hadnt seemed like an awful lot cowpersmith had heard the day before that murray was in town and tracked him down to a hotel on central park south after some deliberation he had telephoned murray he really hated doing it he needed the fifty but in his view the odds against getting it were so bad that he didnt like the risk of investing a dime in a phone call the dime was after all real money there was no way to flash a revoked american express card at the phone booth as he had done with the last two restaurants and the airline that had brought him back from chicago where the last of his bankroll had melted away but the odds had paid off murray was in and obliging what fifty well dont you remember you met that canadian girl oh christ sure was it only fifty must be some interest due by now tud tell you what and the way it worked out they were to meet at this party and cowpersmith would collect not fifty but a hundred dollars that required some decision making too because there was the investment for a subway token to be considered but murray had sounded prosperous enough for a gamble only no murray cowpersmith took another hit from a girl wearing batik bellbottoms and a halter top and glared around the room through the roar of alice cooper he realized she was talking to him what i said is your name ted tud turd tud cowpersmith he yelled over the androgynous rock its a family name tudsbury she reached up close to his earshe was not more than five feet talland shouted if youre a friend of murrays hes looking for you he allowed her to lead him around the buttress of the stairwell for the first time noticing that her armpits were unshaven the hair on her head stuck out in tiny tied witch curls and she was quite pretty and there was murray knotting his wild red eyebrows hospitably hey tud looking great man long time youre looking fine too said cowpersmith although it wasnt really true murray looked a little bit fine and a lot prosperous the medallion that hung over his rawsilk shirt was clearly gold and he wore a very expensive looking though ugly thick wristwatch the thing was he also looked about fifteen years older than he had eighteen months before they sat in two facing armchairs one a broken lounger the other so overstuffed that the stuffing was curling out of it the girl sat crosslegged between them on the floor and murray idly played with her tied curls cooper had changed to the new york queens and somebody had turned the volume down or else the shelter of the stairwell did the same thing for them cowpersmith got several words of what murray was saying ajob cowpersmith repeated what kind of ajob the finest fucking job in all the world said murray and laughed and laughed poking the girls shoulder when he had calmed down he said what do you work for tud cowpersmith said angrily god you know i worked for the advertising agency until they took cigarette ads off tv then i was with the oil company until no no for what purpose cowpersmith shrugged money sure but what do you do with the money pay bills he guessed no no damn it after you do all the lousy stuff like that what do you do with the extra money like when you were still pulling down twentyfive k at the agency and everything was on the expense account anyway oh sure it had been so long ago cowpersmith had almost forgotten fun good food plays girls cars right on cried murray and thats what everyone else works for too everybody but me thats what my job is i dont have to work for those things because i work at them i dont imagine youre going to believe this tud but its true he added as an afterthought cowpersmith looked down at the girl and swallowed hard a dismal vision flashed through his mind of the five crumpled twenties in his pocket turning out to be joke money that turned over might say april fool or held for ten minutes might evaporate their ink leaving bare paper and ruin i dont have any idea of what youre talking about he said to murray but still looking at the girl you think im stoned murray said accurately well i dont blame you look well lets see shirley he said half laughing how do we explain this try it this way he went on not waiting for her help suppose you had all the money in the world suppose you had more money than you even wanted right i follow you i mean as a theoretical thing and then suppose you had like an accident crashbang youre in a car accident or a piano falls on you quadriplegic cant have any fun anymore got that bad scene said cowpersinith nodding all right but even though you can t do much yourself anymore theres a way you can have some fun vicariously like youre not going to ibiza yourself but youre seeing slides of it or something you cant get the kicks a normal person can but you can get something maybe not much but better than nothing out of what other people do now in that position tud what would you do kill myself no you wouldnt for christs sake youd hire other people to have fun for you and then with this process he patted the ugly thing that looked like a wristwatch but cowpersmith now realized was not you can play back their fun and maybe it isnt much but its all the jollies you can ever get right shirley she shook her head and said sweetly shit well anyway its something like that i guess its kind of secret i think probably because its someone like howard hughes or maybe one of the roekefellers thats involved they wont say but the jobs for real tud all i have to do is have all the fun i can they pick up the tab it all goes on the credit card and they get the bill and they pay it as long as i wear this thing thats all i have to do and every friday besides all that five hundred in cash there was a pause while bette midler flowed over and around them from the speakers and cowpersmith looked from the girl to his friend waiting for the joke part at last he said but nobody gets a job like that wrong friend said shirley you did just now if you want it ill take you there tomorrow morning behind the door stenciled etc importexport co ltd there was nothing more than a suite of offices sparsely occupied and eccentrically furnished hardly furnished at all you might say there was nobody at the reception desk which shirley walked right past and no papers on the desk of the one man anywhere visible ive got a live one for you mr morris shirley sang out friend of murrays mr morris looked like a printing salesman about fifty plump studying cowpersmith over half glasses good producer he agreed reluctantly all right youre hired and he counted out five hundred dollars in bills of various sizes and pushed them across the desk to cowpersmith cowpersmith picked up the money feeling instantly stoned is that all there is to it no not for me ive got all the paperwork now your credit card keeping records i mean like dont you want me to fill out an application form certainly not he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a wristwatchshaped thing cowpersmith could not see all of the inside of the drawer from his angle but he was nearly sure there was nothing else in it he handed it to cowpersmith and said once you put it on it wont come off by itself but well unlock it any time you want to quit thats all go have fun by which he added i dont actually mean screwing because weve got plenty of records of that already what then asked cowpersmith disconcerted hell man up to you water skiing skin diving breaking the bank at monte carlo what do you dream about when things look bad you do dream dont you well sure but cowpersmith hesitated thinking i always wanted to eat at la tour dargent and uh theres this crazy poison fish they have in japan sounds good the man said without enthusiasm ill have your card delivered to you at your hotel tomorrow yes but wait a minute whats the catch no catch tud said shirley annoyed jesus what does it take to convince you nothing like this ever happened to me before there has to be something wrong with it no there doesnt said mr morris and i have to get busy on your card cowpersmith found himself standing up no wait he said howhow long does the job last shrug until you get bored i guess then what then you turn in your recordings and you take your last weeks pay and go look for another job recordings cowpersmith looked down at his wrist where without thinking about it he had clasped on the metal object is this a tape recorder im not into that part of it mr morris said i only know my job and ive just done it goodby and that was all she wrote at shirleys urging cowpersrnith checked into a small but very nice hotel on the upper east side went to a massage parlor iceskated at rockefeller center and met shirley for a late drink in a greek bar in chelsea good start she said now youre on your own got any plans well he said experimenta ly i think i can still make the mardi gras in rio and i heard about a safari tour to kenya travel huh why not she finished her drink well well keep in touch no take it easy he said i dont understand some things there isnt any reason for you to understand just enioy i tried to call murray but hes gone off somewhere and yoare going too right look she said youre going to ask some probably very important questions to you but all i knows my own job which is which is none of your business go enjoy when mr morris wants to he in touch with you hell be in touch with you no dont ask how hell find you hell find you and so good night and so for eight dynamite months tud cowpersmith enioyed he did everything he had ever wanted to do he made the carnival in rio and discovered heartsofpalm soup in a restaurant overlooking the copacabana beach he rode a hydrofoil around leningrad and toured the hermitage bloated on fresh caviar gypsy violins in soho pounded abalone on fishermans wharf a nudeencounter weekend at big sur highstakes gambling in macao firstclass stewardesses on half a dozen airlines began to recognize him in half a dozen languages shirley turned up once in his suite at the george cinq but only to tell him he was doing fine another time he thought he saw murray pushing a scooter at the copenhagen airport but he was going one way and murray another and there was no way for cowpersmith to get off the moving person carrier to catch him he took up motorcycle racing and tried to enjoy listening to the harpsichord and in spite of what morris had said repeatedly and enthusiastically enjoyed a great deal of sex it was at the time of his second case of gonorrhea that he began to feel enough was very nearly enough and then one morning his phone rang cowpersrnith said mr morris tinny little voice very far away you dont seem to be having a lot of fun right now are you about ready to quit although the pleasure had not been quite as much pleasure lately the prospect of losing it was very much pain no yelped cowpersmith what are you talking about hell man you should see the girl i just he looked around he was alone in the big bed i mean ive got this date no whispered the small voice thats not good enough your eis been down for three weeks now not below the threshold yet we can still get a little good stuff from you but the qualitys definitely down cowpersmith and somethings got to be done about it dismayed cowpersmith sat up and swung his feet over the side of the bed how do you know aboutwhat is it my ei emotional index well what do you think man we continuously monitor the product and it just isnt what we want yeah cowpersmith conceded look i just woke up and im a little fuzzy but he got out of bed car rying the phone and sat in a chair by the window outside was grosvenor square with a demonstration going on in front of the american embassy so he knew he was in the europa in london but what cowpersrnith but ill think of something hold on by this time the staff of the hotel had learned to value him and understand his likes so the floor waiter alerted by the incoming phone call was bringing in his black coffee american style with two large glasses of fresh orange juice cowpersrnith swallowed a little of one and a little of the other and said listen can you give me an idea of what he likes who likes whoever it is is paying for all this stuff i cant discuss our clients said mr morris they told me not to well can you give me some idea no i dont know what youve been doing the monitor doesnt show that it shows where you are and how youre feeling thats it we wont know exactly what youve been up to until the debriefing when they study the recordings me ill never know not my department well dont you have any idea what kind of stuff they like mostly any kind of stuff they havent had before hah cowpersmith thought wildly listen hows this has anybody just sort of sat and meditated for you pause you mean like religious meditation like some kind of guru well yes or just sitting and thinking like you know thoreau at walden pond i give it fortyeight hours said mr morris orwell how about skin diving again the doctor told me to lay off for a little while until my ear healed up after bermuda but i heard about this neat stuff at the great barrier reef and cowpersmith said the tiny voice you know what youre costing not counting the half a thousand a week in cash your charge has been running over fortyeight hundred a week on the average you got to show more than some spearfishing maybe a couple weeks from now you got to show today and tomorrow and every day so long so cowpersmith kept at it the meditation didnt seem to be going well after the first hour so he hired a new travel consultant and for a while things looked bright or bright enough maybe he backpacked across the trinity mountains and flew to naples for a swim in the blue grotto he ate couscous and drank akvavit and smoked acapulco gold all in their native environment then he took a pack mule through the montana hills and flew back to naples for four hours of clambering around the ruins of pompeii and hit paris for nightclubs and waikiki for surfing but a couple of wipeouts at diamond head made his ear feel worse and one nightclub turned out to be an awful lot like another except that where the toilet jokes were in french he couldnt understand them he knew the phone was going to ring again he didnt need the little machine on his wrist to tell him he was down he felt down so he came to a decision and just sat in his hotel room sullenly waiting he had already put eleven thousand dollars in a numbered bank account in bern and paid off all his old debts and if it was over it was over but he didnt want it to be over the more he thought about it the more he didnt want it to be over it was after all the finest fucking job in all the world and everything murray had said about it was true no more headwaiters falling all over themselves no more pretty women to take to the clubs to the tracks to bed he ordered up a couple of bottles of brandy and worked himself up to a weeping drunk and when the next morn ing it was inevitably followed by a drymouthed burning bellied hangover he sat wallowing in the misery of his thousandfrancaday suite shaking and enfeebled barely moving to order up food and more booze and more food the longer he sat the worse he felt and the next day and the next day and and by the fifth day after most of a week of solid sullen misery he realized that his phone had not rung why not he certainly wasnt enjoying he didnt understand why but when it came through to his mind that it was so he didnt really care why hope was back the magic money machine had not turned itself off so he cleaned himself up he got himself dressed he waved off the floor waiter and the majordomo and the concierge and went out for a walk a perfectly dull uninteresting unexciting walk up the champs elysees to the lido arcade he ate a quiche and drank a beer and dropped in on a flick it was an old barbra streisand with french subtitles he had seen it before and he didnt care it bored the ears off him he enjoyed being bored very much but when he got back to the hotel new york was on the line for homey pleasures said mr morris small distant voice you dont get paid this kind of money you want a mcdonalds hamburger quit and come back i had this feeling youd call cowpersmith acknowledged what can i say ive had it with joy it is no fun anymore so quit this was your second warning anyhow and you dont get but three all right said cowpersmith after a moment of digesting that bit of information but tell me one thing last week i was really down how come you didnt fire me then last week last week you were great i thought you knew pleasure isnt the only sensation they like you mean youll pay me for misery one of our best units said the little voice in his ear was terminal stomach cancer they paid him five grand a week plus full medical every week he didnt take painkillers that took a moment to digest too and it went down hard but cowpersmith began to see hope well i dont want to go that far whatever you were doing last week was far enough id say then maybe i could sure said mr morris nice talking to you third strike is out ensued some of the most depressing weeks of cowpersmiths life not miserable at least not reliably miserable he could not even be sure from day to day that he was quite bugged enough to register a decent misery on his wristband and that in itself was discouraging he tried everything he could think of inspiration struck and he made a quick list of all the things he had been putting off because they were awful went to the dentist had a barium enema got tattooed that took care of three days and looking back at them honestly he had to admit they were not memorably bad merely lousy he flew back to washington and spent two afternoons in the senate gallerymerely tedious after the first half hour he stopped hearing what was being said and caught himself drowsing off he flanged together two stereo systems and poured thirty watts of acid rock into one earpiece and mahler into the other and came out with only a headache he invented excuses to go in and out of kennedy airport with special emphasis on the customs line and the hack stands but after a while even that anger diminished food remembering all the enjoyment he had had from good food he looked for dyspepsia and displeasure from bad he ate a haggis in glasgow flew to heathrow and had brawn for dinner caught a commuter flight to paris and had an american breakfast at orly none of it worked very well it proved to be harder to make oneself unhappy than to find joy which had after all lasted for the best part of a year the other thing was that deliberately making oneself unhappy made one well unhappy it was not a way he liked to live he discovered that twenty cups of coffee a day sixty cigarettes and a maximum of three hours of sleep gave him a perpetual headachy feeling that made everything an annoyance but the other side of the coin was that nothing was much more than an annoyance he was simply too beat to care in desperation he returned to the states and delved into copies of the underground press answering all the ads he could find for instruction discipline and so on but that mostly got him a large number of fbi men and postal inspectors and the sm experiences were basically he thought pretty god awful anyway so he was not all that surprised when less than five weeks from the second warning his phone rang again he was in waikiki where he had been nerving himself up to trying to get his ear hurting again in the surf and he was frankly grateful to be spared it third times the charm said the little voice come home come home for debriefing im fired right well said distant mr morris judiciously you stop working for us as soon as youre debriefed but you get a years severance pay which comes to lets see twenty six k wow cried cowpersmith and then uh say was that you know just to give me a high no although you did register a beaut no its real you just have to turn over the recording and youre on your own well said cowpersmith picking up the phone and walking out onto the lanai well he said surrendering a dream i guess thats about it then isnt it ill catch the first plane tomorrow no said mr morris you wont do that youll catch the next plane right now weve arranged for your tickets theyll be at the desk when you check out which should be in fifteen minutes and five minutes after he hung up the uikai bellman was at the door eager for cowpersmiths one beaten bag mr morris had been very thorough they not only had cowpersmiths ticket at the desk they had an envelope with two twentydollar bills and ten singles for tips and miscellaneous and they also had their instructions about his credit card im very sorry said the clerk politely but as of the time you settle your account with us your card is canceled and we have to pick it up its part of our contract with the company well fine said cowpersmith tell you what i forgot to pick up a couple little things in the shops so let me have the card for a minute before i finish settling up so sorry said the clerk you already have and now when it was all over cowpersmith spent his time in the taxi to the airport thinking of things he could have done but had not he got onto the plane in a daze of missed menus and untried wines and had to be prodded sharply by the stewardess before he realized he was in the wrong part of the airplane sorry he mumbled allowing himself to be led aft he glanced around with some wonder he had almost forgotten that there were parts of a where people sat three abreast at kennedy he was met shirley he stared at her through gummed eyelids by the sun it was late afternoon but by the clock of his body it was eight in the morning after a night with no more sleep than a man can get sitting in a coach seat between a fat plumber on a group tour and a small boy who alternated snoring and leaping about had fun she asked steering him toward a chauffeurdriven bentley you know better than i he said bitterly trying to take the wristband off and slap it in her palm the gesture failed because it still would not come open youll feel better when we get going she said ive got a thermos of coffee its about an hours drive i know i know grumped cowpersmith who had after all been in and out on the kennedymanhattan run more times than he could count but when the chauffeur took a righthand turn where there had always been a left he realized he did not know it did not seem important and he drowsed until the car stopped doors opened heres your boy morrie looks like well have to carry him in and he opened his eyes to see mr morris and the chauffeur tugging at him em all right he said with dignity and halfway up the pebbled walk looked around and said where is this place anyway porticoed porch ivied walls he had not seen it before where you get debriefed said shirley pausing at the door so long tud he hesitated youre not coming in will i see you again ill see you she said patted his shoulderblade and returned to the car sensory impressions smote him an entrance hall with a staircase winding up under a huge canvasshrouded painting in a gilt frame a library of glassedin shelves mostly empty with dropclothed chairs around a cold and swept fireplace a dining hall and beyond it a closed door does he live in this place whoever he is asked cowpersmith staring about mr morris sighed there is no he he said patiently there are they they are here some of them this is the part i hate he added morosely why well youre going to ask a lot of questions again you all do and youre going to figure youve done your bit now you have a right to know right and maybe in a sense you do although its pretty pointless anyway what we do now we take the recordings from you and when weve got enough to make a shipment we send them off i dont know where exactly i dont know what they do with them exactly but its a big business with them big business misconceptions and erroneous as sumptions were splintering in cowpersmiths brain well like a tv network i mean i think they kind of broadcast them sort of like a national geographic television special sensory impressions from all over strange pleasures of the aborigines i never said cowpersrnith positively apprehensions dissolving the sleep from his mind heard any broadcast like that no not on this planet no cowpersmith swallowed choking on apprehensions and the splinters of former certainties the mistake you made said mr morris sympathetically is that you assumed the people who hired you were human beings theyre not no you wouldnt think so if youd seen one they uh well they look a little bit like fish and a little bit like the devil all red you see and not very big but murray said oh christ said mr morris how could murray know if its any consolation to you when he was debriefed he was as surprised as you are it gets everybody the same way bloody charming said cowpersmith bitterly now im an agent of a foreign power i wouldnt be surprised if the fbi picks me up about this i would said mr morris in there go on where there through the door what do we do in there cowpersmith demanded truculent because the only alternative was being terrified you turn over the recording to them and thats that said mr morris cowperstnith swallowed again choking this time on plain panic he wished that the car hadnt gone away still he thought they had to be somewhere on long island maybe sands point maybe patchogue and he still had most of the fifty dollars plus whatever had been left in his coat plus of course that swiss bank account there would be a taxi okay he said tugging at the wristband lets get it over with and ill get out of here oh said mr morris annoyed what are you doing thats not the recording thats only the monitor so we could tell how you were doing and where you were you turn over the recording in there and he opened the door behind the dining hall two men in white stepped through they were not smiling they were without expression like saloon bouncers or dog catchers the room behind them looked like an operating chamber bright lights over a flat white table rows of transparent jars lined the shelves around the room they came in two sizes in the large red and hideous things stirred uneasily looking out toward cowpersmith with great pale eyes in the smaller jars of which there were more than a dozen were the floating objects in them really human heads and that one there next to the brighter of the two red creatures the one with the wild red eyebrowswasnt it very familiar it was too late to turn the men were reaching out for him as mr morris said from behind him sadly disclaimingly what better recording could they have than the one in your own brain
