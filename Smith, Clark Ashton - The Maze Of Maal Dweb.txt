the maze of maal dweb clark ashton smith alternative version of the maze of the enchanter by the light of the four small wanimg moons of xiccarph tiglari had crossed that bottomless swamp wherein no reptile dwelt and no dragon descended but where the pitchblack ooze was alive with incessant heavings he had not cared to use the high causey of corundum that spanned the fen and had threaded his way with much peril from isle to sedgy isle that shuddered gelatinously beneath him when he reached the solid shore and the shelter of the palmtall rushes he did not approach the porphyry stairs that wound skyward through giddy chasms and along glassy scarps to the house of maal dweb the causey and the stairs were guarded by the silent colossal automatons of maal dweb whose arms ended in long crescent blades of tempered steel which were raised in implacable scything against any who came thither without their masters permission tiglaris naked body was smeared with the juice of a plant repugnant to all the fauna of xiccarph by virtue of this he hoped to pass unharmed the ferocious apelike creatures that roamed at will through the tyrants cliffhung gardens he carried a coil of woven rootfibre strong and light and weighted with a brazen ball for use in climbing the mesa at his side in a sheath of chimeraskin he wore a needlesharp knife that had been dipped in the poison of winged vipers many before tiglari with the same noble dream of tyrannicide had attempted to cross the fen and scale the scarps but none had returned and the fate of such as had won to the palace of maal dweb was a muchdisputed problem but tiglari the skilled jungle hunter was undeterred by the hideous dubieties before him that escalade would have been an improbable feat by the full light of the three suns of xiccarph with eyes keen as those of some nightflying pterodactyl tiglari hurled his weighted coil about narrow coigns and salients he climbed with simian ease from footheld to foothold and at length he gained a little buttress beneath the last cliff from this vantage it was easy to fling his rope around a crooked tree that leaned gulfward with scimitar like foliage from the gardens evading the sharp semimetallic leaves that slashed downward as the tree bent limberly with his weight he stood stooping warily on the fearsome and fabled mesa here it was said with no human aid the halfdemoniac sorcerer had carved a mountains pinnacles into walls domes and turrets and had leveled the rest of the mountain to a flat space about them this space he had covered with loamy soil produced by magic and therein he had planted curious baneful trees from outlying worlds together with flowers that might have been those of some exuberant hell little enough was known of these gardens but the flora that grew upon the northern southern and western sides of the palace was believed to be less deadly than that which faced the dawning of the three suns much of this latter vegetation accordiag to myth had been trained and topiarized in the form of a labyrinth balefully ingenious that concealed atrocious traps and unknown dooms mindful of this labyrinth tiglari had appraached the place on the side toward the sunset breathless from his climb he crouched in the garden shadows about him heavyhooded blossoms leaned in venomous languor or fawned with open mouths that exhaled a narcotic perfume or diffused a pollen of madness anomalous multiform with silhouettes that curdled the blood or touched the mind with nightmare the trees of maal dweb appeared to gather and conspire against him some arose with the sinuous towering of plumed pythons of aigretted dragons others crouched with radiating limbs like the hairy members of giant spiders they seemed to close in upon tiglari they waved their frightful darts of thorn their scythelike leaves they blotted the four moons with webs of arabesque menace with endless caution the hunter made his way forward seeking a rift in the monstrous hedge his faculties ever alert wore quickened still more by fear and hatred the fear was not for himself but for the girl athlй his beloved and the fairest of his tribe who had gone up alone that evening by the causey of corundum and the porphyry stairs at the summons of maal dweb his hatred was that of an outraged lover for the allpowerful alldreaded tyrant whom no man had ever seen and from whose abode no woman ever came back who spoke with an iron voice audible in far cities or outmost jungles who punished the disobedient with a doom of falling fire swifter than the thunderstone maal dweb had taken ever the fairest from among the maidens of the planet xiccarph and no mansion of the walled towns or outland cave was exempt from his scrutiny he had chosen no less than fifty girls during the period of his tyranny and these forsaking their lovers and kinsfolk voluntarily lest the wrath of maal dweb should descend upon them had gone one by one to the mountain citadel and were lost behind its cryptic walls there as the odalisques of the ageing sorcerer they were supposed to dwell in halls that multiplied their beauty with a thousand mirrors and were said to have for servants women of brass and men of iron tiglari had poured before athlй his uncouth adoration and the spoils of the chase but having many rivals was unsure of her favor cool as a riverlily she had accepted inpartially his worship and that of the others among whom the warrior mocair was perhaps the most formidable returning from the hunt tiglari had found the tribe in lamentation and learning that athlй had departed to the harem of maal dweh was swift to follow he had not told his intention to anyone since the ears of maal dweb were everywhere and he did not know whether mocair or any of the others had preceded him in his desperate errantry but it was not unlikely that mocair had already dared the obscure and hideous perils of the mountain the thought of this was enough to drive tiglari forward with a rash disregard of the clutching foliations and reptile flowers he came to a gap in the horrible grove and saw the saffron lights from the sorcerers windows the lights were vigilant as dragons eyes and appeared to regard him with an evil awareness but tiglari leapt toward them across the gap and heard the clash of sabered leaves meeting behind him before him was an open lawn covered with a queer grass that squirmed like innumerable worms under his feet he did not care to linger upon that lawn there were no footmarks in the grass but nearing the palace portico he saw a coil of thin rope that someone had flung aside and surmised that mocair had preceded him there were paths of mottled marble about the palace and fountains that played from the throats of carven monsters the open portals were unguarded and the whole building was still as a mausoleum lit by windless lamps tiglari however mistrusted this appearance of quietude and slumber and followed the bordering paths for some distance before daring to approach nearer to the palace certain large and shadowy animals which he took for the apish monsters of maal dweb went by him in the gloom some of them ran in fourfooted fashion while others maintained the halferect posture of anthropoids but all were hairy and uncouth they did not offer to molest tiglari but whining dismally they slunk away as if to avoid him by this token he knew that they were actual beasts and could not abide the odor with which he had smeared his limbs and torso at length he came to a lampless columncrowded portico and gliding silently as a jungle snake he entered the mysterious house of maal dweb a door stood open behind the dark pillars and beyond the door he discerned the dim reaches of an empty hall tiglari went in with redoubled caution and began to follow the arrased wall the place was full of unknown perfumes languorous and somnolent a subtle reek as of censers in hidden alcoves of love he did not like the perfumes and the silence troubled him more and more it seemed to him that the darkness was thick with unheard breathings was alive with invisible movements slowly like the opening of great yellow eyes yellow flames arose in lamps of copper along the hall tiglari hid himself behind an arras and peering forth presently he saw that the hall was still deserted finally he dared to resume his progress all around him the rich hangings broidered with purple men and blue women on a field of blood appeared to stir with uneasy life in a wind he could not feel but there was no sign of the presence of maal dweb or his metal servitors and human odalisques the doors on either side of the hall with cunningly mated valves of ebony and ivory were all closed at the far end tiglari saw a thin rift of light in a somber double arras parting the arras very slowly he peered through into a huge brilliantly lit chamber that seemed to be the harem of maal dweb peopled with all the girls that the enchanter had summoned to his dwelling it seemed in fact that there were hundreds leaning or lying on ornate couches or standing in attitudes of languor or terror tiglari discerned in the throng the women of ommuzain whose flesh is whiter than desert salt the slim girls of uthmai who are molded from breathing palpitating jet the queenly topaz girls of equatorial xala and the small women of ilap who have the tones of newly greening bronze but among them all he could not find the lotuslike beauty of athlй much he marveled at the number of the women and the perfect stillness with which they maintained their various postures they were like goddesses that slept in some enchanted hall of eternity tiglari the intrepid hunter was awed and frightened these women if indeed they were women and not mere statues were surely the thralls of a deathlike spell here indeed was proof of the sorcery of maal dweb however if tiglari were to continue his search he must traverse that enchanted chamber feeling that a marble sleep might descend upon him at the crossing of the sill he went in with held breath and furtive leopardlike paces about him the women preserved their eternal stillness each it seemed had been overcome by the spell at the instant of same particular emotion whether of fear wonder curiosity vanity weariness anger or voluptuousness their number was fewer than he had supposed and the room itself was smaller but metal mirrors paneling the walls had created an illusion of multitude and immensity at the farther end he parted a second double arras and peered into a twilight chamber illumined dimly by two censers that gave forth a particolored glow the censers stood on tripods facing each other between them beneath a canopy of some dark and smoldering stuff with hinges braided like womens hair was a couch of nightdeep purples bordered with silver birds that fought against golden snakes on the couch in sober garments a man reclined as if weary or asleep the mans face was dim with everwavering shadows but it did mot occur to tiglari that this was any other than the redoubtable tyrant whom he had come to slay he knew that this was maal dweb whom no man had seen in the flesh but whose power was manifest to all the occult omniscent ruler of xiccarph the suzerain of the three suns and of all their planets and moons like ghostly sentinels the symbols of the grandeur of maal dweb the images of his frightful empire rose up to confront tiglari but the thought of athlй was a red mist that blotted all he forgot his eery terrors his awe of that wizard palace the rage of the bereaved lover the bloodthirst of the cunning hunter awoke within him he neared the unconscious sorcerer and his hand tightened on the hilt of the needlesharp knife that had been dipped in vipervenom the man before him lay with closed eyes and a cryptic weariness on his mouth and eyelids he seemed to meditate rather than sleep like one who wanders in a maze of distant memories or profound reveries about him the walls were draped with funereal hangings darkly figured above him the twin censers wrought a cloudly glow and diffused throughout the room their drowsy myrrh which made tiglaris senses swim with a strange dimness crouching tigerwise he made ready for the stroke then mastering the subtle vertigo of the perfume he rose up and his arm with the darting movement of some heavy but supple adder struck fiercely at the tyrants heart it was as if he tried to pierce a wall of stone in midair before and above the recumbent enchanter the knife clashed on some unseen impenetrable substance and the point broke off and tinkled on the floor at tiglaris feet uncomprehending baffled he peered at the being whom he had sought to slay maal dweb had not stirred nor opened his eyes but his look of enigmatic weariness was somehow touched with a faint and cruel amusement tiglari put out his hand to verify a curious notion that had occurred to him even as he had suspected there was no couch or canopy between the censers only a vertical unbroken highly polished surface in which the couch and its occupant were apparently reflected but to his further mystification he himself was not visible in the mirror he whirled about thinking that maal dweb must be somewhere in the room even as he turned the funereal draperies rushed back with a silken evil whispering from the walls as if drawn by unseen hands the chamber leapt into sudden glaring light the walls appeared to recede illimitably and naked giants whose umberbrowm limbs and torsos glistened as if smeared with ointment stood in menacing postures on every side their eyes glowered like those of jungle creatures and each of them held an enormous knife from which the point had been broken this thought tiglari was a fearsome thaumaturgy and he crouched down wary as a trapped animal to await the assault of the giants but these beings crouching simultaneously mimicked his every movement it came to him that what he saw was his own reflection multiplied in the mirrors he turned again the tasseled canopy the couch of nightdark purples the reclining dreamer had vanished only the censers remained rearing before a glassy wall that gave back like the others the reflection of tiglari himself baffled and terrified he felt that maal dweb the allseeing allpotent magician was playing a game and was deluding him with elaborate mockeries rashly indeed had tiglari pitted his simple brawn and forest craft against a being capable of such demoniac artifice he dared not stir he scarcely ventured to breathe the monstrous reflections appeared to watch him like giants guarding a captive pigmy the light which streamed as if from hidden lamps in the mirrors took on a more pitiless and alarming luster the reaches of the room seemed to deepen and far away in their shadows he saw the gathering of vapors with human faces that melted and reformed incessantly and were never twice the same ever the weird radiance brightened ever the mist of faces like a hellborn smoke dissolved and relimned itself behind the immobile giants in the lengthening vistas how long tiglari waited he could not tell the bright frozen horror of that room was a thing apart from time now in the lit air a voice began to speak a voice that was toneless deliberate and disembodied it was faintly contemptuous a little weary slightly cruel it was near as the beating of tiglaris heart and yet infinitely far what do you seek tiglari said the voice do you think to enter with impunity the palace of maal dweb others many others with the same intentions have come before you but all have paid a price for their temerity i seek the maiden athlй said tiglari what have you done with her athlй is very beautiful returned the voice it is the will of maal dweb to make a certain use of her loveliness the use is not one that should concern a hunter of wild beasts you are unwise tiglari where is athlй persisted the hunter she has gone to find her fate in the labyrinth of maal dweb not long ago the warrior mocair who had followed her to my palace went out at my suggestion to pursue his search amid the threadless windings of that nevertobeexhausted maze go now tiglari and seek her also there are many mysteries in my labyrinth and among them perhaps is one which you are destined to solve a door had opened in the mirrorpaneled wall emerging as if from the mirrors two of the metal slaves of maal dweb had appeared taller than living men and gleaming from head to foot with implacable lusters as of burnished swords they came forward upon tiglari the right arm of each was handed with a great sickle hastily the hunter went out through the opened door and heard behind him the surely clash of its meeting valves the short night of the planet xiccarph was not yet over and the moons had all gone down but tiglari saw before him the beginning of the fabled maze illumined by glowing globular fruits that hang lanternwise from arches of foliage guided only by their light he entered the labyrinth at first it was a place of elfin fantasies there were quaint paths pillared with antic trees latticed with drolly peering faces of extravagant orchids that led the seeker to hidden surprising bowers of goblinry it was as if those outer mazes had been planned wholly to entice and beguile then by vague degrees it seemed that the designers mood had darkened had become more ominous and baleful the trees that lined the way with their twisted intertwining boles were laoc цons of struggle and torture lit by enormous fungi that seemed to lift unholy tapers the path ran downward to eery pools alight with wreathing witchfires or climbed with evilly tilted steps through caverns of closeset leafage that shone like brazen dragonscales it divided at every turn the branching multiplied and skilled though he was in junglecraft it would have been impossible for tiglari to retrace his wanderings he kept on hoping that chance would somehow lead him to athlй and many times he called her name aloud but was answered only by remote derisive echoes or by the dolorous howling of some unseen beast now he was mounting through arbors of malignant hydra growths that coiled and uncoiled tumultuously about him the way lightened more and more the nightshining fruits and blossoms were pale and sickly as the dying tapers of a witches revel the earliest of the three suns had risen and its gambogeyellow beams were filtering in through the frilled and venomous vines far off and seeming to fall from some hidden height in the maze before him he heard a chorus of brazen voices that were like articulate bells he could not distinguish the words but the accents were those of a solemn announcement fraught with portentous finality they ceased and there was no sound other than the hiss and rustle of swaying plants it seemed now as tiglari went on that his every step was predestined he was no longer free to choose his way for many of the paths were overgrown by things that he did not care to face and others were blocked by horrid portcullises of cacti or ended in pools that teemed with leeches larger than tunnies the second and third suns arose heightening with their emerald and carmine rays the horror of the strange web closing ineluctably about him he climbed on by stairs that reptilian vines had taken and gradients lined with tossing clashing aloes rarely could he see the reaches below or the levels toward which he was tending somewhere on the blind path he met one of the apelike animals of maal dweb a dark savage creature sleek and glistening like a wet otter as if it bathed in one of the pools it passed him with a hoarse growl recoiling as the others had done fron his repulsively smeared body but nowhere could he find the maiden athlй or the warrior mocair who had preceded him into the maze he came to a curious little pavement of onyx oblong and surrounded by enormous flowers with bronzelike stems and great leaning bells that might have been the mouths of chimeras yawning to disclose their crimson throats he stepped forward upon the pavement through a narrow gap in this siagular hedge and stood staring irresolutely at the serried blooms for here the way seemed to end the onyx beaeath his feet was wet with some unknown sticky fluid a quick sense of peril stirred within him and he turned to retrace his steps at his first movement toward the opening through which he had entered a long tendril like a wire of bronze recoiled with lightning rapidity from the base of each of the flower sterns and closed about his ankles he stood trapped and helpless at the center of a taut net then while he struggled impotently the stems began to lean and tilt toward him till the red mouths of their blossoms were close about his knees like a circle of fawning monsters nearer they came almost touching him from their lips a clear hueless liquid dripping slowly at first and then running in little rills descended on his feet and ankles and shanks indescribably his flesh crawled beneath it then there was a passing numbness then a furious stinging like the bites of innumerable insects between the crowding heads of the flowers he saw that his legs had undergone a mysterious and horrifying change their natural hairiness had thickened had assumed a shaggy pile like the fur of apes the shanks themselves had somehow shortened and the feet had grown longer with uncouth fingerlike toes such as were possessed by the animals of maal dweb in a frenzy of nameless alarm he drew his brokentipped knife and began to slash at the flowers it was as if he had assailed the armored heads of dragons or had struck at ringing bells of iron the blade snapped at the hilt then the blossoms lifting hideously were leaning about his waist were laving his hips and thighs in their thin evil slaver with the senses of one who drowns in nightmare he heard the startled cry of a woman above the tilted flowers he beheld a strange scene which the hitherto impenetrable maze parting as if by magic had revealed fifty feet away on the same level as the onyx pavement there stood an elliptic dais of moonwhite stone at whose center the maiden athlй emerging from the labyrinth on a raised porphyry walk had paused in an attitude of wonder before her in the claws of an immense marble lizard that reared above the dais a round mirror of steely metal was held upright athlй as if fascinated by some strange vision was peering into the disk midway between the pavement and the dais a row of slender brazen columns rose at broad intervals topped with graven heads like demoniac termini tiglari would have called out to athlй but at that moment she took a single step toward the mirror as if drawn by something that she saw in its depths and the dull disk seemed to brighten with some internal incandescent flame the hunters eyes were blinded by the spiky rays that leapt forth from it for an instant enveloping and transfixing the maiden when the dimness cleared away in whirling blots of color he saw that athlй in a pose of statuesque rigidity was still regarding the mirror with startled eyes she had not moved the wonder was frozen on her face and it came to tiglari that she was like the women who slept an enchanted slumber in the harem of maal dweb even as this thought occurred to him he heard a ringing chorus of metallic voices that seemed to emanate from the graven demon heads of the columns the maiden athlй annoumced the voices in solemn and portentous tones has beheld herself in the mirror of eternity and has passed beyond the changes and corruptions of time tiglari felt as if he were sinking into some obscure and terrible fen he could comprehend nothing of what had befallen athlй and his own fate was an equally dark and dreadful enigma beyond the solution of a simple hunter now the blossoms had lifted about his shoulders were laving his arms his body beneath their abhorrent alchemy the transformation continued a long fur sprang up on the thickening torso the arms lengthened they became simian the hands took on a likeness to the feet from the neck downward tiglari differed in no wise from the apish creatures of the garden in helpless abject horror he waited for the completion of the metamorphosis then he became aware that a man in sober garments with eyes and mouth filled with the weariness of strange things was standing before him behind the man were two of the sicklehanded iron automatons in a somewhat languid voice the man uttered an unknown word that vibrated in the air with prolonged mysterious aftertones the circle of craning flowers drew back from tiglari resuming their former upright positions in a close hedge and the wiry tendrils were withdrawn from his ankles hardly able to comprehend his release he heard a sound of brazen voices and knew dimly that the demon heads of the columns had spoken saying the hunter tiglari has been laved in the nectar of the blossoms of primordial life and has become in all ways from the neck downward even as the beasts that he hunted when the chorus ceased the weary man in sober raimeat came nearer and addressed him i maal dweb had planned to deal with you precisely as i dealt with mocair and many others mocair was the beast that you met in the labyrinth with newmade fur still sleek and wet from the liquor of the flowers and you saw some of his predcecssors about the palace however i find that my whims are not always the same you tiglari unlike the others shall at least remain a man from the neck upward you are free to resume your wanderings in the labyrinth and escape from it if you can i do not wish to see you again and my clemency springs from another reason than esteem for your kind go now the maze has many windings which you are yet to traverse a great awe was upon tiglari his native fierceness his savage volition were tamed by the enchanters languid will with one backward look of concern and wonder at athlй he withdrew obediently slouching like a huge ape his fur glistening wetly to the three suns he vanished amid the labyrinth maal dweb attended by his metal slaves went over to the figure of athlй which still regarded the mirror with astonished eyes mong lut he said addressing by name the nearer of the two automatons at his heels it has been as you know my caprice to eternalize the frail beauty of women athlй like the others before her has explored my ingenious maze and has looked into that mirror whose sudden radiance turns the flesh to a stone fairer than marble and no less enduring also as you know it has been my whim to turn men into beasts with the copious fluid of certain artificial flowers so that their outer semblance should conform more strictly to their inner nature is it not well mong lut that i have done these things am i not maal dweb in whom all knowledge and all power reside yes master echoed the automaton you are maal dweb the allwise the allpowerful and it is well that you have done these things however continued maal dweb the repetition of even the most remarkable thaumaturgies can grow tiresome after a certain number of times i do not think that i shall deal again in this fashion with any woman or deal thus with any man is it not well mong lut that i should vary my sorceries in future am i not maal dweb the all resourceful indeed you are maal dweb agreed the automaton and it would no doubt be well for you to diversify your enchantments maal dweb was not ill pleased with the answers that the automaton had given he cared little for converse other than the iron echoing of his metal servitors who assented always to all that he said and spared him the tedium of arguments and it may have been that there were times when he wearied a little even of this and preferred the silence of the petrified women or the muteness of the beasts that could no longer call themselves men
