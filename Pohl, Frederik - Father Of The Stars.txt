father of the stars i norman marchand sat in the wings of the ballrooms small stage on a leather hassock someone had found for him there were people outside in the ballroom waiting to do him honor marchand remembered the ballroom very well he had once owned it forty no it wasnt forty not even fifty sixty years ago it had been sixty and more years ago that he and joyce had danced in that ballroom then the hotel was the newest on earth and he was the newly married son of the man who had built it and the party was the reception for his wedding to joyce of course none of these people would know about that but marchand remembered oh joyce my very dear but she had been dead a long time now it was a noisy crowd he peered out through the wings and could see the head table filling up there was the vicepresident of the united states shaking hands with the governor of ontario as though for the moment they had forgotten they were of different parties there was linfox from the institute obligingly helping a chimpanzee into the chair next to what judging by the microphones ranked before it would probably be marchands own linfox seemed a little ill at ease with the chimp the chimpanzee had no doubt been smithed but the imposition of human intelligence did not lengthen its apes legs then dan fleury appeared up the steps from the floor of the ballroom where the rest of the diners were taking their places fleury didnt look well at all marchand thought not without a small touch of satisfaction since fleury was fifteen years younger than himself still marchand wasnt jealous not even of the young bellhop who had brought him the hassock twenty years old at the most and built like a fullback one life was enough for a man to live especially when you had accomplished the dream you had set out to bring to fruition or almost of course it had cost him everything his father left but what else was money for its time to go in sir may i help you it was the young fullback nearly bursting his bellhops uniform with the huge hard muscles of youth he was very solicitous one of the nice things about having this testimonial dinner in a marchand hotel was that the staff was as deferential to him as though he still owned the place probably that was why the committee had picked it marchand ruminated quaint and oldfashioned as the hotel must seem now though at one time he recollected himself im sorry young man i was woolgathering thank you he stood up slowly but not very painfully considering that it had been a long day as the fullback walked him onto the stage the applause was enough to drive down the automatic volume control on his hearing aid for that reason he missed the first words from dan fleury no doubt they were complimentary very carefully he lowered himself into his chair and as the clapping eased off he was able to begin to hear the words dan fleury was still a tall man built like a barrel with bushy eyebrows and a huge mane of hair he had helped marchands mad project for thrusting man into space from its very beginnings he said as much now mans grandest dream he roared the conquering of the stars themselves and here is the one man who taught us how to dream it norman marchand marchand bowed to the storm of applause again his hearing aid saved his ears and cost him the next few words and now that we are on the threshold of success fleury was booming it is altogether fitting that we should gather here tonight to join in fellowship and in the expression of that grand hope to rededicate ourselves to its fulfillment and to pay our respects and give of our love to the man who first showed us what dream to have while the avc registered the power of dan fleurys oratory marchand smiled out on the foggy sea of faces it was he thought almost cruel of fleury to put it like that the threshold of success indeed how many years now had they waited on it patiently and the door still locked in their faces of course he thought wryly they must have calculated that the testimonial dinner would have to be held soon unless they wanted a cadaver for a guest but still he turned painfully and looked at fleury half perplexed there was something in his tone was there could there be there could not he told himself firmly there was no news no breakthrough no report from one of the wandering ships no dream come true at last he would have been the first to know not for anything would they have kept a thing like that from him and he did not know that thing and now fleury was saying i wont keep you from your dinners there will be many a long strong speech to help your digestions afterward i promise you but now lets eat laughter applause a buzz and clash of forks the injunction to eat did not of course include norman marchand he sat with his hands in his lap watching them dig in smiling and feeling just a touch deprived with the wry regret of the very old he didnt envy the young people anything really he told himself not their health their youth or their life expectancy but he envied them the bowls of ice he tried to pretend he enjoyed his wine and the huge pink shrimp in crackers and milk according to asa czerny who ought to know since he had kept marchand alive this long he had a clear choice he could eat whatever he chose or he could stay alive for a while and ever since czerny had been good enough or despairing enough to give him a maximum date for his life expectancy marchand had in idle moments tried to calculate just how much of those remaining months he was willing to give up for one really good meal he rather believed that when czerny looked up at him after the weekly medical checkup and said that only days were left that he would take those last days and trade them in for a sauerbraten with potato pancakes and sweetsour red cabbage on the side but that time was not yet with any kind of luck he still had a month perhaps as much as two i beg your pardon he said halfturning to the chimpanzee even smithed the animal spoke so poorly that marchand had not at first known that he was being addressed he should not have turned his wrist had lost its suppleness the spoon in his hand tilted the soggy crackers fell he made the mistake of trying to move his knee out of the way it was bad enough to be old he did not want to be sloppy and he moved too quickly the chair was at the very edge of the little platform he felt himself going over ninetysix is too old to be falling on your head he thought if i was going to do this sort of thing i might just as well have eaten some of those shrimp but he did not kill himself he only knocked himself unconscious and not for very long at that because he began to wake up while they were still carrying him back to his dressing room behind the stage once upon a time norman marchand had given his life to a hope rich intelligent married to a girl of beauty and tenderness he had taken everything he owned and given it to the institute for colonizing extrasolar planets he had to begin with given away several million dollars that was the whole of the personal fortune his father had left him and it was nowhere near enough to do the job it was only a catalyst he had used it to hire publicity men fund raisers investment counselors foundation managers he had spent it on documentary ifims and on tv commercials with it he had financed cocktail parties for united states senators and prize contests for the nations sixth grades and he had done what he set out to do he had raised money a very great deal of money he had taken all the money he had begged and teased out of the pockets of the world and used it to finance the building of twentysix great ships each the size of a dozen ocean liners and he had cast them into space like a farmer sowing wheat upon the wind i tried he whispered to himself returning from the darkest place he had ever seen i wanted to see man reach out and touch a new home and i wanted to be the one to guide him there and someone was saying he knew about it did he but we were trying to keep it quiet someone else told the first person to shut his mouth marchand opened his eyes czerny was there unsmiling he saw that marchand was conscious youre all right he said and marchand knew that it was true since czerny was scowling angrily at him if the news had been bad he would have smiled no you dont cried czerny catching him by the shoulder you stay right there youre going home to bed but you said i was all right i meant you were still breathing dont push it norm marchand protested but the dinner i ought to be there asa czerny had cared for marchand for thirty years they had gone fishing together and once or twice they had gotten drunk czerny would not have refused for nothing he only shook his head marchand slumped back behind czemy the chimpanzee was squatting silently on the edge of a chair watching hes worried marchand thought worried because he feels its his fault what happened to me the thought gave him enough strength to say stupid of me to fall like that mr im sorry czerny supplied the introduction this is duane ferguson norman he was supernumerary on the copernicus smithed hes attending the dinner in costume as it were the chimpanzee nodded but did not speak he was watching that silvertongued orator dan fleury who seemed upset where is that ambulance demanded czerny with a doctors impatience with interns and the fullback in bellhops uniform hurried silently away to find out the chimpanzee made a barking sound clearing his throat ghwadd he said more or less the german ich sound followed by the word what ghwadd did jou meean aboud evdial midda vleury dan fleury turned and looked at the chimp blankly but not marchand thought suddenly as though he didnt know what the chimp was talking about only as if he didnt intend to answer marchand rasped whats this evdial dan search me look mr ferguson perhaps wed better go outside ghwadd the harsh barking voice struggled against the simian body it occupied and came closer to the sounds it meant to emit what did you bean did you mean he was a rude young man marchand thought irritably the fellow was tiring him although there was something about that insistent question marchand winced and felt for a moment as though he were going to throw up it passed leaving him wobbly it wasnt possible he had broken anything he told himself czerny would not lie about that but he felt as if he had he lost interest in the chimpman did not even turn his head as fleury hurried him out of the room whispering to him in an agitated and lowpitched chirrup like the scratching of a crickets legs if a man wanted to abandon his godgiven human body and put his mind thoughts and yes soul into the corpus of an anthropoid there was nothing in that to entitle him to any special consideration from norman marchand of course not marchand rehearsed the familiar argument as he waited for the ambulance men who volunteered for the interstellar flights he had done so much to bring about knew what they were getting into until some superbatman invented the mythical ftl drive it would always be so at possible speeds less than lights mps crawl it was a matter of decades to reach almost every worthwhile planet thatwas known the smith process allowed these men to use their minds to control chimpanzee bodies easily bred utterly exp ndable whie their own bodies rested in the deepfreeze for all the long years between the stars it took brave men naturally they were entitled to courtesy and consideration but so was he and it was not courteous to blather about evdial whatever that was while the man who had made their trip possible was seriously injured unless marchand opened his eyes again evdial unless evdial was the closest chimpanzee vocal chords and chimpanzee lips could come to to unless what they had been talking about while he was unconscious was that utterly impossible hopeless and fantastic dream that he marchand had turned his back upon when he began organizing the colonization campaign unless someone had really found the way to ftl travel ii as soon as he was able the next day marchand got himself into a wheelchair all by himself he didnt want any help in this and rolled it out into the chart room of the home the institute had given him rent free for all of his life the institute had put into the chart room stayed and guywired stars flecked the volume of a fortyfoot ballroom representing in scale all the space within fiftyfive lightyears of so every star was mapped and tagged they had even moved a few of them slightly a year ago to correct for proper motion it was that carefully done the twentysix great starships the institute had financed were there too or such of them as were still in space they were out of scale of course but marchand understood what they represented he rolled his chair down the marked path to the center of the room and sat there looking around just under yellow sol there was bluewhite sirius dominating them all procyon hanging just above the two of them together were incomparably the brightest objects in the room though red altair was brighter in its own right than procyon in the center of the chamber sol and alpha centauri a made a brilliant pair he gazed with rheuming eyes at the greatest disappointment of his life alpha centauri b so close so right so sterile it was an ironic blunder of creation that the nearest and best chance of another home had never formed planets or had formed them and swept them into the bodearea traps set by itself and its two companions but there were other hopes marchand sought and found tau ceti yellow and pale only eleven lightyears away the colony should be definitely established by now in another decade or less they should have an answer if of course it had planets man could live on that was the big question to which they had already received so many noes but tau ceti was still a good bet marchand told himself stoutly it was a dimmer cooler sun than sol but it was type g and according to spectropolarimetry almost certainly planetiferous and if it was another disappointment marchand turned his eyes to eridani a even dimmer even farther away the expedition to eridani a had been he remembered the fifth ship he had launched it ought to be reaching its destination soon this year or perhaps next there was no sure way of estimating time when the top velocity was so close to lights own but now of course the top velocity was more the sudden wash of failure almost made him physically ifi faster than light travel why how dared they but he didnt have time to waste on that particular emotion or indeed on any emotion at all he felt time draining away from him and sat up straight again looking around at you dare not do anything slowly not even daydream he glanced at and dismissed procyon they had tried procyon lately the ship would not be even halfway they had tried almost everything even epsilon eridani and groombridge even far down past the probable good bets among the spectroscopic classes cygni a and epsilon mdi a late and despairing try at proxima centauri there had been twentysix of them in all three ships lost three returned one still earthbound nineteen were still out there marchand looked for comfort at the bright green arrow that marked where the tycho brahe rode its jets of ionized gas the biggest of his ships three thousand men and women it seemed to him that someone had mentioned the tycho brahe recently when why he was not sure but the name stuck in his mind the door opened and dan fleury walked in glancing at the arrayed stars and ships and not seeing them the chart room had never meant anything to fleury he scolded damn it norman you scared us witless why youre not in the hospital now i was in the hospital dan i wouldnt stay and finally i got it through asa czernys head that i meant it so he said i could come home if i would stay quiet and let him look in well as you see im quiet and i dont care if he looks in i only care about finding out the truth about ftl oh cripes norm honestly you shouldnt worry yourself dan for thirty years youve never used the word honestly except when you were lying to me now give i sent for you this morning because you know the answer i want it for gods sake dan fleury glanced around the room as though he were seeing the glowing points of light for the first time perhaps he was marchand thought he said at last well there is something marchand waited he had had a great deal of practice at waiting theres a young fellow said fleury starting over again hes named eisele a mathematician would you believe it hes got an idea fleury pulled over a chair and sat down its far from perfect he added in fact he said a lot of people think it wont work at all yoti know the theory of course einstein lorentzfitzgerald the whole roster theyre all against it its called get this polynomiation he waited for a laugh hopelessly then he said although i must say he appears to have something since the tests marchand said gently and with enormous restraint dan will you please spit it out lets see what you said so far theres this fellow named eisele and he has something and its crazy but it works well yes marchand slowly leaned back and closed his eyes so that means that we were all wrong especially me and all our work look norman dont ever think like that your work has made all the difference if it werent for you people like eisele never would have had the chance dont you know he was working under one of our grants no i didnt know that marchands eyes went out to the tycho brahe for a moment but it doesnt help much i wonder if fiftyodd thousand men and women who have given most of their lives to the deep freeze because of my work will feel the way you do but thanks youve told me what i want to know when czerny entered the chart room an hour later marchand said at once am i in good enough shape to stand a smith the doctor put down his bag and took a chair before he answered we dont have anyone available norman there hasnt been a volunteer for years no i dont mean smithed into a human body i dont want any wouldbe suicide volunteer donors you said yourself the smithed bodies sometimes suicided anyway ill settle for a chimp why should i be any better than that young fellow whats his name you mean duane ferguson sure why should i be any better than he is oh cut it out norman youre too old your phospholipids im not too old to die am i and thats the worst that could happen it wouldnt be stable not at your age you just dont understand the chemistry i couldnt promise you more than a few weeks marchand said joyously really i didnt expect that much thats more than you can promise me now the doctor argued but marchand had held up his end of many a hardfought battle in ninetysix years and besides he had an advantage over czerny the doctor knew even better than marchand himself that getting into a passion would kill him at the moment when czerny gauged the risk of a smith translation less than the risk of going on arguing about it he frowned shook his head grudgingly and left slowly marchand wheeled after him he did not have to hurry to what might be the last act of his life there was plenty of time in the institute they kept a supply of breeding chimpanzees but it would take several hours to prepare one one mind had to be sacrificed in the smith imposition the man would ultimately be able to return to his own body his risk less than one chance in of failure but the chimp would never be the same marchand submitted to the beginnings of the irradiation the delicate titration of his body fluids the endless strapping and patching and clamping he had seen it done and there were no surprises in the procedure he had not known however that it would hurt so much iii trying not to walk on his knuckles marchand waddled out into the pad area and bent his rigid chimps spine back in order to look up at the hated thing dan fleury came toward him norm he asked tentatively marchand attempted to nod it was not a success but fleury understood norman he said this is sigmund eisele he invented the ftl drive marchand raised one long arm and extended a hand that resisted being opened it was used to being clawed into a fist congradulazhuns he said as clearly as he could virtuously he did not squeeze the hand of the young darkeyed man who was being introduced to him he had been warned that chimpanzee strength maimed human beings he was not likely to forget but it was tempting to allow himself to consider it for a moment he dropped the hand and winced as pain flooded through him czerny had warned him to expect it unstable dangerous wont last had rumbled through his conversation and dont forget norman the sensory equipment is set high for you youre not used to so much input it will hurt but marchand had assured the doctor he would not mind that and indeed he didnt he looked at the ship again zo thads id he grumbled and again bent the backbone the whole barrel chest of the brute he occupied to stare at the ship on the pad it was perhaps a hundred feet tall nod mudge he said scornfully de zirian dad was our firzd zdood nine hoonderd feed dali and garried a dousand beople to alpha zendauri and it brought a hundred and fifty back alive said eisele he didnt emphasize the words in any way but he said it quite clearly i want to tell you ive always admired you dr marchand i hope you wont mind my company i understand you want to go along with me out to the tycho brahe why zhould i mind he did of course with the best will in the world this young fellow had thrown seventy years of dedication plus a handsome fortune eight million dollars of his own countless hundreds of millions that marchand had begged from millionaires from government handouts from the pennies of schoolchildren tossed them all into the chamber pot and flushed them into history they would say a nonce figure of the early twentyfirst century norman marchand or marquand attempted stellar colonization with primitive rocketpropelled craft he was of course unsuccessful and the toll of life and wealth in his illconceived venture enormous however after eiseles fasterthanlight became practicable they would say that he was a failure and he was when tycho brahe blasted off to the stars massed bands of five hundred pieces played it to its countdown and television audiences all over the world watched it through their orbiting satellites a president a governor and half the senate were on hand when eiseles little ship took off to catch it and tell its people their efforts had been all in vain it was like the departure of the ferry for jersey city to that extent thought marchand had eisele degraded the majesty of starifight yet he would not have missed it for anything not though it meant forcing himself as supercargo on eisele who had destroyed his life and on the other smithed chimpanzee duane ferguson who was for some reason deemed to have special privileges in regard to the brahe they shipped an extra ftl unit marchand heard one of the men call it a polyflecter but he would not do it the honor of asking anyone what that meant for some reason because it was likely to break down so spares were needed marchand dismissed the question realizing that it had not been a fear but a hope whatever the reason he didnt care he didnt want even to be here he only regarded it as his inescapable duty and he entered eiseles ship the interior of eiseles damned ship was built to human scale ninefoot ceilings and broad acceleration couches but they had brought hammocks scaled to a chimpanzee torso for himself and duane ferguson doubtless they had looted the hammocks from the new ship the one that would never fly or at least not on streams of ionized gas and doubtless this was almost the last time that a mans mind would have to leave earth in an apes body what eiseles damned ship rode to the stars on in place of ionized gas marchand did not understand the whatchaflecter whatever the damned thing was named was so tiny the whole ship was a pigmy there was no room for reaction mass or at least only for enough to get it offearth then the little black box it was not really little since it was the size of a grand piano and it was not black but gray but it was a box all right would work its magic they called that magic polynomiation what polynomiation was marchand did not try to understand beyond listening or seeming to listen to eiseles brief crude attempt to translate mathematics into english he heard just enough to recognize a few words space was ndimensional all right that answered the whole question as far as he was concerned and he did not hear eiseles tortuous effofts to explain how one jacked oneself up so to speak into a polynomial dimension or no not that but translated the existing polynomial extensions of a standard fourspace mass into higher orders he didnt hear he didnt hear any of it what he was listening to was the deep liquid thump of the great apes heart that now was sustaining his brain duane ferguson appeared in the apes body that he would never leave now that was one more count of marchands selfindictment he had heard them say that the odds had worked against ferguson and his body had died in the imposition as soon as he had heard what eisele was up to marchand had seized on it as a chance for expiation the project was very simple a good test for eiseles drive and a mission of mercy too they intended to fleet after the plodding longgone tycho brahe and catch it in midspace for even now thirty years after it had left port kennedy it was still decelerating to begin its search orbit around groombridge as marchand strapped himself in eisele was explaining it all over again he was making tests on his black box and talking at the same time you see sir well try to match course and velocity but frankly thats the hard part catching thems nothing weve got the speed then well transfer the extra polyflecter to the tycho brahe yez thanggs said marchand politely but he still did not listen to the talk about the machine as long as it existed he would use it his conscience would not let him off that but he didnt want details because the thing was there were all those wasted lives every year in the tycho brahes deep freeze means a month off the life of the body that lay there respiration was slowed but it was not stopped the heart did not beat but blood was perfused through a pump tubes dripped sugar and minerals into the torpid blood catheters carried wastes away and groombridge was a flight of ninety years the best a fortyyearold man could hope for on arriving was to be restored into a body whose biological age was nearly fifty while behind him on the earth was nothing but a family long dead friends turned into dust it had been worth it or so the colonists had thought driven by the worm that wriggled in the spine of the explorer the itch that drove him on because of the wealth and the power and the freedom that a new world could give them and because of the place they would have in the history books not washingtons place or even christs they would have the place of an adam and an eve it had been worth it all those thousands had thought when they volunteered and set out but what would they think when they landed if they landed without knowing the truth if some ship like eiseles did not reach and tell them in midspace they would find the greatest disappointment any man had ever borne the groombridge expedition aboard the tycho brahe still had forty years to go on its original trip plan with eiseles invention driving fasterthanlight commerce there would be a planet populated by hundreds of thousands of people factories at work roads built the best land taken the history books already into their fifth chapter and what would the three thousand aging adventurers think then marchand moaned and shook not entirely because the ship was taking off and the acceleration squeezed his rib cage down against his spine when they were in the polyflecters grip he floated across the pilot room to join the others i vas never in zpaze bevore he said eisele said with great deference your work was on the earth vas yez but marchand left it at that a man whose whole life was a failure owed something to humanity and one of the things he owed was the privilege of allowing them to overlook it he watched carefully while eisele and ferguson read their instruments and made micrometric settings on the polyflecter he did not understand anything about the fasterthanlight drive but he understood that a chart was a chart here there was a doubly profiled representation of the course line of the groombridge expedition the tycho brahe was a point of light some ninetenths of the way from sol to the groombridge star in distance which meant something under threequarters of the way in time mass detectors dr marchand said eisele cheerfully pointing to the charts good thing theyre not much closer or they wouldnt have mass enough to show marchand understood the same detectors that would show a sun or a planet would also show a mere millionton ship if its speed was great enough to add sufficient mass and a good thing added eisele looking worried that theyre not much farther away were going to have trouble matching their velocity now even though theyve been decelerating for nine years lets get strapped in from the hammock marchand braced himself for another surge of acceleration but it was not that it was something different and far worse it was a sausagegrinder chewing his heart and sinews and spitting them out in strange crippled shapes it was a winepress squeezing his throat collapsing his heart it was the giddy nausea of a roller coaster or a small craft in a typhoon wherever it took them the stars on the proffle charts slipped and slid and flowed into new positions marchand absorbed in the most crushing migraine of all but a century hardly knew what was happening but he knew that in the hours they found the tycho brahe after giving it a thirtyyear start iv the captain of the tycho brahe was a graying yellowfanged chimp named lafcadio his brown animal eyes hooded with shock his long stringy arms still quivering with the reaction of seeing a ship a ship and human beings he could not take his eyes off eisele marchand noted it had been thirty years in an apes body for the captain the ape was old now lafcadio would be thinking himself more than half chimp already the human frame only a memory that blurred against the everyday reminders of furrybacked hands and splayed prehensile feet marchand himself could feel the apes mind stealing back though he knew it was only imagination or was it imagination asa czerny had said the imposition would not be stable something to do with the phospholipids he could not remember he could not in fact remember anything with the clarity and certainty he could wish and it was not merely because his mind was ninetysix years old without emotion marchand realized that his measured months or weeks had dwindled to a few days it could of course be the throbbing pain between his temples that was robbing him of reason but marchand only entertained that thought to dismiss it if he had courage enough to realize that his lifes work was wasted he could face the fact that pain was only a secondorder derivative of the killer that stalked his apes body but it made it hard for him to concentrate it was through a haze that he heard the talk of the captain and his crew the twentytwo smithed chimpanzees who superintended the running of the tycho brahe and watched over the three thousand frozen bodies in its hold it was over a deep confusing roar that he heard eisele instruct them in the transfer of the ftl unit from his tiny ship to the great lumbering ark that his box could make fleet enough to span the stars in a days journey he was aware that they looked on him from time to time with pity he did not mind their pity he only asked that they allow him to live with them until he died knowing as he knew that that would be no long time and he passed while they were still talking into a painful dizzying reverie that lasted until he did not know the measure of the time until he found himself strapped in a hammock in the control room of the ship and felt the added crushing agony that told him they were once again slipping through the space of other dimensions are you all right said a familiar thick slurred voice it was the other last victim of his blundering the one called ferguson marchand managed to say that he was were almost there said ferguson i thought youd like to know theres a planet inhabitable they think from earth the star called groombridge was not even visible to the naked eye binoculars might make it a tiny flicker of light lost among countless thousands of farther but brighter stars from groombridge sol was not much more marchand remembered struggling out of his hammock overruling the worry on fergusons simian face to look back at the view that showed sol ferguson had picked it out for him and marchand looked at light that had been years journeying from his home the photons that impinged on his eyes now had paused to drench the earth in the colors of sunset when he was in his seventies and his wife only a few years mourned he did not remember getting back to his hammock he did not remember either at what moment of time someone told him about the planet they hoped to own it hung low around the little orange disk of groombridge by solar standards at least the captains first approximation made its orbit quite irregular but at its nearest approach it would be less than ten million miles from the glowing firecoal of its primary near enough warm enough telescopes showed it a planet with oceans and forests removing the lingering doubts of the captain for its orbit could not freeze it even at greatest remove from its star or char it at closest or else the forest could not have grown spectroscopes thermocouples filarometers showed more the instruments racing ahead of the ship now in orbit and compelled to creep at rocket speeds the last little inch of its journey the atmosphere could be breathed for the ferny woods had flushed out the poisons and filled it with oxygen the gravity was more than earths a drag on the first generation to be sure and an expense in foot troubles and lumbar aches for many more but nothing that could not be borne the world was fair marchand remembered nothing of how he learned this or of the landing or of the hurried joyful opening of the freezing crypts the awakening of the colonists the beginning of life on the planet he only knew that there was a time when he found himself curled on a soft warm hummock and he looked up and saw sky v the protuberant hairy lip and sloping brows of a chimpanzee were hovering over him marchand recognized that young fellow ferguson hello he said how long have i been unconscious the chimp said with embarrassment well you havent been unconscious at all exactly youve been his voice trailed off i see said marchand and struggled up he was grateful for the strength of the slopeshouldered shortlegged body he had borrowed for this world he had come to had an uncomfortably powerful grip the effort made him dizzy a pale sky and thin clouds spiraled around him he felt queer flashes of pain and pleasure remembered tastes he had never experienced felt joys he had never known with an effort he repressed the vestigial ape and said you mean ive been what would you call it unstable the smithing didnt quite take but he didnt need confirmation from ferguson he knew and knew that the next time he slipped away would be the last czerny had warned him the phospholipids wasnt that it it was almost time to go home off to one side he saw men and women human men and women on various errands and it made him ask youre still an ape i will be for a while dr marchand my bodys gone you know marchand puzzled over that for a while his attention wandering he caught himself licking his forearm and grooming his round belly no he shouted and tried to stand up ferguson helped him and marchand was grateful for the apes strong arm he remembered what had been bothering him why he asked why what dr marchand why did you come ferguson said anxiously i wish youd sit down till the doctor gets here i came because theres someone on the tycho brahe i wanted to see a girl thought marchand wonderingly and did you see her not her them yes i saw them my parents you see i was two years old when the tycho brahe left my parents were good breeding stock volunteers were hard to get then they tell me oh of course youd know better than i anyway they i was adopted by an aunt they left me a letter to read when i was old enough dr marchand whats the matter marchand reeled and fell he could not help it he knew he was a spectacle could feel the incongruous tears rheuming out of his beast eyes but this last and unexpected blow was too harsh he had faced the fact of fifty thousand damaged lives and accepted guilt for them but one abandoned baby left to an aunt and the apology of a letter broke his heart i wonder why you dont kill me he said dr marchand i dont know what youre talking about if only said marchand carefully i dont expect any favors but if only there were some way i could pay but i cant i have nothing left not even enough life to matter but im sorry mr ferguson and that will have to do ferguson said dr marchand if im not mistaken youre saying that you apologize for the institute marchand nodded but oh im not the one to say this but theres no one else look let me try to make it clear the first thing the colonists did yesterday was choose a name for the planet the vote was unanimous do you know what they called it marchand only looked at him dully please listen dr marchand they named it after the man who inspired all their lives their greatest hero they named it marchand marchand stared at him and stared longer and then without changing expression closed his eyes dr marchand said ferguson tentatively and then seriously worried at last turned and scuttled apelike legs and knuckles bearing him rapidly across the ground to get the ships doctor who had left him with strict orders to call him as soon as the patient showed any signs of life when they got back the chimp was gone they looked at the fronded forest and at each other wandered off i expect said the doctor it may be just as well but the nights are cold hell get pneumonia hell die not any more said the doctor as kindly as he could hes already dead in every way that matters he bent and rubbed his aching thighs worn already from the struggle against this new edens gravity then strthghtened and looked at the stars in the darkening western sky a bright green one was another planet of groombridge s farther out all ice and copper salts one of the very faintest ones perhaps was sol he gave us these planets said the doctor and turned back toward the city do you know what being a good man means ferguson it means being better than you really are so that even your failures carry someone a little farther to success and thats what he did for us i hope he heard what you were trying to tell him i hope he remembers it when he dies the doctor said if he doesnt said ferguson very
