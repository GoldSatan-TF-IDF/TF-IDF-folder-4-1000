chapter contents next hed have killed for a beer a big frosty mug filled with some dark import that would go down smoother than a womans first kiss a beer in some nice dim cool bar with a ball game on the tube and a few other stoolsitters who had an interest in the game gathered around while he staked out the womans apartment jack dakota passed the time fantasizing about it the foamy head the yeasty smell the first gulping swallow to beat the heat and slake the thirst then the slow savoring sip by sip that assured a man all would be right with the world if only politicians and lawyers would debate the inevitable conflicts over a cold one at a local pub while a batter faced a count of three and two it was a bit early for drinking at just past one in the afternoon but the heat was so huge so intense and the cooler full of canned sodas just didnt have quite the same punch as a cold foamy beer his ancient oldsmobile didnt run to amenities like airconditioning in fact its amenities were pathetically few except for the pricey earsplitting stereo hed installed in the peeling fauxleather dash the stereo was worth about double the blue book on the car but a man had to have music when he was on the road he enjoyed turning it up to scream and belting them out with the beatles or the stones the muscleflexing v engine under the dented guttergray hood was tuned as meticulously as a swiss watch and got jack where he wanted to go fast just now the engine was at rest and as a concession to the quiet neighborhood in northwest washington dc he had the cd player on murmur while he hummed along with bonnie raitt she was one of his rare bows to music after jack often thought hed been born out of his own time he figured hed have made a pretty good knight a black one he liked the straightforward philosophy of might for right hed have stood with arthur he mused tapping his fingers on the steering wheel but hed have handled camelots business his own way rules complicated things hed have enjoyed riding the west too hunting down desperadoes without all the nonsense of paperwork just track em down and bring em in dead or alive these days the bad guys hired a lawyer or the state gave them one and the courts ended up apologizing to them for the inconvenience were terribly sorry sir just because you raped robbed and murdered is no excuse for infringing on your time and civil rights it was a sad state of affairs and it was one of the reasons jack dakota hadnt gone into police work though hed toyed with the idea during his early twenties justice meant something to him always had but he didnt see much justice in rules and regulations which was why at thirty jack dakota was a bounty hunter you still hunted down the bad guys but you worked your own hours and got paid for a job and didnt answer to a lot of bureaucratic garbage there were still rules but a smart man knew how to work around them jack had always been smart he had the papers on his current quarry in his pocket ralph finkleman had called him at eight that morning with the tag now ralph was a worrier and an optimist a combination jack thought that must be a job requirement for a bail bondsman personally jack could never understand the concept of lending money to complete strangers strangers who since they needed bond had already proved themselves unreliable but there was money in it and money was enough motivation for most anything he supposed jack had just come back from tracing a skip to north carolina and had made ralph pitifully grateful when he hauled in the dumbasapost country boy whod tried to make his fortune robbing convenience stores ralph had put up the bond claimed hed figured the kid was too stupid to run jack could have told him straight off that the kid was too stupid not to run but he wasnt being paid to offer advice jack had planned to relax for a few days maybe take in a few games at camden yards pick one of his female acquaintances to help him enjoy spending his fee hed nearly turned ralph down but the guy had been so whiny so full of pleas he didnt have the heart so hed gone into first stop bail bonds and picked up the paperwork on one m j oleary whod apparently decided against having her day in court to explain why she shot her married boyfriend jack figured she was dumb as a post as well a goodlooking woman and from her photo and description she qualified with a few working brain cells could manipulate a judge and jury over something as minor as plugging an adulterous accountant it wasnt like shed killed the poor bastard it was a creampuff job which didnt explain why ralph had been so jumpy hed stuttered more than usual and his eyes had danced all over the cramped dusty office but jack wasnt interested in analyzing ralph he wanted to wrap up the job quickly get that beer and start enjoying his fee the extra money from this quick one meant he could snatch up that first edition of don quixote hed been coveting so hed tolerate sweating in the car for a few hours he didnt look like a man who hunted up rare books or enjoyed philosophical debates on the nature of man he wore his sunstreaked brown hair pulled back in a stubby ponytail which was more a testament to his distrust of barbers than a fashion statement though the sleek look enhanced his long narrow face with its slashing cheekbones and hollows over the shallow dent in his chin his mouth was full and firm and looked poetic when it wasnt curled in a sneer his eyes were razoredged gray that could soften to smoke at the sight of the yellowing pages of a firstedition dante or darken with pleasure at a glimpse of a pretty woman in a thin summer dress his brows were arched with a faintly demonic touch accented by the white scar that ran diagonally through the left and was the result of a tangle with a jackknife wielded by a murder in the second who hadnt wanted jack to collect his fee jack had collected the fee and the skip had sported a broken arm and a nose that would never be the same unless the state sprang for rhinoplasty which wouldnt have surprised jack a bit there were other scars his long rangy body had the marks of a warrior and there were women who liked to coo over them jack didnt mind he stretched out his yardlong legs cracked the tightness out of his shoulders and debated popping the top on another soft drink and pretending it was a beer when the mg zipped by top down radio blasting he shook his head dumb as a post he thought though he admired her taste in music the car jibed with his paperwork and the quick glimpse of the woman as shed flown by confirmed it the short red hair that had been blowing in the breeze was a dead giveaway it was ironic he thought as he watched her unfold herself out of the little car shed parked in front of him that a woman who looked like that should be so pathetically stupid he wouldnt have called her easy on the eyes there didnt look to be anything easy about her she was a tall one and he did have a weakness for longlegged dangerous women her narrow teenageboy hips were hugged by a pair of faded jeans that were white at the stress points and ripped at the knee the tshirt tucked into the jeans was plain white cotton and her small unhampered breasts pressed nicely against the soft fabric she hauled a bag out of the car and jack received a interesting view of a firm female bottom in tight denim grinning to himself he patted a hand on his heart small wonder some slob had cheated on his wife for this one she had a face as angular as her body though it was milkmaidpale to go with the flaming cap of hair there was nothing of the maid about it pointed chin and pointed cheekbones combined to create a tough sexy face tilted off center by a lush sensual mouth she was wearing dark wraparound shades but he knew her eyes were green from the paperwork he wondered if theyd be like moss or emeralds with an enormous shoulder bag hitched on one shoulder a grocery bag cocked on her hip she started toward him and the apartment building he let himself sigh once over her looselimbed groundeating stride he sure did go for leggy women he got out of the car and strolled after her he didnt figure shed be much trouble she might scratch and bite a bit but she didnt look like the kind whod dissolve into pleading tears he really hated when that happened his game plan was simple he could have taken her outside but he hated public displays when there were other choices so hed push himself into her apartment explain the situation then take her in she didnt look like she had a care in the world jack noted as he stepped into the building behind her did she really figure the cops wouldnt check out the homes of her friends and associates and driving her own car to shop for groceries it was amazing she hadnt already been picked up but then the cops had enough to do without scrambling after a woman whod had a spat with her lover he hoped her pal who lived in the apartment wasnt home hed kept the windows under surveillance for the best part of an hour and hed seen no movement hed heard no sound when he took a lazy walk under the open thirdfloor windows and hed wandered inside to listen at the door but you could never be too sure since she turned away from the elevator toward the stairs so did he she never glanced back making him figure she was either supremely confident or had a lot on her mind he closed the distance between them flashed a smile at her want a hand with that the dark glasses turned leveled on his face her lips didnt curve in the slightest no ive got it okay but im going a couple flights up visiting my aunt havent seen her in damn two years just blew into town this morning forgot how hot it got in dc the glasses turned away again its not the heat she said her voice dry as dust its the humidity he chuckled at that recognizing sarcasm and annoyance yeah thats what they say ive been in wisconsin the past few years grew up here though but id forgotten here let me give you a hand it was a smooth move easing in as she shifted the bag to slip her key into the lock of the apartment door equally smooth she blocked with her shoulder pushed the door open ive got it she repeated and started to kick the door shut in his face he slid in like a snake took a firm hold on her arm ms oleary it was all he got out before her elbow cracked into his chin he swore blinked his vision clear and dodged the kick to the groin but it had been close enough to have him swiftly changing his approach explanations could damn well wait he grabbed her and she turned in his arms stomped down hard enough on his foot to have stars springing into his head and that was before she backfisted him in the face her bag of groceries had gone flying and she delivered each blow with a quick expulsion of breath initially he blocked her blows which wasnt an easy matter she was obvious trained for combat a little detail ralph had omitted when she went into a fighting crouch so did he this isnt going to do you any good he hated thinking he was going to have to deck her maybe on that sexy pointed chin im going to take you in and id rather do it without messing you up her answer was a swift flying kick to his midsection he wished hed been able to admire from a distance but he was too busy crashing into a table damn she was good he expected her to bolt for the door and was up on the balls of his feet quickly to block her but she merely circled him eyes hidden behind the dark glasses mouth curled in a grimace come on then she taunted him nobody tries to mug me on my own turf and walks away im not a mugger he kicked away a trio of firm ripe peaches that had spilled out of her bag im a skip tracer and youre busted he held up a hand signaling peace and hoping her gaze had flickered there moved in fast hooked a foot under her leg and sent her sprawling on her butt he tackled her and might have appreciated the long economical lines of her body pressed beneath him but her knee had better aim than her initial kick his eyes rolled his breath hissed as the pain only a man understands radiated in sick waves but he hung on he had the advantage now and she knew it vertical she was fast and her reach was nearly as long as his and the odds were more balanced but in a wrestling match he outweighed her and outmuscled her it infuriated her enough to have her resorting to dirty tactics she fixed her teeth in his shoulders like a bear trap felt the adrenaline and satisfaction rush through her as he howled they rolled limbs tangling hands grappling and crashed into the coffee table a wide blue bowl filled with chocolate drops shattered on the floor a shard pierced his undamaged shoulder and made him swear again she landed a blow to the side of his head another to his kidneys she was just beginning to think she could take him after all when he flipped her over she landed with a jarring smack and before she could suck in breath he had her hands locked behind her back and was sitting on her the fact that his breath was coming in pants was very little satisfaction and for the first time she was seriously afraid dont know why the hell you shot the guy when you couldve just beat the hell out of him jack muttered he reached into his back pocket for his cuffs swore again when he came up empty theyd popped out during the match he simply rode her out as she bucked and caught his breath he hadnt had a fight of this magnitude with a female since he hunted down big betsy and shed been two hundred pounds of sheer muscle look its only going to be harder on you this way why dont you just go quietly before we bust up any more of your friends apartment youre crushing me you jerk she said between her teeth and this is my apartment you try to rape me and ill twist your pride clean off and hand it to you there wont be enough left of you for the cops to scrape off their shoes i dont force women sugar just because some accountant couldnt keep his hands off you doesnt mean i cant and the cops arent interested in me they want you she blew out a breath tried to suck another in but he was crushing her lungs i dont know what the hell youre talking about he pulled the papers out of his pocket shoved them in front of her face m j oleary assault with a deadly malicious wounding and blahblah ralphs real disappointed in you sugar hes a trusting man and didnt expect a nice woman like you to try to skip out on the tenk bond this is a crock she could see her name and some downtown address on what appeared to be some kind of arrest warrant youve got the wrong person i didnt post bail for anything i havent been arrested and i live here idiot cops she muttered and tried to buck him off again call in to your sergeant or whatever straighten this out and when you do im suing nice try and i suppose youve never heard of george macdonald no i havent then it was really rude of you to shoot him he eased up just enough to flip her face up then caught both of her hands at the wrist shed lost her glasses he noted and her eyes were neither moss nor emerald he decided they were dark shadyriver green and just now full of fury look you want to have a hot affair with your accountant sister its no skin off my nose you want to shoot him i dont particularly care but you skip bond and it ticks me off she could breathe slightly easier now but his hands were like steel bands at her wrists my accountants name is holly bergman and we havent had a hot affair i havent shot anyone and i havent skipped bond because i havent posted bond i want to see your id ace he thought it took a lot of nerve to make demands in her current position my names dakota jack dakota im a skip tracer her eyes narrowed as they skimmed over his face she thought he looked like something out of the gritty side of a western a coldeyed gunslinger a toughtalking gambler or a bounty hunter well theres no bounty here jerk it wasnt rape and it wasnt a mugging the fear that had iced her heart thawed into fresh temper you son of a bitch you break in here tear up my things ruin twenty bucks worth of produce and all because you cant follow the right trail your butts in a sling i promise you when im done you wont be able to trace your own name with a stencil you wont she broke off when he stuck a photo in her face it was her face and the photograph might have been taken yesterday got a twin oleary one who drives a mg license plate slainte and is currently shacked up with some guy named bailey james baileys a woman she murmured staring at her own face while new worries raced in her head was this about bailey about what bailey had sent her what kind of trouble could her friend be in and this isnt her apartment its mine i dont have a twin she looked up into his eyes again whats going on is bailey all right wheres bailey under his clamped hands her pulse had spiked she was struggling again with a fresh and vicious energy he knew was brought on by fear and he was dead certain it wasnt fear for herself i dont know anything about this bailey except this address is listed under her name on the paperwork but he was beginning to smell something and he didnt like it he was no longer thinking m j oleary was dumb as a post a woman with any brains wouldnt have left herself with so many avenues to be tracked if she was on the run ralph jack mused frowning down into mjs face why were you so jumpy this morning if youre being straight with me we can confirm it quick enough maybe it was a clerical mixup but he didnt think so no indeed and there was an itching at the base of his spine listen he began just as the door broke open and the giant roared in you were supposed to bring her out the giant said and waved an impressive magnum youre talking too much hes waiting jack didnt have much time to decide how to play it the big man was a stranger to him but he recognized the type it looked like all bulk and no brains with the huge bullet head small eyes and massive shoulders the gun was big as a cannon and looked like a toy in the hamsize hands sorry he gave mjs wrist a quick squeeze hoping shed understand it as a sign of reassurance and remain still and quiet i was having a little trouble here just a woman you were supposed to just bring the woman out yeah i was working on it jack tried a friendly smile ralph send you to back me up come on up up now were going sure no problem you wont need the gun now ive got her under control but the gun continued to point its barrel as wide as montana at his head just her and the giant smiled floppy lips peeling back over huge teeth we dont need you now fine i guess you want the paperwork for lack of anything better jack snagged a can of tomato sauce on his way up and winged it it made a satisfactory crunching sound on the big mans nose ducking jack rushed forward like a battering ram it felt a great deal like beating his head against a brick wall but the force took them both tumbling backward and over a ladderback chair the gun went off putting a fistsize hole in the ceiling before it flew across the room she thought about running she could have been out of the door and away before either of them untangled but she thought about bailey about what she had weighing down her shoulder bag about the mess shed somehow stepped in and was too mad to run she went for the gun and ended up falling backward as jack flew into her she cushioned his fall and he was up fast springing into the air and landing a doublefooted kick in the big mans midsection nice form mj thought and scrambled to her own feet she snagged her shoulder bag spun it over her head and cracked it hard over the sleek bulletshaped head he went down hard on the sofa snapping the springs youre wrecking my place she shouted and smacked jack in the side simply because she could reach him sue me he dodged a fist the size of a steamship and went in low pain sang through every bone as his opponent slammed him into a wall pictures fell glass shattering on the floor through his blurred vision he saw the woman charge a redheaded fireball that flew up and latched like a plague of wasps on the mans enormous back she used her fists pounding the sides of his face as he spun wildly and struggled to grab her hold him still jack shouted damn it just hold him for a minute spotting an opening he grabbed what was left of a table leg and rushed in he checked his first swing as the duo spun like a mad twoheaded top if he followed through he might have cracked the back of mjs head open like a melon i said hold him still you want me to paint a bullseye on his face while im at it with a guttural snarl she hooked her arms around the mans throat clamped her thighs like a vise around his wide steel beam of a torso and screamed hit him for gods sake stop dancing around and hit him jack cocked back like a batter with two strikes already on his record and swung full out the table leg splintered like a toothpick blood gushed like water in a fountain mj had just enough time to jump clear as the man toppled like a redwood she stayed on her hands and knees a minute gasping for air whats going on what the hells going on no time to worry about it selfpreservation on his mind jack grabbed her hand hauled her to her feet this type doesnt usually travel alone lets go go she snagged the strap of her purse as he pulled her toward the door where away hes going to be mean when he wakes up and if hes got a friend were not going to be so lucky next time lucky my butt but she was running with him driven by a pure instinct that matched jacks you son of a bitch you come busting into my place push me around wreck my home nearly get me shot i saved your butt i saved yours she shouted it at him cursing viciously as they thudded down the stairs and when i get a minute to catch my breath im going to take you apart piece by piece they rounded the landing and nearly ran over one of her neighbors the woman with helmet hair and bunny slippers cowered back against the wall hands pressed to her deeply rouged cheeks mj what in the world were those gunshots mrs weathers no time jack all but jerked her off her feet as he headed down the next flight dont you shout at me you jerk im making you pay for every grape that got smashed every lamp every yeah yeah i get the picture wheres the back door when mj pointed down the corridor he gave a nod and they both slid outside then around the corner of the building screened by some bushes in the front jack darted a gaze up and down the street there was a windowless van less than half a block down and a small chickenfaced man in a bad suit dancing beside it stay low jack ordered thankful hed parked right out front as they ran down the walkway and he all but threw mj into the front seat of his car my god what the hell is this she shoved at the can shed sat on kicked at the wrappers littering the floor then joined them when jack put a hand behind her head and shoved low he repeated in a snarl and gunned the engine the faint ping told him the man with the chicken face was using the silenced automatic hed pulled out jacks car screamed away from the curb and he twowheeled it around the corner and shot down the street like a rocket tossed like eggs in a broken carton mj rapped her head on the dash cursed and struggled to balance herself as jack maneuvered the huge boat of a car down side streets what the hell are you doing saving your butt again sugar his eyes flicked to the rearview as he took a hard tiresquealing right turn a couple of kids riding bikes on the sidewalk lifted their fists and cheered the maneuver in instant reaction jack flashed a grin slow this junk heap down mj had to crawl back onto the seat and clutch the chicken stick for balance and let me out before you run over some kid walking his dog im not going to run over anybody and youre staying put he spared her a quick glance in case you didnt notice the guy with the van was shooting at us and as soon as i make sure weve lost him and find someplace quiet to hole up youre going to tell me what the hells going on i dont know whats going on he shot her a look thats bull because he was sure it was he took a chance he swung to the curb again reached under his seat and came up with spare cuffs before she could do more than blink he had her locked by the wrist to the door handle no way was she skipping out on him until he knew why hed just been tossed around by a threehundredpound gorilla to block out her shouting and her increasingly imaginative threats and curses jack turned up his stereo and drowned her out chapter contents prev next at the very first opportunity she was going to kill him brutally mj decided mercilessly two hours before this shed been happy free wandering around the grocery store like any normal person on a saturday squeezing tomatoes true shed been weighed down with curiosity about what she carried in the bottom of her purse but shed been sure bailey had a good reason and a logical explanation for sending it to her bailey james always had good reasons and logical explanations for everything that was only one of the aspects about her that mj loved but now she was worried worried that the package bailey had shipped to her by courier the day before was not only at the bottom of her purse but also at the bottom of her current situation she preferred blaming jack dakota hed pushed his way into her apartment and attacked her okay so maybe shed attacked first but it was a natural reaction when some jerk tried to muscle you at least it was mjs natural reaction she was an ace student in the school of punch first ask questions later it was humiliating that hed been able to take her down she had a lot of notches on her fifthdegree black belt and she didnt like to lose a match but shed pay him back for that later all she knew for certain was that he seemed to be at the root of it all because of him her apartment was wrecked her things tossed every which way now theyd gone leaving the front door open the lock broken she didnt form close attachments to things but that wasnt the point they were her things and thanks to him she was going to have to waste time shopping for replacements which was almost as bad as having some gun wielding punk the size of texas busting down her door having to run for her life from her own home and being shot at but all of that all of it paled next to one infuriating fact she was handcuffed to the door handle of an oldsmobile jack dakota had to die for that who the hell was he she asked herself bounty hunter excellent handtohand fighter slob she added as she pushed candy wrappers and paper cups around with her foot and nerveless driver under different circumstances shed have been impressed by the way he handled the tank of a car swinging it around curves screaming around corners whipping it through yellow lights and zipping onto the washington beltway like the leader in a grand prix event if hed walked into her bar shed have looked twice she admitted grudgingly running a pub in a major city meant more than being able to mix drinks and work the books it meant being able to size people up quickly tell the troublemakers from the lonely hearts and know how to deal with both shed have tagged him as a tough customer it was in his face a damn good face all in all hard and handsome yeah shed have looked twice mj thought teeth gritted as she looked out the window of the speeding car pretty boys didnt interest her much she preferred a man who looked as though hed lived crossed a few lines and would cross a few more jack dakota fit that bill shed gotten a good close look into those eyes granite gray and knew that he wasnt one to let a few rules get in his way just what would a man like him do if he knew she was carrying a kings ransom in her battered leather purse damn it bailey damn it mj fisted her free hand and tapped it restlessly on her knee why did you send me the diamond and where are the other two she cursed herself as well for not going directly to baileys door after she came home from closing mjs the night before but shed been tired and shed figured bailey was sound asleep and as her friend was the steadiest most practical person mj knew shed simply decided to wait for what she was certain would be a very practical sensible reason stupid she told herself now why had she assumed bailey had sent the stone to her simply because she knew mj would be home in the middle of the day and around to receive the package why had she assumed the rock was a fake a copy even though the note that accompanied it asked mj to keep it with her at all times because bailey just wasnt the kind of woman to ship off a blue diamond worth more than a million with no warnings or explanations she was a gemologist dedicated brilliant and patient as job how else could she continue to work for the creeps who masqueraded as her family mjs mouth tightened as she thought of baileys stepbrothers the salvini twins had always treated bailey as though she were an inconvenience something they were stuck with because their father had left her a percentage of the business in his will and blindly loyal to family bailey had always found excuses for them now mj wondered if they were part of the reason had they tried to pull something she wouldnt put it past them no indeed but it was hard to believe timothy and thomas salvini would be stupid enough to try something fancy with the three stars of mithra that was what bailey had called them and shed had a dreamy look in her eyes three priceless blue diamonds in a golden triangle that had once been held in the open hands of a statue of the god mithra and now property of the smithsonian salvini with baileys reputation behind it was to assess verify and appraise the stones what if the creeps had gotten it into their heads to keep them no it was too wild mj decided better to believe this whole mess was some sort of mixup a mistaken identity tangle much better to concentrate on how she would repay jack dakota for ruining her afternoon off you are a dead man she said it calmly relishing the words yeah well everybody dies sooner or later he was heading south on and he was grateful shed stopped swearing at him long enough to let him think its going to be sooner in your case jack lots sooner the traffic was thick thanks to the fourth of july holiday weekend but it was fast how humiliating would it be she wondered to stick her head out the window and scream for help mortifying she supposed but she might have tried it if shed believed it would work better if they could just run into one of the inexplicable traffic snags that stopped cars dead for miles where the hell were the road crews and the rubberneckers who loved them when she needed them seeing nothing but clear sailing for miles she told herself to deal with jack the idiot dakota herself if you want to live to see another sunrise pull this excuse for a car over uncuff me and let me go go where he flicked his eyes from the road long enough to glance at her back to your apartment thats my problem not yours not anymore sister i take it personal real personal when someone shoots at me since you seem to be the reason why ill be keeping you for a while if they hadnt been doing seventy shed have punched him instead she rattled her chain take these damn things off me nope a muscle twitched in her jaw youve stepped in it now dakota were in virginia kidnapping crossing state lines thats federal you came with me he pointed out now youre staying with me until i get this figured out the doors rattled ominously as he whipped around an eighteenwheeler and you should be grateful oh i should be grateful you broke into my apartment knocked me around busted up my things and have me cuffed to a door handle thats right if i hadnt youd probably be lying in that apartment right now with a bullet in your head they came after you ace not me i dont think so my debts are paid im not fooling around with anyones wife and i havent pissed anyone off lately except for you nobodys got a reason to send muscle after me you on the other hand he skimmed his gaze over her face again somebody wants you sugar thousands do she said stretched out her long legs as she shifted toward him ill bet he didnt give in to the impulse to look at those legs he just thought about them but other than the brainless idiots youd kick in the heart youve got someone real interested interested enough to set me up and take me out with you ralph you bastard he shoved aside a copy of the grapes of wrath and a torn tshirt and snagged his car phone steering onehanded he punched in numbers then hooked the receiver under his chin ralph you bastard he repeated when the phone was answered dddakota that you you track dddown that skip when i figure my way clear of this im coming for you what whatre you talking about you find her look its a straight trace jack i gggave you a plum just a cccouples hours work for full fffee youre stuttering more than usual ralph that wont be a

why the phony paperwork whyd you set me up i got ppproblems big ppproblems im your big problem right now he tapped the brakes swung around a convertible and hit the fast lane if whoevers pushing your buttons is trying to trace this im in my car just tooling around he thought for a moment then added and ive got the woman jack listen to me lllisten tell me where you are dump her and dddrive away jjjust drive stay out of it i wouldnta tagged you for the job cept i knew you could handle yourself now im telling you stash her somewhere give me the lllocation and drive away far away you dont want this who wants her ralph you dont nnneed to know you dddont want to know just dddo it ill throw in five large a bbbonus five large jacks brows lifted when ralph parted with an extra nickel it was big make it ten and tell me who wants her and we may deal it pleased him that mj protested that with a flurry of curses and threats it added substance to the bluff ttten ralph squeaked it stuttered for a full ten seconds okay okay ten grand but no names and bbbelieve me jack im saving your life here just tttell me where youre going to stash her smiling grimly jack made a pithy and anatomically impossible suggestion then disconnected well sugar your hides now worth ten thousand to me were going to find a nice quiet spot so you can tell me why i shouldnt collect he zipped off an exit did a quick turnaround and headed back north her mouth was dry she wanted to believe it was from shouting but there was fear clawing at her throat where are you going just covering my tracks they wouldnt get much of a trace on a cellular but it doesnt hurt to be cautious youre taking me back he didnt look at her and didnt grin though the waver of nerves in her voice pleased him if she was scared enough shed talk ten thousands a hefty incentive sugar lets see if you can convince me youre worth more alive he knew just what he was looking for he trolled the secondary roads skimming through the holiday traffic hed forgotten it was the fourth of july weekend which was just as well he thought as it didnt look like there were going to be a lot of opportunities to kick back with that cold beer and watch any fireworks unless they came from the woman beside him she was a firecracker all right she had to be afraid by now but she was holding her own he was grateful for that there was nothing more irritating than a whiner but scared or not he was certain shed try to take a chunk out of him at the first opportunity he didnt intend to give her one with any luck once they were settled hed have the full story out of her within a couple hours then maybe hed help her out of her jam for a fee that is it could be a small one because at this point he was ticked and figured he had a vested interest in dealing with whoever had set him on her whoever it was theyd gone to a great deal of trouble but they hadnt picked their goons very well he could figure the scam well enough once he captured his quarry and had her secured and in his car the men in the van would have run them off the road hed have figured it to be the action of a competing bounty hunter and though he wouldnt have given up his fee without a fight hed have been outnumbered and outgunned skip tracers didnt go crying to the cops when a competitor snatched their bounty the goons might have let him off with a few bruises maybe a minor concussion but the way that mountain of a man had been waving his cannon in mjs apartment jack thought it was far more likely that hed have sported a brandnew hole in some vital part of his body because the mountain had been an moron so at this point he was on the run with an angry woman a little over three hundred in cash and a quarter tank of gas he intended to know why he spotted what he was after north of leesburg virginia the tourists and holiday travelers unless they were very down on their luck would give a dilapidated dump like the kountry klub motel a wide berth but the lowslung building with the paint peeling on the green doors and the pitted parking lot met jacks requirements perfectly he pulled to the farthest end of the lot away from the huddle of rusted cars near the checkin and cut the engine is this where you bring all your dates dakota he smiled at her a quick flash of teeth that was unexpectedly charming only first class for you sugar he knew just what she was thinking the minute he cut her loose shed be all over him like spandex and if she could get out of the car shed be sprinting toward the checkin as fast as those milelong legs would carry her i dont expect you to believe me he said it casually as he leaned over to unlock the cuff from the door handle but im not going to enjoy this she was braced he could feel her body tense to spring he had to be quick and he had to be rough shed no more than hissed out a breath before he had her hands secured and locked behind her she sucked in air just as he clamped a hand over her mouth she bucked and rolled tried to bring up her legs to kick but he pinned her on the seat flipped her facedown he was out of breath by the time hed tied the bandanna over her mouth i lied panting he rubbed the fresh bruise where her elbow had connected with his ribs maybe i enjoyed that a little he used the torn tshirt to tie her legs tried not to appreciate overmuch the length and shape of them but hell he was only human once he had her trussed up like a turkey he looped the slack of the handcuffs around the gearshift then wound up the windows hot as hell isnt it he said conversationally well i wont be long he locked the car and walked away whistling it took her a moment to regain her balance she was scared she realized really bonedeep scared and she couldnt remember if shed ever felt this kind of mindnumbing panic before she was trembling and had to stop it wouldnt help her out of this fix once when shed just opened her pub shed been closing down late at night shed been alone when the man came in and demanded money shed been scared then too terrified by the wild look in his eyes that shouted drugs so shed handed over the till just as the cops recommended then shed handed him the fat end of the louisville slugger she had behind the bar shed been scared but shed dealt with it she would deal with this too the gag tasted of man and infuriated her she couldnt push or wiggle or slide it out so she gave up on it and concentrated on freeing the loop of the cuffs if she could free her hands from the gearshift she could fold herself up bend her legs through her arms and get some mobility she was agile she told herself she was strong and she was smart oh god she was scared she moaned and whimpered in frustration the handcuffs might as well have been cemented to the gearshift if she could only see twist herself around so that she could see what she was doing she struggled all but dislocating her shoulder until she managed to flip around sweat seemed to boil over her dripped into her eyes as she yanked at the steel she stopped herself closed her eyes and got her breath back she used her shaking fingers to probe to trace along the steel slide over the smooth length of the gearshift keeping them closed she visualized what she was doing carefully slowly shifting her hands until she felt steel begin to slide her shoulders screamed as she forced them into an unnatural position but she bit down on the gag and twisted she felt something give hoped it wasnt a joint then collapsed in an exhausted sweaty heap as the cuffs slipped off the stick damn youre good jack commented as he wrenched open the door he dragged her out and tossed her over his shoulder another five minutes you might have pulled it off he carried her into a room at the end of the concrete block hed already unlocked the door and hed paused for a minute to observe and admire her struggles before he came back to the car now he dumped her on the bed because her adrenaline was back and she was fighting him he simply lay flat on her back letting her bounce until she was worn out and he enjoyed that too he wasnt proud of it he thought but he enjoyed it the woman had incredible energy and staying power if theyd met under different circumstances he imagined they could have torn up those cheap motel sheets like maniacs and parted as friends as it was he was going to have a hard time not imagining her naked maybe he lay on her smelled her just a little longer than necessary he wasnt a saint was he he asked himself grimly as he unlocked one of her hands and secured the cuff to the iron headboard he rose ran a hand through his hair youre making this tougher than necessary for both of us he told her as she murdered him with a scalding look out of hot green eyes he was out of breath and knew he couldnt blame it entirely on the last minor skirmish that tight little bottom of hers pressing against his crotch had left him uncomfortably aroused and he didnt want to be turning from her he switched on the tv let the volume boom out mj had already ripped the gag away with her free hand and was hissing like a snake you can scream all you want now he told her as he took out a small knife and sliced through the phone cord the three rooms down from here are vacant so nobodys going to hear you then he grinned besides i put it around at checkin that were on our honeymoon so even if they hear theyre not going to bother us be back in a minute he went out shutting the door behind him mj closed her eyes again dear god what was going on with her for a moment for just one insane moment when he pressed her into the mattress with his body shed felt weak and hot with lust it was sick sick sick but just for that one insane moment shed imagined being stripped and taken being ravaged having his mouth on her his hands on her more shed wanted it she shuddered now praying it was just some sort of weird reaction to shock she wasnt a woman who shied away from good healthy hot sex but she didnt give herself to strangers to men who knocked her down tied her up and tossed her into bed in some cheap motel and hed been aroused she hadnt been so stupid or so dazed with shock that she was unaware of his reaction hell the man had been wrapped around her hadnt he but hed backed off she struggled to even her breathing he wasnt going to rape her he didnt want sex he wanted god only knew dont feel she ordered herself just think just clear your mind and think slowly she opened her eyes took a survey of the room it was in a word hideous obviously some misguided soul had thought that using an eyesearing combo of orange and blue would turn the cheaply furnished cramped little room into the exotic he couldnt have been more wrong the drapes were as thin as paper and looked to be of about the same consistency but hed pulled them closed over the narrow front window so the room was deep in shadow the television blared out a poorly dubbed hercules movie on its rickety gray pedestal the single dresser was ringed with interlinking watermarks there was a metal box beside the bed for a couple of bucks in quarters she could treat herself to dancing fingers whoopee the yellow glass ashtray on the night table was chipped and didnt look heavy enough to make an effective weapon even over the din of hercules she could hear the roaring sputter of an airconditioning unit that was doing absolutely nothing to cool the room the print near a narrow door she assumed was to the bathroom was a garish reproduction of a country landscape in autumn complete with screaming red barn and stupidfaced cows reaching over she tested the bedside lamp it was bright blue glass with a dingy and yellowing shade but it had some heft it might come in handy she heard the rattle of the key and set it down again stared at the door he came in with a small redandwhite cooler and dropped it on the dresser her heart thumped when she saw her purse slung over his shoulder but he tossed it on the floor by the bed so casually that she relaxed again the diamond was still safe she thought and so was the can of mace the can opener and the roll of nickels she habitually carried as weapons nothing i like better than a really bad movie he commented and paused to watch hercules battle several fiercelooking warriors sporting pelts and bad teeth i always wonder where they come up with the dialogue you know was it really that bad when it was scripted in lithuanian or whatever or does it just lose it in the translation with a shrug he walked over lifted the top on the cooler and took out two soft drinks i figure youre thirsty he walked to her offered a can and youre not the type to cut off your nose his assessment was proved correct when she grabbed the can and drank deeply this place doesnt run to room service he continued but theres a diner down the road so we wont go hungry you want something now she eyed him over the top of the can no fine he sat on the side of the bed settled himself and smiled at her lets talk kiss my butt he blew out a breath its an attractive offer sugar but ive been trying not to think along those lines he gave her thigh a friendly pat now the way i see it were both in a jam here and youve got the key once you tell me whos after you and why ill deal with it the worst of her thirst was abated so she sipped slowly her voice dripped sarcasm youll deal with it yeah consider me your championatarms like good old herc there he stabbed a thumb at the set behind him you tell me about it then ill go take care of the bad guys then ill bill you and if the offer about kissing your butts still open ill take you up on that too lets see she leaned her head back kept her eyes level on his what was it you told your pal ralph to do oh yeah she peeled her lips back in a snarl and repeated it he only shook his head is that any way to talk to the guy who kept you from getting a bullet in the brain i kept you from getting a bullet in the brain pal though i have serious doubts hed have been able to hit it as its clearly so small and you pay me back by manhandling me tying me up gagging me and dumping me in some cheap rentbythehour motel im assured this is a family establishment he said dryly god she was a pistol he thought spitting at him despite his advantage daring him to take her on though she didnt have a hope of winning the game and sexy as bloody hell in tight jeans and a wrinkled shirt think about this he said that brainless giant said something about me taking too long talking too much which leads me to believe they were listening from the van they must have had surveillance equipment and he got antsy otherwise if youd gone along with me like a good girl theyd have pulled us over somewhere along the line and taken you they didnt want direct involvement or witnesses youd be a witness she corrected nothing to sweat over id have been ticked off about having another bounty hunter snatch my job but people in my line of work dont go running to the cops id have lost my fee considered my day wasted maybe bitched to ralph thats the way theyd figure it anyway and ralph would have probably passed me some fluff job to keep me happy his eyes changed went hard again knifeedged gray ice somebodys got their foot on his throat i want to know who i couldnt say i dont know your friend ralph former friend i dont know the gorilla who broke my door and i dont know you she was pleased her voice was calm without a single hitch or quiver now if youll let me go ill report all this to the police his lips twitched thats the first time youve mentioned the cops sugar and youre bluffing you dont want them in on this thats another question he was right about that she didnt want the police not until shed talked to bailey and knew what was going on but she shrugged glanced toward the phone hed put out of commission you could call my bluff if you hadnt wrecked the phone you wouldnt call the cops but whoever you called might have their phone tapped i didnt go through all the trouble to find us these plush outoftheway surroundings to get traced he leaned over took her chin in his hand who would you call mj she kept her eyes steady fighting to ignore the heat of his fingers the texture of his skin against hers my lover she spit the words out hed take you apart limb by limb hed rip out your heart then show it to you while it was still beating he smiled eased a little closer he just couldnt resist whats his name her mind was blank totally completely foolishly blank she stared into those slategray eyes a moment then shook his hand away hank hell break you in half and toss you to the dogs when he finds out youve messed with me he chuckled infuriated her you may have a lover sugar you may have a dozen but you dont have one named hank took you too long okay you dont want to spill it and rely on me to work us out of this well go another route he rose leaned over he heard her quickly indrawn breath when he reached down for her purse without a word he dumped the contents on the bed hed already removed the weapons you ever use that can opener for more than popping a beer he asked her how dare you how dare you go through my things oh i think this is small potatoes after what weve been through together he picked up the velvet pouch slid the stone into his hand where it flashed like fire despite its lowly surroundings he admired it as he had been unable to in the car when he searched her bag it was deeply brilliantly blue big as a babys fist and cut to shoot blue flame he felt a tug as it lay nestled in his hand an odd need to protect it almost as inexplicable he thought as his odd need to protect this prickly ungrateful woman so he sat tossing the stone up catching it tell me about this mj just where did you get your hands on a blue diamond big enough to choke a cat chapter contents prev next options whirled through her mind the simplest and the most satisfying she thought was to make him feel like a fool are you crazy she rolled her eyes and scoffed yeah thats a diamond all right a big blue one i carry a green one in my glove compartment and a pretty red one in my other purse i spend all the profits from my pub on diamonds its a weakness he studied her idly tossing the stone catching it she looked annoyed he decided amused and cocky so what is it a paperweight for gods sake he waited a beat you carry a paperweight in your purse hell it was a gift she said it primly her nose in the air yeah from hank the hunk no doubt he rose casually pushed through the rest of the contents hed dumped out lets see other than the blackjack it was a roll of nickels she corrected same effect mace a can opener i doubt you cart around to pop bud bottles weve got an electronic organizer a wallet with more photos than cash i dont appreciate you rifling my personal belongings sue me a bottle of designer water six pens four pencils some eyeliner matches keys two pair of sunglasses a paperback copy of sue graftons latest good book by the way i wont tell you the ending a candy bar he tossed it to her in case youre hungry a flip phone he tucked that in his back pocket about three dollars in loose change a weather radio and a box of condoms he lifted a brow unopened but then you never know heat a combination of mortification and fury crawled up her neck pervert id say youre a woman who believes in being prepared so why not carry a paperweight around with you you might run into a stack of paper that needs anchoring happens all the time he made a couple of swipes to gather and dump the items scattered on the bed back into her bag then tossed it aside i wont ask what kind of fool you take me for because ive already got that picture moving to the mirror over the dresser he scraped the stone diagonally across the glass it left a long thin scratch they just dont make motel mirrors like they used to he commented then came back and sat on the bed beside her now back to my original question what are you doing with a blue diamond big enough to choke a cat when she said nothing he vised her chin in his hand jerked her face to his listen sister i could truss you up again leave you here and walk away with your milliondollar paperweight thats door number one i can kick back watch the movie and wait you out because sooner or later youll tell me what i want to know thats door number two behind door number three you tell me now why youre carrying a stone that could buy a small island in the west indies and we start figuring out how to get us both out of this jam she didnt flinch she didnt blink he had to admire the sheer nerve because he did he waited patiently while she studied hum out of those deep green cattilted eyes why havent you taken door number one already because i dont like having some gorilla try to break me in half i dont like getting shot at and i dont like being hosed by some skinny woman with an attitude he leaned closer until they were nosetonose ive got debts to pay on this one sugar and youre the first stop she grabbed his wrist with her free hand shoved threats arent going to cut it with me dakota no he shifted gears smoothly his hand came back to her face but lightly now a skim of knuckles along a cheekbone that had her blinking in shock before her eyes narrowed you want a different approach his fingers trailed down her throat down the center of her body and back before sliding around to cup her neck his mouth hovered one hot breath away from hers dont even think about it she warned too late his lips curved and his eyes stared straight into hers ive been thinking about it ever since you swaggered up the apartment steps in front of me no hed been thinking about it he realized since ralph shoved her photo at him but hed consider that later he skimmed his mouth over hers drew back fractionally hed expected her to cringe away or fight god knew he was ruthlessly pushing all those female fear buttons it was deplorable but hed consider that later as well he just wanted the pressure to work to get her to spill before they both got killed and if he got a little twisted pleasure out of the whole thing well hell he had his flaws but she didnt fight and she didnt cringe she didnt move a muscle just kept those goddessgreen eyes lasered on his a dark primitive thrill rippled down to his loins what was one more sin on his back he thought and clamping his hand on her free one he took a long deep gulp of her it was all heat primitive as tribal drums no thought no reason all instinct that surprisingly lush mouth gave under his so he dived deeper a rumble of pure male triumph sounded in his throat as he moved into her plunging his tongue between those full inviting lips sinking into that long tough body fisting his hand in that cap of flamecolored hair his mind shut off like a shattered lamp he forgot it was a con a ploy to intimidate forgot he was a civilized man forgot she was a job a puzzle a stranger and knew only that she was his for the taking his hand closed greedily over her breast his thumb and forefinger tugging at the nipple that pressed hard against the thin cotton of her shirt she moved under him arched to him and the blood pounded like thunder in his brain she moved fast all but twisting his ear from his head while her teeth clamped down like a bear trap on his bottom lip he yelped jerked back and certain she would saw off a chunk of him pinched her chin hard until she let him loose he pressed the back of his hand to his throbbing lip scowled at the blood he saw on it when he took it away damn it pig she was vibrating now scrambling to her knees on the bed to take another swipe at him swearing when her reach fell short pervert he spared her one murderous look then turned on his heel the bathroom door slammed shut behind him she heard water running and closing her eyes she sank back and let the shudders come my god dear god she thought pressing a hand to her face shed lost her mind had she fought him no had she been filled with outrage with disgust no shed enjoyed it she rocked herself berated herself and damned jack dakota to hell shed let him kiss her there was no pretending otherwise shed stared into those dangerous gray eyes felt the zip of an electric current when that cocky mouth brushed over hers and shed wanted him her muscles had gone lax her breasts had tingled and her blood had begun to swim shed let him kiss her without a murmur of protest shed kissed him back without a thought for the consequences m j oleary she thought wincing tough gal who prided herself on always being in control who could flip a twohundredpound man onto his back and have her foot on his throat in a heart beat confident kickbutt mj had melted into a puddle of mindless lust and hed tied her up hed gagged her he had her handcuffed to a bed in some cheap motel wanting him even for an instant made her as much of a pervert as he was thank god shed snapped out of it it didnt matter that bonedeep fear of her feelings had been the motivation for stopping him the fact was she had stopped him and she knew shed been an instant away from letting him do whatever he wanted to do she was very much afraid that if shed had both hands free she would have flipped him onto his back then ripped off his clothes it was the shock she told herself even a woman who prided herself on being able to handle anything that came her way was entitled to go a little loopy with shock under certain circumstances now she had to put this aberration behind her and figure out what to do the facts were few but they were clear she had to contact bailey whatever her friends purpose in sending the stone bailey couldnt have had any idea just how dangerous the act would be shed had her reasons mj was sure and she thought it was likely to have been one of baileys rare acts of impulse and defiance she didnt intend for bailey to pay the price for it what had bailey done with the other two stones did she have them or oh god she dropped back weakly on the bricklike pillow she would have sent one to grace it had to be it was logical and bailey was nothing if not logical thered been three stones and shed sent one to mj so it followed that shed kept one and sent the other to the only other person in the world shed trust with such a responsibility grace fontaine the three of them had been close as sisters since college bailey quiet studious and serious grace rich stunning and wild theyd roomed together for four years at radcliffe and stayed close since bailey moving into the family business mj following tradition and opening her own bar and grace doing whatever she could to shock her wealthy conservative and disapproving relatives if one of them was in trouble they were all in trouble she had to warn them she would have to escape from jack dakota or shed have to use him but how much she asked herself did she dare trust him in the bathroom jack studied his mutilated lip in the mirror hed probably have a scar well he admitted he deserved it he had been a pig and a pervert not that she was entirely innocent either lying there on the bed with that justtryitbuster look in her eyes and hadnt she pressed that long tight body to his opened that soft sexy mouth arched those neat narrow hips pig he scrubbed his hands over his face what choice had he given her dropping his hands he looked at himself in the mirror looked deadon and admitted he hadnt wanted to give her a choice hed just wanted her well he wasnt an animal he could control himself he could think he could reason and that was just what he was going to do hed probably have a scar he thought again grimly as he touched a fingertip gingerly to his swollen lip just let that be a lesson to you dakota he jerked his head in a nod at the reflection in the spotty mirror if you cant trust yourself you sure as hell cant trust her when he came out she was frowning at the hideous drapes on the window he glared at her she glared back saying nothing he sat in the single ratty chair crossed his feet at the ankles and tuned into the movie hercules was over hed probably triumphed in his place was a japanese sciencefiction flick with an incredibly poorly produced monster lizard who was currently smashing a highspeed train hordes of extras were screaming in terror they watched awhile as the military came rushing in with large guns that had virtually no effect on the giant mutant lizard a small man in a combat helmet was devoured his chickenhearted comrades ran for their lives mj found the candy bar from her purse that jack had tossed her earlier broke off a chunk and ate it contemplatively as the lizard king from outer space lumbered toward tokyo to wreak reptilian havoc can i have my water she asked in scrupulously polite tones he got up fetched it out of her bag handed it over thanks she took one long sip waited until hed settled again whats your fee she demanded he took another soda out of his cooler wished it was a beer for what you do she shrugged say i had skipped out on bail what do you get for bringing me back depends why she rolled her eyes depends on what on how much bail youd skipped out on she was silent for a moment as she considered the lizard demolished a tall building with many innocent occupants what was it i was supposed to have done shot your lover the accountant i believe his name was hank very funny she broke off another hunk of chocolate and when jack held out a hand reluctantly shared how much were you going to get for me more than youre worth now she sighed im going to make you a deal jack but im a businesswoman and i dont make them blind whats your fee interesting he thought and drummed his fingers on the arm of the chair for you sugar considering what youre carrying in that suitcase you call a purse adding in what ralph offered me to turn you over to the goons he thought it over a hundred large she didnt bat an eye i appreciate you trying to lighten the situation with an attempt at wry humor a hundred k for a man who cant even take out a single hired thug by himself is laughable who said i couldnt take him out his pride leaped up and bit him i did take him out sugar him and his cannon and you havent bothered to thank me for it oh excuse me it must have slipped my mind while i was being dragged around and handcuffed how rude and you didnt take him out i did but regardless she continued holding up her free hand like a traffic cop now that weve had our little joke lets try to be serious ill give you a thousand to work with me on this a thousand he flashed that quick dangerous grin sister there isnt enough money in the world to tempt me to work with you but for a hundred k ill get you out of the jam youre in in the first place she drew up her legs sat lotusstyle im not your sister and im not your sugar if you have to refer to me use my name you dont have a name you have initials in the second place she said ignoring him if a man like you got his hands on a hundred thousand hed just lose it in vegas or pour it down some strippers cleavage since i dont intend for that to happen to my money im offering you a thousand she smiled at him with that you can have yourself a nice weekend at the beach with a keg of imported beer its considerate of you to look out for my welfare but youre not really in the position to negotiate terms here you want help itll cost you she didnt know if she wanted his help the fact was she wasnt at all sure why she was wrangling with him over a fee under the circumstances she felt she could promise him any amount without any obligation to pay up if and when the time came but it was the principle of the thing five thousand and you follow orders seventyfive and i dont ever follow orders five she set her teeth take it or leave it ill leave it casually he picked up the stone again held it up studied it and take this with me he rose patted his back pocket and maybe ill call the cops on your fancy little phone after im clear she fisted her fingers flexed them she didnt want to involve the police not until shed contacted bailey nor could she risk him following through on his threat to simply take the stone fifty thousand she bit the words off like raw meat thats all ill be able to come up with most everything ive gots tied up in my business he cocked a brow the finders fee on this little baubles got to be worth more than fifty i didnt steal the damn thing it doesnt belong to me its she broke off clamped her mouth shut he started to sit on the edge of the bed again remembered what had happened before and chose the arm of the chair who does it belong to mj im not spilling my guts to you for all i know youre as big a creep as the one who broke down my door you could be a thief a murderer he cocked that scarred eyebrow which is why ive robbed and murdered you the days young let me point out the obvious im the only one around that doesnt inspire confidence she brooded a moment how far did she dare use him she wondered and how much did she dare tell him if you want my help he said as if reading her mind then i need facts details and names im not giving you names she shook her head slowly thats out until i talk to the other people involved and as for facts and details i dont have many give me what you do have she studied him again no she didnt trust him not nearly as far as she could throw him if she ever got the opportunity but she had to start somewhere unlock me he shook his head lets just leave things as they are for the moment but he rose walked over and shut off the television whered you get the stone mj she hesitated another instant trust wasnt the issue she decided he might help if in no other way than just by providing her with a sounding board a friend sent it to me overnight courier i just got it yesterday where did it come from originally from asia minor i believe she shrugged off his hiss of annoyance im not telling you where it was sent from but i will tell you there had to be a good reason my friends too honest to steal a handshake all i know is it was sent with a note that said for me to keep it with me at all times and not to tell anyone until my friend had a chance to explain abruptly she pressed a hand to her stomach and the arrogance died out of her voice my friends in trouble its got to be terrible trouble i have to call no calls look jack no calls he repeated whoevers after you might be after your pal his phone could be tapped which would lead them back to you which leads them to me so no calls now how did your honest friend happen to get his hands on a blue diamond that makes the hope look like a prize in a box of cracker jack in a perfectly legitimate manner stalling she combed her fingers through her hair he thought her friend was male why not leave it that way look im not getting into all of that all im going to tell you is he was supposed to have his hands on it look let me tell you about the stone its one of three at one time they were part of an altar set up to an ancient roman god mithraisin was one of the major religions of the roman empire the three stars of mithra he murmured and had her eyeing him first in shock then with suspicion how do you know about the three stars i read about them in the dentists office he murmured now when he picked up the stone it wasnt simply with admiration it was with awe it was supposed to be a myth the three stars set in the golden triangle and held in the hands of the god of light its not a myth mj told him the smithsonian acquired the stars through a contact in europe just a couple months ago my friend said the museum wanted to keep the acquisition quiet until the diamonds were verified and assessed he thought aloud insured and under tight security they were supposed to be under security mj told him and he answered with a soft laugh doesnt look like it worked does it the diamonds represent love knowledge and generosity his eyes narrowed as he contemplated the ancient stone i wonder which this one is i couldnt say she continued to stare at him fascinated hed gone from tough guy to scholar in the blink of an eye but apparently you know as much about it as i do i know about mithraism he said easily it predates and parallels christianity mankinds always looked for a kind and just god his shoulders moved as he turned the stone in his hand mankind doesnt always get what it wants and i know the legend of the three stars it was said the god held the triangle for centuries and holding it tended the world then it was lost or looted or sank with atlantis for his own pleasure he switched on the lamp watched the stone explode with power in the dingy light more likely it just ended up in the treasure room of some corrupt roman procurer he traced the facets with his thumbs its something people would kill for or die for he murmured some legends have it in cleopatras tomb others have merlin casing it in crystal and holding it in trust until arthurs return others say the god himself hurled them into the sky and wept at mans ignorance but the smart money was that theyd simply been stolen and separated he looked up over the stone and into her eyes worth a fortune singly and within the triangle worth immortality yes she could admit he fascinated her the way that deep allman voice had cooled into professorial tones and the way he stroked the gleaming diamond as a man might stroke a womans gleaming flesh but she shook her head over the last statement you dont believe that no but thats the legend isnt it whoever holds the triangle with the stars in place gains the power of the god and his immortality but not necessarily his compassion people have killed for less a hell of a lot less he set the stone on the table between them where it glowed with quiet fire it had all changed now he realized the stakes had just flown skyhigh and the odds mirrored them youre in a hell of a spot mj whoevers after this wont think twice about taking your head with it he rubbed his chin his fingers dancing over the shallow dimple and my heads awfully damn close to yours just now he couldnt believe how poor his luck was his own mistake he told himself as he calmed himself with mozart and moet because he tried to keep his distance from events hed had to count on others to handle his business incompetents one and all he thought and soothed himself by stroking the pelt of a sable coat that had once graced the shoulder of czarina alexandra to think hed enjoyed the irony of having a bounty hunter track down the annoying ms oleary it would have been simpler to have her snatched from her apartment or place of business but hed preferred finesse and again the distance the bounty hunter would have been blamed for her abduction and her death such men were violent by nature unpredictable the police would have closed the case with little thought or effort now she was on the run and most certainly had the stone in her possession she would turn up he thought taking slow even breaths she would certainly contact her friends before too much longer hed been assured they were admirably loyal to each other he was a man who appreciated loyalty and when ms oleary attempted to contact her friends one who had vanished the other out of reach he would have her and the stone with her he had no doubt he would acquire the other two stars after all he thought with a pleasant smile bailey james was reputed to be a good friend a com passionate and intelligent woman intelligent enough he mused to have uncovered her stepbrothers attempt to copy the stars smart enough to thwart them before they had made good on delivery well that too would be dealt with he was sure bailey would be loyal to her friend compassionate enough to put her friend first and her loyalty and compassion would deliver the stones to him without much more delay in exchange for the life of m j oleary he had spent many years of his life in search of the three stars he had invested much of his great wealth and had taken many lives now they were almost in his hands so close he thought so very close his fingers tingled with anticipation and when he held them fit them into the triangle set them on the altar hed had built for them he would have the ultimate power immortality then of course he would kill the women a fitting sacrifice he reflected to a god chapter contents prev next hed left her alone now she had to consider the matter of trust should she believe hed just go out pick up food and come back he hadnt trusted her to stay mj mused rattling the handcuffs and she had to admit hed gauged her well shed have been out the door like a shot not because she was afraid of him shed considered all the facts all her instincts and she no longer believed hed hurt her he would have done so already shed seen the way he dealt with the gorilla who broke in her door true hed had his hands full but hed handled himself with speed strength and an admirable streak of mean it galled to admit it but she knew hed held back when he tangled with her not that it excused him trussing her up and tossing her in some cheap motel room but if she was going to be fairminded she had to say he could have done considerable damage to her during their quick sweaty bout if hed wanted to and all hed really bruised was her pride he had a brain which had surprised her that was she supposed a generalizingfromafirstimpression mistake shed fallen into because of his looks and that sheer inyourface physicality but in addition to the street smarts she would have expected from his type it appeared jack dakota had an intellect a good one and she didnt believe he did his reading in the dentists office a guy didnt read about ancient religions while he was waiting to have his teeth cleaned so she had to conclude there was more to him than shed originally assumed all she had to do was decide whether that was an advantage or a disadvantage now that shed calmed down a little she was certain that he wasnt going to push himself on her sexually either shed have given odds that little interlude had shaken him as much as it had shaken her it had been she was sure a misstep on his part intimidate the woman flex the testosterone and shell tell you whatever you want to know it hadnt worked all it had done was make them both itchy damn the man could kiss but she was getting off track she reminded herself and scowled at the ridiculous movie hed left blaring on the television no she wasnt afraid of him but she was afraid of the situation which meant she didnt want to sit here on her butt and do nothing action was her style whether the action was wise or not wasnt the point the doing was shifting to her knees she peered at the handcuffs turning her wrist this way and that flexing her hand as if she were an escape artist preparing to launch into her latest trick she tested the rungs on the headboard and found them distressingly firm they didnt make cheap hotels like they used to she thought with a sigh and wished for a hairpin a nail file a hammer all she found in the sticky drawer of the night stand was a torn phone book and a linty wedge of hard candy hed taken her purse with him and though she knew she wouldnt find that hairpin nail file or hammer inside she still resented the lack of it she could scream of course she could shout down the roof and endure the humiliation if someone actually paid any attention to the sounds of distress and that wouldnt get her out of the cuffs unless someone called a locksmith or the cops she took a deep breath struggled for the right avenue of escape she was sick with worry for bailey and grace desperate to reassure herself that they were both well if she did go to the police what kind of trouble would bailey be in she had technically taken possession of a fortune would the authorities be understanding or would they slap bailey in a cell that mj wouldnt risk not yet not as long as she felt it was remotely possible to even the odds and to do that she had to know what the hell she was up against which again meant getting out of the room she was considering gnawing at the headboard with her teeth when jack unlocked the door he flashed a quick smile at her one that told her he had her thoughts pegged honey im home youre a laugh riot dakota my sides are aching you make quite a picture cuffed to that bed mj he set down two white takeout bags a lesser man would be toying with impure notions right about now it was her turn to smile wickedly you already did and youll probably have a scar on your bottom lip yeah he rubbed his thumb gingerly over the wound it still stung id say i deserved it but you were cooperating initially that stung too the truth often did you go right on thinking that jack she all but purred it im sure an ego like yours requires regular delusions sugar i know a delusion from a lip lock but weve got more important things to do than discuss your attraction for me pleased with that last sally he reached into one of the bags burgers the smell bit her like a fist right in the empty stomach her mouth watered so are we going to hole up here like a couple of escaped convicts she rattled her chain for emphasis and eat greasy food you bet he handed her a burger and took out an order of fries designed to clog the arteries and improve the mood i think better when im eating companionably he stretched out beside her back against the headboard legs extended food on his lap weve got us a serious problem here if weve got us a serious problem here why am i the only one with handcuffs he loved the sarcastic edge in her voice and he wondered what was wrong with him because youd have done something stupid if i hadnt left you secured im looking out for my investment he gestured with the rest of his burger and thats you sugar i can look out for myself and if im hiring you then you should be taking orders the first order is unlock these damn things ill get to it once we set up the ground rules he popped open a paper package of salt dribbled it on the fries ive been thinking well then she munched bitterly on an overcooked burger between two slices of slightly stale bun why am i worried youve been thinking youve got a sarcastic mouth but i like that about you he handed her a tiny paper napkin you got ketchup on your chin now somebody put the pressure on ralph enough that ralph falsified official paperwork and put my butt in a sling he wouldnt have done it for money not that ralph doesnt like money jack continued but he wouldnt risk his license or risk me coming after him for a few bucks so he was saving his skin and since ralph is a pillar of the community no doubt this narrows down the list it means it was somebody with punch somebody who wasnt afraid old ralph would tip me off or go to the cops somebody who wanted you taken out who knows youve got the rock nobody except the person who sent it to me she frowned at her burger and possibly one other if more than one person knows a secret it isnt a secret how did your friend get the diamond mj you cant keep dancing around the data here ill tell you after i clear it with my friend i have to make a phone call no calls you called ralph she pointed out i took a chance and we were mobile youre not making any calls until i know the score the diamond was shipped just yesterday he mused they tagged you fast which means they tagged my friend her stomach turned over jack please i have to call i have to know the emotion choking her voice both weakened and annoyed him he stared into her eyes how much does he mean to you she started to correct him then just shook her head everything no one in the world means more to me lucky guy it wasnt the response shed wanted or expected fueled by frustration and fears she grabbed his shirt what the hells wrong with you someone tried to kill us how can we just sit here thats just why were sitting here we let them chase their tails awhile your friends on his own for now and since i cant picture you falling for some jerk who cant handle himself he should be fine you dont understand anything she sat back dragged her fingers through her hair god this is a mess i should be getting ready to go in to work now and instead im stuck here with you im supposed to be behind the stick tonight you tend bar he lifted a brow i thought you owned the place thats right i own the place it was a source of pride i like tending bar you have a problem with that nope since the topic had distracted her he followed it are you any good nobody complains howd you get into the business when she eyed him owlishly he shrugged come on a little conversation over a meal cant hurt we got time to kill that wasnt all she wanted to kill but the rest would have to wait im a fourthgeneration pub owner my greatgrandfather ran his own public house in dublin my grandfather immigrated to new york and worked behind the stick in his own pub he passed it to my father when he moved to florida i practically grew up behind the bar what part of new york west side seventyninth and columbus olearys the grin came quick and close to dreamy lots of dark wood and lots of brass live irish music on saturday nights and they build the finest guinness this side of the atlantic she eyed him again intrigued despite herself youve been there i downed many a pint in olearys that would have been ten years ago more or less hed been in college then he remembered working his way through courses in law and literature and trying to make up his mind who the devil he was i was up there tracing a skip about three years ago stopped in nothing had changed not even the scars on that old pine bar it made her sentimental couldnt be helped nothing changes at olearys i swear the same two guys were sitting on the same stools at the end of the bar smoking cigars reading the racing form and drinking irish callahan and oneal it made her smile theyll die on those stools and your father pat oleary son of a bitch steeped in the haze of memory he shut his eyes that big wide irish face and wiry shock of red hair with a voice straight out of a cagney movie yeah thats pop she murmured only more sentimental you know when i walked in it had been at least six years since id walked out your father grinned at me how are you this evening college boy he said to me and took a pint glass and starting building my beer you went to college his hazy pleasure dimmed considerably at the shock in her voice he opened one eye so so you dont look like the college type she shrugged and went back to her burger i build a damn good guinness myself could use one now me too maybe later so this friend of yours how long have you known him my friend and i go back to our own college days theres no one i trust more if thats what youre getting at maybe you ought to rethink it just consider he said when her eyes fired the three stars are a big temptation for anyone so maybe he was tempted maybe he got in over his head no it doesnt play like that but i think someone else might have and if my friend found out about it she pressed her lips together if you wanted to protect those stones to make certain they werent stolen didnt fall as a group into the wrong hands what would you do it isnt a matter of what id do he pointed out but what hed do separate them mj said pass them on to people you could trust without question people who would go to the wall for you because youd do the same for them without question absolute trust absolute loyalty he balled his napkin twopointed it into the waste can i cant buy it then im sorry for you she murmured because you cant buy it it just is dont you have anyone whod go to the wall for you jack no and theres no one id go to the wall for for the first time in his life it bothered him to realize it he scooted down closed his eyes im taking a nap youre taking a what a nap youd be smart to do the same how can you possibly sleep at a time like this because im tired his voice was edgy and because i dont think im going to get much sleep once we get started weve got a couple hours before sundown and what happens at sundown it gets dark he said and tuned her out she couldnt believe it the man had shut down like a machine switched off like a hypnotists subject at the snap of a finger like a she scowled when she ran out of analogies at least he didnt snore well this was just fine she fumed this was just dandy what was she supposed to do while he had his little liemedown mj nibbled on the last of her fries frowned at the tv screen where the giant lizard was just meeting his violent end the cable channel had promised more where that came from on its marathon monsters and heroes holiday weekend festival oh goody she lay in the darkened room considering her options and considering fell asleep and sleeping dreamed of monsters and heroes and a blue diamond that pulsed like a living heart jack woke wrapped in female he smelled her first a tang just a little sharp of lemony soap clean fresh and simple he heard her the slow even relaxed breathing felt the quiet intimacy of shared sleep his blood began to stir even before he felt her long umber limbs a shapely yard of leg was tossed over his own one welltoned arm with skin as smooth as new cream was flung over his chest her head was settled companionably on his shoulder mj was a cuddler he realized and smiled to himself whod have thought it before he could talk himself out of it he lifted a hand brushed it lightly over her tousled cap of hair bright silk he mused it was quite a contrast to all that angled toughness she sure had style his kind of style he decided and wondered what direction they might have taken if he just walked into her pub one night and put some moves on her shed have kicked him out on his butt he thought and grinned what a woman it was too bad too damn bad that he didnt have time to try out those moves because he really wanted another taste of her and because he did he slid out from under her stood and stretched out the kinks while she shifted and tried to find comfort she rolled onto her back and flung her free hand over her head the restless animal inside him stirred he grabbed it in a choke hold and reminded himself that he was occasionally a civilized man civilized men didnt climb onto a sleeping woman and dive in but they could think about it since it would be safer all around to think about it at a distance he went into the bathroom splashed cold water on his face and considered his next move in dreams she was holding the stone in her hand wondering at it as streams of sunlight danced through the canopy of trees instead of penetrating the stone the rays bounced off creating a flashing whirl of beauty that stung the eyes and burned the soul it was hers to hold if not to keep the answers were there secreted inside if only she knew where to look from somewhere came the growl of a beast low and feral she turned toward it rather than away the stone protected in the fist of her hand her other raised to defend something moved slyly in the brush hidden waiting searching hunting then he was there astride a massive black horse at his side was a sword of dull silver its width a thick slab of violence his gray eyes were granitehard and as dangerous as any beast that slunk over the ground he held a hand down to her and there was challenge in that slow smile danger ahead danger behind she stepped forward clasped hands with him and let him pull her up on the gleaming black horse the horse reared high trumpeted when they rode they rode fast the blood beating in her head had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with triumph she came awake with her heart pounding and her blood high she was in the dim cramped motel room with jack shaking her shoulder roughly what what naps over he considered kissing her awake risking her fist in his face but it would be too distracting weve got places to go where she struggled to shake off sleep and the silky remnants of the dream to visit a friend he unlocked the cuffs from the headboard snapped them on his own wrist linking mj to him you have a friend ah shes awake now he pulled her outside into a misty dusk that still pulsed with heat get in and slide over he instructed when he opened the drivers side door she was still groggy enough that she obeyed without question but by the time hed started the engine her wits were back look jack these handcuffs have got to go i dont know i kind of like them this way did you ever see that movie with tony curtis and sidney poitier great flick were not escaped cons running for a train here dakota if were going to have a business relationship there has to be an element of trust sugar you dont trust me any more than i trust you he steered out of the pitted lot kept to the speed limit look at it this way he lifted his hand causing hers to jerk were both in the same boat and i could have just left you back there she drummed her fingers on her knee why didnt you i thought about it he admitted i could move faster without you along but id rather keep my eye on you and if things go wrong and i cant get back id hate for you to have to explain why youre cuffed to the bed of a cheap motel damn considerate of you i thought so though its your fault im flying blind itd be easier if youd fill in the blanks think of it as a challenge oh i do it and you he slanted her a look whats this guy got mj this friend of yours youd risk so much for she looked out her window thought of bailey then pushed the thought aside worry for bailey only brought the fear back and fear clouded the mind and made it sluggish you wouldnt understand love would you jack her voice was quiet without its usual edge and her gaze passed over his face in a slow search the kind that doesnt ask questions doesnt require favors or have limits no inside the emptiness her words brought him curled an edgy fist of envy id say if you dont ask questions or have limits youre a fool and youre no fool under the circumstances you should be grateful im not ill get you out of this mj then youll owe me fifty thousand you know your priorities she said with a sneer yeah money smooths out a lot of bumps on the road and i say before you pay me off we end up in bed again only this time it wont be to take a nap she turned toward him fully and ignored the quick pulse of excitement in her gut dakota the only way ill end up in the sack with you is if you handcuff me again there was that smile slow insolent damnably attractive well that would be interesting wouldnt it wanting to make time he swung onto the interstate headed north and he promised himself that not only would he get her into bed but she wouldnt think of another man when he did youre heading back to dc thats right weve got some business there in the glare of oncoming headlights his face was grim he took a roundabout route circling cruising past his objective winding his way back until he was satisfied none of the cars parked on the block were occupied there was pedestrian traffic as well hed sized it up by his second pass deals were being made he mused and that kind of business kept people moving nice neighborhood she commented watching a drunk stumble out of a liquor store with a brown paper sack just charming yours ralphs were only a couple blocks from the courthouse he cruised past a prostitute who was well off the usual stroll and pulled around the corner he likes the location it was an area she knew that even the most fearless cabbies preferred to avoid an area where life was often worth less than the spit on the sidewalk and those who valued theirs locked their doors tight before sundown and waited for morning here the graffiti smeared on the crumbling buildings wasnt an art form it was a threat she heard someone swearing viciously then the sound of breaking glass a man of taste and refinement your friend ralph former friend he took her hand obliging her to slide across the seat when he climbed out that you dakota that you a man slipped out of the shadows of a doorway his eyes were fire red and skittish as a whipped dogs he ran the back of his hand over his mouth as he shambled forward in battered hightops and an overcoat that had to be stifling in the midsummer heat yeah freddie hows it going been better been better jack you know his eyes passed over mj then moved on been better he said again yeah i know jack reached in his front pocket for the bills hed already placed there you could use a hot meal a hot meal freddie stared at the bills moistened his lips sure could do with a hot meal all right you seen ralph aint freddies shaky fingers reached for the money clamped on he blinked up when jack continued to hold the bills aint he repeated musta closed up early its a holiday the fourth of july damn kids been setting off firecrackers already cant tell them from gunshots damn kids whens the last time you saw ralph i dunno yesterday he looked at jack for approval yesterday probably ive been here awhile but i aint seen him and his place is locked up have you seen anybody else who doesnt belong here her freddie pointed at mj and smiled she dont besides her nope nobody the voice went whiny i sure been better jack you know yeah without bothering to sigh jack turned the money loose get lost freddie yeah okay and he hurried down the street around the comer hes not going to buy food mj murmured you know what hes going to buy with that you cant save the world sometimes you cant even save a little piece of it but maybe he wont mug anybody tonight or get himself shot trying to jack shrugged hes been dead since the first time he picked up a needle nothing i can do about it then why do you feel so lousy about it she lifted a brow when he looked down at her its all over your face dakota he used to have a family was all he said by way of an answer lets go he led her up the street then ducked down the side of a building to her surprise he unlocked the cuffs youve got more sense than to take off in this neighborhood he smiled and ive got your rock locked in the trunk of my car on a street like this youll be lucky if your cars still there when you get back around they know my car nobodyll mess with it then he turned whirled really and made her jolt as he slammed two vicious kicks into a dull gray door she heard wood splinter and pursed her lips in appreciation as the door gave way on the third try nice job thanks and if ralph didnt get cute and change the code were in business he stepped inside scanned an alarm box beside the broken door with quick fingers he stabbed numbers how do you know his code i make it my business to know things move aside with a strength she had to admire he hauled the broken door up muscled it back into place ralph should have gone for steel too cheap he flicked on the lights scanned the tiny space that was crammed with file boxes and smelled of must mj watched a mouse scamper out of sight charming im very impressed with your associates so far dakota would this be his secretarys year off ralph doesnt have a secretary either hes a big believer in low overhead office is through here i cant wait wary of rodents and anything else with more than two legs she watched her step as she followed him this is what they call nighttime breaking and entering isnt it cops have a name for everything he paused with his hand on a doorknob glanced over his shoulder if you wanted someone whod knock politely on the front door you wouldnt be with me she lifted her arm rattled the dangling handcuffs remember these he only shook his head you wouldnt be with me he repeated and opened the door she sucked in her breath but it was the only sound she made later he would remember that and appreciate her grit and her control the backwash of light from the anteroom spilled into the closetsize office gunmetalgray file cabinets scarred and dented lined two walls papers spilled out of the open drawers uttered the floor fluttered on the desk under the breeze of a whining electric fan blood was everywhere the smell of it roiled in her stomach had her clamping her teeth and swallowing hard but her voice was steady enough when she spoke that would be ralph chapter contents prev next it had been a messy job jack thought if it had been pros they hadnt bothered to be quick or neat but then thered been no reason for either ralph was still tied to the chair or what was left of him was you can wait in the back jack told her i dont think so she wasnt a stranger to violence a girl didnt grow up in a bar and not see blood spilled from time to time but shed never seen anything like this as realistic as she considered herself she hadnt really believed it was possible for one human being to inflict this kind of horror on another she kept her eyes on the wall but stepped in beside him what do you think they were after the same thing i am anything that leads back to whoever used ralph to set us up stupid son of a bitch his voice softened all at once with what could only have been termed regret why didnt he run maybe he didnt have the chance her stomach was settling but she continued to take small shallow breaths we have to call the police sure well call then well wait and explain ourselves from the inside of a cell crouching down he began shuffling through papers jack for gods sake the mans been murdered he wont be any less dead if we call the cops will he never could figure out ralphs filing system havent you got any feelings at all you knew him i havent got time for feelings and since they were trying to surface his voice was rough as sand think about it sugar whoever did this to him would love to play the same game with you take a good look and ask yourself if thats how you want to end up he waited a moment then accepted her silence as understanding now you can go in the back room and save your sensibilities or you can help me sort through this mess when she turned he assumed shed walk away that she might keep on walking no matter the neighborhood but she stopped at a file cabinet grabbed a handful of papers what am i looking for anything that narrows it down and why should there be anything left theyve already been here hed keep a backup somewhere jack hissed at the snowfall of papers why the hell didnt he use a computer like a normal person rising he went to the desk wrenched out a drawer he searched it turning it over checking the underside the back then tossing it aside and yanking out another on the third try he found a false back his quick grunt of approval had mj turning watching him take out a penknife and pry at wood giving up her own search she walked to him by tacit agreement with him she gripped the loosened edge and tugged while he worked the knife around wood splintered from wood its practically cemented on jack muttered and recently how do you know its recent its clean no dust no grime watch your fingers here you take the knife let me they switched jobs he skinned his knuckles swore and continued to peel the wood back all at once it popped free jack took the knife again cut through the tape affixing a key to the back of the drawer storage locker he muttered i wonder what ralph has tucked away bus station train station airport mj leaned closer to study the key it doesnt have a name just a number id go with one of the first two ralph didnt like to fly and the airports a trek from here that still leaves a lot of locks on a lot of boxes she reminded him well track it down do you know how many storage lockers there must be in the metropolitan area he turned the key between his fingers and smiled thinly we only need one he took her hand and before she realized his intent hed cuffed them together again oh for gods sake jack just covering my bases come on weve got work to do at the first bus station hed grudgingly removed the cuffs before dragging mj into a phone booth and making an anonymous call to the police to report the murder then he carefully wiped down the phone if theyve got caller id he told her theyll track down where the call was made and i take it your prints are on file he flashed a grin just a little disagreement over pool in my misspent youth fifty dollars and time served because hed shifted she was backed into the corner of the booth pressed to the wall by his body its a little crowded in here i noticed he lifted a hand skimmed back the hair at her temple you did all right back there a lot of women would have gotten hysterical i dont get hysterical no you dont so give me a break here will you he tipped her face up lowered his head just for a minute and he closed his mouth over hers she could have resisted she meant to but it was an easy kiss with need just a whispering note it was almost friendly could have been friendly if not for the press of his body to hers and the heat rising from it and an easy almost friendly kiss shouldnt have made her want to cling to hold on and hold tight she compromised by fisting a hand on his back not holding but not protesting if her lips softened under his warmed and parted it was only for a moment it meant nothing could mean nothing i want you he murmured the words against her mouth then again when his lips pressed to her throat this is a hell of a time for it a hell of a place but i want you mj im having a hard time getting past that i dont go to bed with strangers whos asking you to he lifted his head met her eyes weve got each other figured dont we and youre not the kind of woman who needs fussy dates or fancy words maybe not the fire hed kindled inside her was still smoldering maybe i havent figured out what i need then think about it he backed off then took her hand and pulled her out of the booth well check the lockers maybe well get lucky they didnt not in that terminal or in the next two it was nearly one in the morning before he pocketed the key i want a drink she let out a breath rolled her shoulders after twelve hours in a waking nightmare she could see his point i wouldnt turn one down you buying why not he steered clear of any of the places where he might be recognized and chose instead a dingy little dive not far from union station good thing ive had my shots mj wrinkled her nose at the sticky stampsize table and checked the chair before she sat it was either this or a fern bar we can check out union station when weve had a break two of what youve got on tap he told the waitress and cracked a peanut i dont know how places like this stay in business with a critical eye mj studied the atmosphere smokechoked air a generally stale smell sticky floor uttered with peanut shells cigarette butts and worse a few gallons of disinfectant some decent lighting and this joint would turn up one full notch i dont think the clientele cares he glanced toward the surlyfaced man at the bar and the wearyeyed working girl who was casing him some people just come into a bar to engage in the serious business of drinking until theyre drunk enough to forget why they came into the bar to begin with she acknowledged his comment with a nod thats the type i dont want in my place you get them from time to time but they rarely come back theyre not looking for conversation and music or a companionable drink with a pal thats what i serve at my place like father like daughter you could say that mjs eyes narrowed in disapproval as the waitress slammed down their mugs beer sloshed over the tops she wouldnt last five minutes at mjs rude barmaids have their own charm jack picked up his beer and sipped gratefully i meant what i said earlier he grinned when her gaze narrowed on his about that too but i meant how you handled yourself it was a tough room mj for anybody it was a first for me she cleared her throat drank you yeah and i dont mind saying i hope its my last ralph was a jerk but he didnt deserve that id have to say whoever did that to him enjoyed his work youve got some real bad people interested in you it looks that way and those same people she thought would be interested in bailey and grace how long do you figure itll take to find the lock that fits that key no telling knowing ralph he wouldnt go too far afield he hid the key in his office not his apartment so odds are the box is close but if it wasnt it could be hours even days before they found it she wasnt willing to wait that long she took another gulp of beer i need the rest room when he narrowed his eyes she smirked want to come with me he studied her a moment then moved his shoulders make it fast she didnt rush toward the back but her mind was racing ten minutes she calculated that was all she needed to get out get to the phone booth shed seen outside and get through to bailey she closed the door of the ladies room at her back scanned the woman in black spandex primping in the mirror then grinned at the small casement window set high in the wall hey give me a leg up the woman perfected a second coat of bloodred lipstick a what come on be a pal mj hooked a hand on the narrow sill give me a boost will you taking her maddening time the woman slid the top back on her tube of lipstick bad date the worst i know the feeling she tottered over on icepick heels do you really think you can squeeze through that youre skinny but itll be a tight fit ill make it the woman shrugged exuded a puff of toosweet designerknockoff perfume and cupped her hands whatever you say mj bounced a foot in the makeshift stirrup then boosted herself up until she had her arms hooked on the sill a quick wriggle and she was chesthigh just another little push no problem getting into the spirit the woman set both hands on mjs bottom and shoved sorry she said when mj cracked her head on the window and swore its okay thanks she wiggled grunted twisted and forced herself through the opening head then shoulders taking a quick breath trying not to imagine herself remaining corked in the window she muscled her way through with only a quick rip of denim good for you honey mj stayed on her hands and knees long enough to shoot her assistant a quick grin then she was off and running she dug in her pocket as she went for the quarter habitually carried there she could hear her mothers voice never leave the house without money for a phone call in your pocket you never know when youll need it thanks ma she murmured and reached the phone booth at a dead run be there be there she whispered plugging in the coin stabbing numbers she heard baileys calm cool voice answer on the second ring and swore as she recognized the recorded message where are you where are you she clamped down on panic took a breath bailey listen up she began the instant after the beep i dont know what the hells going on but were in trouble dont stay there he may come back im in a phone booth outside some dive near damn idiot jack reached in grabbed her arm hands off you son of a bitch bailey but hed already disconnected her using the confines of the booth to his advantage he twisted her around and clamped the cuffs on so that her arms were secured then he simply lifted her up and tossed her over his shoulder he let her rant let her kick and had her dumped back into the car before a single good samaritan could take interest her threats and promises bounced off him as he peeled away from the curb and shot down side streets so much for trust and where there wasnt trust he thought there had to be proof cautious he doubled back scouting the area until he found a narrow alley half a block from the phone booth he backed in shut off the lights and engine reaching over he vised a hand around the back of her neck pulled her face close you want to see where your phone call would have gotten us just sit tight take your hands off me at the moment having my hands on you is the least of my concerns just be quiet and wait for it when his grip loosened she jerked back wait for what it shouldnt take much longer and brooding into the dark he watched the street it took less than five minutes by his count a little more than fifteen since her call the van crept up to the curb two men got out recognize them of course she did shed seen them only that morning one of them had broken in her door the other had shot at her with a quick tremor of reaction she shut her eyes theyd traced the call from baileys line she realized traced it quickly and efficiently and if jack hadnt moved fast they might very well have snapped her up just as quickly just as efficiently the smaller of the two went into the bar while the other stood by the phone booth scanning the street one hand resting under his suit jacket hell pass the bartender a couple of bucks to see if you were in there if you were alone how long ago you left they wont hang around long theyll find out youre still with me so theyll be looking for the car we wont be able to use it anymore around here tonight she said nothing as the second man came back out joined the first they appeared to discuss something argue briefly and then they climbed back in the van this time it didnt creep down the street it rocketed she remained silent for another moment continued to stare straight ahead you were right she said at length im sorry excuse me im not sure i heard that you were right she had to swallow when she found herself distressingly close to tears im sorry hearing the tears in her voice only heightened his temper save it he snapped and started the engine next time you want to commit suicide just make sure im out of range i needed to try i couldnt not try i thought you were overreacting or just pushing my buttons i was wrong how many times do you want me to say it i havent decided if you start sniveling im really going to get ticked i dont snivel but she wanted to the tears were burning her throat it cost nearly as much to swallow them as it would have to let them free she worked on calming herself as he drove out of the city and headed down a deserted back road in virginia the city lights giving way to comforting dark no ones following us she said thats because im good not because youre not stupid get off my back if id sat in there another five minutes waiting for you i could be as dead as ralph right now so consider yourself lucky i dont just dump you on the side of the road and take myself off to mexico why dont you ive got an investment he caught the look the glimmer of wet eyes and ground his teeth dont look at me like that it really makes me mad swearing he swerved to the shoulder yanking the key from his pocket he unlocked her hands then slammed out of the car to pace why the hell was he tangled up with this woman he asked himself why hadnt he cut himself loose why wasnt he cutting loose right now mexico wasnt such a bad place he could get himself a nice spot on the beach soak up the sun and wait for all this to blow over nothing was stopping him then she got out of the car spoke quietly my friends in trouble i dont give a damn about your friend he whirled toward her i give a damn about me and maybe i give one about you though god knows why because youve been nothing but grief ever since i watched you swagger up those apartment steps ill sleep with you that cut his minor tirade off in midstream what she squared her shoulders ill sleep with you ill do whatever you want if you help me he stared at her at the way the moonlight showered over her hair at the way her eyes continued to glisten and wanted her mindlessly but not in a barter oh thats nice bitterness spewed through his voice thats great i dont even have to tie you to the damn railroad tracks he stepped toward her grabbed her by the arms and shook what the hell do you take me for i dont know i dont use women he said between his teeth and when i take one to bed its a twoway street so thanks for the offer but im not interested in the supreme sacrifice he let her go started back to the car fury had him turning back do you think your friend would appreciate the gesture if he found out youd slept with me to help him she took a deep steadying breath the depth of his sense of insult had gone farther toward gaining her trust than any promise or oath could have no it wouldnt stop me but no she stepped toward him stopping only when they were within an armspan my friends name is bailey james shes a gemologist he recognized the name from the doctored paperwork but the pronoun was the most vital piece of information to him she yes she we went to college together we roomed together one of the reasons i located in dc was because of bailey and grace she was our other roommate theyre the closest friends i have ever have had im afraid for them and i need your help baileys the one who sent you the stone yes and she wouldnt have done it without good reason i think she may have sent the third one to grace it would be baileys kind of logic she does a lot of consulting work for the smithsonian suddenly tired mj rubbed her gritty eyes i havent seen her since wednesday evening we were supposed to get together tonight at the pub i put a note under her door to check the time with her i work a lot of nights she works days so even though we live right across the hall from each other we pass a lot of notes under the door and lately since she got the job working on the three stars for the smithsonian shes been putting in a lot of overtime i didnt think anything of it when i didnt see her for a couple days and friday you got the package yes i called her at work right away but i only got the service theyd closed until tuesday id forgotten shed told me they were closing down for the long weekend but that shed probably work through it i went by but the place was locked up i called grace got her machine by that time i was annoyed with both of them i figured i just was going to have to assume bailey had her reasons and would let me know so i went to work i just went on to work theres no use beating yourself up about that you didnt have much choice i have a key to her place i could have used it weve got this privacy arrangement which is why we pass notes i didnt use the key out of habit she shuddered out a breath but she didnt answer the phone now when i called from outside that bar and it was two oclock in the morning baileys arrowstraight shes not out at am but she didnt answer the phone and im afraid what they did to that man im afraid for her he put his hands on her shoulders and this time they were gentle theres only one thing to do because he thought she might need it he pressed a kiss to her brow well check it out she let out her breath on a shuddering sigh thanks but this time you have to trust me this time i will he opened the door waited for her to get in the other friend you were talking about the he she pushed her hair back looked up there is no he so he leaned down captured her mouth with his in one long searing kiss theres going to be he took a chance went back to union station first theyd be looking for his car true enough but he was banking on the moldy gray of the olds with its scarred vinyl top blending in and he intended to be quick bus and train stations were all very much the same in the middle of the night he thought the people curled in chairs or stretched out in blankets werent all waiting for transportation some of them just had nowhere else to go keep moving he told mj and keep sharp i dont want to get cornered in here she wondered as she matched her pace to his why such places smelled of despair in the early hours there was none of the excitement the bustle the anticipation of goings and comings so evident during the daylight hours those who traveled at night or looked for a dry corner to sleep were usually running low on hope you said we were going to check on bailey soon as im done with this he headed straight for the storage lockers did a quick scan sometimes you just get lucky he murmured and matching numbers slid the key into a lock mj leaned over his shoulders whats in there stop breathing down my neck and ill see backup copies of your paperwork he said and handed them to her souvenir for you gee thanks im really going to want a memento of our little vacation jaunt but she stuffed them in her bag after a cursory glance her interest perked up when jack drew out a small notebook covered in fake black leather that looks more promising wheres his running money jack wondered deeply disappointed not to find any cash when he swiped his hand around the locker a last time hed have kept some ready in here if he had to catch a train fast maybe hed already taken it out he opened his mouth to disagree then shut it again yeah youve got a point could be he wanted to have it on him if he wanted to make a fast exit brows knit he flipped through the book names numbers addresses phone numbers she asked craning her neck to try to see no amounts dates payoffs he decided looks to me like ralph was running a little blackmail racket on the side salt of the earth your friend ralph former friend jack said automatically before he remembered it was literally true very former he murmured if this got out hed have lost more than his business hed have been doing time in a cell do you think someone decided to blackmail the blackmailer follows and not everybody puts the arm on for money he shook his head according to the figures ralph had made more than a decent income with his sideline sometimes they go for blood what good does this do us mj demanded not a hell of a lot he tucked the book into his back pocket scanned the terminal again but someone ralph was squeezing squeezed back or more likely someone who knew about ralphs little moonlighting project saved the information until it became useful then killed him mj added as her stomach tightened whoever did isnt just connected with that little book or ralph theyre connected to bailey through the stones i have to find her next stop he said and took her hand in his chapter contents prev next mj understood the risk and prepared herself to make no arguments whatever about jacks instructions shed ask no questions this was his area of expertise after all and she needed a pro that vow lasted less than thirty minutes why are you just driving around she demanded you should have turned left back at the corner did you forget how to get there no i didnt forget how to get there i dont forget how to get anywhere she rolled her eyes in his direction well if youve got a map in your head youve just taken a wrong turn no i didnt men she thought on a huff of breath im telling you i live here the apartments three blocks that way hed told himself hed be patient with her she was under a lot of stress theyd both put in a long rough day his good intentions fled to the place mjs vow had gone i know where you live he snapped i had your place staked out for two hours while you were out shopping i wasnt shopping i was buying and thats entirely different and you still havent answered my very simple question do you ever shut up are you ever anything but rude he braked at a light drummed his fingers on the wheel you want to know why im driving around ill tell you why im driving around because there are two guys with guns in a van looking for us specifically in this car and if they happen to be in the area id just as soon see them before they see us and the reason for that is id prefer not being shot tonight is that clear enough she folded her arms over her chest why didnt you just say so in the first place his answer was a mutter as he turned again he drove sedately for a half block then pulled over to the curb shut off the engine why are you stopping here were still blocks away look jack if your testosterones low and youre lost i wont hold it against you i can im not lost he put both hands in his hair and was tempted to pull i never get lost i know what im doing he reached over popped open the glove box well then why were going on foot he told her and grabbed a pencilbeam flashlight and a he made sure she saw the gun and took his time checking the clip she barely blinked at it that doesnt make any sense if we have to were doing this my way oh big surprise im simply asking im tired of answering really tired of answering but he sighed out a breath were going to cut down this street then between those two yards around the building on the next block then through to the back of the apartment were going on foot because well be tougher to spot if theyve got your building staked out she thought it over considered the angles then nodded well that makes sense thanks thanks a lot he grabbed her purse and while she stuttered out a shocked protest emptied her wallet of cash just what the hell do you think youre doing thats my money she snatched back her empty wallet as he stuffed bills in his pocket then goggled as he plucked out the diamond and pushed it in after the bills give me that are you out of your mind she made a grab for him jack simply shoved her back against the seat held her in place and risking another bloody lip crushed his mouth to hers she wriggled muttered what he assumed were oaths popped her fist against his ribs then she decided to cooperate and her cooperation hot avid was a great deal more difficult to resist than her protests he lost himself in her for a moment experienced the shock of being helpless to do otherwise it was like the first time consuming the thought circled in his mind mat hed been waiting all his life to find his mouth pressed to hers just that simple just that terrifying the fist shed struck him with relaxed and her open fingers slid around up his back hooked possessively over his shoulder mine she thought just that easy just that staggering when he shifted back they stared at each other in the dim light two strongminded people whod just had their worlds tilt under them her hand was still gripped on his shoulder and his on hers whyd you do that she managed it was mostly to shut you up his hand skimmed up her shoulder into her hair it changed very slowly she nodded yes it did he had a strong urge to drag her into the back seat and play teenager the idea nearly made him smile i cant think about this now no me either the hand in her hair moved and in a surprisingly sweet gesture took hers laced fingers with hers were going to do more than think about it later yeah her lips curved a little i guess we are lets go no dont take the purse when she opened her mouth to argue he simply tugged it away from her tossed it into the back mj that thing weighs a ton we may have to move fast im taking the cash and the stone because they might make the car or we may not get back to it all right she got out waited for him on the sidewalk glanced briefly at the gun he secured in a shoulder holster i know this is risky i have to do it jack he took her hand again then lets do it they followed the route hed mapped out slipped between yards a dog barking halfheartedly at them the moon was out a bright beacon that both guided their path and spotlighted them he had a moment to intensely wish hed had her change out of the white tshirt it glowed in the dark like a litup flag but she moved well with quiet long strides he already knew she could run if necessary he had to be satisfied with that you have to do what i tell you he began keeping his voice low as he surveyed the back of her building i know that goes against the grain for you but youll have to swallow it if i tell you to move you move if i tell you to run you run no questions no arguments im not stupid i just like to know the reasons this time you just do what youre told and well discuss my reasoning later she struggled to fall into step her cars here she told him quietly the little white compact okay so maybe shes home or he thought she hasnt been able to drive but he didnt think that was what mj needed to hear well go in the side through the fire door work our way around to the stairs no noise mj no conversation okay her eyes were already on baileys windows as they hurried toward the side door the windows were dark the curtains drawn bailey left her curtains open was all she could think bailey liked to look out the windows and rarely shut out her view they slipped inside like shadows and with jack a half step in the lead walked quietly to the steps the security light beamed lighting the hall and stairs jack glanced out the front door keeping well to the side if anyone was watching he mused theyd be spotted easily going into the light it was a chance theyd have to take as they moved up the stairs he listened for any sound any movement it was so late it was early the building slept there wasnt even the murmur of a latenight tv behind any of the doors they passed on the second floor when they reached the third mj made her first sound just a quickly indrawn breath instantly muffled there was police tape over her door your neighbor with the bunny slippers called the cops jack murmured odds are theyre looking for you too he held out a hand key she turned kept her eyes on baileys door as she dug into her pocket handed it to him he gestured her back toward the steps to give her room to run away unsheathed his gun then unlocked the door keeping low he used his light to scan saw no movement holding a hand up to keep mj in place he stepped inside what hed seen had already decided him that no one was there but he wanted to check the bedroom the kitchen before mj joined him hed taken the first steps when her gasp unmuffled this time had him turning stay back he ordered stay quiet oh god bailey she shot toward the bed room leaping over ripped cushions overturned chairs like a hurdler coming off the mark he reached the door a step ahead shoved her roughly out of the way hold it together damn it he hissed then opened the door shes not here he said a moment later go close the front door lock it on legs that trembled she crossed back taking a winding path through the destruction of the living room she closed the door locked it then leaned back weakly what have they done to her jack oh god what have they done to her sit down let me look she squeezed her eyes tight fought for control images flitted through her head her and grace sitting in the shade of a boulder while bailey gleefully hunted rocks the three of them giggling like fools late at night over jug wine bailey a wave of blond hair falling into her face soberly contemplating a pair of italian shoes in a store display ill help she said and let out a whoosh of breath i can help yeah he thought watching the way her spine stiffened her shoulders squared she probably could okay youve got to keep it quiet and keep it quick we cant risk the lights or much time he skimmed the beam over the room contents of drawers and closets had been tossed and scattered a few breakables smashed the cushions the mattress even the back of chairs had been slashed so that stuffing poured out in an avalanche of destruction youre not going to be able to tell if anythings missing in all this mess he surveyed the surface damage and calculated that the woman had gone in for tchotchkes in a big way but i can tell you i dont think your friend was here when this went on mj pressed a hand to her heart as though to hold in hope why this wasnt a struggle mj it was a search a quick messy and mostly quiet one id say we have a pretty good idea what they were looking for whether they found it or not shed have it with her mj said quickly her note was very clear that i should keep the stone with me shed have kept it with her if thats true then odds are she still has it she wasnt here he repeated scanning the light into the living room she didnt put up a fight here she wasnt hurt here theres no blood her knees wobbled again no blood and she pressed a hand to her mouth to cut off the little sob of relief okay shes okay she went underground the same way we did if shes as smart as you say she is thats just what shed do shes smart enough to run if she had to run it helped to look at the tumbled room with a more careful eye she doesnt have her car so shes on foot or using public transportation and mjs heart sank at the thought of it she doesnt know the streets jack she doesnt know the ropes baileys brilliant but shes naive she trusts too easily likes to believe the best in people shes sweet mj added on a little shudder she must have picked up something from you he appreciated the fact that she could smile at that even a little lets just take a quick look through this stuff see if anything pops out check her clothes you could probably tell if shed packed things she has a travel kit fully stocked shed never go anywhere without it buffered by that simple everyday fact mj headed into the bath to check the narrow linen closet even there items had been pulled out the shelves stripped bottles opened and emptied but she found the kit itself opened and empty on the floor recognized several of its contents the travel toothbrush the foldup hair brush the travelsize shampoos and soaps its here she stepped into the bedroom did her best to inventory clothes i dont think she took anything theres a suit missing its fairly new so i remember a neat little blue silk she might be wearing it hell shoes and bags i dont know she collects them like stamps she keep a stash anywhere insulted she jerked up her head bailey doesnt do drugs not drugs patience he told himself and cast his eyes at the ceiling you sure have an opinion of me sugar money cash oh she rose from her crouch sorry yeah she keeps some cash it bothered her a little but she led him into the kitchen boy is she going to hate seeing this she really likes things ordered its kind of an obsession with her and her kitchen she kicked some cans coated with the flour and sugar and coffee that had been dumped out of canisters youd be hardpressed to find a crumb in the toaster id say weve all got bigger problems than housekeeping right she bent down retrieved a soup can its one of those fake safe things she explained and twisted off the top she didnt take her emergency money either and there was relief in that she probably hasnt even been back here since hey she jerked the can back but hed already scooped out the cash put that back listen we cant risk using plastic so we need money cash money he stuck a comfortingly thick wad of it in his pocket you can pay her back i can you took it details he muttered grabbing her hand lets go theres nothing here and were pushing our luck i could leave her a note in case she comes back stop dragging me she may not be the only one who comes back he yanked her through the door and kept tugging until they were heading down the stairs ive got to see about grace one friend at a time mj were getting out of dodge for a while i could call her on my phone or your cellular jack if bailey and i are in the middle of this grace is too travel as a pack do you so she hurried toward the side door with him fueled by fresh worry i have to contact her she has a place in potomac i dont think shes there i think shes up at her country place but quiet he eased open the door scanned the quiet side lot the sleeping neighborhood it had been smooth and easy so far smooth and easy made him edgy keep it down until were clear will you god youve got a mouth she snarled with it as he pulled her outside and started eating up the ground i dont see what the problem is whoever was looking for bailey and the diamond have been and gone doesnt mean they wont come back he caught the glint of moonlight off the chrome of the van just as it squealed into the lot sometimes i hate being right go he shouted shoving her ahead of him he whirled to protect her back tried a quick prayer that they hadnt been spotted and decided god was busy at the moment when the van doors burst open the gun was in his hand the first shot fired before he spun around and sprinted after her he hoped the single shot would give his pursuers something to consider i said go he snapped out when he all but mowed her down i heard a shot i thought dont think run he grabbed her hand to be certain she did and was grateful she had no problem keeping pace they stormed between the yards and this time the dog took a keener interest sending up a wild din that carried for blocks moonlight flowed in front of them though he heard no footsteps pounding in pursuit jack didnt break stride as they whipped around the side of a building turned the corner he took time to scan the street then hit the ground running in was all he said as he sprinted to the drivers side he neednt have bothered with the order mj was already wrenching open the door and diving onto the seat they didnt come after us she panted thats bad they should have come after us you catch on he flicked the key hit the gas and shot out from the curb just as the van screamed around the corner grab on to something though she wouldnt have believed it possible he spun the big car into a fast uturn riding two wheels over the opposing curb his bumper kissed lightly off the fender of a sedan and then he was screaming down the quiet suburban street at sixty he took the first turn with the van three lengths behind you know how to use a gun mj picked it up off the seat yeah lets hope you dont have to get your seat belt on if you can manage it he suggested as he jerked the olds around another corner mjs elbow rapped against the dash and dont point that thing in this direction i know how to handle a gun teeth set she braced herself and watched through the rear window just drive theyre closing in jack flicked his gaze into the rear view measured the distance from the oncoming headlights not this time he promised he wound through the streets like a snake tapping the brake flooring the gas whipping the wheel so that his tires whined the challenge of it the speed the insanity had him grinning i like to do this to music and he switched the radio up to blare youre crazy but she found herself grinning madly back at him they want to kill us people in hell want snow cones he hit a fourlane and pushed the car to eighty this tank might not look like much but she moves so does that van youre not shaking them i havent gotten started he skimmed his gaze fast left right then plowed recklessly through a red light traffic was sparse even as they zipped toward downtown thats the trouble with dc he commented no nightlife politicians and ambassadors it has dignity yeah right he wrestled the car around a curve at fifty and began to travel the rabbit warren of narrow back streets and circles he heard the ping of metal against metal as a bullet hit his rear fender now theyre getting nasty i think theyre trying to shoot out the tires i just bought these babies old or new she thought if a bullet hit rubber the game was over mj took a deep breath held it then popped out the window to her waist and fired are you crazy his heart jumped into his throat and nearly had him crashing into a lamppost get your head back in here before you get it blown off grimeyed too wired to be afraid she fired again two can play with the third shot she hit a headlight the shattering glass pumped her adrenaline it hardly mattered that shed been aiming at the windshield i hit them with a mindless snarl jack grabbed the seat of her jeans and dragged her in for the first time in his life his hands trembled on the wheel of his car who do you think you are bonnie parker they backed off no they didnt im outrunning them just let me handle this will you he twisted his way back to the fourlane careened straight across shooting over the median with a bonerattling series of bumps sparks spewed out like stars as steel skidded on concrete with a skill mj admired he wrestled the car into a wide arc then headed north theyre trying it she twisted in the seat poked her head out the window again despite jacks steady swearing i dont think theyre gonna she hooted at the sound of crunching metal theyre backing up heading north on the southbound i can see i dont need a damn playbyplay get back in here strap in this time he hit the onramp for the beltway at sixty and had gained just enough time he calculated to make it work he barreled off at the first exit and headed into maryland you lost them she crawled over and gave him an enthusiastic smack on the cheek youre good dakota damn right he was also shaky the moment he felt he could afford it he pulled to the shoulder and wiped her grin away by grabbing her shoulders and giving her a hard teethrattling shake dont you ever do anything so stupid again youre lucky you didnt fall out of the window or get your head shot off cut it out jack her hand was already fisting i mean it then she went limp as he hauled her against him and held tight his face was buried in her hair his heart was pounding hey baffled moved she patted his back i was just pulling my weight dont his mouth found hers in a desperate kiss just dont and as abruptly as hed grabbed her he shoved her away youve gotten to me he muttered furious at the emotions storming through him just shut up his head whipped around when she opened her mouth just shut up i dont want to talk about it fine her own stomach was trembling as if the fate of the world depended on it she meticulously buckled her seat belt as he pulled back onto the road id really like to call my friend grace his hands were tensed on the wheel but he kept his voice even we cant risk it now we dont know what kind of equipment theyve got in that van and theyre too close yet well see what we can manage tomorrow knowing shed have to settle for that she rubbed her restless hands on her knees jack i know what you risked going to baileys to try to ease my mind i appreciate it just part of the service is it he glanced over met her eyes hell no i said i dont want to talk about it im not talking about it she wasnt sure she knew how or what to do about these unexpected feelings swimming through her im thanking you then youre welcome look im heading back to the bates motel which are you more hungry or tired that at least didnt take any thought hungry good so am i she had a lot of considering to do mj decided her friend was missing she had a priceless blue diamond in her possession or in jacks pocket and shed been chased shot at and handcuffed added to that she was very much afraid she was falling for some tougheyed swaggering bounty hunter who drove like a maniac and kissed like a dream a hot sweaty dream and she knew barely more of him than his name it made no sense and though she enjoyed being reckless in some areas her heart wasnt one of them shed always kept a firm hand there and it was frightening to feel that grip slipping over a man shed literally rammed into only the day before she wasnt a romantic woman or a fanciful one but she was an honest woman honest enough to admit that whatever danger she was facing from the outside she was facing danger just as great just as real from her own heart he was trembling with fury incompetence it was unacceptable to find himself surrounded by utter incompetence it was true hed had to hire the men quickly and with only the thinnest of recommendations but their failure to execute one small task to deal with one woman was simply outrageous he had no doubt he could have dealt with her handily himself if he could have risked the exposure now with the moon set and the stars fading he stood on the terrace calming his soul with a glass of wine the color of new blood it was partly his fault he conceded certainly he should have checked more carefully into the matter of jack dakota but time had been of the essence and he had assumed the fool of a bail bondsman was capable of following the orders to assign someone just competent enough to take her and wise enough to turn her over apparently jack dakota wasnt a wise man but a stubborn one and the woman was infuriatingly lucky m j oleary well perhaps she had the luck of the irish but luck could change he would see to that just as he would see to bailey james she would have to surface eventually hed be ready and grace fontaine pity well he would find the third stone as well he would have all of them and a heavy price would be paid by all who had tried to stop him his fingers snapped the fragile stem glass tinkled on the stone wine splattered and pooled grimly he smiled down watched the red liquid seek the cracks more than blood would be spilled he promised himself and soon chapter contents prev next they settled in the little allnight diner just down from the motel coffee strong enough to walk on came first served by a sleepyeyed waitress wearing a cottoncandypink uniform and a plastic name tag that declared her midge mj shifted in the booth catching her jeans on the torn vinyl of the seat perused the handtyped menu under its plastic coating then propped an elbow on the scarred surface of the coffeestained linoleum that covered their table a very ancient countryandwestern tune was twanging away on the juke and the air was redolent of the thick odor of frying grease aesthetics werent served there but breakfast was twentyfour hours a day thats almost too perfect mj commented after she ordered a whopping breakfast including a short stack eggs over and a rasher of bacon she even looks like a midge hardworking competent and friendly i always wondered if people grew into their names or vice versa like bailey cool studious smart or grace elegant feminine and generous jack rubbed a hand over the stubble on his chin so whats mj stand for nothing he cocked a brow sure it does mary jo melissa jane margaret joan what she sipped her coffee its just initials and thats been made legal too his lips curved ill get you drunk and youll spill it dakota i come from a long line of irish pub owners getting me drunk is beyond your capabilities well have to check that out maybe in your place dark wood he asked with a half smile lots of brass irish music live on weekends yep and not a fern in sight now were talking and seeing as you own it you can buy the first round as soon as were clear its a date she picked up her cup again and boy am i looking forward to it what were not having fun yet she eased back as the waitress set their heaping plates on the table thanks then picked up a fork and dug in its had its moments she told him can i see ralphs book what for so i can admire its handsome plastic binding she said sweetly sure why not he lifted his hips drew it out and tossed it on the table as she flipped through the pages he sampled his eggs see anyone you know it was the cocky tone of his voice that made her delighted to be able to glance up at him smile and say actually i do what he would have snatched the book back if she hadnt held it out of reach who t salvini thats got to be one of baileys stepbrothers no kidding no kidding theres a five and three zeros after his name just think tim or tom did business with ralph you did business with ralph now im in a loose manner of speaking doing business with you those darkrivergreen eyes shifted up met his small world right jack from where im sitting he agreed heres another payment about five k looks like the bill came in on the eighteenth of the month goes four no five months back thoughtfully she tapped the book on the edge of the table now i wonder what one or both of the creeps did that was worth twentyfive thousand to keep ralph quiet about it people do things all the time they want kept quiet and they pay for it one way or another she angled her head youre a real student of human nature arent you dakota and a cynic as well lifes a cynical journey well weve got one solid connection back to ralph maybe well pay the creeps a visit soon theyre businessmen she pointed out slimy from my viewpoint but murders a big jump i cant see it sometimes its a much smaller step than youd think he took the book back pocketed it again on that cynical journey i can see them cooking the books she said speculatively timothy has a gambling problem meaning he likes to play and tends to lose is that so well ralph had a lot of connections when it came to lets say games of chance thats a link that slides neat onto the chain so ralph finds out the creeps playing deep maybe skimming the till to keep from getting his legs broken and he puts the pressure on it might work and salvini whines to somebody whos got more muscle somebody who wants the stars he moved his shoulders and decided to give it a chance to brew in any case that wasnt bad work sugar it was great work she corrected ill cop to good and you looked pretty natural with your hips hanging out the car window shooting at a speeding van he drowned his pancakes in syrup even if it did stop my heart if you ever decide to change careers youd make a passable skip tracer really she wasnt sure if she should be complimented or worried by the assessment she decided to be flattered i dont think i could spend my life on the hunt or being hunted she shook enough salt on her eggs to make jack a sodium fan wince how do you why do you hows your blood pressure hmm never mind i figure you go with your strengths im good at tracking backtracking then figuring out the steps people are planning to take and i like the hunt he grinned wolfishly i love the hunt doesnt matter what size the prey is as long as you bring them down crimes crime not exactly thats a cop attitude but if youve got the right point of view its just as satisfying to snag some deadbeat father running from back child support as it is to bag a guy who shot his business partner you can bring down both if you get to know your quarry mostly theyre stupid theyve got habits they dont break such as a guy dips into the till where he works he gets caught charged then he jumps bail odds are hes got friends relatives a lover it wont take long before he asks somebody for help most people arent loners they think they are but theyre not something always pulls them back theyll make a call a visit leave a paper trail take you surprised she frowned i hadnt done anything thats not the issue youre a smart woman a selfstarter but you wouldnt have gone far you wouldnt have gone long without calling your friends he scooped up eggs smiled at her in fact thats just what you did and what about you who would you call nobody his smile faded he continued to eat as the waitress topped off their coffee no family no he picked up a slice of bacon snapped it in two my father took off when i was twelve my mother handled it by hating the world i had an older brother signed with the army the day he hit eighteen he decided not to come back i havent heard from him in ten twelve years once i got into college my mother figured her job was done and hit the road you could say we dont keep in touch im sorry he jerked his shoulder against the sympathy irritated with himself for telling her he didnt talk family ever with anyone you havent seen your family in all these years she continued unable to prevent herself from probing just a bit you dont know where they are they dont know where you are we werent what youd call close and we didnt spend enough time together to be considered dysfunctional but still i always figured it was in the blood he said cutting her off some people just dont stay put all right she thought his family was out of the conversation it was a tender spot even if he didnt realize it what about you jack how long have you stayed put thats part of the appeal of the job you never know where its going to take you thats not what i meant she searched his face but you knew that i never had any reason to stay her hand rested on the table an inch from his he was tempted to take it just hold it that worried him i know people a lot of people but i dont have friends not the way you do with bailey and grace a lot of us go through life without that mj i know but do you want to i never gave it a hell of a lot of thought he rubbed both hands over his face god i must be tired philosophizing over breakfast in the twilight diner at five in the morning she glanced out the window at the lightening sky to the east the allbutempty road and down the long and silent street the dawn with silversandaled feet crept like a frightened girl finishing the quote he shrugged she was goggling at him how do you know that just what did you take in college whatever appealed to me now she grinned propped her elbows on the table me too i drove my counselors crazy i cant tell you how many times i was told i had no focus but you can quote oscar wilde at am you can shoot a dropkick your average man you eat like a trucker understand ancient roman gods and i bet you mix a hell of a boilermaker the best in town so here we are jack a couple of people most would say are overeducated for their career choices drinking coffee at an ungodly hour of the morning while a couple of guys in a van with one headlight hunt for us and the pretty rock youve got in your pocket its the fourth of july weve known each other less than twentyfour hours under very possibly the worst of circumstances and the person who brought us together is dead as moses she pushed her plate aside what do we do now he took bills out of his pocket tossed them on the table we go to bed the motel room was still tacky cramped and dim the thin flowered spread was still mussed where they had stretched out on it hours before only hours she thought it felt like days a lifetime more than a lifetime it felt as if shed known him forever she realized as she watched him empty his pocket onto the dresser that hed been a vital part of her forever if that wasnt enough maybe the wanting was maybe wanting like this was the best thing to hold on to when your world had gone insane there was nothing and no one left to trust but him why should she say no why should she turn away from comfort from passion from life why should she turn away from him when every instinct told her he needed those things as much as she did he turned and waited he could have seduced her he had no doubt of it she was running on sheer nerves now whether she knew it or not so she was vulnerable and needy and he was there sometimes that alone was enough he could have seduced her would have if it hadnt been important if she hadnt been so inexplicably and vitally important sex would have been a relief a release a basic physical act between two freewilled adults and that should have been all he wanted but he wanted more he stayed where he was beside the dresser as she stood at the foot of the bed ive got something to say he began okay im in this with you until its over because thats the way i want it i finish what i start so i dont want anything that comes from gratitude or obligation if her heart hadnt been jumping she might have smiled i see so if i suggested you sleep in the bathtub that wouldnt be a problem he eased a hip onto the dresser itd be your problem if thats what you want you can sleep in the bathtub well you never claimed to be a gentleman no but ill keep my hands off you she angled her head studied him he looked dangerous plenty dangerous she decided as her pulse quickened the dark stubble the wild mane of hair those hard gray eyes so intense in that tough rawboned face he thought he was giving her a choice she wondered if either of them was fool enough to believe she had one so her smile was slow arrogant she kept her eyes on his as she reached down tugged her tshirt out of her jeans she watched his gaze flick down to her hands follow them up as she pulled the shirt over her head tossed it aside id like to see you try she murmured and unsnapped her jeans he straightened on legs gone watery when she began to lower the zipper i want to do that with heat already tingling in her fingertips she let her hands fall to her sides help yourself her shoulders were long fascinating curves her breasts were pale and small and would cup easily in a mans palm but for now he looked only at her face he took his time tried to crossing to her catching the metal tab between his thumb and finger drawing it slowly down and his eyes were on hers when he slid his hand past the parted denim and cupped her felt her hot naked felt her tremble quick deep i had a feeling she let out a careful breath drew in another through lungs that had become stuffed with cotton i didnt get to my laundry this week good he eased the denim down another inch slid his hands around her bottom youre built for speed mj thats good because this isnt going to be slow i dont think i could manage slow right now he yanked her against him arousal to arousal youre just going to have to keep up her eyes glinted into his her chin angled in a dare i havent had any trouble keeping up with you so far so far he agreed and ripped a gasp from her when he lifted her off her feet and clamped his hungry mouth to her breast the shock was stunning glorious an electric sizzle that snapped through her blood and slapped her heartbeat into overdrive she let her head fall back and wrapped her legs tight around his waist to let him feed the scrape of his beard against her skin the nip of teeth the slide of his tongue each a separate staggering thrill and each separate staggering thrill tore through her system and left her quivering for more the fall to the bed a reckless dive from a cliff the grip of his hands on hers another link in the chain his mouth desperate on hers a demand with only one answer she pulled at his shirt rolled with him until he was free of it and they were both bare to the waist and found the muscles and bones and scars of a warriors body the heat of flesh on flesh raged through her like a firestorm her hands and mouth were no less impatient than his her needs no less brutal with something between an oath and a prayer he flipped her over dragging at her jeans his mouth busily scorched a path down her body as he worked the snug denim off desire was blinding him with hammer blows that stole the breath and battered the senses no hunger had ever been so acute so edgy and keen as this for her he only knew if he didnt have her all of her hed die from the wanting those long naked limbs the energy pulsing in every pore those harsh panting gasps of her breath had the blood searing through his veins to burn his heart wild for her he yanked her hips high and used his mouth on her the climax screamed through her one long hot wave with jagged edges that had her sobbing out in shock and delight her nails scraped heedlessly down his back then up again until they were buried in his thick mane of goldtipped hair she let him destroy her welcomed it and with her body still shuddering from the onslaught wrestled him onto his back to tear at the rest of his clothes she felt his heart thud could all but hear it their flesh slick with sweat slid smoothly as they grappled his fingers found her pierced her drove her past desperation if speech had been possible she would have begged rather than beg she clamped her thighs around him and took him inside fast and deep his fingers dug hard into her hips when she closed over him his breath was gone his heart stopped for an instant with her raised above him her head thrown back his hands sliding sinuously up her body he was helpless hers then she began to move pistonquick riding him ruthlessly in a wild race her breath was sobbing her hands were clutched in her hair in some part of his brain he realized that she too was helpless his he reared up his mouth greedy on her breast on her throat wherever he could draw in the taste of her while they moved together in a merciless driving rhythm then he wrapped his arms around her pressed his lips to her heart groaning out her name as they shattered each other they stayed clutched joined shuddering time was lost to him he felt her grip slacken her hands slide weakly down his back and brushed a kiss over her shoulder he lay back drawing her with him so that she was sprawled over his chest he stroked a hand over her hair and murmured its been an interesting day she managed a weak chuckle all in all they were sticky exhausted and quite possibly insane she thought certainly it was insane to feel this happy this perfect when everything around you was wrecked she could have told him shed never been intimate with a man so quickly or that shed never felt so in tune so close to anyone as with him but there didnt seem to be a point what was happening to them was simply happening opening her eyes she studied the stone resting atop the scarred dresser did it glow she wondered or was it simply a trick of the light of the room what power did it have really beyond material wealth it was just carbon after all with some elements mixed in to give it that rare rich color it grew in the earth was of the earth and had once been taken by human hands from it and had once been held in the hands of a god the second stone was knowledge she thought and closed her eyes perhaps some things were known only to the heart you need to sleep jack said quietly the tone of his voice made her wonder where his mind had wandered maybe she rolled off him stretched out on her stomach across the width of the bed my bodys tired but i cant shut off my head she chuckled again or i cant now that im able to think again making love with you is a regular brain drain thats a hell of a compliment he sat up running a hand over her shoulder down her back then stopping short at the subtle curve of her bottom intrigued he narrowed his eyes leaned closer then grinned nice tattoo sugar she smiled into the hot rumpled bedspread thanks i like it she winced when he switched on the bedside lamp hey lights out just want a clear look amused he rubbed his thumb over the colorful figure on her butt a griffin good eye symbol of strength and vigilance she turned her head cocked it so that she could see his face you know the oddest things jack but yeah thats why i chose it grace got this inspiration about the three of us getting tattoos to celebrate graduation we took a weekend in new york and each got our little butt picture her smile slid away as thoughts of her friends weighed on her heart it was a hell of a weekend we made bailey go first so she wouldnt chicken out she picked a unicorn thats so like her oh god come on turn it off he was mortally afraid she might weep as far as we know shes fine no use borrowing trouble he continued kneading the muscles of her back weve got plenty of our own in a couple hours well clean up go out and cruise around try to call grace okay she pulled in the emotion tucked it into a corner maybe did you run track in college huh the sudden change of subject accomplished just what hed wanted it to it distracted her from worry did you run track youve got the build for it and the speed yeah actually i was a miler i never liked relays im not much of a team player a miler huh he rolled her over and smiling traced a fingertip over the curve of her breast you gotta have endurance her brows lifted into her choppy bangs thats true stamina he straddled her absolutely he lowered his head toyed with her lips and you have to know how to pace yourself so youve got wind for that final kick you bet thats handy he bit her earlobe because im planning on pacing myself this time you know the saying mj the one about slow and steady winning the race i think ive heard of it why dont we test it out he suggested and captured her mouth with his this time she slept as hed hoped she would facedown again he mused studying her crossways over the bed he stroked her hair he couldnt seem to touch her enough and couldnt remember ever having this need to touch before just a brush on the shoulder the link of fingers he was afraid it was ridiculously sentimental and was grateful she was asleep a man with a reputation for being tough and cynical didnt care to be observed mooning like a puppy over a sleeping woman he wanted to make love with her again that at least was understandable to lose himself in sex the hot sweaty kind or the slow and sweet kind shed turn to him he knew if he asked he could wake her now arouse her before her mind cleared shed open for him take him in ride with him but she needed to sleep there were shadows under her eyes those dark witchy green eyes and when the flush of passion faded from her skin her cheeks had been pale with fatigue sharpboned cheeks defined by a curve of silky skin he pressed his fingers to his eyes listen to him he thought the next thing he knew hed be composing odes or something equally mortifying so he nudged her over made himself comfortable hed sleep for an hour he thought setting his internal clock then they would step back into reality he closed his eyes shut down mj woke to the sound of rain it reminded her of lazy mornings summer showers snuggling into the pillow shifting from dream to dream she did so now sliding back into sleep the horse leaped over the narrow stream where shallow water flashed blue her heart leaped with it and she clutched the man tighter smelled leather and sweat around them buttes rose like pale soldiers into a sky fired by a huge white sun the heat was immense he was in black but it wasnt her knight the face was the same jacks face but it was shadowed under a widebrimmed black hat a gun belt rode low on his hips instead of a silver sword the empty land stretched before them wide as the sea with waves of rocks sharpedged as honed knives one misstep and the ground would be stained with their blood but he rode fearlessly on and she felt nothing but the power and excitement of the speed when he reined in turned in the saddle she poured herself into his arms met those hard demanding lips eagerly with her own she offered him the stone that beat with light and a fire as blue as the hottest flame it belongs with the others love needs knowledge and both need generosity he took it from her secured it in the pocket over his heart one finds the other both find the third his eyes lit and you belong to me in the shadow of a rock the snake uncoiled hissed out its warning struck mj shot up in bed a scream strangled in her throat both hands pressed to her racing heart she swayed still caught in the dream fall the snake she thought with a shudder a snake with the eyes of a man lord she concentrated on steadying her breathing controlling the tremors and wondered why her dreams were suddenly so clear so real and so odd rather than stretch out again she found a tshirt jacks and slipped it on her mind was still fuzzy so it took her a moment to realize it wasnt rain she was hearing but the shower and that alone knowing he was just on the other side of the door chased away the last remnants of fear she might be a woman whose pride was based on being able to handle herself in any situation but shed never faced one quite like this it helped to know there was someone who would stand with her and he would she smiled and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes he wouldnt back down he wouldnt turn away he would stick and he would face with her whatever beasts were in the brush whatever snakes there were in the shadows she rose raking both hands through her hair just as the bathroom door opened he stepped out a billow of steam following a dingy white towel was hooked at his waist and his body still gleamed with droplets of water his hair was slick and wet to his shoulders gold glinting through rich brown he had yet to shave she stood heavyeyed tousled from sleep wearing nothing but his wrinkled tshirt tattered at the hem that skimmed her thighs for a moment neither of them could do more than stare it was there as real and alive in the tatty little room as the two of them and it gleamed as bright as vital as the stone that had brought them to this point jack shook his head as if coming out of a dream perhaps one as vivid and unnerving as the one mj had awakened from his eyes went dark with annoyance this is stupid if shed had pockets her hands would have been in them instead she folded her arms and frowned back at him yeah it is i wasnt looking for this you think i was he might have smiled at the insulted tone of her voice but he was too busy scowling and trying desperately to backpedal from what had just hit him square in the heart it was just a damn job nobodys asking you to make it any different eyes narrowed he took a step forward challenge in every movement well it is different yeah she lowered her hands to her sides lifted her chin so what are you going to do about it ill figure it out he paced to the dresser picked up the stone set it down again i thought it was just the circumstances but its not he turned studied her face it would have happened anyway her heartbeat was slowing thickening feels like that to me okay he nodded planted his feet you say it first uhuh for the first time since hed opened the door her lips twitched you damn it he dragged a hand through his dripping hair felt a hundred times a fool okay okay he muttered though she was waiting silently patiently nerves drummed under his skin his muscles coiled like wires but he looked her dead in the eye i love you her response was a burst of laughter that had him clamping his teeth until a muscle jerked in his jaw if you think youre going to play me for a sucker on this sugar think again sorry she snorted back another laugh you just looked so pained and ticked off the romance of its still pittering around in my heart what do you want me to sing it maybe later she laughed again the delighted sound rolling out of her and filling the room right now ill let you off the hook i love you right back is that better the ice in his stomach thawed then heated into a warm glow you could try to be more serious about it i dont think its a laughing matter look at us she pressed a hand to her mouth and sat down on the foot of the bed if this isnt a laughing matter i dont know what is she had him there in fact he realized she had him period now his lips curved with determination okay sugar im just going to have to wipe that smirk off your face lets see if a big tough guy like you can manage it she was grinning like a fool when he shoved her back on the bed and rolled on top of her chapter contents prev next she had to learn to defer to him on certain matters mj told herself that was compromise that was relationship the fact was he had more experience in situations like the one they were in than she did she was a reasonable person she thought one who could take instruction and advice like hell she was come on jack do i have to wait till you drive to outer mongolia to make one stupid phone call he flipped her a look hed been driving for exactly ten minutes he was surprised shed waited that long to complain she was worried he reminded himself the past twentyfour hours had been rough on her he was going to be reasonable in a pigs eye you use that phone before i say and ill toss it out the window she drummed her fingers on the little pocket phone in her hand just answer me this how is anybody going to trace us through this portable were out in the middle of nowhere were less than an hour outside of dc city girl and youd be surprised what can be traced okay maybe he wasnt exactly sure himself if it could be done but he thought it was possible if her friends phone was tapped and whoever was after them had the technology it seemed possible that the frequency of her flip phone could be a trail of sorts he didnt want to leave a trail how hed been afraid shed ask look that things essentially a radio right yeah so radios have frequencies you tune in on a frequency dont you it was the best he could do and it was a relief to see her purse her lips and consider itplus i want to put some distance between where we are and where were staying if it was the fbi on our tails id want them chasing in circles what would the fbi want with us its an example he didnt beat his head on the steering wheel but he wanted to just deal with it mj just deal with it she was trying to trying to remind herself that it had only been a day after all one single day but her life had changed in that single day at least you could tell me where were going im taking north toward pennsylvania pennsylvania then you can make you call after well head southeast toward baltimore he flicked her another glance if the os are in town we can take in a game you want to go to a ball game hey its the fourth of july ball games beer parades and fireworks some things are sacred im a yankee fan you would be but the point is a ballparks a good place to lose ourselves for a couple hours and a good place for a meet if youre able to contact grace grace at a baseball game she snorted right its a good cover he began then frowned your friend has something against the national pastime sports arent exactly graces milieu now a nice rousing fashion show or maybe a thrilling opera it was his turn to snort and youre friends hey ive been known to go to the opera in chains she had to laugh practically yeah were friends she let out a sigh i guess its hard surfacewise to see why the scholar the mick and the princess but we just clicked tell me about them start with bailey since this starts with bailey all right she drew a deep breath watched the scenery roll by little snatches of country thick with trees and hills that rolled shes lovely has this fragile look about her blond browneyed with rosepetal skin she has a weakness for pretty things silly pretty things like elephants she collects them i gave her one carved out of soapstone for her birthday last month remembering how normal it had all been how simple had her pressing her lips together she likes old movies especially the film noir type and she can be a little dreamy at times but shes very focused of the three of us back in college she was the only one who knew exactly what she wanted and worked toward it he liked the sound of bailey jack thought and what did she want gemology shes fascinated by rocks stones not just jewel types we keep talking about the three of us going to paris for a couple weeks but last year we ended up in arizona rockhounding she was happy as a pig in slop and shes had a lot of unhappiness in her life her father died when she was a kid he was an antique dealer so thats another of her weaknesses beautiful old things anyway she adored her dad her mother tried to hold the business together but it must have been rough they lived up in connecticut you can still hear new england in her voice its classy she lapsed into silence a moment struggling to push back the worry her mother married again a few years later sold the business relocated in dc bailey was fond of the guy he treated her well got her interested in gems that was his area sent her to college her mother died when she was in college a car accident it was a rough time for bailey her stepfather died a couple years later its tough losing people right and left yeah she glanced at jack thought of him losing father brother mother perhaps never really having them to lose ive really never lost anyone he understood where her mind had gone and he shrugged you get through you go on didnt bailey yeah but it scarred her its got to scar a person jack people live with scars he wouldnt discuss it she realized and turned back to the scenery her stepfather left her a percentage of the business which didnt sit well with the creeps ah yeah the creeps thomas and timothy salvini theyre twins by the way mirror images slicklooking characters in expensive suits with hundreddollar haircuts thats one reason to dislike them jack noted but its not your main one nope i never liked their attitudes toward bailey and women in general its easiest to say bailey considered them family from the getgo and the sentiment wasnt returned timothy was particularly rough on her i get the impression they mostly ignored her before their old man died and then went ballistic when she inherited part of salvini in the will and whats salvini thats their name and the name of the gem business they design buy sell gems and jewelry out of a fancy place in chevy chase salvini cant say ive heard of it but then i dont buy a lot of baubles they sell some awesome glitters especially the ones bailey designs and they do consultant work for estates museums thats primarily baileys forte too though she loves design work if bailey does design work and consulting what do the creeps do thomas handles the business end accounts sales takes a lot of trips to check out sources for gems timothy works in the lab when it suits him and likes to stride around the showroom looking important restless she reached out to fiddle with the buttons of his stereo and had her fingers slapped hands off touchy about your toys arent you she muttered well anyway its a pretty posh little firm old established rep it was her contacts at the smithsonian that copped them the job with the three stars she was dancing on the ceiling when it came through couldnt wait to get her hands on them put them under one of those machines she uses the somethingmeters and whattayascopes she uses in their lab so she was verifying authenticity assessing value you got it she was dying for us to see them so grace and i went in last week that was the first time id laid eyes on them but they seemed almost familiar spectacular almost unreal yet familiar i suppose its because baileyd described them to us she rolled her shoulders to toss off the sensation and the memory of the dreams youve seen the one touched it its magnificent but to see the three of them together it just stops your heart sounds to me as though they stopped someones conscience if baileys as honest as you say mj interrupted him she is then well have to check out the stepbrothers her brows shot up would they actually have the nerve to try to steal the three stars she wondered could that be why ralph was blackmailing one of them rather than the gambling no well why not then she shook her head answering her own question couldnt be the payments started months ago and theyd just recently got the contract there you go she brooded over it a moment longer but maybe they were planning to steal the stars if they were trying to pull a fast one got away with it it would destroy their business the business their father slaved a lifetime to build she added slowly and that would destroy bailey even the thought of it shed do almost anything to prevent that from happening like ship off the stones to the two people in the world she felt she could trust without question yeah and face down her stepbrothers alone fear was a claw in her throat jack stay logical his voice snapped to combat the waver in hers if theyre involved in this and id say it fits it means theyve got a client a buyer and they need all three stars shes safe as long as they dont shes safe as long as were out of reach theyd be desperate they could be holding her somewhere they might have hurt her hurts a long way from dead theyd need her alive mj until they round up all three and from the rundown youve just given me your pal may have a fragile side and she may be naive but shes not a chump no shes not steadying herself mj looked at the phone in her lap the call she realized wasnt just a risk for herself but a risk for all of them if you want to drive to new york before i use this its okay with me he reached out squeezed a hand over hers were not going to yankee stadium no matter how much you beg i dont just owe you for me now i should have realized it before i owe you for bailey and for grace ive put them in your hands jack he drew his away clamped it on the wheel dont get sloppy on me sugar it pisses me off i love you his heart did a long slow circle in his chest made him sigh hell i guess you want me to say it again now i guess i do i love you whats the mj stand for it made her smile as hed hoped it would look jack wild sex and declarations of love are one thing but i havent known you long enough for that one martha jane i really think its martha jane she made a rude buzzing sound wrong and that puts you out of this round sir better luck next time thered be a birth certificate somewhere he mused he knew how to hunt okay tell me about grace grace is a complicated woman shes utterly unbelievably beautiful thats not an exaggeration ive seen grown men turn into stuttering fools after one flash of her baby blues im looking forward to meeting her youll probably swallow your tongue but thats all right im not the jealous sort and its kind of a kick to watch guys go into instant meltdown around grace you flipped through the pictures in my wallet when you searched my purse didnt you yeah i took a look theres a couple of me with grace and bailey in there he skimmed his mind back focused in and didnt want to tell her hed barely noted the blonde or the brunette the redhead had taken most of his attention the brunette wearing a big silly hat in one of them yeah that was on our rockhounding trip last year we had a tourist snap it anyway shes gorgeous and she grew up privileged and orphaned she lost her folks young and lived with an aunt the fontaines are filthy rich fontaine fontaine his mind circled as in fontaine department stores right the first time theyre rich stuffy snotty snobs grace enjoys shocking them she was expected to do her stint at radcliffe do the obligatory tour of europe and land the appropriate rich stuffy snotty snob husband shes done everything but cooperate and since shes got mountains of money of her own she doesnt really give two damns what her family thinks she paused considered i dont think shed give two damns if she was flat broke either money doesnt drive grace she enjoys it spends it lavishly but she doesnt respect it people who work for their money respect it shes not a donothing trustfunder mj said immediately defensive she just doesnt care if people see her that way she does a lot of charity work quietly thats private shes one of the most generous people i know and shes loyal shes also contrary and moody shell take off for days at a time when the whim strikes her just go it might be rome or it might be duluth she just has to go she has a place up in western maryland i guess youd call it a country home but its small and sweet lots of land very isolated no phone no neighbors i think she was going there this weekend she shut her eyes tried to image i dont know if i could find the place ive only been up there once and bailey did the driving once i get out of the city all those country roads look the same its in the mountains near some state forest it might be worth checking out well see would she go to her family if there was trouble the last place how about a man why would you depend on something you could twist into knots with a smile no theres no man shed go to he thought about that one awhile then blinked remembered and grinned grace fontaine the ivy league miss april it was the hat in the wallet shot that threw me off id never forget that face really voice dry as dirt she shifted to look at him over the top of her sunglasses do you spend a lot of your time drooling over centerfolds dakota i did over miss april he admitted cheerfully and rubbed a hand over his heart my god youre pals with miss april her names grace and she posed for that years ago when we were in college she did it to needle her family thank the lord i think i still have that issue somewhere im going to have to take a much closer look now what a body he remembered fondly women built like that are a gift to mankind perhaps youd like to pull over and well have a moment of silence he looked over kept right on grinning gee mj your eyes are greener and you said you werent the jealous sort im not normally its a matter of dignity youre having some revolting prurient fantasy about my best friend its not revolting i promise prurient maybe but not revolting he took the punch on the arm without complaint but its you i love sugar shut up do you think shell sign the picture for me maybe right across the im warning you fun was fun he thought but a man could push his luck in more ways than one he turned off headed east wait i thought we were going up to pa to call you just said grace had a place in western maryland it wouldnt be smart to head in that general direction just now change of plans we head in toward baltimore first go ahead and make the call i think weve said our last goodbye to our little motel paradise he smiled patted her hand dont worry sugar well find another it couldnt possibly be the same i hope she added and dialed hurriedly its ringing keep it short dont say where you are just tell her to go to a public phone public place and call you back i she swore its her machine i was afraid of this she tapped her fist impatiently against her knees as graces recorded voice flowed through the receiver grace pick up damn it its urgent if you check in for messages dont go home dont go to the house get to a public phone and call my portable were in trouble serious trouble wrap it up mj oh god grace be careful call me she disconnected with a little catch of breath shes up in the mountains or she got a wild hair and decided to fly to london for the fourth or shes on the beach in the west indies or theyve already found her doesnt sound like a lady whos easy to track im leaning toward your first choice he cut off on the interstate headed north were going to circle around a little then stop and fill up the tank and buy a map lets see if we can jog some of your memory and find graces mountain hideaway the prospect settled her nerves thanks isolated huh its stuck in the middle of the woods and the woods are stuck in the middle of nowhere hmm i dont suppose she walks around naked up there he chuckled when she hit him just a thought they found a gas station and a map in a truck stop just off the interstate they stopped for lunch with the map spread out over the table they got down to business well theres only like a half a dozen state forests in western maryland jack commented and forked up some of his meatloaf special any one of them ring a bell whats the difference theyre all trees a real urbanite arent you she shrugged bit into her ham sandwich arent you guess so i never could understand why people want to live in the woods or in the hills i mean where do they eat at home they looked at each other shook their heads most every night too he agreed and where do they go for fun for a little afterwork relaxation on the patio thats a scary thought no people no traffic no restaurants or movie theaters no life im with you obviously our pal grace isnt my pal she said with an arched brow she likes solitude she gardens what like tomatoes yeah and flowers the time we went up shed been grubbing in the dirt planting i dont know petunias or something i like flowers but all you have to do is buy them nobody says you have to grow them there were deer in the woods that was pretty cool she remembered bailey got into the whole business it was okay for a couple days but she doesnt even have a television up there thats barbaric you bet she just listens to cds and communes with nature or whatever theres a little store had to be at least four miles away you can get bread and milk or sixpenny nails it looked like something out of mayberry except thats in the south there was a bank i think and a post office what was the name of the town i dont know dogpatch funny try to imagine the route just more or less youd have headed up yeah and then onto near what is it frederick i zoned out some think i even slept its an endless drive you had pit stops he prompted her girls dont take road trips without plenty of pit stops is that a slam no its a fact whered you stop what did you do somewhere off i was hungry i wanted fast food she shut her eyes tried to bring it back youre still eating like a teenager mj so why dont we try a salad for a change because a day without fries is a sad and wasted day it made her smile remembering now how bailey had rolled her eyes laughed then given in oh wait we grabbed a quick lunch but then she saw this sign for antiques big antique barnlike place she went orgasmic had to check it out it was off the interstate had a silly countrytype name ah she strained for it rabbit hutch chicken coop no no with water trout stream beaver creek she remembered we stopped to antique at this huge flea market or whatever its called at beaver creek shed have spent the weekend there if i hadnt dragged her out she bought this old bowl and pitcher for grace like a housewarming gift i bought her a rocking chair for her porch we had a hell of a time loading it in baileys car okay with a nod he folded the map well finish eating then head toward beaver creek take it from there later when they stood in the parking lot of the antique mart mj sipped a soft drink out of a can shed done the same on the trip with bailey and she hoped it would somehow jog her memory i know we got back on bailey was chattering away about some glassware depression glass she was going to come back and buy the place out there was some table she wanted too and she was irritated she hadnt snapped it up and had it shipped i won the tune toss the what the tune toss bailey likes classical you know beethoven whenever we drive we flip a coin to see who gets to pick the tunes i won so we went for aerosmith my version of longhair i think were made for each other its getting scary he leaned down nipped her mouth with his what was she wearing what is this sudden obsession with how my friends dress just bring it all back complete the picture the more details the clearer it should be oh i get it mollified she pursed her lips and studied the sky slacks sort of beige bailey shies away from bold colors grace is always giving her grief about it a silk blouse tailored sort of pink and pale she had on these great earrings shed made them big chunks of rose quartz i tried them on while she was driving they didnt suit me pink wouldnt not with that hair thats a myth redheads can wear pink we got off the interstate onto a western route i cant remember the number jack bailey had it in her head it was written down but she didnt need me to navigate he consulted the map heads west out of hagerstown lets see if it looks familiar i know it was another couple hours from here she said as she climbed back in i could drive for a while no you couldnt she skimmed her gaze over the car noting that the back door was hooked shut with wire this heap is hardly something to be proprietary about jack his jaw set the heap had until recently been his one true love theres more chance of you remembering if we stick with the plan fine she stretched out her legs as he turned out of the parking lot do you ever think about a paint job the car has character just the way it is and its whats under the hood that counts not a shiny surface whats under the hood she said then glanced at the stereo system and in the dash i bet that toy set you back four grand i like music what about that tinkertoy you drive my mg is a classic its a kiddie car you must have to fold up your legs just to get behind the wheel at least when i parallelpark its not like docking a steamship in port pay attention to the road will you i am she offered him the rest of her soft drink i know it looks like it but you dont actually live in this car do you when i have to otherwise ive got a place on mass avenue a couple of rooms dusty furniture he thought now mountains of books but no real soul no roots nothing he couldnt leave behind without a second thought just like his life had been up to the day before what the hell was he doing with her he thought abruptly there was nothing behind him that could remotely be called a foundation nothing to build on nothing to offer she had family friends a business shed forged herself what did they have in common other than the situation they were in similar tastes in music and a preference for city life and the fact that he was in love with her he glanced over at her she was concentrating now he noted leaning forward in the seat frowning out the window as she tried to pick out landmarks she wasnt beautiful he thought he might have been blind in love but he would never have termed her by so simple a term that odd foxy face caught the eye certainly the male eye it was sexy unique with the contrast of planes and angles and the curve of that overlush mouth her body was built for speed and movement rather than for fantasy yet hed lost himself in it in her he knew hed turned a corner when he met her but hadnt a clue where the road would lead either of them this is the road she turned beamed at him and stopped his heart im sure of it he bumped up the speed to sixtyfive as long as one of them was sure he thought chapter contents prev next the road cut straight through the mountain mj supposed it was some sort of nifty feat of engineering but it made her uneasy particularly all the signs warning of falling rock and those high jagged walls of cliffs on either side of them muggers she could understand anticipate but who she wondered could anticipate mother nature what was to stop her from having a minor tantrum and perhaps heaving down a couple of boulders at the car and since it was big enough to sleep eight it was a dandy target mj kept a wary eye out of the side window willing the rocks to stay put until they were through the pass ahead mountains rose and rolled lushly green with summer heat and humidity merged to make the air thick as syrup tires hummed along the highway occasionally she would see houses behind the roadside trees glimpses only as if they were hiding from prying eyes she wondered about them those tuckedaway houses undoubtedly with neat yards guarded by yapping dogs decorated with gardens and swing sets accented with decks and patios for grills and redwood chairs it was one way to live she supposed but you had to tend that garden mow that lawn shed never lived in a house apartments had always suited her lifestyle to some she supposed an apartment would seem like a box tucked with other boxes within a box but shed always been satisfied with her own space with the camaraderie of being part of the hive why would you need a lawn and a swing set unless you had kids she felt a quick little jitter in her stomach at the idea had she actually ever thought about having children before rocking a baby watching it grow tying shoes and wiping noses it was grace who was soft on children she thought not that she herself didnt like them she had a platoon of cousins who seemed bent on populating the world and mj had spent many an hour on a visit home cooing over a new baby playing on the floor with a toddler or pitching a ball to a fledgling little leaguer she didnt imagine it was quite the same when the child was yours what did it feel like she mused to have your own baby rest its head on your shoulder and yawn or to have a shakylegged toddler lift its arms up to you to be held and what in gods name was she doing thinking about children at a time like this weary she slipped her fingers under her shaded glasses pressed them to her eyes then slid a considering glance at jacks profile what she wondered did he think about kids incredibly she felt heat rising to her cheeks and turned her face back to the window quickly idiot she told herself youve known the guy an instant and youre starting to think of diapers and booties that she thought grimly was just what happened to a woman when she got herself tied up over some man she went soft all over particularly in the head then she let out a shout that surprised them both there thats the exit thats where we got off im sure of it next time just shoot me jack suggested as he swung the car into the right lane its bound to be less of a shock than a heart attack sorry he eased off the exit giving her time to orient herself as they came to a twolane road left she said after a moment im almost sure we went left okay i need to gas up this hog anyway he headed for the closest service station and pulled up next to the pumps what was on your mind back there mj on my mind you went away for a while the fact that hed been able to tell disconcerted her she shifted in the seat shrugged her shoulders i was just concentrating thats all no you werent he cupped a hand under her chin turned her face to his thats exactly what you werent doing he rubbed his thumb over her lips dont worry well find your friends theyre going to be all right she nodded felt a wash of shame grace and bailey should have been on her mind and instead shed been daydreaming over babies like some lovesick idiot grace will be at the house all we have to do is find it hold that thought he leaned forward touched his lips to hers and go buy me a candy bar youve got all the dough oh yeah he got out reached into his front pocket and pulled out a handful of bills splurge he suggested and buy yourself one too gee thanks daddy he grinned as she walked away long legs striding narrow hips twitching under snug denim hell of a package he mused as he slipped the nozzle into the gas tank he wasnt going to question the twist of fate that had dropped her into his life and into his heart but he wondered how long it would be before she did people didnt stay in his life for long they came and went it had been that way for so long hed stopped expecting it to be different maybe hed stopped wanting it to be still he knew that if she decided to take a walk hed never get over it so hed have to make sure she didnt take a walk feeding the greedy tank of the olds he watched her come back out cross to the softdrink machine and he wasnt the only one watching jack noted the teenager fueling the rusting pickup at the next pump had an eye on her too cant blame you buddy jack thought shes a picture all right maybe youll grow up lucky and find yourself a woman half as perfect for you and blessing his luck jack screwed the cap back on his tank then strolled over to her she had her hands full of candy and soft drinks when he yanked her against him and covered her mouth in a long smoldering braindraining kiss her breath whooshed out when he released her what was that for because i can he said simply and all but swaggered in to pay his tab mj shook her head noted that the teenager was gawking and had overfilled his tank i wouldnt light a match pal she said as she passed him and climbed into the car when jack joined her she went with impulse plunging her hands into his hair and pulling him against her to kiss him in kind thats because i can too yeah he was pretty sure he felt smoke coming out of his ears were a hell of a pair it took him a moment to clear the lust from his mind and remember how to turn the key both thrilled and amused by his reaction she held out a chocolate bar candy he grunted took it bit in watch the road he told her try to find something familiar i know we werent on this road very long she began we turned off and did a lot of snaking around on back roads like i said bailey had it all in her head bailey as the idea slammed into her she pressed her hands to her mouth what is it i kept asking myself where she would go if she was in trouble if she was running where would she go eyes alight she whirled to face him and the answer is right there she knows how to get to graces place she loved it there shed feel safe there its a possibility he agreed no no shed go to one of us for sure she shook her head fiercely desperately and she couldnt get to me that means she headed up here maybe took a bus or a train as far as she could rented a car her heart lightened at the certainty of it yes its logical and just like her theyre both there up in the woods sitting there figuring out what to do next and worrying about me and so was he worrying about her she was putting all her hope into a long shot but he didnt have the heart to say it if they are he said cautiously we still have to find them think back try to remember okay with new enthusiasm she scanned the scenery it was spring she mused it was pretty stuff was blooming dogwoods i guess and that yellow bush thats almost a neon color and something bailey called redbuds there was a garden place she remembered suddenly a whatchamacallit nursery bailey wanted to stop and buy grace a bush or something and i said we should get there first and see what she already had so we look for a nursery it had a dopey name she closed her eyes a moment struggled to bring it back corny it was right on the road and it was packed thats one of the reasons i didnt want to stop it would have taken forever buds n blooms she smacked her hands together as she remembered we made a right a mile or so beyond it there you go he took her hand lifted it to his mouth to kiss and had them both frowning at the gesture hed never kissed a womans hand before in his entire life inside mjs stomach butterflies sprang to life clearing her throat she laid her hand on her lap well ah anyway grace and bailey went back to the plant place i stayed at her house those two get a big bang out of shopping for anything i figured theyd buy out the store which they almost did they came back loaded with those plastic trays of flowers and flowers in pots and a couple of bushes grace keeps a pickup at her place i can imagine what theyd write in the posts style section about grace fontaine driving a pickup truck would she care shed laugh but she keeps this place to herself the relatives thats what she calls her family the relatives dont even know about it id say thats to our favor the less people who know about it the better his lips curved as he noted a sign theres your garden spot sugar business is pretty good even this late in the year delight zinged through her as she spotted the line of cars and trucks pulled to the side of the road the crowds of people wandering around tables covered with flowers i bet theyre having a holiday sale ten percent off any red white or blue posies god bless america about a mile you said yeah and it was a right im sure of that dont you like flowers huh distracted she glanced at him sure theyre okay i like ones that smell you know like those things those carnations they dont smell like sissies and they dont wimp out on you after a couple days either he chuckled muscle flowers is this the turn no i dont think so a little farther leaning forward she tapped her fingers on the dash this is it coming up im almost sure he downshifted bore right the road rose and curved beside it fences were being slowly smothered by honeysuckle and behind them cows grazed i think this is right she gnawed on her lip all the damn roads back here look the same fields and rocks and trees how do people find where theyre going did you stay on this road no she turned again right or left mj asked herself right or left we kept heading deeper into the boonies and climbing maybe here he slowed let her consider the crossroads was narrow cornered on one side by a stone house a dog napped in the yard under the shade of a dying maple concrete ducks paddled over the grass this could be it to the left im sorry jack its hazy look weve got a full tank of gas and plenty of daylight dont sweat it he took the left cruised along the curving road that climbed and dipped the houses were spread out now and the fields were crammed with corn high as a mans waist where fields stopped woods took over growing thick and green arching their limbs over the road so that it was a shady tunnel for the car to thread through they came to the rise of a hill and the world opened up a dramatic and sudden spread of green mountains and land that rolled beneath them yes bailey almost wrecked the car when we topped this hill if it is this hill she added i think thats part of the state forest she was dazzled by it but we turned off again one of these little roads that winds through the trees youre doing fine tell me which one you want to try at this point your guess is as good as mine she felt helpless stupid it just looks different now the trees are all thick they just had that green haze on them when we came through well give this one a shot he decided and flipping a mental coin turned right it took only ten minutes for them to admit they were lost and another ten to find their way out and onto a main road they drove through a small town mj had no recollection of then backtracked after an hour of wandering mj felt her patience fraying how can you stay so calm she asked him i swear weve fumbled along every excuse for a road within fifty miles every street lane and cow path im going crazy my line of work takes patience i ever tell you about tracking down big bill bristol she shifted in her seat certain shed never feel sensation in her bottom again no you never told me about tracking down big bill bristol are you going to make this up dont have to to give them both a breather he swung off the road there was a small pulloff beside what he supposed could be called a swimming hole trees overhung dark water and let little splashes of sun hit the surface and bounce back big bill was up on assault lost his temper over a hand of sevencard stud and tried to feed the pot to his opponent that was after he broke his nose and knocked the guy out big bill is about sixfive twoeighty and has hands the size of minneapolis he doesnt like to lose i know this for a fact as i have spent the occasional evening playing games of chance with big bill mj smiled winningly gosh jack i just cant wait to meet your friends recognizing sarcasm when it was aimed at him he merely slanted her a look in any case ralph fronted his bond but big bill found out about a floating game in jersey and didnt want to miss out the law frowns not only on floating games but on bailjumping and his bail was revoked bill was on the skip list and you went after him well i did jack rubbed his chin thought fleetingly about shaving it should have been cutanddried find the game remind bill he had to have his day in court bring him back but it seemed bill had won large quantities of money in jersey and had moved on to another game i should add that bill is big but not in the brain department and he was on a hot streak moving from game to game state to state with jack dakota bounty hunter hot on his trail on his trail anyway a lot of it his back trail if the jerk had planned to lose me he couldnt have done a better job i crisscrossed the northeast hit every game how much did you lose not enough to talk about he answered her grin i got into pittsburgh about midnight i knew there was a game but i couldnt bribe or threaten the location out of anyone id been on bills trail for four days living out of my car and playing poker with guys named bats and fast charlie i was tired dirty down to my last hundred in cash i walked into a bar of course you did im telling the story he said tugging her hair picked it at random no thought no plan and guess who was in the back room holding a pair of bullets and bumping the pot lets see could it have been big bill bristol in the flesh patience and logic had gotten me to pittsburgh but it was instinct that had me walking into that game howd you get him to go back with you there i had a choice i considered hitting him over the head with a chair but more than likely that would have just annoyed him i thought about appealing to his good nature reminding him he owed ralph but he was still on that hot streak and wouldnt have given a damn so i had a drink joined the game after a couple of hours i explained the situation to bill and appealed to him on his own level one cut of the cards i draw high he comes back with me no hassle he draws high i walk away and you drew high yeah i did he scratched his chin again of course id palmed an ace but like i said brains werent big bills strong suit you cheated sure it was the clearest route through the situation and everybody ended up happy except big bill no him too hed had a nice run had enough of the ready to pay off the guy whose skull hed cracked charges dropped no sweat she cocked her head and what would you have done if hed decided to welsh and not go back with you peacefully id have broken the chair over his head and hoped to live through it quite a life you lead jack i like it and the moral of the story is you just keep looking follow logic and when logic peters out you go with instinct so saying he reached into his pocket drew out the stone the second stone is knowledge his eyes met hers what do you know mj i dont understand you know your friends you know them better than i know big bill or anyone else for that matter he could come to envy her that he realized and would think on it more closely later theyre part of what you were who you are and i guess who you will be her chest went tight youre getting philosophical on me dakota sometimes that works too trust your instincts mj he took her hand closed it over the stone trust what you know her nerves were suddenly on the surface of her skin chilling it you expect me to use this thing like some sort of compass divining rod you feel that dont you it was a shock to him as well but his hands stayed steady his eyes remained on hers its all but breathing you know the thing about myths if you reach down deep enough inside them you pull out truth the second stone is knowledge he shifted back put his hands on the wheel which way do you want to go she was cold shudderingly cold yet the stone was like a sun burning in her hand west she heard herself say it knew it was odd for a city woman to use the direction rather than simply right or left this is crazy we left sanity behind yesterday no use trying to find that back trail just tell me which way you want to go which way feels right so she held the stone gripped in her hand and directed him through the winding roads sided with trees and outcroppings of rock along a meandering stream that trickled low from lack of rain past a little brown house so close that its door all but opened into the road on the right mj said through a throat dustdry and tight as a drum you have to watch for it we passed it had to double back her lanes narrow just a cut through the woods you can barely see it she doesnt have a mailbox she goes into town and picks it up when shes here there her hand trembled a bit as she pointed just there he turned in the lane was indeed narrow branches skimmed and scraped along the sides of the car as he drove slowly up over gravel around a curve that was sheltered by more trees and there in the center of the lane still as a stone statue stood a deer with a pelt that glowed dark gold in the flash of sun it should be a white hind jack thought foolishly a white hind is the symbol of a quest the doe watched the lumbering approach her head up her eyes wide and fixed then with a flick of the tail a quick spin of that gorgeous body she leaped into the trees on thin graceful legs and was gone with barely a rustle the house was exactly as mj remembered tucked back on the hill above a small bubbling creek it was a neat two stories that blended into the backdrop of woods it was wood and glass simple lines with a long front porch painted a bold blue two white rockers sat on it along with copper pots overflowing with trailing flowers shes been busy mj murmured scanning the gardens flowers bloomed everywhere wildly as if unplanned the flow of colors and shapes rumbled down the hill like a river wide wooden steps cut through the color meandered to the left then marched down to the lane at the house in potomac she hired a professional landscaper she knew just what she wanted but she had someone else do it here she wanted to do everything herself it looks like a fairy tale he shifted uncomfortable with his own impressions he wasnt exactly up on his fairy tales you know what i mean yeah a shiny blue pickup truck was parked at the end of the lane but there was no sign of the car grace would have driven to her country home no dusty rental car announcing baileys presence theyve just gone to the store mj told herself theyll be back any minute she wouldnt believe theyd come this far found the house and not found grace and bailey the minute jack pulled up beside the truck she was out and dashing toward the house hold it he gripped her arm skidded her to a halt lets get the lay of the land here gently he uncurled her fingers took the stone when it was tucked back in his pocket he took her hand you said she leaves the truck here yes she drives a mercedes convertible or a little beemer your pal has three rides grace rarely owns one of anything she claims she doesnt know what shes going to be in the mood for theres a back door yeah one out the kitchen and another on the side she gestured to the right fought to ignore the weight pressing against her chest it leads onto a little patio and into the woods lets look around first there was a gardening shed neatly filled with tools a lawn mower rakes and shovels where the lawn gave way steppingstones had been set with springy moss growing between more flowers a raised bed with blooms and greenery spilling over the dark wall and the cliff behind growing with ivy a hummingbird hovered at a bright red feeder its iridescent wings blurred with speed it darted off like a bullet at their approach its whirl the only sound he spotted no broken windows or other signs of forced entry as they circled around the back passed an herb garden fragrant with scents of rosemary and mint brass wind chimes hung silently near the rear door not a leaf stirred its creepy she rubbed her arm skulking around like this lets just skulk another minute they came around the far side with the little patio there a glass table a padded chaise more flowers in concrete troughs and clay pots just beyond was a small pond with young ornamental grasses thats new mj paused to study she didnt have that before she talked about it though it looks fresh id say your pals done some planting this week you think theres a plant or flower in existence shes missed probably not but mjs smile was weak as they came back around to the front i want to go in jack i have to go in lets take a look he climbed the porch steps found the front door locked she got a hideyhole for a key no despite the miserable heat she rubbed her hands over her chilled arms too quiet was all she could think it was much too quiet she used to keep an extra for the potomac house in this flowerpot outside the door but her cousin melissa found it and made herself at home while grace was in milan really ticked her off he crouched examined the locks shes got good ones simpler to break a window youre not breaking one of her windows he sighed rose i was afraid youd say that okay we do it the hard way while she frowned he went back to his car popped the trunk inside it was loaded with tools clothes books water jugs and paperwork he pushed around selected what he needed does she have an alarm system no not that i know of anyway mj studied the leather pouch what are you going to do pop the locks it may take a while im rusty but he rubbed his hands together anticipating the challenge you could go around check the other doors and windows just in case she left something unlocked if she locked one she locked them all but okay she circled around again pausing at each window tugging then peering in by the time shed made a complete circuit jack was on the second lock intrigued she watched him finesse it it was cooler here than in the city but the heat was still nasty sweat dampened his shirt gleamed on his throat can you teach me to do that she asked him ssh he wiped his hands on his jeans took a firmer hold on his pick got it he stood swiped an arm over his brow cold shower he murmured cold beer ill kiss your pals feet if shes got both grace doesnt drink beer but mj was pushing in the door ahead of him the living area was homey tidy but still livedin with its wide striped sofa the deep chairs that picked up the rich blue tones in the brick fireplace a lush green fern rose out of a brass spittoon mj moved quickly through the rooms over wideplanked chestnut floors and berber rugs into the sunny kitchen with its forest green counters and white tiles through to the cozy parlor grace had turned into a library the house seemed to echo around her as she raced upstairs looked in the bedrooms the baths graces gleaming brass bed was tidily made the handmade lace spread shed purchased in ireland accented with rich dots of colorful pillows a book on gardening lay on the nightstand the bathroom was empty the ivory shell of the sink scrubbed clean and shining in its powder blue counter towels were neatly folded on the shelves on a tall wicker stand knowing it was useless she looked in the bedroom closet it was ridiculously full and ruthlessly organized theyre not here mj jack touched her shoulder but she jerked away i can see that cant i her voice snapped out broke like a rigid twig but grace was here she was just here i can still smell her she closed her eyes drew in the air her perfume it hasnt faded yet thats her scent some fragrance tycoon who fell for her had it designed for her i can smell her in here okay he caught the scent himself classy sex with wild undertones maybe she ran into town for supplies or took a drive no she walked away from him toward the window as she spoke she wouldnt have locked the house up for that she always says how lovely it is not to worry about locking up out here she only does when she closes the place up and heads somewhere else bailey isnt here grace isnt here and shes not planning on coming back for a while weve missed her back to potomac she shook her head the tightness in her chest was unbearable as if greedy hands were squeezing her heart and lungs not likely shed avoid the city on the fourth too much traffic too many tourists thats why i was sure shed stay through until tomorrow at least she could be anywhere which means shell surface somewhere he started toward her caught the gleam on her cheek and stopped dead like a man whod run facefirst into a glass wall what are you doing are you crying it was an accusation delivered in a voice edged with abject terror mj merely wrapped her arms over her chest and hugged her elbows all the excitement the tension the frustration of the search fell away into sheer despair the house was empty i want you to stop that right now i mean it sniveling isnt going to do you any good and it certainly wasnt going to do him any good it terrified him left him feeling stupid clumsy and annoyed just leave me alone she said and her voice broke on a muffled sob just go away thats just what im going to do you keep that up and im walking i mean it im not standing around and watching you blubber get a grip on yourself havent you got any pride at the moment pride was low on her list giving up she pressed her brow to the window glass and let the tears fall im walking mj he snarled at her and turned for the door im getting a drink and a shower so when youve got yourself in order well figure out what to do next then go just go he made it as far as the threshold then swearing ripely whirled back i dont need this he muttered he hadnt a clue how to handle a womans tears particularly those from a strong woman who was obviously at the end of her endurance he cursed her again as he turned her into his arms folded her into them he continued to swear at her as he picked her up sat with her in a widebacked chair he rocked and cursed and stroked get it over with then kissed her temple please youre killing me im afraid her breath hitched as she turned her face into his shoulder his strong broad shoulder im so tired and afraid i know he kissed her hair held her closer i know i couldnt stand for anything to happen to them i just cant bear it dont he tightened his grip as if he could strangle off those hot terrifying tears but his mouth skimmed up her cheek found hers and was tender its going to be all right everythings going to be all right he brushed at her tears clumsily with his thumbs i promise eyes brimming she stared into his i was just so sure theyd be here i know he brushed the hair back from her face youve got a right to break down i dont know anyone else whod have made it this far without a blowout but dont cry anymore mj it rips me up i hate to cry she sniffled knuckled tears away im glad to hear it he took her hands kissed them both this time without that moment of surprise think about this she was here today maybe as little as an hour ago shes tidied up locked up which means she was just fine when she left she let out an unsteady breath drew in another youre right im not thinking straight thats because you need a break a decent meal a little rest yeah but she laid her head against his shoulder again can we just sit here for a little while just sit like this sure it was easy to wrap his arms around her hold her close and just sit chapter contents prev next he told her it didnt make sense to drive back to the city fight the traffic generated by fireworks fans not when they had a perfectly good place to stay the night the fact was he thought if shed broken down once she could easily do so again and a decent meal along with a decent nights sleep might shore up some holes in her composure in any case theyd been in the car for more than five hours that day already after little more than an hours sleep driving straight back was bound to make them both feel as though the effort to find graces house had been wasted and he wanted time to work on a plan that was beginning to form in his mind take a shower he told her borrow a shirt or something from your pal youll feel better it couldnt hurt she managed a smile i thought you wanted a shower dont you want to conserve water well it was tempting he could envision himself getting under a cool spray with her lathering up lathering her up and letting nature take its very interesting course and it also occurred to him that she hadnt had five full minutes of privacy in hours it was about all he had the power to give her at the moment im going to hunt up a drink see if your friend has some cans around here i can open he kissed the tip of her nose affectionately go ahead and get started without me okay you can hunt me up a drink while youre at it but youre not going to find any beer in the fridge and god knows what shes got in cans around here mj headed for the bath stopped turned jack thanks for letting me get it out he tucked his hands in his pockets her eyes those exotically tilted cats eyes were still swollen from weeping and her cheeks were pale with fatigue i guess you needed to i did and you didnt make me feel like too much of a jerk so thanks she said again and stepped into the bath she stripped gratefully all put peeling cotton and denim away from her clammy overheated skin the simple style grace had chosen for the rest of the house didnt follow through to the master bath this was pure selfindulgence the tiles were soft blue and misty green so that it was like stepping into a cool seaside glade the tub was an oversize lake of white fueled with water jets and framed by a wide up where more ferns grew lushly in biscuittoned pots the acre of counter boasted a cutout for a vanity stool and held a brass makeup mirror overhead was a garden of tulipshaped lights of frosted glass doors holding linens and sheetsize towels were mirrored tossing the room back and giving the illusion of enormous luxurious space though mj briefly considered the tub and the bubbling jets she stepped instead toward the wavy glass block of the shower enclosure her showerheads were set in three sides at varying levels with a need for pampering mj turned them all on full then after one enormous sigh helped herself to some of graces pricey soap and shampoo and the fragrance made her weepy again it was so grace but she refused to cry already regretted her earlier tears they helped nothing practicalities did she reminded herself a shower a meal a respite from activity for a brief time would all serve to clear the brain undoubtedly she needed a few hours sleep to recharge it wasnt just the crying jag that made her feel woozy and weak she imagined something had to be done some move had to be made and quickly to make it she needed to be sharp and to be ready it hardly mattered that it hadnt been much more than a day that had passed every hour she lived through without being able to contact either bailey or grace was one short tense lifetime things had to be settled her world had to be set right again and then she would have to face whatever was happening and whatever would happen between her and jack she was in love with him there was no doubt of that the speed with which shed fallen only increased the intensity of the emotion shed never felt for any man what she felt for him this emotion that cut clean through the bone and melded with the feeling of passion which she could have dismissed was a sense of absolute trust an odd and deep affection a prideful respect and the certainty that she could pass the years of her life with him if not in harmony in contentment she understood him she realized as she held her face under the highest spray she doubted he knew that but it was absolutely true she understood his loneliness his scarredover pain and his pride in his own skills he had kindness and cynicism patience and impulse he had a questing intellect a touch of the poet and more than a touch of the nonconformist he lived his own way making his own rules and breaking them when he chose she would have wanted no less in a life partner and that was what worried her finding herself thinking of marriage permanence and making a family with a man who so obviously ran from all three and had run from them most of his life but perhaps since those concepts had bloomed so recently in her she could nip them in the bud she had a business of her own a life of her own wanting jack to be a part of that didnt have to change the basic order of things she hoped she switched off the showerheads toweled off and because it was there slathered on some of graces silky body cream and felt nearly human again rubbing a towel over her hair she padded naked into the bedroom to raid the closet at least in the country graces choice of attire ran toward the simple mj slipped on a shortsleeved shirt of minute whiteandblue checks and found a pair of cotton shorts in the bureau they bagged a little grace was still built like the centerfold shed once been and mj had no hips to speak of they also ran short as mj had several inches more leg than her friend but they were cool and when she slid them on she stopped feeling like a woman whod been living in her clothes for two days she started to toss the towel aside then rolled her eyes when she thought of how grace would react to that fastidiously she went back to the bath and draped it over the shower then in bare feet her hair still damp and curling around her face she went in search of jack i not only started without you she said when she found him in the kitchen i finished without you youre slow dakota still frowning at the small jar in his hand he turned all i found was and trailed off staggered hed told himself she wasnt beautiful and that was true but she was striking the impact of her slammed into him anew those sharp sexy looks the long long legs set off by tiny blue shorts she had her thumbs tucked in the front pockets of them a halfcocked grin on her face and her hair was dark and damp and curling foolishly over her ears his mouth simply watered you clean up good sugar its hard not to in that fancy shower of graces wait till you get a load of it she angled her head as a nice flush of heat began to work up from her toes i dont know why youre looking at me like that jack youve seen me naked yeah maybe ive got a weakness for long women in little shorts he lifted a brow did you borrow any of her underwear no some things even close friends dont share men and underwear being the top two he set the jar down in that case she shot a hand up slapped in on his chest i dont think so pal you dont exactly smell like roses at the moment and besides im hungry the woman gets cleaned up she gets picky but he ran a hand over his chin again reminded himself to get his shaving kit out of the trunk this time theres not a hell of a lot to choose from around here shes got fancy french bubbly in the fridge more fancy french wine in a rack in the closet over there some crackers in tins some pasta in glass jars i found some tomato paste which i guess is embryonic spaghetti sauce does that mean one of us has to cook im afraid it does they considered each other for ten full seconds okay he decided we flip for it fair enough heads you cook she said as he dug out a quarter tails i cook either way i have a feeling well be looking for her antacid she hissed when the quarter turned up tails isnt there anything else something we can just eat out of a can or jar you cook he said but held out a jar and theres fish eggs she blew out a breath as she studied the jar of beluga you dont like caviar give me a trout fry it up and thats dandy what the hell do i want to eat eggs that some fish has laid but he tossed her the jar help your self ill go clean up while you do something with that tomato paste you probably wont like it she said darkly but dug out a pan as he wandered off thirty minutes later he wandered in again his hair was slicked back his face cleanshaven the smells coming from the simmering pan werent halfbad he decided the kitchen door was open and there was mj sitting out on the patio cramming a caviarloaded cracker in her mouth not too bad she said over it when she saw him you just pretend its something else then wash it down with this she sipped champagne shrugged grace goes for this stuff always did it was the way she was raised environment can twist a person he agreed then opened his mouth and let mj ram a cracker in he grimaced snagged her glass and downed it a hot dog and a nice dark beer she sighed perfectly in tune with him yeah well beggars cant be choosers pal its nice out here cooled off some but you know the trouble you just cant hear anything no traffic no voices no movement it kind of creeps me out people that live in places like this dont really like being around other people he was hungry enough to load up a cracker for himself you and me mj were social animals were at our best in a crowded room yeah thats why i work the pub most nights i like the busy hours she brooded looking off to where the sun was sinking fast behind the trees tonight would be slow sunday holiday everybodyll be wondering where i am ive got a good head waitress though shell handle it she shifted restlessly reached for her glass i guess the cops have gone by talked to her and my bartenders some of the regulars theyll be worried it wont take much longer hed been working on refining his plan looking for the pitfalls your publl run a few days without you you take vacations right a couple weeks here and there its supposed to be paris next she was surprised he remembered thats the plan have you ever been there no have you nope we went to ireland when i was a kid and my father got all mistyeyed and sentimental he grew up on the west side of manhattan but youd have thought hed been born and bred in dublin and had been wrenched away by gypsies other than that ive never been out of the states ive been up to canada down to mexico but ive never flown over the ocean he smiled and took the glass from her again i think your sauce is burning sugar she swore shot up and scrambled inside while she muttered he eyed the level of the bottle normally he wouldnt have recommended alcohol as a tranquilizer but these were desperate times hed seen that misery come into her eyes when he mentioned paris and reminded her of her friends for a few hours for this one night he was going to make her forget i caught it in time she told him dragging her hair back as she stepped out again and i put on the water for the pasta i dont know how long that sauce is supposed to cook probably for three days but were eating it rare he grinned handed her the glass hed just topped off fine with me there was another bottle of this chilling right yeah i get it for her by the case my distributor just loves it she knocked some back chuckled into the exquisite bubbles i can imagine what my customers would say if i put brother dom on the menu im getting used to it he rose skimmed a hand over her hair im going to put some music on too damn quiet around here good idea with a considering look she glanced over her shoulder you know i think grace said they have like bears and things up here he looked dubiously into the woods guess ill get my gun too he got more than that to her surprise he brought candles into the kitchen turned the stereo on low and found a station that played blues he stuck a pink flower that more or less resembled a carnation to him behind her ear yeah i guess redheads can wear pink he decided after a smiling study you look cute blowing her hair out of her eyes she drained the pasta whats this a romantic streak ive got one i keep in reserve and while her hands were full he leaned in and nuzzled the back of her neck does that bother you no she angled her head enjoying the leaping thrill up her spine but to complete the mood youre going to have to eat this and pretend its good she frowned a little when he retrieved another bottle of champagne from the refrigerator do you know what that costs a bottle ace even wholesale beggars cant be choosers he reminded her and popped the cork as meals went theyd both had better and worse the pasta was only slightly overdone the sauce was bland but inoffensive and being ravenous they dipped into second helpings without complaint he made certain he steered the conversation away from anything that worried her probably should have used some of those herbs shes got growing out there mj considered but i dont know whats what its fine he took her hand pressed a kiss to the palm and made her blink how are you feeling better she picked up her glass full nerves funny he thought she hadnt shown nerves when he handcuffed her or when he drove like a madman through the streets of washington with potential killers on their tail but nuzzle her hand and she looked edgy as a virgin bride on her wedding night he wondered just how much more nervous he could make her i like looking at you he murmured she sipped hastily set the glass down picked it up again youve been looking at me for two days not in candlelight he filled her glass again it puts fire in your hair in your eyes star fire he smiled slowly held the glass out to her whats that line fair as a star when only one is shining in the sky yeah she gulped wine felt it fizz in her throat i think thats it youre the only one mj he pushed the plates aside so that he could nibble on her fingers your hands trembling it is not her heart was but she tugged her hand free just in case he was right she drank again then narrowed her eyes are you trying to get me drunk dakota his smile was slow confident relaxed and you were relaxed mj before i started to seduce you a hot ball of need lodged in the pit of her stomach is that what you call it youre ripe for seducing he turned her hand over grazed his teeth over the inside of her wrist your heads swimming with wine your pulse is unsteady if you were to stand right now your legs would be weak she didnt have to stand for them to be weak even sitting her knees were shaking i dont need to be seduced you know that what i know is that im going to enjoy it i want you trembling and weak and mine she was afraid she already was and pulled back unnerved this is silly if you want to go to bed well get there eventually he rose drew her to her feet then slid his hands in one long possessive stroke down the sides of her body then back up youre worried about what i can do to you you dont worry me yes i do he eased her against him kept his mouth hovering over hers a moment then lowered it to nip lightly at her jaw just now i worry you a lot her breath was thick unsteady cook a man one meal and he gets delusions of grandeur and when he chuckled his breath warm on her cheek she shivered kiss me jack her mouth turned seeking his just kiss me youre not afraid of the fire he evaded her lips heard her moan as his mouth skimmed her throat but the warmth unnerves you you can have both his lips brushed hers retreated tonight well have both there wont be any choice the wine was swimming in her head just as hed said in sparkling circles she was trembling just as hed said in quick helpless quivers and she was weak just as hed said even as she strained for the fire the flash danced out of her reach there was only the warmth enervating sweet drugging her breath caught then released in a rush when he lifted her why are you doing this because you need it he murmured and so do i he heated her skin with nibbling kisses as he carried her from the room filled his head with the scent that was foreign to both of them and only added to the mystery the house was dark empty with the silvery shower of moonlight guiding his path up the steps he laid her on the bed covered her with his body and finally finally lowered his mouth to hers her limbs went weak as the kiss drained her sent her floating she struggled once tried to find level ground but he deepened the kiss so slowly so cleverly so tenderly she simply slid into the velvet trap hed already laid for her she murmured his name heard the echo of it whisper through her head and surrendered he felt the change that soft and complete yielding the gift of it was powerfully arousing sent dark ripples of delight dancing through his blood even as his desire quickened his mouth slipped down to gently explore the pulse that beat so hard and thick in the hollow of her throat let go he said quietly just let go of everything and let me take you his hands were gentle on her skimming and tracing those curves and angles this he thought makes her sigh and that makes her moan as if their time were endless he tutored himself in the pleasures of her the strong curve of her shoulder the long muscles of her thigh the surprisingly fragile line of her throat he undressed her slowly pressing his lips to the hands that reached for him until they went limp again he left her nothing to hold on to but trust gave her nothing to experience but pleasure tenderness destroyed her until her world was whittled down to the slowly rising storm inside her own body the fire was there that flash of lightning and outrageous heat the whip of wind and roll of power but he held it off with clever hands and patient mouth easing her along the path hed chosen for them he turned her over and those hands stroked the muscles in her shoulders and turned them to liquid that mouth traced kisses down her spine and made her quake even as her mind went misty she could hear the rustle of the sheets as he moved over her hear the whisper of his promises feel the warm glow of promises kept and from outside in the deepening night came the long haunting call of an owl no part of her body was ignored no aspect of seduction forgotten she lay helpless beneath him open to any demand and when demand finally came her moan was long throaty the response of her body instant and full he buried his face between her breasts fighting back the urge to rush now that hed brought her so luxuriously to the peak i want more of you he murmured i want all of you i want everything he closed his mouth over her breast until she moved under him again until her breath was nothing but feverish little pants when her voice broke on his name he slipped inside her filled her slowly teetering on a new brink she arched toward him her eyes locked on his as they linked hands there was only his face in the moonlight dark eyes firm mouth the rich flow of hair threaded with gold swept by a rushing tide of love she smiled up at him take more of me she felt his fingers tremble in hers take all of me saw the flash that was both triumph and need in his eyes take everything the fire reached out for both of them while she slept he held her close against him and worked out the final points of his plan it had as much chance of working hed decided as it did of blowing up in his face even odds werent such a bad deal hed have risked much worse for her much more to prevent those tears from slipping down her cheeks again hed waited thirty years to fall which he concluded was why hed fallen so hard and so fast unless he wanted to take the more mystical route and believe it was all simply fated the timing the stone mj either way hed come to the same place she was the first and only person hed ever loved and there was nothing he wouldnt do to protect her even if it meant breaking her trust if this was the last time hed lie beside her he could hardly complain shed given him more in two days than hed had in his entire life she loved him and that answered all the questions as jack lay in the deep country dark contemplating his life wondering about his future another sat in a room washed with light his day had been full and now he was weary but his mind wouldnt shut off and he couldnt afford the fatigue he had watched fireworks streak across the sky he had smiled conversed sipped fine wine but all the while the rage had eaten at him like a cancer now he was blessedly alone in the room that soothed his soul he feasted his eyes on the renoir such lovely subtle colors he mused such exquisite brush strokes and only he would ever look upon its magnificence there the puzzle box of a chinese emperor glossy with lacquer a red dragon streaking over it and into a black sky priceless full of secrets and only he had the key here a ruby ring that had once graced the royal finger of louis xiv he slipped it on his pinkie turned the stone toward the light and watched it shoot fire from the kings hand to his he thought with a few detours along the way but it was where it belonged now usually such things brought him a deep exquisite pleasure but not tonight some had been punished he thought some were beyond punishment yet it wasnt enough his treasure room was filled with the stunning the unique the ancient yet it wasnt enough the three stars were the only thing that would satisfy him he would trade every treasure he owned for them for with them he would need nothing else the fools believed they understood them believed they could control them and elude him they were meant for him of course their power was always meant for him and the loss of them was like ground glass in his throat he rose ripping the ruby from his finger and flinging it across the room like a child tossing a broken toy he would have them back he was sure of it but a sacrifice must be made to the god he thought with a slow smile of course a sacrifice to the god in blood he left the room leaving the lights burning and most of his sanity behind chapter contents prev next jack considered leaving a note when she woke shed be alone at first shed probably assume hed gone out to find that little store shed spoken of to buy some food shed be impatient a little annoyed after an hour or so she might worry that hed gotten himself lost on the back roads but it wouldnt take her long to realize he was gone as he walked quietly down the stairs just as dawn broke he imagined her first reaction would be anger shed storm through the house cursing him threatening him shed probably kick something he was almost sorry to miss it she might even hate him for a while he thought but shed be safe here that was what mattered most he stepped outside into the quiet mist of morning that shrouded the trees and hazed the sky a few birds were up with him stretching their vocal cords graces flowers perfumed the air like a fantasy and there was dew on the grass he saw a deer likely the same doe that had been on the lane the day before standing at the edge of the woods they studied each other a moment each both interested in and wary of the alien species then dismissing him she moved with hardly a sound along the verge of the trees until she was slowly swallowed by them he glanced back at the house where hed left mj sleeping if everything went as he hoped hed be back for her by nightfall it would take some doing he knew but he had to believe hed convince her eventually that hed acted for the best and if her feelings were hurt well hurt feelings werent terminal again he considered leaving a note something short and to the point but he decided against it shed figure it out for herself quickly enough she was a sharp woman his woman he thought as he slipped behind the wheel of the car whatever happened to him in the course of this day she would be safe a soldier prepared for battle a knight armed for the charge he steeled himself to leave his lady and ride off into the mist such was his mood when he turned the key and the engine responded with a dull click his mood deflated like a sail emptied of wind terrific great just what he needed he swung out of the car resisted slamming the door and rounded the hood muttering oaths he popped it stuck his head under lose something ace slowly he withdrew his head from under the hood she was standing on the porch legs spread hands fisted on her hips venom in her eyes it had taken only a glance to see that his distributor cap was missing he didnt even need to look at her to conclude that shed nailed him but he was cool hed faced down worse than one angry woman in his checkered career looks that way youre up early mj so are you jack i was hungry he flashed a smile and kept his distance i thought id hunt up some breakfast she cocked a brow got your club in the car my club thats what neanderthals do dont they get their club and go off into the woods to bash a bear for meat as she came down the steps toward him he kept the smile plastered to his face leaned back on the fender i had something a little more civilized in mind something like bacon and eggs oh and where are you going to find bacon and eggs around here at dawn she had him there ah i thought i could you know find a farmer and the breath whooshed out of his lungs as her fist plunged into his belly dont you lie to me do i look stupid he coughed got his breath back and managed to straighten no listen did you think i couldnt tell what was going on last night the way you made love to me did you think youd soften me up so i wouldnt know that was a big goodbye scene you bastard she swung again but this time he ducked so she missed his jaw by inches now his own temper began to climb hed never treated a woman with such care as hed treated her with in the night and now she was tossing it back in his face what did you do sneak down here in the middle of the night and sabotage my ride he saw the answer to that in the thin satisfied smile that spread on her face oh thats nice real nice trusting how dare you talk about trust you were going to leave me here yeah thats right now wheres the distributor cap he took her by the arms firmly before she could take another shot at him where is it where do you think youre going what sort of idiotic plan have you mapped out in that tiny feeble brain of yours im going to take care of business he said grimly ill come back for you when im done come back for me what am i a pet she jerked but didnt manage to free herself until shed hammered her heel onto his instep youre going back to the city arent you youre going looking for trouble his fury was such that he wondered only briefly how many bones in his foot she might have broken i know what im doing its what i do and what youre going to do is give me the cap then youre going to wait the hell i am we started this together and we finish it together no he swung her around until her back was pressed into the car im not taking any chances with you since when are you in charge i take my own chances get your hands off me no he leaned in cuffing her hands with his for once in your life youre going to do what youre told youre going to stay here i can move faster without you and ill be damned if im going to be distracted worrying about you nobodys asking you to worry about me just what are you planning to do ive wasted enough time letting them chase me its time to flush them out on my turf my terms youre going after those two maniacs in the van her heart lodged in her throat and was ruthlessly swallowed fine good idea im going with you youre staying here they havent found this place and it doesnt look like theyre going to youll be safe he lifted her to her toes shook her mj i cant risk you youre everything that matters to me i love you and im supposed to sit here like some helpless female and risk you exactly you arrogant jerk what am i supposed to do if you get yourself killed in case youve forgotten this is my problem my deal youre the one whos along for the ride and youre not going anywhere without me youll be in my way thats bull ive held my own through this thing im going jack and unless you want to ride your thumb back to dc thats the deal he jerked away snarling then whirled to pace he considered cuffing her inside the house it would be an ugly struggle he could almost have looked forward to that aspect of it and hed win but if things went wrong he couldnt know how long it would be before someone found her no he couldnt leave her alone and handcuffed in some isolated house in the boondocks he could lie agree to her terms then ditch her she wouldnt be easy to shake but it was an option or he could try a different tack altogether he turned smiled winningly okay sugar ill come clean ive had enough have you it was fun it was educational but its getting tedious even the fifty thousand you promised me just isnt worth risking my neck for so i figured id cruise up north for a few weeks wait for things to blow over he gave a careless shrug as she stared at him things were getting a little heavy between you and me thats not my style so i figured id take off avoid the obligatory scene if i were you id call the cops turn over the stone and chalk it all up to one of your more interesting holiday weekends youre dumping me she said in a small voice that made him feel like sludge lets say im just moving on a guys got to look out for number one all the things you said to me hey sugar were both free agents we both know the score tell you what ill drop you off at the nearest town give you a few bucks for transpo in answer she staggered toward the porch every step a slice through his heart when she collapsed buried her face in her hands he wished himself in hell shell be safe he reminded himself all that mattered was that shed be laughing her guts out he gaped as she threw back her head and roared with laughter her arms were clutched around her stomach not in defense against heartbreak but to keep herself from shaking apart with mirth oh you idiot she managed did you really think i was going to fall for that she could hardly get the words out between great gusts of laughter the darker his expression the wilder her glee now i guess im supposed to tearfully hand over the distributor cap and let you leave me off somewhere to nurse my shattered heart she wiped her streaming eyes youre so in love with me dakota you cant think straight he was thinking straight enough he determined he wondered how shed like it if he closed his hands over that throat of hers and gave it a nice loving squeeze i could get over it he muttered no you couldnt its hit you right between the eyes and i know the feeling were stuck with each other jack theres no getting past it for either of us she breathed deep rubbed a hand over her aching ribs i ought to kick your butt for trying this but it was too stupid and too sweet he jammed his hands in his pockets it was the sweet that made him feel most foolish outmaneuvering her hadnt worked he considered temper and threats hadnt made a dent and lies had only amused her so he would try the truth he decided simple unvarnished and he would plead with it okay you got me he walked over sat beside her took her hand ive never told anyone i loved them before he began i never loved anyone not a woman not family not a friend jack swamped with emotion she brushed the hair from his brow you just never had a chance to doesnt matter he said it fiercely his fingers tightening on hers i meant what i said last night theres only you mj he pressed the back of her hand to his lips held it there a moment you wouldnt understand that not really youve had other people in your life important people yes touched she leaned over kissed his cheek there are people i love maybe theres not only you jack but there is you and what i feel for you is different than anything ive felt before for anyone he stared down at their hands a moment they fit so well didnt they he noticed just slid together as if theyd been waiting for the match ive done things my own way for a long time he continued ive avoided complications that i wasnt interested in its been easy to evade attachments until you he looked into her eyes as he touched a hand to her cheek you cried yesterday over those other people you love it cut me off at the knees and when i was holding you and you were crying i knew id do anything for you let me do this you planned to leave me here because i cried because when you did i finally realized just what your friends mean to you and how much youd been holding it in i need to help you and them she looked away from him for a moment it wouldnt do either of them any good if she wept again and his words and the quiet and deep emotion that flowed behind them had touched her in a new part of her heart i already love you jack she let out a long sigh now im close to adoring you then youll stay no she cupped his face as irritation raced over it but im not mad at you anymore great he pushed off the steps to pace again havent you heard anything ive said i cant risk you i couldnt handle it if anything happened to you but im supposed to handle it if something happens to you it doesnt work that way jack she rose and faced him not for me what you feel for me i feel for you were in this together equal ground she held up a hand before he could speak and youre not going to say something lame about you being a man and me being a woman actually it had been very close to coming out of his mouth a lot of good it would do me then its settled she angled her head and let me add something here just in case youve got a bright idea about ditching me along the way if you try it ill go to the nearest phone and call the cops ill tell them you kidnapped me molested me ill give them your description a description of what you call a car and your tag number youll be trying to explain yourself to sheriff bubba and his team before you get twenty miles his eyes kindled you would wouldnt you damn straight and ill make it good so good theyll probably mess up your pretty face before they toss you in a cell now do we know where we stand yeah he pushed impotently against the corner shed boxed him into we know where we stand you cover your angles sugar you can count on that she walked toward him laid her hands on his tensed shoulders and you can count on me jack im sticking with you expecting no response she touched her lips to his and got none i wont walk out on you she murmured and saw the flicker of understanding in his eyes and i wont let you down she brushed her lips over his again i wont go away and leave you she saw too much he realized more perhaps than hed seen himself this isnt about me yes it is no ones stuck with you but i will no one loved you enough but i do she skimmed her hands up his shoulders until they framed his face that makes all this about us im going to be there for you even when you try to play hero and shake me loose he was losing and knew it you could start being there tomorrow im already there now are you going to kiss me or not maybe her lips curved as they met his then they softened and opened and gave he felt himself slide into her a homecoming that was both sweet and exciting the kiss heated even before she slipped her hands under his shirt ran them up his back then down again with nails scraping lightly i want you she murmured moving sinuously against him now before we go she turned her head nipped her teeth into his throat for luck his head swam as she reached between their bodies and found him i can always use a little extra luck she laughed tugged him away from the car they fell on the ground together and rolled over grass still damp with dew it was fast and a little desperate as the sun grew stronger burning through the morning mist they tugged at clothes pawed each other let me he panted and dragged at denim i cant here her hands fumbled with his dragged material aside hurry god she rolled again reared up and raced her mouth over his bare chest she wanted to feast on him needed to feast of those flavors those textures sate herself with them she would have sworn she felt the ground tremble as he turned her hooked his teeth into her shoulder one hand taking her breast and the other what are you how can you her head fell back as he ripped her viciously over the edge breath sobbing she reached up locked her arms around his neck and let the animal free she was with him beat for beat her body strong and agile her need was as greedy and as primal as his perhaps his hands bruised her in his rush but hers were no less bold no less rough she turned her head took his mouth with a wild avidity that tasted of the dark and the secret it was she who twisted who dragged him down to her now she demanded and her eyes gleamed like those of a cat on the hunt right now and wrapping herself around him took him in he drove hard burying himself in her she met each rough wild stroke those tilted cats eyes wide and focused on his the heat of her fueled him and through that edgy violence of need he felt his heart simply shatter with an emotion just as brutal i love you his mouth clamped on hers drank from it god i love you i know and when he pressed his face into her hair shuddering as he poured himself into her she needed to know nothing else jack she stroked his hair the sun was in her eyes his weight was on her and the grass was damp against her back she thought it one of the finest moments of her life jack she said again and sighed he nearly had his wind back maybe theres something to country living after all with a little groan he propped up on his elbows and felt his stomach sink what are you crying for are you trying to kill me im not the suns in my eyes then feeling foolish she flicked the single tear away its not that kind of crying anyway dont worry im not going to blubber did i hurt you look im sorry i jack she heaved another sigh its not that kind of crying okay and im done now anyway wary he studied those gleaming eyes are you sure yes then she smiled you coward guilty and he wasnt ashamed to admit it he kissed her nose now that weve got all this extra luck wed better get going youre not going to try to pull a fast one are you he thought of the way shed taken his face in her hands and told him she was sticking there had never been anyone in his life who ever made him that one simple promise no i guess were a team good guess mj waited until they were back on the highway heading toward civilization before she asked okay jack whats the plan nothing fancy simplicity has fewer pitfalls the way i see it weve got to get to whoevers pulling the strings our only link with him or her is the guys in the van and maybe the salvinis so far im with you i need to have a little chat with them to do that i have to lure them out maintain the advantage and convince them its in their best interest to pass on some information okay there are two guys with guns one of whom is the approximate size of the washington monument and youre going to convince them to chat with you she beamed at him i admire your optimism its all a matter of leverage he said and explained how he planned to accomplish it thunder was rumbling in a darkened sky when he pulled up in the lot at salvini it was a dignified building separated from a strip mall by a large parking lot and it was locked tight for the monday holiday in the smaller welltended salvini lot sat a lone mercedes sedan know who owns that one of the creeps baileys stepbrothers thomas i think bailey said they were closing down for an extended weekend if hes inside i dont know why lets poke around jack got out wandered to the sedan it was locked tight its security light blinking he checked the front doors of the building first scanned the darkened showroom saw no signs of life offices upstairs he asked mj yeah baileys thomass timothys her heart began to race maybe shes in there jack she rarely drives to work we live so close uhhuh and though it wasnt part of his plan the worry in her voice had him going with impulse and pressing the buzzer beside the door lets check the rear he said a moment later they could be holding her inside she could be hurt i should have thought of it before toward the west lightning forked down like jagged blades she could be in there hurt and he turned listen if were going to get through this youve got to hold it together we dont have time for a lot of handwringing and speculation her head jerked back then she squared her shoulders all right sorry after a short study of her face he nodded then continued to the back where he took a long look at the steel security door someones been at the locks what do you mean at she leaned over his shoulder as he crouched down do you mean someone picked the locks fairly recently no rust no dust in the scrapes wonder if he got in he rose examined the sides the jambs he didnt try to jimmy it or hammer against it id say he knew what he was doing under different circumstances id say it was just your average breakin but thats stretching it can you get in that wasnt part of the immediate plan either but he considered probably do you know what kind of alarm system theyve got theres a box inside the door its coded i dont know the code you punch some numbers she caught herself before she could indeed wring her hands jack she struggled to keep her voice calm she could be in there she could be hurt if we dont check and something goes wrong okay but if i cant deal with the alarm and fast were going to get busted still he got his tools out of the trunk and went to work watch my back will you he told her make sure none of those holiday shoppers next door take an interest over here she turned scanned the lot and the strip mall beyond people came and went obviously too involved in the bargains theyd bagged or those they were hunting to take notice of a man crouched at a security door of a locked building thunder walked closer and rain long awaited began to flood out of the sky she didnt mind getting wet considered the storm only a better cover but she shuddered with relief when he gave her the allclear once i open this ive probably got a minute to ninety seconds before the alarm if i cant disengage it well have to go and fast but no arguments here mj if by any chance baileys in there the copsll be along in minutes and theyll find her well take our show on the road elsewhere agreed what choice was there agreed fine he swiped dripping hair out of his eyes you stay right here if i say go you head for the car taking her silence for assent he stepped inside he saw the alarm box immediately lifted a brow interesting he murmured then signaled mj inside its off i dont understand that its always set just our lucky day he winked took her hand then flipped on his flashlight with the other well try upstairs first see if we get lucky again up these stairs she told him baileys office is right down the hall nice digs he commented scanning the expensive carpeting the tasteful colors while keeping his ears tuned for any sound there was nothing but drumming rain he blocked mj with an outstretched arm and swept the light into the office quiet organized elegant and empty he heard mj let out a rusty breath no sign of struggle he pointed out well check the rest of the floor then downstairs before we go into phase one of plan a he moved down the hall and a full yard before the next door stopped go back in her office wait for me why what is it then she caught the heaviness in the air recognized it for what it was bailey oh my god jack rapped her back against the wall pinned her until her struggles ceased you do what i tell you he said between his teeth you stay here she closed her eyes admitted there were some things she wasnt strong enough to face nodded satisfied he eased back he moved down the hall quietly eased the door open it was as bad as hed ever seen and death was rarely pretty but this he thought trailing the light over the wreckage caused by a lifeanddeath struggle had been madness life had lost he turned away from it went back to mj she was pale as wax leaning against the wall its not bailey he said immediately its a man not bailey no he put a hand to her cheek found it icy but her eyes were losing their glazed look im going to check the other rooms i dont want you to go in there mj she let out the breath that had been hot and trapped in her lungs not bailey was it like ralph no his voice was flat and hard it was a hell of a lot worse stay here he went through each room checked corners and closets careful not to touch anything or to wipe a surface when he had no choice but to touch saying nothing he led mj downstairs and did a quick thorough search of the lower level someones been in here he murmured hunkering down to shine the light into a tiny alcove under the stairs the dusts disturbed considering he stroked his chin id say if somebody was smart and needed a bolt hole this would be a good choice her clothes were clinging wet against her skin but that wasnt why she was shivering baileys smart he nodded rose keep that in mind lets do what we came for okay she cast one last look over her shoulder imagined bailey hiding in the dark from what she wondered from whom and where was she now outside jack secured the door wiped the knob i figure if you need to you can get over to that mall on those legs of yours in about thirty seconds at a sprint im not running away you will if i tell you he pocketed the flashlight youre going to do exactly what i tell you no questions no arguments no hesitation his eyes flared into hers made her shiver again whoever did what i found upstairs is an animal you remember that i will she clamped down ruthlessly on the next tremor and you remember were in this together the idea is for me to take these guys down one at a time if you can get to the van while im distracting them and disable it fine but dont take any chances ive already told you i wouldnt once i have them secured he continued ignoring the impatience in her voice we can use their van i can have a nice chat with them i think i can get a name out of them he examined his fist then smiled craftily over it into her eyes some basic information oooh she fluttered her wet lashes so macho shut up depending on the name and information we get and the situation we either go to the cops which would be my second choice or we follow the next lead agreed he opened the door of his car waited until she slid over the seat then picked up her phone make the call stretch it out for about a minute just in case she dialed then began to ramble to graces answering machine in potomac she kept her eyes on jacks and when he nodded she pushed disconnect phase two she said struggling for calm now we wait within fifteen minutes the van turned into the lot at salvini the rain had slowed now but continued to fall in a steady stream in his position beside an aging station wagon jack hunched his shoulders against the wet and watched the routine the two men got out separated and did a slow circle of the building the big one was his target using parked cars as cover jack made his way over watching as the man bent picked up mjs phone from the ground it was a decent plant jack mused gave him something to consider in that peasize brain of his as the big man pondered over the phone jack sprang and hit him at a dead run bashing into his kidneys like a cannonball he took his quarry to his knees and had the cuffs snapped over one steelbeam wrist before he was flicked off like a fly he felt the searing burn as his flesh scraped over wet grainy asphalt and rolled before a sizesixteen shoe could bash into his face he made the grab snagged the sledgehammer of a foot and heaved from her post mj watched the struggle wincing as jack hit the ground praying as he rolled hissing as fists crunched against bone she started quietly toward the van glancing back to see the progress of the bout he was outmatched she thought desperately was going to get his neck broken at the very least braced to spring to his aid she saw the second man rounding the far corner of the building hed be on them in moments she thought and jacks plan to take them both quickly and separately was in tatters she sucked in the breath to call out a warning then narrowed her eyes maybe there was still a way to make it work she dashed out from behind cover took a short run toward salvini away from jack she skidded to a halt when she saw the second man spot her made her eyes widen with shock and fear his hand went inside his jacket but she held fast waiting until he began closing in then she ran into the curtaining rain drawing him away from jack both jack and his sparring partner heard the shout both looked over instinctively and saw the woman with the bright cap of red hair racing away and the man pursuing her never listens jack thought with a bright spear of terror then he looked back saw the big man grinning at him jack grinned back and his swollen left eye gleamed bright with malice gotta take you down and fast he said conversationally as he rammed a fist into the mans mouth thats my woman your pals chasing the giant swiped blood from his face youre meat yeah there wasnt any time to dally praying mjs legs and his neck would hold out he lowered his head and charged like a mad bull the force of the attack shot the man back rapping his head smartly on the steel door bloodied battered and exhausted jack drove his knee up hard and high and heard the satisfactory sound of air gushing out of a deflated blimp blinking stinging sweat and warm rain out of his eyes jack wrenched the mans arms back snapped on the second cuff ill be back for you he promised as he retrieved the phone and tore off in search of mj chapter contents prev jack had told her if anything went wrong to head for the shops to lose herself in the crowds scream bloody murder if necessary with that on her mind mj veered that way her priority to lure the second gunman away from jack and give him an even chance but as she raced toward the stores with their bright on sale signs she saw couples families children being led by the hand babies in strollers and thought of the way the man chasing her had slipped a hand under his jacket she thought of what a gun fired at her in the midst of a crowd would do and she pivoted changed direction on a dime and ran toward the far end of the lot pumping her arms she tossed a quick look over her shoulder shed left her pursuer in the dust he was still coming but lagging now overheated she imagined in his bagging suit coat and leather shoes slippery shoes on wet pavement just how far would he chase her she wondered before giving up and turning back to pick up his friend and stumble over jack deliberately she slowed her pace let him close some of the distance in order to keep his interest keen part of her worried that he would simply use that gun slam a bullet into her leg or her back with the image of that running riot in her head she streaked into a line of parked cars she could hear her own breath whistling now shed run the equivalent of a fiftyyard touchdown dash in the blistering heat of a midsummer storm crouching behind a minivan she swiped sweat from her eyes and tried to think could she circle back find a way to help jack had the gorilla already pounded him into dust and set off to help his buddy how long would her luck last before some innocent family of four their bargainhunting complete ran through the downpour and into the line of fire concentrating on silence more than speed she duckwalked around the van slid her way around a compact she needed to catch her breath needed to think needed to see what was happening behind the salvini building bracing herself she put one trembling hand on the fender of the compact and risked a quick look he was closer than shed anticipated four cars to the left and taking his time she ducked down fast pressed her back into the bumper if she stayed where she was would he pass by or would he spot her better to die on the run she thought or with your fists raised than to be picked off cowering behind an economy import she sucked in a breath said another quick prayer for jack and headed for new ground it was the ping on the asphalt beside her that stopped her heart she felt the sharp edge of rock bounce off her jeans he was shooting at her her heart bounced from throat to stomach and back like a pingpong ball and she skidded around a parked car another inch two at the most and that bullet would have met flesh hed tagged her she realized and now it would only be a matter of running her down cornering her like a rabbit well she would see about that gritting her teeth she bellied under the car ignored the wet grit the smell of gas and oil and slid like a snake beneath the undercarriage held her breath as she pulled herself through the narrow space and under the next vehicle she could hear him now he was breathing hard a wheeze on each inhale a whistle on the exhale she saw his shoes little feet she thought irreverently decked out in glossy black wing tips and argyle socks she closed her eyes for one brief moment trying to get a picture of him planted in her mind fiveeight tops maybe a hundred and sixty midthirties sharp eyes a welldefined nose wiry but not buff and out of breath hell she thought going giddy she could take him she scooted another inch was just preparing to make her move when she saw those shiny wing tips leave the ground there in front of her eyes were a pair of scuffed boots jacks boots jacks voice was muttering panting curses her vision blurred with relief and the terror as she heard the muffled thump that was the silenced gun firing again skinning elbows and knees she was out from under the car in time to see the gunman running for cover and jack starting off in pursuit jack he skidded to a halt whirled sheer relief covering his battered face and it was then that she saw the blood staining his shirt oh god oh god youre shot her legs went weak so that she stumbled toward him as he glanced down absently pressing a hand to his side hell the pain registered but only dimly as his arms filled with woman the car he managed get to the car hes heading back his hand wet with blood and rain locked on hers later she would remember running but none of it seemed real as it happened feet pounding on pavement skidding the jittery thud of her heart the rising sense of fear and fury the wide shocked eyes of a woman carrying shopping bags who was nearly mowed down in their rush and jack cursing her steadily for not doing as she was told the van screamed out of the lot as they skidded down the incline damn it all to hell and back again his lungs were burning his side shot fire desperately he dug the keys out of his pocket in the car now she all but dived through the window barely maintaining her balance as he burned rubber in reverse youre hurt let me see he batted her worried hands away and whipped the wheel around he got his threeton friend too after all that trouble theyre not getting away the car shimmied fishtailed then the tires bit the road as he swung into the chase get the gun out of the glove box give it to me jack youre bleeding for gods sake didnt i tell you to run he punched the gas screaming on the vans rear bumper as they rocketed toward the main drag i told you to head for people to get lost he could have killed you give me the damn gun all right all right she beat a fist on the glove compartment until the sticky door popped open hes heading for the beltway i see where hes going youre not going to shoot at him you could hit some poor schmucks car jack snatched the gun out of her hand swerved to make the exit skidded on the damp roadway i hit what i aim at now strap in and be quiet ill deal with you later her fear for him was such that she didnt blink an eye at his words he zipped through traffic like a madman hugging the bumper of the van like a lover and when they hit ninety a cold numbness settled over her as if her system had been shot full of novocaine youre going to kill someone she said calmly it might not even be us i can handle the car that at least was perfect truth he threaded through traffic staying on target like a heatseeking missile his fat new tires gripping true on the slick roadway he was close enough that he could see the big man hunched in the passenger seat turn around and snarl yeah im coming for you you son of a bitch jack muttered youve got my spare cuffs youre bleeding on the seat mj heard herself speak but the words seemed to come from outside her mind ive got more and with the gun on his lap he whipped the wheel gained inches on the side hed cut them off he calculated drive them to the shoulder the big man was cuffed and he could handle the other and then they would see his eyes narrowed as he saw the driver of the van twist his head around heard the wheels screech the van shimmied shuddered then swerved wildly toward the oncoming exit he cant make it jack pumped his brakes fell back a foot and prepared to make the quick sharp turn he cant make that turn hell lose it he swore when the van rocked lost control on the rainslicked road and hit the guardrail at eighty the crash was huge and sent the van flying up like a drunken high diver it rolled once in the air and amid the squeal of brakes of other horrified drivers it landed twelve feet below on the incline he had time to swing to the side to push out of the car before the explosion shoved him back like a huge hot hand mjs hand gripped his shoulder as the flames spewed up the air stank with gas not a chance he murmured lost them get in the car jack it amazed her how cool how composed her voice sounded cars were emptying of drivers and passengers people were rushing toward the wreck in the passenger side im driving now after all that he said dazed with smoke and pain lost them anyway in the car she led him around ignoring the high excited voices someone surely would have already called on his car phone there was nothing left to do we need to get out of here she drove on instinct back to her apartment safe or not it was home and he needed tending driving jacks car was like manning a yacht she thought concentrating on her speed and direction as the rain petered out to a fine drizzle a very old very big boat with a vague sense of surprise she pulled in beside her mg nothing much had changed she realized her car was still there the building still stood a couple of kids who didnt mind getting wet were tossing a frisbee in the side yard as if it was an ordinary day in ordinary lives wait for me to come around she dragged up her purse from the floor found her keys of course he didnt listen and was standing on the sidewalk when she came around the hood you can lean on me she murmured sliding an arm around his waist just lean on me jack it should be all right to be here he decided at least for a little while we may have to move again soon he realized he was limping favor ing an ache in his right leg that he hadnt noticed before her heart had stopped stuttering and was numb well just get you cleaned up yeah i could use a beer ill get you one she promised as she led him inside though she habitually took the stairs she steered him to the elevator lets just get you inside and then to a hospital she thought she had to see how bad it was first once shed done what she could she was dumping it all and going official cops doctors fbi whatever it took she sent up a small prayer of thanksgiving when she saw that the corridor was empty no nosy neighbors she thought ignoring the police tape and unlocking her door no awkward questions she kicked a broken lamp out of her way walked him around the overturned couch and into the bath sit she ordered and flicked on the lights lets have a look and her trembling hands belied her steady voice as she gently lifted his bloody shirt over his head god jack that guy beat the hell out of you i left him with his face in the dirt and his hands cuffed behind his back yeah she made herself look away from the blooming purple bruises over his torso and wet a cloth have you been shot before once in abilene caught me in the leg slowed me down awhile ridiculous as it was it helped that this wasnt the first time she pressed the cloth to his side low along the ribs her eyes stung with hot tears that she wouldnt shed i know it hurts you were going to get me a beer didnt she look pretty he thought playing nurse with her cheeks pale her eyes dark and her hands cool as silk in a minute just be still now she knelt beside him steeling herself for the worst then sat back on her heels and hissed damn it jack its only a scratch he grinned at her feeling every bump and bruise as if in a personal carnival of pain thats supposed to be my line i was ready for some big gaping hole in your side it just grazed you he looked down considered bled pretty good though he took the cloth himself pressed it against the long shallow wound about that beer ill get you a beer i ought to hit you over the head with it well talk about who conks who after i eat a bottle of aspirin he got up wincing and pawed through the mirrored cabinet over the sink maybe you could get me a shirt out of the car sugar i dont think im going to be wearing the other one again you scared me anger tears and desperate relief brewed a messy stew in her stomach do you have any idea how much you scared me he found the aspirin closed the cabinet and met her eyes in the mirror ive got an idea seeing how i felt when i saw you trying to draw that pussforbrains fire you promised to head for the mall well i didnt sue me out of patience she shoved him down again ignoring his muffled yelp of pain oh be quiet and let me finish up here i must have some antiseptic here somewhere maybe just a leather strap to bite on while you pour salt in my wounds dont tempt me she dampened another cloth then knelt down and began to clean his face youve got a black eye blooming your lips swollen and youve got a nice big knot right here he yelped again when she pressed the cloth to his temple baby if youre going to play nurse nancy at least give me some anesthesia first since she didnt seem inclined to give him any water he swallowed the aspirin dry he continued to complain as she swabbed him with antiseptic slapped on bandages out of patience she pressed her lips to his which caused him equal amounts of pain and pleasure are you going to kiss everywhere it hurts he asked you should be so lucky then she laid her head in his lap and let out a long long sigh i dont care how mad you are i didnt know what else to do he was coming hed have had you i only knew i had to draw him away from you he weakened stroked her hair okay well get into all that later he noticed for the first time the raw skin on her elbow hey youve got a few scrapes yourself burns some she murmured aw come on sugar ill be the doctor he reversed their positions grinned this may sting a little youd love that wouldnt ouch damn it jack baby but he kissed the abraded skin then bandaged it gently you ever scare me like that again and ill keep you cuffed to the bed for a month promises promises she leaned forward wrapped her arms around him theyre dead arent they they couldnt have lived through that chances are slim im sorry mj i never got anything out of them not a clue we never got anything out of them she corrected and we did our best she struggled to bury the worry straighten her shoulders theres still the creeps she began then went pale again remembering odds were at least one of the salvini brothers was dead but it hadnt been bailey in there she reminded herself and took two deep breaths well at least now i can get myself some fresh clothes and some cash and im calling into the pub this was a dare ill wait until were ready to head out again but im checking in letting them know im okay giving them the schedule for the rest of the week fine be a businesswoman he stood up held her still well find your friends mj i promise you that and as much as it goes against the grain its time to call in the cops she let out a wavering sigh of relief yeah three days of this is enough therell be a lot of questions then well give them the answers i should tell you that a man in my line of work isnt real popular with straight cops ive got a couple of contacts but when you start moving up the ranks the tolerance level shoots way down well handle it should we call from here or just go in here cop shops make me itchy im not giving them the stone she planted her feet prepared for an argument its baileys or its her decision im not turning it over to anyone but her okay he said easily and made her blink well work around it she and grace come first with both of us now her smile spread and the jangling ring made them both jolt what she stared down at her purse as if it had suddenly come alive and snapped at her its my phone my phones ringing he touched a hand to his pocket reassured when he felt the gun answer it barely breathing she dug into the purse shed dropped on the floor hit the switch oleary the tears simply rushed into her eyes as she sank down on the floor bailey oh my god bailey are you all right where are you are you hurt what what yes yes im fine in my apartment but where her hand reached up gripped jacks bailey stop asking me that and tell me where the hell you are yeah ive got it well be there in ten minutes stay she clicked off im sorry she told jack ive got to then burst into tears shes all right she managed as he rolled his eyes and picked her up shes okay it was a quiet established neighborhood with lovely old trees mj gripped her hands together on her lap and scanned house numbers twentytwo twentyfour twentysix there that one even as jack turned into the driveway of a tidy federalstyle home she was reaching for the door handle he merely hooked a hand in the waist of her jeans and hauled her back hold on wait until i stop even as he did he saw the woman a pretty blonde of fragile build come racing out of the front door and across the wet grass mj shoved herself out of the car and streaked into her arms it made a nice picture jack decided as he climbed out gingerly the two of them standing in the watery sunlight holding on as if they could swallow each other whole they swayed together on the lush grass weeping talking over each other and just clinging and as touching and attractive a scene as it was there was nothing he wanted to avoid more than two sobbing women he spotted the man standing just outside the door noted the smile in his eyes the fresh bandage on his arm without hesitation jack gave the women a wide berth and headed for the front door cade parris jack took the extended hand measured his man about sixtwo trim brown hair eyes of a dreamier green than mjs a strong grip that jack felt balanced out the glossy good looks jack dakota cade scanned the bruises shook his head you look like a man who could use a drink despite his sore mouth jacks lips spread in a grateful smile brother you just became my best friend come on in cade invited with a last glance toward mj and bailey theyll need some time and we can fill each other in it took a while but jack was feeling considerably more relaxed with his feet propped up on a coffee table a beer in his hand amnesia he murmured must have been tough on her shes had a rough few days seeing one slimy excuse for a stepbrother kill her other slimy excuse for a stepbrother then come for her we dropped in on salvinis i saw the results cade nodded then you know how bad it was if she hadnt gotten away well she did she still doesnt remember all of it but shed already sent one of the diamonds to mj and one to grace ive been working the case since friday morning when she came to my office you saturday afternoon jack told him and cooled his throat with beer its been fast work all around but cade frowned as he looked toward the window bailey was scared confused but she wanted answers and figured a private investigator could get them for her we had a major breakthrough today jack lifted a brow gesturing toward the bandage that part of it the remaining salvini cade said his eyes level and cold hes dead which meant one more dead end jack mused you figure they set the whole thing up no they had a client i havent tracked him yet cade rose wandered to the window mj and bailey were still standing in the yard talking fast cops are on it too now ive got a friend mick marshall yeah i know him hes a rare one a cop with a brain and a heart thats mick buchanans over him though he doesnt much like pis buchanan doesnt much like anybody but hes good hes going to want to talk to you and mj the prospect had jack sighing i think i could use another beer with a laugh cade turned from the window ill get us both another and you can tell me how you spent your weekend his eyes roamed over jacks face and how the other guy looks timothy mj said with surprise i never liked him but i never pictured him as a murderer it was as if hed lost his mind bailey kept her hand linked with mjs as if afraid her friend would vanish without the connection i blanked it all just shut it out everything little pieces started to come back but i couldnt get a grip on them i wouldnt have made it through without cade i cant wait to meet him she looked into baileys eyes and her own narrowed in speculation it looks as though he works fast it shows bailey asked and flushed like a big neon sign just days ago bailey said half to herself it all happened fast it doesnt seem like just a few days it feels as if ive known him forever her lips curved warmed her honeybrown eyes he loves me mj just like that i know it sounds crazy youd be surprised what doesnt sound crazy to me these days he makes you happy mj tucked baileys wave of hair behind her ear thats what counts i couldnt remember you or grace a tear squeezed through as bailey shut her eyes i know it was only a couple of days but it was so lonely without you then when i started to remember it wasnt specifics more just a feeling a loss of something important then when i did remember and we went to your apartment you were gone thered been the breakin and i couldnt find you everything happened so fast after that it was only hours ago then i remembered that phone you cart around in your purse i remembered and i called and there you were it was the best call i ever got the best i ever made her lips trembled once mj i cant find grace i know drawing together mj draped an arm around baileys shoulders we have to believe shes all right jack and i were just up at her country place this morning shed been there bailey i could still smell her and we found each other well find her yes we will they walked toward the house together this jack does he make you happy yeah when hes not ticking me off with a chuckle bailey opened the door then i cant wait to meet him either i like your friend jack stood out on cades patio contemplating aftertherain in suburbia she likes you too shes classy and shes come through a rough time holding her own parris seems pretty sharp he helped get her through so hes aces with me we filled in most of the blanks for each other hes got a cool head a quick mind and hes crazy about your friend i think i noticed that jack took her hand studied it not delicate like baileys he mused but narrow competent strong hes got a lot to offer class again money fancy house i guess youd call it security intrigued she watched his face i guess you would he hadnt meant to get started on this he realized but however fast certain things could move hed decided life was too short to waste time my old man was a bum he said abruptly my mother served drinks to drunks when she felt like working i worked my way thorough college hauling bricks and mixing mortar for a mason which led me to a useless degree in english lit with a minor in anthropology dont ask me why it seemed like the thing to do at the time ive got a few thousand socked away for dry spells you get dry spells in my line of work i rent a couple of rooms by the month he waited a beat but she said nothing not what youd call security nope is that what you want security she thought about it nope he dragged his hand through his hair you know how those two stones looked when you and bailey put them together they looked spectacular sure all that fire and power in one spot but mostly they just looked right he met her eyes tried to see inside her sometimes its just right and when it is you dont have to look for the reasons maybe not i dont know what im doing here i dont know why this is ive lived my life alone and liked it that way do you understand that she enjoyed the irritation in his voice and smirked yeah i understand that the lone wolf you want to howl at the moon tonight or what dont get smart with me when im trying to explain myself he took a quick circle around the patio there was a hammock swinging between two big trees and somewhere in those dripping green leaves a bird was singing its heart out his life jack mused had never been that simple that calm or that pretty he didnt have anything to offer but what he was and what he had inside himself for her shed have to decide if that was enough to build on the point is i dont want to keep living my life alone his head snapped up and his bruised eye glared out from under the arched scarred brow do you understand that why wouldnt i her smirk remained firmly in place youre sloppy in love with me pal keep it up just keep it up he hissed out a breath eased a hand onto his aching side my feelings arent the issue and maybe yours arent either things happen to peoples emotions under intense circumstances now hes being philosophical again must be that minor in anthropology he closed his eyes prayed for patience im trying to lay out my cards here you come from a different place than i do and maybe you dont want to head where im heading maybe you want to slow down some now take it in more careful steps more traditional now she snorted is that how i strike you the traditional type his frown only deepened maybe not but it doesnt change the fact that a week ago you were cruising along in your own lane just fine youve got a right to ask questions look for reasons a couple of days with me im not asking questions or looking for reasons jack she said interrupting him i stopped cruising in my own lane the day i met you and im glad of it oh hell she thought and braced it stands for magdalen juliette a cough of laughter escaped him it was the last thing hed expected youre kidding it stands for magdalen juliette she repeated between clenched teeth and the only people who know that are my family bailey and grace in other words only people i love and trust which now includes you magdalen juliette he repeated rolling it around on his tongue quite a handle sugar its mj legally mj because thats what i wanted and if you ever call me any form of magdalen juliette other than mj i will personally and with great pleasure skin you alive she would too he thought with a quick crooked grin if you dont want me using it why did you tell me she took a step toward him i told you that and im telling you this because my name is m j oleary and i know what i want his eyes flared and burned away the grin youre sure of that the second stones knowledge and i know do you yeah his breathing took a hitch its a big step the biggest okay his palms were sweaty in his pockets so he pulled them free you go first her grin flashed no you no way i said it first last time fairs fair she supposed it was angling her head she took a good long look at him yes she thought she knew okay lets get married relishing the swift kick of joy he tucked his thumbs in his pockets arent you supposed to ask you know propose a guys entitled to a little romance at big moments youre pushing your luck then she laughed and locked her arms around his neck but what the hell will you marry me jack sure why not and when she laughed again he caught her against his sore and battered body perfect fit
