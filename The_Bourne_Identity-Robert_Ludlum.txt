chapter one the man with no memory whos there whos in this room washburn went quietly to the bed he did not want to make a sudden noise or movement that could cause his patient new psychological damage the next few minutes would be as important as the surgery that he had performed on the man many times during the past month a friend he said softly you speak english i thought you would how do you feel im not sure you were brought here to the french island of ile de port noir by fishermen who found you in the mediterranean youd been shot many times im a doctor your doctor my name is geoffrey washburn whats yours the stranger was silent for a minute then he turned and looked into the doctors eyes i dont know he said weeks passed it will take time dont fight it youre drunk his patient said i usually am washburn agreed thats why i lost my job in a london hospital and came here but im a good doctor and i saved your life ive watched you and ive listened to you you speak

youve had surgery to every part of it eyes nose chin and your hair is not your natural color the stranger thought about this but why he said think what are you what were you an international salesman a teacher of languages no said washburn your body is strong your hands are strong but youre not a builder or a fisherman you have a good mind and wide knowledge when you were unconscious you talked of places that ive never heard of what else have you learned about me i had to be sure that your mind was strong enough to accept this washburn held up a small square of plastic i found this piece of film under your skin it says die bank gemeinschaft bahnhofstrasse zurich bank details exactly the numbers are in your handwriting theyre your signature for an account at a bank in zurich more time passed there are no rules the doctor told him amnesia can be physical from a head wound or psychological i think for you its both your mind is protecting itself but were making progress were finding out what you do best he opened a closet and took out a gun take this to pieces he threw it to the other man the patient looked at the gun then his fingers started moving and in seconds the gun was in pieces you see you have experience a lot of experience of guns youre a professional but not i believe a soldier im thinking of the surgery to your face your skills and your normal behavior will slowly come back to you but your physical brain is not what it was i dont know if it will ever connect those skills with your past your memories have been destroyed the man sat silently then he said the answers in zurich yes youre strong enough now ive made arrangements theres a boat here from marseilles the captain will leave you on a beach outside the city the man with no memory looked at him so its time its time i know what youre feeling a sense of helplessness because until now ive been your guide but youre not helpless believe me you will find your way to zurich to zurich agreed the doctor

also hurt on my boat the doctor helped them i had no fish so no money youre my payment i need papers the man said sensing that more help was possible i need a passport to be changed the captain was silent then he said ill be in a cafe in marseilles this evening le bouc de mer youll need money for the papers how much thats a matter for the man youll speak to there a lot the patient thought about the money from the doctor it wouldnt be enough ill be there he said some time later he walked through the narrow streets of the small coastal town money he found the richest area in a store he heard a conversation between the owner and a customer wheres the marquis today drunk in the apartment above the cafe next door waiting for a woman i had to drive him from the house without his wife seeing him ive left his car here but he wont be able to drive it ill come back later the patient walked around the nextdoor building looking through doors and windows and wondering which car belonged to the marquis a woman arrived an attractive woman in a very short skirt and soon he saw her at an upstairs window the patient went inside took the stairs to the first floor and in one quick movement broke the door down nom de dieu the man on the bed looked up in shock did my wife hire you ill pay you more keep quiet said the patient and you wont get hurt he quickly put on the marquiss expensive clothes and took his money watch and car keys please leave me your clothes the marquis cried im sorry i cant do that he picked up his own and the womans clothes then he noticed a telephone on a desk by the window and pulled the wire from the wall the police will find you the marquis said angrily i dont think youll report a crime how will you explain it to your wife youre not helpless you will find your way what kind of past produced the skills that were returning to him now he had difficulty with the controls in the marquiss jaguar he had he thought no past experience with cars like this he followed the signs to marseilles and found a garage selling new and used expensive cars ten minutes later he had exchanged the car for six thousand francs about a fifth of its value but no questions asked soon after that he had sold the watch and bought clothes and a soft leather suitcase then he found a hotel and rested until it was time for his appointment at le bouc de mer the patient made his way through the crowded tables of the cafe until he found the captain there was another man at the table thin and palefaced with narrow eyes how much to change this passport by ten oclock tomorrow three and a half thousand francs and ill need a photo i had one done on the way here the patient passed it to him a meeting was arranged for the next day and the captain was given five hundred francs under the table then the patient walked toward the door it happened so quickly that there was no time to think a man walked into him and then his eyes widened in disbelief no my god it cannot youre dead the patients hand seized his shoulder i lived what do you know the other mans face was red and angry he pulled out a knife ill finish it now he said the man with no memory brought his other hand down hard and kicked with all his strength his attacker fell back and the knife was seen by the people around them take your argument outside or well call the police the patient could not move in the crowd his attacker ran holding his stomach out into the darkness of the street he thought i was dead wanted me to be dead and now he knows im alive chapter two names and addresses he knew the name of the hotel carillon du lac he had given it to the taxi driver without thinking he knew the reception area and the big glass windows that looked out over lake zurich he had been there before its good to see you again sir the receptionist said but i dont know you i dont know me help me please thank you he said ive hurt my hand could you fill in the form for me and then ill try to sign it the patient held his breath of course sir the receptionist completed the form then turned it around for the signature mr j bourne new york ny usa he stared at it he had a name part of a name j bourne john james joseph he signed the receptionist bent forward the usual conditions sir you will be informed of any calls or visitors but only calls from your company should be put straight through to your room treadstone seventyone if i remember correctly more information another name he had a country and a city and a company that employed him or that had employed him and he was protected from unwanted visitors thats correct thank you upstairs in his room he called the new york operator her words were quite clear we have no telephone number for a company of that name sir he put the phone down might treadstone seventyone be a code a way of reaching mr j bourne of new york city he left his room and walked into the street his feet seemed to take him on a route that he knew and then there was the gemeinschaft bank he entered through the heavy glass doors and was directed to a first floor receptionist your signature please the man requested passing him a form he looked and understood no name was needed this time just the number of the account he wrote out the numbers and was shown to a private room the door will lock behind you the receptionist told him it is usual for holders of special accounts to telephone before they come i knew that washburns patient lied but im in a hurry he walked inside heard the door lock sat down and waited finally another metal door opened a bank officer introduced himself as herr apfel and invited the visitor into his office the signature was requested again and within minutes the receptionist entered with a black metal container may i unlock the box herr apfel asked please do open it the banker looked shocked i said unlock not open your identity might be listed and i do not need to know it but if i wanted the money to be sent to another bank then a name would be needed open it the banker opened the box and passed the papers to the other man who stared at the top page in disbelief the amount in the account was swiss francs more than million american dollars how why the bottom statement showed that the first payment into the account had been from singapore swiss francs below that was an envelope with owner only officer of the treadstone seventyone company typed on it he opened it and read owner jason charles bourne address unlisted nationality american jason he felt a pain in his stomach a ringing sound in his ears why did he feel that he was falling into darkness again when he returned to the reception area an hour later after a meeting with another bank official herr koenig swiss francs had been sent to the marseilles account of dr geoffrey washburn who had saved his life the money would cure or kill the alcoholic four million francs was on its way to a bank in paris for the use of jason c bourne another francs in large notes had been handed over by herr koenig in cash herr koenig walked with him to the elevator past two men who were sitting at opposite ends of the room out of the corner of his eye bourne noticed movement koenig had turned to both of the men one took a radio out of his pocket and spoke into it the other took out a gun the men moved toward bourne who was forced to back into the empty elevator as the elevator doors closed with the gun at his head bourne moved suddenly to the right then swept his foot off the floor and up to the mans arm knocking the gun from his hand his body continued to turn and his shoulder crashed into the other mans stomach throwing him against the wall the man fell to the floor unconscious the man at le bouc de mer bourne knew had wasted no time sending his message to zurich kill him he seized the other killer by his neck how many how many are waiting downstairs no answer he pushed the mans face into the elevator wall opened his coat and found another gun he pointed it how many two one by the elevators one by the car outside what kind of car a peugeot brown the elevator doors opened and a man in a dark coat wearing gold glasses stepped forward recognized the situation and pointed a silenced gun at bourne bourne quickly pushed his prisoner out in front of him protecting himself from the gun shots were fired people screamed for the police his prisoner fell to the floor bourne seized the nearest person the receptionist threw him into the path of the man with the gold glasses and ran through the doors then he slowed down and walked calmly away past the man in the peugeot before he turned and watched as the first police car arrived the man in gold glasses talked to the driver of the peugeot then unexpectedly he returned to the bank joining the police who were racing inside the peugeot left and an ambulance arrived bourne turned away he had to get to his hotel pack and leave zurich leave switzerland for paris why paris inside the bank there had seemed to be no question he had to go to paris but why at the carillon du lac bourne packed quickly and then started down again there were three other guests in the elevator two men and a redhaired woman frenchspeaking canadians bourne realized and clearly at the hotel for a conference as he followed them to the reception desk he noticed a sign on the wall welcome to members of the sixth world economic conference the woman was now speaking english to the receptionist dr st jacques the man checked and passed her an envelope bourne moved toward the entrance then stopped a brown peugeot was parked in the street outside and the man with gold glasses was climbing out of the car from another door a second man appeared wearing a raincoat with pockets that were wide enough for powerful guns how how had they found him then he remembered and he felt sick it had seemed so innocent at the time are you enjoying your stay in zurich herr apfel had asked very much my room looks out onto the lake very peaceful how many hotels looked out onto the lake two three the names of the hotels came into his mind from where they had seen him but did they think they could walk into a crowded hotel and simply kill him of course they did with silencers on their guns and people all around him they could easily escape before they were identified what made them think he would not scream for the police and then the answer was clear they knew that jason bourne could not expect police protection why he turned and saw the redhaired woman still reading her message he looked back at the entrance the killers were moving through the crowd toward him bourne walked quickly toward the woman seized her by the arm and pulled her away from the reception desk as she looked up at him in surprise he showed her the end of the gun in his pocket i dont want to frighten you he said quietly but i have no choice take me to your conference room surprise had turned to shock you cant yes i can unseen by the people around them he pushed the gun into her side lets go pale and shaking she led him quickly to a large hall where a man was giving a talk ill scream the woman whispered ill shoot he promised he pushed her across the back of the hall and down toward the front heads turned in their direction the speaker paused and then came three sharp sudden sounds shots then screams running now bourne pulled the woman toward a door at the back of the stage and out they were in a car park he heard a metallic sound saw a slight movement another killer how did they know where to find him radios again of course he moved quickly to one side his shoulder crashing into the womans stomach sending her to the ground shots hit cars near them he jumped up gun in hand and fired three shots before throwing himself down he heard a scream and then nothing he started to get up but could not pain spread through his body through all the places where his wounds had been he looked over at the woman who was slowly getting to her feet he could not let her go he had to stop her he slowly made his way across the ground toward her help me up he said hearing the pain in his voice youre joking this gun is aimed at your face doctor help me up when he too was on his feet he pulled the dead driver from the car and ordered the woman to get behind the wheel drive he said climbing into the passenger seat where could he go the killers had seen his suitcase they would watch the stations and the airports but he had money a lot of money and he had to get to paris i work for the canadian government the woman said quickly im an economist they expect me to contact them tonight if they dont hear from me theyll call the police bourne took her bag and looked through it keys money her passport dr marie st jacques and the message that was given to her at reception a message allowing her vacation time as they drove across zurich stopping only to leave the car and steal another one bourne was following a memory a restaurant he knew it was important he knew the way but what was it called drei alpenhauser yes he had to go there even before they parked he had noticed that she was too quiet too obedient when they came to a stop her door crashed open she was halfway out into the street before bournes arm shot out and seized the back of her dress forcing her back into the car he took her hair and pulled her head toward him i wont do it again she cried i promise i wont you will he said quietly but if you run away before i let you go ill have to kill you i dont want to but ill have to you say youll let me go she said when in an hour or two when were out of zurich and im on my way to somewhere else now dry your eyes were going inside whats in there he looked at the wide brown eyes that were searching his i dont know he replied he showed her the gun a reminder and they entered the bar he had seen the inside of the drei alpenhauser before he recognized the heavy wooden tables the lighting the sounds he had come here in another life a waiter led them to a table where they ordered a drink bourne looked around and then he saw a face across the room a large head above a fat body bourne did not know the face which was showing fear and disbelief but the face knew him the fat man walked uncomfortably over to their table why are you here he asked i did what i was told to do i gave you the envelope i told no one about you have others spoken i saw the police offer of a reward for information about you but i did nothing the police have not come to me if they did you know others would follow my wife my children ive said nothing done nothing has anyone else tell me ill know if youre lying chernak is the only contact of yours that i know he passed me the envelope you know that but he wouldnt say anything where is he now where he always is in his apartment on lowenstrasse what number youre testing me the fat man stared at him in fear yes im testing you who gave the envelope to chernak what was in it i have no idea who gave it to him in it money i guess a lot of money now please let me go get out of here one more question bourne said what was the money for the fat man was shaking now no one told me but every day i read the newspapers six months ago a man was killed chapter three trained to kill they followed directions to lowenstrasse marie was silent now holding the wheel tightly bourne watched her and understood a man was killed jason bourne had been paid to kill the police had offered a reward others would follow how many people were looking for him who were they when would this end theres number he said stop the car marie looked at him with fear in her eyes i dont want to go in there with you i heard what the man said in the restaurant if i hear any more youll kill me bourne pulled his aching body out of the car his words made no more sense to me than to you maybe less he saw the confusion on her face lets go he did not press the bell below chernaks name he pressed others until someone opened the door he walked with difficulty up the stairs holding maries arm and on his orders she knocked and then called out to the man inside the door opened and there in a wheelchair was a man with no legs youre crazy the man cried get away from here im tired of hearing that bourne said and pulled marie inside she willingly obeyed his orders to go to a small windowless bedroom and then bourne turned back to chernak you promised that our last piece of business would be the final one chernak shouted whitefaced this is too dangerous the envelope that you passed to our friend at the drei alpenhauser bourne said who gave it to you a messenger like all the others i dont know you were paid so i know you accepted the job why are you here now because i have to know because i dont understand help me he suddenly noticed chernaks hand moving toward a bag hanging from his chair the hand came out quickly pointing a gun and before bourne could reach his own chernak fired twice pain filled bournes head and shoulder as he dived to one side then crashed his other shoulder into chernaks wheelchair the legless man fell helplessly to the floor theyll pay for your corpse he screamed carlos will pay ill see you in hell bourne fired a bullet into the mans head a long terrible cry came from the bedroom door a womans cry bourne could hardly think for the pain he had to take her what was her name and get out my god you killed him she screamed as he pulled her out of the apartment a man with no inside the car bourne tried to stop the blood the head wound was only a cut but he was feeling sick and faint from the pain in his shoulder an address came to him he could picture the doorway steppdeckstrasse he ordered weakly the car did not move what was she doing marie knocked the gun from his hand pushed his head against the car window then jumped out and ran he could not stay in the car he cleaned off the blood as well as he could then got out somewhere there would be a taxi no questions were asked when bourne rented a room in the house in steppdeckstrasse and a doctor was found who also asked nothing the pain in his head and shoulder was real but the psychological damage was great he needed to rest as he lay on the bed words came to him a man was killed you accepted the job and then theyll pay for your corpse carlos will pay he heard a sudden sharp noise outside the room there was someone on the stairs bourne jumped off his bed seized his gun and ran to the wall by the door the door crashed open he pushed it back throwing all his weight at it then pulled the door open and kicked up at the mans head then taking the man by the hair he pulled him inside a gun fell to the floor bourne closed the door and listened no sounds outside he looked down at the unconscious man was he a thief a killer police had the owner of the steppdeckstrasse house decided to earn the reward he searched the mans pockets and found cards and licenses in different names he was a killer a professional someone had hired him who knew that bourne was there the woman had he spoken the address he could not remember he took the papers put the gun in his pocket then tied the unconscious man to the bed then he walked quietly and painfully down the stairs the next doorway he guessed and he was right he turned toward it and fired hitting the second man in the leg is there anyone else he asked with his gun at the mans head no only two of us we were paid who by you know a man named carlos i will not answer kill me first give me your car keys the man tried to push bourne away bourne brought the end of the gun down on his head and took his gun and keys he hoped he would be able to drive he found the car and tried one key after another which was it suddenly a powerful light burned his eyes get out it was the man with the gold glasses behind him a woman was led toward the car thats him marie st jacques said softly so this is what you look like the swiss man said to bourne we have had so many descriptions im happy to help the police but id like to make my statement now whatever you need and go back to the hotel please marie said the swiss man looked up and a second larger man seized her arm she stared at them and then at bourne suddenly realizing let her go back to canada bourne said she works for the canadian government and youll never see her again she has seen us the swiss man said there are rules he turned to the larger man take her in the other car to the limmat bourne froze maries corpse was going to be thrown in the limmat river scream he shouted she tried but her scream was cut off by a blow to her neck and she was pulled unconscious toward a small black car as the car drove away bourne felt sick it was his fault he had killed her you were at the bank he said you know i have money why not take mine money is only useful if you have time to enjoy it the swiss man said i wouldnt have five minutes he took the gun from bournes pocket and brought it down hard on bournes hands my fingers theyre broken bourne screamed but he had quickly covered his right hand with his left his left hand was bloody and useless but he could still move the fingers on his right hand another gunman joined them in the car and as they headed across the city he searched bournes clothes roughly taking the money and documents my leg bourne screamed bending down and reaching quickly inside his sock for the gun that was hidden there watch him cried the swiss man who was driving but it was too late bourne had fired twice at the killer beside him and the gun was now at the head of the driver stop the car he shouted but the car went faster i can get you out of zurich the man said without me you cant leave there are police looking for you everywhere i dont think you want the police or i can crash the car and kill us both i have nothing to lose well talk bourne lied slow down drop your gun on the seat next to me bourne dropped his gun and the car slowed thirty kilometers an hour eighteen nine he seized the man by the neck then lifted his bloody left hand and spread the blood across the swiss mans eyes reaching across with his right hand he turned the wheel to the right into a pile of garbage he took the gun from the seat and fired a darkred hole appeared in the killers head in the street people were running toward the car bourne climbed into the front pushed the corpse out and drove away the limmat marie would be killed in a dark empty place near the water or she already had been he had to know he could not walk away he drove and searched the length of the river trying to forget the pain in his hand the pain in his shoulder he stopped only to push out the body from the back seat then in an unlit parking area he noticed the small black car he stopped fifty meters away and opened his door he heard a cry low and frightened from inside the car the sound of a hand across a face and another cry gun in hand he walked slowly toward marie and her assassin the man was pulling off her clothes filled with anger but unable to shoot without hitting her he broke the car window with his shoe stay inside he shouted to marie as the killer threw himself out of the car and onto the ground the killer fired and missed bourne fired and heard a cry he had wounded the man but not killed him who is it what is happening an old man was shouting in german holding a light in front of his face the killer ran to the old man and stood behind him pulling him back there was a shot then the sound of running footsteps the old man had served his purpose and was dead bourne lowered himself to the ground he could do nothing more he did not care marie climbed slowly out of the car shock in her eyes holding her clothes to her body take the keys he shouted get out of here go to the police real ones with uniforms this time you saved my life she whispered you were free but you came back for me and saved my life he heard her through his pain he felt her tying her clothes around his bleeding wounds then her hands were on his arms gently pulling him up as she helped him into the car he could feel himself falling falling into unconsciousness can you hear me maries voice asked youre hurt quite badly but a doctor has seen you and you dont need to go to the hospital a weeks rest will be enough where are we in a village called lenzberg twentyfive kilometers from zurich how i decided to help you its the most difficult decision that ive ever made i sat and thought for half an hour but i couldnt go to the police after you saved me even knowing what i am i only know what ive heard and ive seen a different man arent you afraid of me he asked afraid of what ive done of course i am but youre very weak and i have your gun also you have no clothes ive thrown them all away bourne laughed through his pain remembering the marquis who are you marie asked they say my name is jason bourne they say what does that mean my life began five months ago on a small island in the mediterranean as she sat by his bed he talked through the night until there was nothing more to say my god marie said softly you know so little about yourself you must really be suffering how can you think about my suffering after what ive done to you he answered theyre separate independent of each other outside chernaks apartment you said something about the fat mans words making no more sense to you than to me i thought you were crazy but now i understand why didnt you tell me before that chernak tried to kill you there wasnt time before and it didnt matter it mattered to me i thought you killed a defenseless man the man with the gold glasses the one who told me that he was a policeman said that you were a professional assassin who must be stopped but you were running for your life are running for your life and youre not a killer bourne took her hand but there were envelopes filled with money which i accepted there were millions of dollars in a bank account and youve seen my skills he stared at the ceiling the pain returning those are the facts marie you should leave you dont have facts she said im not a fool but your facts come from the mouths of killers and that bank account can be inspected by a company called treadstone seventyone that doesnt sound like the employer of a hired killer i dont know what i believe but i do know that i was going to die and you came to save me i believe in you i think i want to help you chapter four following the money during the daylight hours marie arranged for clothes meals maps and newspapers she also drove the stolen car fifteen kilometers away and left it returning by taxi bourne used the time for rest and exercise to strengthen his damaged body while they were together they talked shyly at first with many pauses and silences looks passed between them and quiet laughter and slowly they began to feel comfortable with each other marie bourne learned had first studied history but had then realized that most of history was shaped by economic powers and so her future as an economist was decided marie questioned bourne examining the little he knew trying to explain the holes in his knowledge when you read the newspapers she asked whats familiar almost everything names places political relationships and when you look at the maps ive bought in some cases i picture buildings hotels streets faces but the faces have no names did you meet people are there faces in buildings in hotels streets he said without thinking quiet places dark places what did they talk about i dont know there arent any voices there arent any words treadstone thats your company isnt it it doesnt mean anything i couldnt find it it could be apart of a company that buys other businesses secretly maybe you were working for american financial interests but the account no money was leaving it i was selling not buying and why would people be trying to kill me what comes into your mind when you think of money marie asked dont do this dont you understand when i think of money i think of killing i dont know bourne said im tired i want to sleep now youre wrong you know she said ive seen that look in your eyes seeing things that may or may not be there afraid that they are they have been he replied explain the steppdeckstrasse explain a fat man at the drei alpenhauser i cant but you cant either find out jason find out paris he said yes paris marie stood up and walked across the room to him then she reached down and touched his face thank you for my life she whispered thank you for mine he answered and she climbed into the bed he held her tight days and nights passed im going to paris with you today marie told him early one morning i can do things for you that you cant do yourself you dont know enough about money and financial organizations i do and i have a position with the canadian government so i can get information and protection but at the first sign of violence ill leave i dont want to become a problem for you there was a long silence finally bourne said why are you doing this i believe in the man who almost died for me she answered i accept he said reaching for her i shouldnt but i need that belief very badly i want to contact peter a friend of mine marie said if there is a treadstone seventyone in a big company somewhere hell find out ill phone from a payphone in paris and ask him to call me back and if he finds it do i contact the company yes very carefully and through another person me if you like they havent contacted you in six months all that money was left in zurich untouched have they walked away from you do they think youve become part of something illegal that would make them look guilty too but whatever we learn about treadstone bourne said men are still trying to kill me and i dont know why i have to know why someone named carlos will pay for my corpse marie stared at him in shock what did you just say she asked the name carlos thats right in all this time youve never talked about him bourne looked at her trying to remember she was right he hadnt why not had he tried to block the name from his mind does carlos mean something to you my god you really dont know marie said studying his eyes hes an assassin a man whos been hunted for twenty years or more hes believed to be responsible for killing between fifty and sixty people mostly politicians and army officers no one knows what he looks like but its said that he works from paris bourne felt a wave of coldness spread through his body after separate flights to paris they had an arrangement to meet in a small hotel first though bourne visited the sorbonne library i read the newspapers six months ago a man was killed those were the words of the fat man in zurich bourne counted back six months and collected newspapers for the ten weeks before that then he fingered through them quickly page by page nothing he returned the newspapers and took the ones for four and five months ago more turning of pages and then he found it ambassadeur leland est mort a marseilles he felt an explosion of pain hitting him between the eyes his breathing stopped as he stared at the name leland he knew it he could picture the face he read american ambassador leland had been killed by a single shot from a highpowered gun he had been in france asking the french government not to sell fighter planes to africa and the middle east it was believed that he had been killed as a warning the buyers and sellers of death were unhappy with his visit the assassin was without doubt paid a lot of money bourne closed his eyes how could he know what he knew if he was not that assassin in marseilles he could not meet marie now she had been wrong and his worst fears were real he looked at the date of the newspaper thursday august something was wrong washburn had told him again and again trying to help him remember you were brought to my door on the morning of tuesday august he was not in marseilles on the twentysixth he had not killed leland filled with happiness he looked at his watch it was time to find marie to reach her and hold her and tell her that there was hope in the room of their small hotel marie changed bournes hair color from dark to fair and he put on thick brown glasses they formed a plan and then went to the bank where bournes money was now sitting marie went inside while bourne stayed outside at a payphone he rang the banks number and asked for foreign services he gave his name and the name of the bank in zurich and asked to speak to a bank official he then explained to a monsieur damacourt that he needed to know whether the millions of francs had reached the bank i am afraid damacourt explained that i cannot give that kind of information to a stranger on the telephone i suggest that you come to the bank my office is on the ground floor bourne agreed to be there in half an hour then ended the conversation seconds later the telephone rang his names damacourt ground floor office he told marie ill find it she said she was soon standing near the office would it happen was she right it happened there was sudden activity as damacourts secretary rushed into his office returning seconds later to call a number and speak reading from her notebook two minutes later damacourt appeared at his door questioned the secretary and returned to his room leaving the door open then another man arrived with a small black case and entered the room a light appeared on the secretarys telephone damacourt was making a call jason bournes account had secret instructions with it the phone call had been made from his position at the payphone bourne saw three men hurrying up the street to the bank and one of them he had seen before in zurich bourne phoned the bank again and explained that his plans had changed he had to go to the airport and fly to london monsieur damacourt should keep the account information in his office bourne would visit him the following day at the end of the working day marie pointed out damacourt as he left the bank then returned to the hotel bourne followed the banker to the door of a cafe and pulled him inside jason bourne he introduced himself your friends must be confused by now racing around the airport and wondering if youve given them false information damacourt looked at him with fear in his eyes i know nothing i only followed the instructions on the account they sat down and bourne ordered drinks tell me he said the instructions came from the gemeinschaft bank i could lose my job if i talk to you you could lose your life if you dont bourne said name your price you decide what value the information has to you your money came with special instructions to be opened by me when the accountholder came for money the instructions said that a telephone number should be called but if i tell you more you must think of another person who told you this the information cannot come from me i know a man bourne said a criminal at the gemeinschaft his name is koenig ill remember that damacourt wrote down a paris telephone number then he added but there was another number before that a number in new york that had been cut out only the area code was still there and this one had been put in its place how valuable are you finding my information the price could be five figures bourne told him then i shall continue i spoke to a woman who gave me no name she told me only that you were a dangerous man and must be kept in my office until a man arrived he needed to see you the man came and i told him that you had changed your plans thats all who are you monsieur someone who must pay you a lot of money bourne said thoughtfully so how now do we get our money there is a way forms completed and your identity checked by a lawyer i do not have the power to stop that of course i would have to make the phone call but maybe only after i had signed the other papers on my desk i do know a suitable lawyer he would cost francs i would want so the account in zurich was opened with those special instructions marie said thoughtfully that would be illegal in many countries but some private european banks allow it you probably knew that the instructions were there put there by treadstone seventyone bourne agreed but someone was paid to change the telephone number koenig thats a crime that could bring him ten years in a swiss prison he was paid a lot of money by carlos bourne said carlos why what am i to him ill phone the canadian embassy and ask about the paris telephone number that damacourt used marie said my friend peter gave me the name of a man there dennis corbelier she called then they left the hotel so marie could use a payphone to call peter for information about treadstone she came away from the phone white and shaking bourne took her in his arms whats wrong i spoke to his boss marie said faintly peters dead he had phone calls from washington dc and new york then he went to meet someone at the airport on the way he was shot in the throat peter oh what have i done you have done nothing bourne could hardly breathe a bullet in the throat it was carlos chapter five the man is cain in a small bookstore they found three old magazines with stories about carlos bought them and returned to the hotel minutes passed as they read and then marie sat up straight its here she said with fear in her face and her voice listen it is believed that carlos and his soldiers commonly punish people by shooting them in the throat leaving them to die in terrible pain the punishment is for disloyalty or a refusal to give information marie stopped unable to continue he refused to tell them about me and he was killed for it she stared at bourne but you knew about the gunshot in the throat you said it i said it i knew it i dont know how am i one of carloss soldiers did i break the code of silence or loyalty is that how stop marie shouted you are you dont take that away from me test me bourne said unhappily take another of these magazine stories about carlos and give me names from it lets see if i can tell you anything marie looked at him then picked up another magazine and looked through it beirut she said embassy he answered cia chief shot in the street three hundred thousand dollars her voice shaking marie continued novgorod a russian training school for spies he spent time there tehran eight killings two million dollars paris marie said quickly all contracts are agreed in paris what contracts whose contracts the contracts killings carloss carlos then theyre his contracts his killings not yours but i knew i know all this without reading the stories what are you trying to tell me youre carlos god no carlos wants to kill me and i dont speak russian the only explanation is that i was with him and i left him thats why i know too much about him to live marie thought about it theres a problem with that she said slowly why havent you just taken the money all that money and gone somewhere safe why dont we do that now stop it bourne cried i cant run i have to know marie took him in her arms i know and i want to help you at the lawyers office arrangements for receiving the money went smoothly after bourne increased the amounts that would be paid to both the lawyer and damacourt a messenger would carry the money from the bank in a leather case at that afternoon and meet bourne at on a bridge over the river seine we understand marie told the lawyer finally as bournes financial advisor that the special instructions with the account must be followed but the timing must be to monsieur bournes advantage if not i would have to report unacceptable activities that i have witnessed in the banking and legal professions here back in the hotel bourne checked his gun while marie phoned the canadian embassy and spoke to dennis corbelier thats strange she said after their conversation he didnt know about peter he did find out about the telephone number that damacourt gave you though its a private line belonging to a fashion house called les classiques its a store really but all the clothes are designed by a man called rene bergeron by bourne was sitting in a taxi opposite the bank when a van drove out of the car park and parked in front of him fifteen minutes later a man left the bank with a leather case and climbed into the van follow that truck he told the taxi driver but keep two cars behind it the driver looked worried i work for the bank bourne explained i need to watch the truck when the van stopped in traffic in a small street he jumped out and ran to the van door gun in hand he shouted the code words through the door and ordered the van to stop ive been told to meet you at the bridge monsieur the van driver said opening his window slightly bourne heard the low voice of a man in the passenger seat it must be at the bridge we have orders and then another man the messenger i want to keep my job im getting out the messenger stepped out into the street and bourne threw himself against the door knocking the second man back inside give me the money bourne shouted at the messenger its yours sir they wanted to find you i meant no harm the van door crashed open again and bourne saw the face of carloss soldier one of the killers from zurich and a gun staring into his eyes he threw himself on the ground turned and fired twice the killer fell bourne pulled the leather case full of money from the hand of the terrified messenger and ran soon after passing the money to marie and changing into more expensivelooking clothes bourne was at les classiques it was a beautiful store on one of the best streets in paris employing beautiful women only a middleaged man sitting in front of a switchboard at the bottom of carpeted stairs looked out of place there bourne walked around admiring the clothes until he saw her it had to be her a tall coldlooking older woman who was walking down the stairs immediately bourne started to play the part of a rich man choosing the most expensive clothes for his girlfriend the woman looked interested and she waved the younger assistants away you have good taste she told him these are some of our designers finest works ill take these three he told her and maybe you could choose a few more similar ones ive had a long flight from the bahamas and im very tired would monsieur like to sit down a drink would be nice he replied and ill pay cash a smile appeared but did not reach the womans eyes then why not have that drink in my office its private and i shall bring more clothes for you to look at i am jacqueline lavier manager and partner in les classiques she held out her hand thank you bourne said taking it but not offering a name he was sure that the woman in front of him was the carrier of messages of death they went upstairs on the seventh step bourne paused below him the middleaged man was speaking on the telephone the back of his head the way his hair fell over his ear bourne had seen that man before explosions darkness and then sudden light where was it why was his head again filled with pain i see that you are interested in our switchboard madame lavier said when a customer phones les classiques the telephone is answered by an educated man with a full knowledge of all our products gentlemen especially like that they reached the office and bourne was given a drink before madame lavier left him to find more clothes bourne looked quickly at the desk bills receipts an address book he could not memorize that then he noticed the corner of a small card showing from under the telephone he moved the telephone to one side there were two telephone numbers on the card one for zurich the other clearly paris he stared at them memorizing them then moved the telephone back he was sitting comfortably again his drink in his hand when madame lavier returned with a thinlipped man of uncertain age both were carrying boxes this is our designer ren bergeron madame lavier introduced him he helped me choose these clothes and you are monsieur briggs charles briggs bourne replied having no idea where the name had come from after bergeron had left he made his final choices and handed madame lavier six fivethousandfranc notes have you thought he asked of opening a store in the bahamas in one of the finer hotels i have contacts there of course and might even be prepared to put some of my own money into the business seeing madame laviers interest he continued im only in paris for one evening but would you like to have dinner she thought about it i think i could be free she said as they walked back downstairs the man at the switchboard was taking a break from calls enough the man thought it was not many years since people were taking calls for him sitting at the switchboards of his companies in saigon and in the communications room of his house by the mekong river in vietnam he looked up and noticed the customer on the stairs his heart stopped as he stared in disbelief oh my god it was him from the living dying terrors of thousands of kilometers away the ghost who was a killer it was him he watched as the customer opened the doors for jacqueline lavier and waved to stop a taxi oh god she was going with him he raced upstairs and into bergerons office bergeron looked up in surprise that man with jacqueline who is he oh probably the american a man called briggs where did they go she left with him shes always been a wise woman find them hell kill her what its him that man is cain far away from paris in washington dc a group of four highlevel officials and a politician were also discussing cain our information is that he was in brussels not zurich ten days ago said an officer of the cia a man was killed there and the method was cains but we have a report from zurich restated an army officer from the pentagon four men were killed there including a man called chernak he is without doubt connected to cain cain used him for payments for his kills my worry is that too many recent assassinations are being blamed on cain said the third man what happened to carlos the most skilled assassin of our time we shouldnt forget him but carloss time has passed david abbott belonged to the secretive special group of five men who were responsible for the countrys relationships with foreign powers cain is the new man we must use all our informants ask for the help of all european police forces and catch him now there have been too many killings it has to stop the only politician in the room was looking confused ive been listening to you discussing an unbelievably dangerous professional assassin my question to you is who is he who is this cain the silence lasted for seconds while eyes found other eyes and saw agreement hes a professional assassin and his skills are for sale the cia man told him we can be certain of thirtyeight killings that he is responsible for and twelve to thirteen more many of them the deaths of other killers are probable for a few months recently we thought that he too had been killed but you dont know who he is the politician asked you have informants they must know something no two descriptions have been the same we do know that he holds meetings at night in dark rooms or streets he speaks english and french and vietnamese you know more the politician moved forward in his chair you know where he came from from southeast asia we believe from operation medusa the cia officer pointed at an envelope on the desk these are the medusa papers that might have information about cain medusa was a very dangerous secret operation behind the enemy lines during the vietnam war in the late s teams of people welleducated but all a little crazy and often even criminal destroyed enemy communications looked for prisoners and even assassinated village leaders who were working with the communists most of them were killed but some stole a lot of money from medusa cains codes and method of killing make us think that cain is one of the men who worked for the united states on operation medusa in vietnam so his identity is in those papers yes but more than two hundred white males disappeared during operation medusa and we dont know which one he is we think hes american but we dont even know that cain was working in southeast asia until a year ago when for some reason he moved to europe i wonder said abbott if he was jealous of carlos in my opinion he moved to europe to show carlos that he was better than him if thats true we should find cain and then sit back and wait when carlos tries to kill him we can take both of them the others agreed and the meeting soon ended while they were preparing to leave abbott pulled the medusa papers toward him and looked quickly through the list of names where was it he was the only one in the room who knew the name yes it was there bourne jason c last known position tam quan chapter six messages rene bergeron threw down the telephone on his desk weve tried every cafe restaurant and bar that shes ever been to and no hotel in paris recognizes his name said the switchboard operator its been more than two hours now she cant tell him much bergeron said she knows less than we do she knows enough she has called parc monceau and she knows why tell me again why are you so sure hes bourne i dont know that i said hes cain bourne is cain we found him through the medusa papers then hes bourne but he didnt use that name in vietnam of course many men had criminal records so their identities were hidden i know its him i was on an operation that he commanded and ill never forget it tell me we went into an area called tam quan to save an american prisoner called webb on our way there two members of the team disappeared lost or killed we thought then enemy gunfire surrounded us for two days and two nights how did they know we were there at night cain went out alone to kill in the darkness so we could move closer i thought he was mad on the third night we found the man webb only just alive we also found the two missing members of our team they had been paid by the vietnamese cain shot them in the head then he got four of us and webb the others were killed out of there he was the coldest most dangerous man i ever saw everyone was his enemy even his own leaders and he didnt care about either side in the war but the pay was excellent and there were many opportunities for us to make money so he didnt use the name bourne what was his name we didnt use real names to me he was delta and then he became cain and now he wants to take carloss place all over europe people know he can be hired contracts can be made his price is lower than carloss but well find him he found us and then carlos will kill him i think we should talk about special instructions from zurich bourne told jacqueline lavier as they sat in a restaurant twenty kilometers from paris my god she cried he had to hold her hand tightly to stop her leaving the table why didnt i guess who are you my name isnt important bourne said but im not him were looking for him too who is we a company that wants its money a lot of money he has it so he didnt earn it theres a disagreement bourne said carefully but why do you want him why is the telephone number of a paris clothes store on special instructions in zurich i am saying nothing jacqueline lavier said get out of paris you made the mistake mistake he stole from us your choice was the mistake you chose the wrong man he took millions from us bourne said but youre not going to have it i want you to stay away from him all of you or well pass information to the police about zurich the bank here in paris les classiques everything and start a big manhunt we have friends in very important positions and well have the information first well catch him you wont hell disappear again hes escaped once twice but well get him now he wont escape a third time we dont want you to have him so stop your hunt tonight you cant talk to me like that who do you think you are bourne paused then attacked a group of people who dont much like your carlos the lavier womans eyes opened wide you do know she whispered and you think you can beat carlos youre mad he has men everywhere they will kill you in the street you forget bourne reminded her that no one knows who i am only you and you arent going to tell anyone madame laviers eyes showed her knowledge that she was now fighting for her life i can carry your message she said what more do you want why does carlos want bourne the woman looked shocked you can ask that hes cain you know that he was your choice your mistake cain bourne heard deafening thunder in his ears felt pain in his head the darkness was there again cain delta you insulted carlos and you are doing it again now tell me tell me everything at the end there is only my beginning i must know it but why is carlos so angry with bourne pretend that i know nothing and explain it to me you paid the wrong assassin because cain has tried to take his place carlos will follow him to the ends of the earth and kill him let him have cain and it is possible only possible that he might take your contract the one that you gave to cain he has the contacts that cain can never have information that is always correct from the highest places thats carlos bourne said trying to control himself what else do you know about cain where did he come from southeast asia of course from the american medusa medusa the darkness the sudden lights the pain delta becomes cain cain is american we have a positive identification bought in washington he has studied carloss methods and he copies them he is very skilled a machine trained for medusa before that we know nothing all records have been destroyed bourne had one final question what happened in marseilles he asked leland the contract was accepted by carlos but many people think that cain was responsible lies the final insult it was what cain wanted people to think he went there to do the job before carlos could then it was said that he had been killed taken from a city street to a fishing boat and later thrown into the water not true of course now i need to use the ladies room you can stand outside the door jacqueline lavier was in the restroom for ten minutes before the pain in bournes head allowed him to notice a light suddenly blinded him and when he could see again a woman was standing in front of him with a camera in her hands i met your girlfriend in the restroom she said with a smile she asked me to give you this note she walked quickly away you may be what you say you are but you may not the photo is on its way to paris if we have our agreement that need not worry you we will talk again he raced outside taxi taxi in the taxi bourne made a difficult decision he would continue his search for his identity but he would continue alone he loved marie too much to ask her to spend her life with an assassin he would write her a note and find a way to disappear when he reached the hotel he held her running his fingers through her dark red hair he lied to her about events at les classiques and said only that the store did seem to be an answering service and that he had arranged to meet the man at the switchboard later that night where did you leave the money he asked at the meurice hotel i took a room there lets collect it and then have some dinner as marie used the bathroom he wrote a quick note go back to canada and say nothing i know where to find you he put the note on the table as they left the room i love you so much but you cannot die with me you must not i am cain they collected the leather case and then stood in the street waiting for a taxi bourne looked at marie she was staring at something in disbelief in terror without warning she screamed he looked around trying to find the reason and then he saw the newspaper stand he realized that he could not leave her now not yet the front page of the newspaper read woman hunted for zurich killings suspect believed to have stolen millions under the words was a picture of marie st jacques bourne found some coins in his pocket passed them to the newspaperseller took two papers and pulled marie away back in the hotel he poured marie a drink he heard her cry out turned quickly but was too late she had the note in her hand you were leaving my god you were leaving me not now listen to me i wont leave you now why jason why later just hold me let me hold you the minutes passed and marie became calmer why did you do it she asked to protect you ill explain but first lets talk about this he pointed to the newspapers as they read the story bourne saw the hand of carlos behind it marie was a way of reaching cain the report was in fact two stories the first part placed the canadian government employee at the scene of three murders fingerprints had it said been found and checked the second part moved away from fact to fiction millions of dollars had it was believed been stolen by the canadian woman and an american man from a secret numbered account at the gemeinschaft bank belonging to an american company called treadstone seventyone bank codes had been broken using highlyskilled computer work and detailed knowledge of swiss banking practices a bank official herr apfel had agreed that a crime had been committed but was unable to give any more information marie let her copy of the newspaper drop to the floor lies bourne said find you and carlos finds me im sorry but so much is true marie said the gemeinschaft treadstone apfel swiss bankers dont talk apfel was ordered to talk by someone very powerful why why was the bank made part of the story this isnt one story its two the second story was added to the first someone is trying to send us a message chapter seven treadstone seventyone it was a quiet street in a good area of manhattan no one would imagine that it contained one of the most secretive organizations in the united states only eight people in the country knew of its existence gordon webb now ringing the doorbell was one of them although he had never visited the house before inside he was welcomed by david abbott and introduced to elliot stevens a trusted assistant to the president what did you find out in zurich abbott asked webb when they were all seated carlos has men in washington maybe even in treadstone he found the special instructions and changed them so he had already identified bourne the accountholder as cain that information is only in the medusa papers good god there are only three copies and very few people are allowed to see them one of those people is working for carlos there was silence while the three men thought about this i saw the newspaper report about the canadian woman stevens said then also carloss work yes we couldnt stop it but shes not a killer we simply added the equally false story about the missing money he looked at abbott although that may not actually be false but why did you use a canadian citizen stevens asked coldly the canadians are already very angry about the death of one of their economists who made the mistake of asking questions about an unlisted american company and was killed for it were trying to save her life webb said bourne knows that the storys false through it were telling bourne to come home jason bourne abbott told stevens is an american spy there is no cain in the sense that carlos believes hes a trap for carlos thats who he is or was i think you should explain stevens said the president has to know three years ago we invented a man and gave him a life he was a killer who raced around southeast asia when there was a killing or an unexplained death there was cain informants were given his name it appeared in embassy reports cain was everywhere and he was bourne showed himself always with a different appearance speaking in one of a number of languages talking to serious criminals as a professional criminal hes been living this lie for three years stevens asked yes when he moved to europe he was known as the most skilled white assassin in asia there he saved four men who carlos had been contracted to kill and took responsibility for killings that carlos had done he has laughed at carlos trying to force him out into the open i dont think theres any way a nation can repay a man like bourne for the work hes done abbott paused if it is bourne what too many things have happened that make no sense to us he disappeared for six months after he tried to stop carloss contract for the killing of howard leland then he came back it was bourne at the bank the signatures were real but who is he now who is he loyal to why is he with the woman why is she with him millions of dollars have been taken men have been killed and there have been traps for other men but who for who by abbott shook his head who is the man out there in a car further down the street a european turned a switch thats all we needed to know he said quietly to himself but you didnt tell them abbott that on march jason bourne was killed by another american in tam quan he turned to the driver beside him quick he said get behind the steps to the front door the european took a long thin gun with a silencer on it and followed the driver toward the house the door opened stevens was being shown out the driver fired twice then both men ran into the building in seconds everyone in it was dead the european took all the paperwork he could find it was more than he had hoped for every code and method of communication used by the invented cain then the final job he picked up a glass and took a piece of tape from a small plastic case in his pocket he pressed the tape against the glass then slowly took it off he held the glass up to the light the fingerprints on it were clear he dropped the glass took some of the pieces and knocked others behind a curtain they would be enough twentyfour hours later four men met at a hotel in washington dc there was no time to look for a meeting place outside the city these were the living members of treadstone seventy one alexander conklin worked for the cia and like one of the two army officers general irwin crawford had been part of the medusa operation the fourth man was an old and muchadmired senator from colorado im meeting the president tonight the senator said tell me everything you can what happened webbs driver found the bodies when webb didnt return to the car crawford told him he wisely called the pentagon not the police and spoke to me personally i sent officers but told them to do nothing until i arrived i then called conklin and we flew to new york with an fbi team the place was completely clean except for a fingerprint on a piece of broken glass deltas said the senator yes and the glass was still wet with wine also outside this room deltas the only person who knows about the house its unbelievable the senator shook his head why you know that he was never my choice the general said in medusa delta frequently disobeyed orders he was usually right said conklin angrily you spent too much time in saigon to know what was happening on operations im just trying to show how his behavior could lead to the events on seventyfirst street im sorry the cia man said i know you are delta changed after his wife and children were killed in phnom penh its why he went into medusa and then was willing to become cain he hated that war hated everyone in it and i think youre right crawford its happened again he went beyond his limits and became filled with hate look at the way he killed those men in treadstone we invented a man called cain and now he is cain so why did he come back here the senator asked i dont know conklin answered to kill us all does he know who the rest of us are his only contact with us was abbott but i think weve become the enemy and he knew webb of course said crawford but not through treadstone yes we shouldnt forget that he even killed his own brother well send his picture out now to every contact every informant we have hell spend money hell buy another identity well find him then we have no choice we have to kill him they left the hotel quickly but not quickly enough bourne saw the look of recognition on the receptionists face as he paid the bill the mans eyes were on marie as they ran for a taxi he was reaching for the telephone pretending to be american tourists they asked the taxi driver to suggest a number of small hotels outside paris he drove them to one and they immediately took a different taxi to another by this time marie had changed her hairstyle and her makeup so who do you think is sending us a message bourne asked when they were in their room i think they expect me to call the canadian embassy for their protection dennis corbelier no bourne said youre wrong it was sent by carlos i am cain and you must leave me he saw the fear in her eyes all right he agreed but do it my way he called the reception desk and asked for another room in the name of briggs for friends who would arrive later then he took some of his clothes and hers and arranged that room before he allowed her to call she told corbelier that she was innocent of the killings that she needed help that he was with her and that they were using the name briggs corbelier promised to send a car at two in the morning they were standing outside their room in the darkness listening waiting when the two men came the men walked softly to mr and mrs briggss room shot out the door lock with a silenced gun and ran inside more shooting followed before a light went on then cries of anger when they had run out again bourne led marie to the room and showed her what had been done to it especially the bullet holes in the bedclothes theres your message bourne said as she cried in his arms and now i think you should listen to me but marie had had another thought and was quickly on the phone calling the embassy as she feared dennis corbelier had been shot in the throat at that morning on the embassy steps ill listen to you jason marie told him a message was sent but not to us not to me only to you for francs the receptionist was more than happy to lend his car the guests were he agreed unlikely to find a taxi so early in the morning soon after that bourne and marie were sitting in the small renault in the middle of the countryside three weeks before in switzerland bourne had started his story with the words my life began five months ago on a small island in the mediterranean this time he began im known as cain he told it all names cities dates assassinations medusa we were wrong maybe marie said but also right if that man existed youre not him now can you walk away from it yes bourne said but alone im wanted by governments and by the police men in washington want to kill me because of what they think i know an assassin wants to shoot me in the throat because of what ive done to him in the end one of those armies will find me trap me kill me do you want to be there no shouted marie but dont forget ill die in a swiss prison for things that i didnt do in zurich i can stop that i could give myself to the police and take responsibility im not sure how yet but i will stop it you see mane said softly is that what cain would do thank you for your offer but i dont accept she was quiet for a minute jason these two sides of you is it possible that those crimes were committed but they werent yours that people want you to believe theyre yours do you know how easy it is to make someone believe that theyre someone else through words and pictures repeated again and again your memories could be false memories its possible that youve been used bourne stared at her and if youre wrong then leave me or kill me i dont care i love you i found two telephone numbers in laviers office with luck they can lead me to the number i need to treadstone if im not cain someone at that number knows who i am back in paris marie called the zurich number first disconnected from another phone she called the local number la residence du general villiers bonjour marie stared at the phone then put it down ive just reached the home of one of the most admired and powerful men in france chapter eight at home with the general villiers is a hero here marie said when they were back in their hotel room its unbelievable to connect him with carlos but there is a connection is he still an army officer no he went into politics but he continues to argue for a strong france with a strong army leland was assassinated because he tried to stop france buying and selling guns theres the connection but his son was killed assassinated marie remembered he was a politician too and very popular surely his father wouldnt work with an assassin im going to talk to him bourne said if he doesnt know about treadstone he can find out ill tell him that the newspapers would be very interested in his relationship with carlos a few hours later bourne was sitting in the renault on a treelined street in the area of parc monceau when the old general came into view leaving the house bourne stared at him what madness had driven a powerful man like him into the terrible world of carlos as villiers drove away bourne followed him after several hours in a country restaurant with other men of a similar age all clearly army officers villiers left to drive home now was his opportunity bourne passed the general in the darkness then turned suddenly and blocked the road he opened his window and gave a cry he heard the old man climb out of his car and walk toward him what has happened are you all right the general asked yes but youre not bourne answered holding up his gun go back to your car and drive it off the road what the old man stood up straighten who are you you will get nothing from me and my family have orders not to pay terrorists use your gun garbage or get out of here bourne stared at the old soldier suddenly uncertain no ones ever doubted your bravery he said but a general of france has become carloss tool the anger in villierss eyes was joined not by shock as bourne expected but by hate his hand shot up and hit bourne across the face hard pig dirty pig villiers screamed garbage ill shoot bourne shouted but he could not he threw his gun out of the window and caught villierss arm are you telling me youre not carloss man yes or no tears appeared in the old mans eyes carlos killed my son he said quietly that is why i left the army and went into politics they were soon sitting together in the front of villierss car im being hunted by carlos and ive discovered that your home telephone is being used bourne explained someone is receiving and passing instructions do you answer the phone yourself actually i dont the general was calmer now but still shocked i have a private line that number is answered by my cook or my driver by my assistant or my wife youd better look closely at your employees impossible i do not doubt their loyalty he looked away an unnamed man traps me on a road at night points a gun at me says terrible things about me and expects me to believe everything he says he paused then turned to bourne and i do believe you only because the anger in your eyes was real and because you threw down your gun follow me back to parc monceau and we will talk more in my office if someone recognizes me im dead and you are too its late wait outside and i will call you if the house is quiet an hour later bourne parked the renault in villierss street and looked across to the house the old man was parked in front of him bourne noticed a light in the doorway and then a figure on the step recognition followed but a recognition that was beyond belief was this a trap had the old man lied he looked around but could see nothing else that was suspicious no it was not a trap something was happening that villiers knew nothing about two people were talking on the step a youngish woman and a grayhaired man the switchboard operator from les classiques a face that brought back other memories violent and painful he heard explosions in his head saw darkness and had to look away when he looked again the grayhaired man was walking down the street and the front door had closed bourne went quietly to the generals car and knocked on the window who was that woman on the step he asked my wife said the general in surprise my second wife your wife bournes shock was on his face im sorry he whispered general i cant go inside that house the man with your wife hes one of carloss contacts the blood left villierss face they drove to a park in another part of town the old soldier knew that the younger man was not lying it was in his eyes in his voice the old man wanted to cry the man without a memory told him that he had to find carlos learn what the assassin knew there would be no life for him if he did not he said nothing about marie st jacques or the island in the mediterranean or a message sent through a newspaper report or a hollow shell who could not be sure that his few memories were really his own instead he told villiers everything he knew about carlos while the general looked at him in surprise because of his son the old man had seen the french governments secret papers on carlos and this stranger knew much much more my wife and i are often in different places villiers explained in many ways we live separate lives but i have

arretez marie said sharply there was a silence then thank you my friend you have reminded an old man of who he was and must be again it was dark when bourne reached the apartment of pierre trignon les classiquess accountant im from the tax office bourne said i must instruct you not to leave paris my office will take your books when the store opens tomorrow what trignon was shocked there is nothing wrong with my books nothing what are you looking for payments that were paid to companies that dont exist and that were sent to a bank in zurich but every payment is signed by madame lavier i just follow her orders so who does she take orders from whose money was put into les classiques i dont know madame lavier has many rich friends then its possible that you and madame lavier are being used bourne said money is going from the store to the zurich account of an assassin called carlos trignon screamed you should talk to madame lavier and start preparing your defense bourne left get carlos trap carlos find treadstone find the meaning of a message find the sender find jason bourne when he returned to the hotel he learned from marie that the calls to parc monceau had stopped and that a woman matching jacqueline laviers description had arrived at villierss house to speak to his wife a gray citroen was parked outside bourne raced out of the hotel again to parc monceau there was no sign of the citroen but villiers was standing on the doorstep they left five minutes ago in a taxi the general said my wife said that her friend wanted to see a priest at a church in neuillysurseine two men followed them in the citroen bourne ran for a taxi and made his way to the church arriving as villierss wife and jacqueline lavier were walking up the path the citroen was parked but neither man got out bourne left his taxi and watched from across the street minutes later villierss wife hurried out of the church carrying a white bag and climbed into the back seat of the citroen which drove away a white bag jacqueline laviers bag bourne started to move toward the church then stopped a trap if lavier was followed he might be too he looked around but saw nothing suspicious so continued toward the church he stopped a priest was coming out bourne had seen him before not in a forgotten past but recently not as a priest but as a man with a gun who where as the killer turned right the sun touched his face bourne froze his skin was dark dark by birth he was looking at ilich ramirez sanchez carlos bourne took his gun from his pocket and ran toward him pushing people out of the way knocking against an old man from his dirty clothes the old man pulled a gun bourne threw himself into the street over a car as shots hit metal on each side of him as screams came from people on the sidewalk he raced through the traffic to the other side of the street the old man disappeared into the crowd where was he where was carlos bourne saw him at the wheel of a large black car he ran but was too late carlos sped away lavier now bourne ran back to the church and then inside he looked around but could not see her excuse me father he said to another priest who was coming from a side room two women came in a few minutes ago did you see them yes the younger woman helped the older one who looked pale and sad into that confession booth he pointed a visiting priest is taking confessions today although i thought i saw him leave thank you father ill wait for her bourne waited until the priest had gone to the door of the church to see why ambulances were arriving outside then he went to the confession booth and pulled back the curtain as he expected jacqueline lavier was dead beside her was a fashionable bag not hers and in it was a note explaining why the poor unhappy woman had decided to end her life she asked for gods forgiveness he understood why carlos had killed her not for disloyalty but for disobedience her crime was her visit to parc monceau bourne decided that his next conversation should be with another messenger and a man he was sure from his past les classiquess switchboard operator marie had learned that his name was philippe danjou he found a payphone danjou delta i wondered when paris is not tam quan delta we work for different employers now delta the name had been spoken the name that meant nothing to him but also everything jacqueline lavier is dead bourne said carlos killed her half an hour ago shes on a plane danjou replied with bergeron shes dead and youre next would she kill herself no call the church in neuillysurseine bourne ended the call and took a taxi to a different payphone danjou so a woman killed herself who says it is really her its her i want to talk no talking delta but in memory of tam quan leave she went to parc monceau and she died for it youve been there too hell use you to trap me and then hell kill you there was a long silence i only want information and then ill leave paris ill see you in an hour outside the louvre there are men watching you tell them youre meeting me youre mad theyll kill you then youll be well paid an hour danjou before he left the payphone near les classiques bourne noted the men in a black car who were clearly watching danjou when danjou left the store his behavior showed that he knew they were there a taxi arrived and the black car followed bourne followed in another taxi when he arrived at the louvre he saw the gray car that had followed lavier and villierss wife to the church drive past that car three hundred francs he ordered when they were beside it he lifted his gun and fired at the back window there were screams and the men threw themselves to the floor they had seen him though as he had planned get out of here bourne shouted at the terrified driver and as the taxi raced past the gates to the louvre he threw himself out he hid between two parked cars and watched the gray car following the speeding taxi the black car he saw two men leaving the car and walking toward philippe danjou who was standing on the steps he ran until they were only a few meters from danjou medusa he shouted danjous head came up in shock the driver of the car turned his gun on bourne while the other mans was pointing at danjou bourne dived to one side and fired at the second man hitting him he moved to the left as shots passed him and fired again the driver screamed by this time men women and children were running in all directions bourne stood up danjou was hiding behind a great block of stone and bourne ran to him delta it was carloss man he was going to kill me i know lets go quickly then he noticed out of the corner of his eye another darkskinned figure with a gun he pushed danjou down as four shots flew past them it was him the pain returned to his head the doors of his mind crashed open then shut as he ran after the man then dived again as the man fired then carlos raced away minutes later bourne and danjou sat in a back street cafe i shall return to asia d anjou said i cant stay here tell me about villierss wife bourne said angelique she is thought to be french but she is venezuelan she is carloss cousin and his lover probably the only other person that he cares about villiers of course knows nothing now treadstone what do you know when i saw you delta it seemed clear that you had made a very expensive agreement with the americans but what can i tell you please just tell me what you what carlos knows you became cain with a list of contracts that never existed to make carlos angry bring him out and catch him treadstone seventyone is the american governments most secretive group formed by david abbott the same man who planned medusa light and warmth were spreading into the dark corners of bournes mind i was told you were an american spy but i knew you werent and that money wasnt the reason either you are cain for the same reason that you became delta whatever that is anything else asked bourne urgently two things first the americans think you are not working for them now or they want carlos to think that the silence the message they wanted him to return second they know of course that your name isnt jason bourne what march is two days away carlos wants your corpse on that day the day you killed jason bourne at tam quan chapter ten friends or enemies she opened the door to him and her large brown eyes moved around his face afraid but questioning she knew not the answer but that there was an answer you were right he whispered im not cain because there is no cain he was invented to trap carlos im that invention delta a man from medusa agreed to become a lie called cain but why there was a reason but danjou didnt know bourne told her everything that had happened and what danjou had said as he spoke he could see the happiness in her eyes jason she cried its everything we felt not quite he said im jason to you bourne to me because i know no other name but its not mine they say i killed him in a place called tam quan im sure there was a reason and its years ago now you must reach the men at treadstone because theyre trying to find you danjou said that they think im not working for them now what can i say to them will they believe that i lost my memory contact washburn hell have records of your illness hes a drunk with a million dollars to spend even if he talks to them how can the men at treadstone be sure but bourne had no choice he called the american embassy identified himself as delta and asked them to contact treadstone five hours later he had followed instructions to call every hour but to stay away from the embassy and he was becoming confused they want me but theyre afraid of me he said to marie it doesnt make sense when im inside the embassy gates theyll control me instead they dont want to touch me but they dont want to lose me either lets get out of here when he called again from another part of town bourne was told that a treadstone officer had arrived from the us and would meet him at a graveyard the cimetiere de noblesse south of paris bourne ended the call and stared at the phone another door was opening in his mind he could see a gentle hill and white crosses it was a place for the dead but also for conversations he saw a face and then remembered a name david abbott the man who was responsible for medusa and for cain he shook his head theyve chosen a graveyard he told marie ive been there before so i know the treadstone mans real if i dont come back call villiers hes the only person we can trust he decided to take the renault which had been parked in an underground car park for some time now as he walked in he noticed a man drop down behind a car the man didnt reappear who was he how had bourne been found of course carlos had found the receptionist who had lent them his car bourne quickly lowered himself between two cars and moved on his hands and knees to a position behind the man the man stood up slowly and looked around confused then realizing that there was a trap he ran now bourne jumped up and ran after him knocking him to the floor then he pushed his fingers into the mans eyes you have five seconds to tell me whos outside a man one man in a car youre carloss man arent you i dont know a carlos we call a number i already called it bourne pushed him to the renault and into the drivers seat the man drove him outside to the other car bourne pointed his gun at the second man and ordered him into the renault too ten kilometers outside paris he let them out of the car in the middle of the countryside but not before he had memorized the number that they had called darkness came and he was walking through the graves where inside this wide fenced area would he be where did he expect bourne to be rain fell and a memory came to him of other heavier rain a brown envelope changing hands he suddenly noticed a faint light moving from side to side among the graves he wanted to call out but he did not shout and he did not run there was something strange about the movement of the light was the holder communicating with another man he was someone was hiding behind a gravestone and the light had caught the end of a gun bourne ran up behind him seized the gun with one hand and pulled the mans head back with the other until it hit the gravestone and he fell unconscious bourne searched the man he was not a government employee this was a hired killer then bourne ran around the graveyard and walked calmly toward the man from treadstone from a different direction my names conklin the man said in case youve forgotten one of many things bourne said i lost my memory and spent five months on a small island a doctor there kept records of course he did you paid him enough we followed the money from zurich our money i told you i didnt know amnesia but you found the money and a woman to help you move it you killed chernak and three other men and then you went to new york and shot them all abbott stevens and gordon webb we found your fingerprints my god your own brother what pain shot through bournes head fire explosions darkness when he opened his eyes conklin was pointing a gun at him i promised myself id give you two minutes to explain yourself the cia man said we all lose people it comes with the job but who gave you the right to turn your gun against us youre wrong it was carlos not me carlos they know about the building on seventyfirst street only eight people knew that address before last week three of them are dead and were two of the other five if carlos found it you told him conklins hand started to close on the gun no screamed bourne and he turned quickly and brought his foot up to conklins arm as conklin fell to the ground bourne saw another shadow appear behind a grave he fired twice and the shadow fell conklin was moving toward his gun bourne pointed his but could not fire he walked quickly away he returned to paris it was a trap he told marie im going to phone villiers his wife is our only hope we have to make her talk he picked up the phone and called general we need to speak to your wife i dont think so mr bourne yes i know your name now my wife told me i am afraid it wont be possible to speak to her she saw the anger in my eyes she saw that i knew we talked and then she took my gun from beside the bed i had emptied it of course so i put my hands around her throat and killed her now i will call the police and confess then i shall end my own life no shouted bourne you need carlos he killed your son and i need him because without him im dead listen to me villiers dont throw your life away you didnt kill your wife you must say that i did there was silence on the other end of the line your wife was carloss cousin and his lover you cant punish her any more but you can use her death vous etes soldat arretez villiers said his voice shaking someone reminded me recently that i am a soldier what do you want me to do im going to send a note to carlos to make him even angrier then can you get me out of the country to new york with a false identity i have a passport in the name of george washburn on the plane ill write down everything thats happened that i know ill send it to you and you can make the decisions if i dont return and please protect marie i will why new york i have to prove that carlos knew about a place where men were killed hell think ive killed his lover and hell follow me to the end of the earth if necessary the man and the invention were finally one there was no other way he had to get carlos chapter eleven rebirth at in the morning the taxi moved slowly along seventyfirst street bourne recognized everything he thought of andre villiers bourne had written down everything that he could remember since his memory had begun to return and had mailed the pages to parc monceau the information would be used wisely and that knowledge gave him freedom by the time it reached paris he or carlos would be dead there was the house and he had the feeling of return he remembered a dark room questions endless questions who is he quickly youre too late wheres this street who did you meet which of these killing methods do you use no delta might do that but not cain you are only what you have become here he had written to carlos that he was coming back here for the hidden documents that were his final protection now he understood what he had meant his identity was inside that house whether carlos came after him or not he had to find it a moving van had stopped outside the house men climbed out and the front door was open the house was being cleared he had to reach conklin the men had to stop their work the assassin would come at night the taxi driver spoke and bourne bent forward to listen as he did a bullet raced past his ear and shot the driver in the head bourne jumped out and fell to the ground carlos was here at the doors of treadstone he had brought him back he ran to a cafe asked for the phone and called the cia he was told that conklin was away he was not expected back until the end of the week the us secretary of state was a very angry man he demanded from general crawford an explanation of a long phone call from the american embassy in paris a canadian woman had arrived at the embassy talking about bourne delta medusa cain carlos and treadstone about american lies to foreign governments and european newspapers without the knowledge of the department of state she said that a friend who was an important man in french politics had suggested that this was the only way to save bournes life ive listened to the tape of her story ten times and i believe her hes an amnesiac the secretary explained to crawford angrily a man who has tried for six months to find out who he is we know he tried to tell you and now hes bringing carlos to us unless you kill him first crawford was silent could it be true then the womans our only hope he said finally we know cains skilled at changing his appearance but she may recognize him i know where the action will happen and it will be today fortunately for you the womans already here we flew her over but where and why today at treadstone he wouldnt go anywhere else and today because its the date of his own death when crawford and marie arrived in seventyfirst street they found that conklin was already there marie sat in a government car a little way away from the treadstone house while the men went into a neighboring property shes lying conklin said in the face of crawfords anger youre wrong and you know it hes here and that proves it maybe maybe conklin closed his eyes but its too late i hired gunmen to kill cain and i cant stop them christ crawford shouted at least send that moving company away ive tried i didnt bring it here he picked up the phone who signed the papers for removals at seventyfirst street his face went white and he turned back to crawford a man who left his job two weeks ago in the street below marie watched without recognition as a man in old clothes carrying blankets walked toward the house i was told you needed more help bourne said to two moving men who were carrying boxes to the van ive brought blankets start at the top with the other new men he was told bourne climbed to the second floor which room memories returned oh god it hurt he opened the door darkness but not complete a slight noise he turned terrified at the tricks being played in his mind but it was not a trick he saw the knife the hand the skin the dark eyes carlos he moved his head back as the knife cut his chin his foot caught his attacker in the knee again the knife came toward him but bourne blocked the arm and pushed it up the knife fell to the floor and bourne reached for his gun the metal toe of a shoe made contact with his head he crashed into a wall seizing his attackers hand and breaking carloss wrist as he fell a scream filled the room and then a bullet hit bourne high in the chest he jumped at the killer as more shots went wild then he heard the door crash shut and footsteps running to the hall shots passed both ways through the door and then the footsteps ran downstairs shouts and more gunfire carlos had organized the moving van some of the men in the house were his but the assassin was killing the real moving men in the distance bourne could hear the sound of the van speeding away the front door was locked he was losing too much blood but he knew that carlos was also wounded jason bourne had died once on this day he would die again but take carlos with him he went slowly down the stairs to the room where cain was born now he pushed open the door and fired gunshots were returned the face he knew it he had seen it before it was known to many he was sure but from where a bullet hit him in the arm then the shots stopped and he could hear the sound of other men outside the door the breaking of wood and metal the men running into the building hes in here screamed carlos why was the assassin calling attention to himself but it had worked the men were running past him carlos was escaping bourne fell to the floor carlos he cried he heard commands then a man was walking toward him a man who had tried to kill him in a paris graveyard you think youll kill me you wont bourne said angrily you dont understand the voice was shaking its conklin delta a voice said i was wrong he felt explosions in his head again darkness and then a clear memory tam quart they had arrived the prisoner was moving he was alive but a man was walking toward him with a gun this man had trained with them studied maps with them flown with them and told the enemy where to find them it was bourne jason bourne delta fired at him more darkness waves were carrying him into the night sky then throwing him down again he was entering endless weightless memory and then he heard the words spoken from the clouds filling the earth jason my love take my hand hold it jason peace came with unconsciousness what made you realize that he was in treadstone general crawford asked marie i didnt recognize him at first but later it came to me the man with the blankets it was the way he held his head to the right but its been almost two weeks now marie said impatiently tell me jason who is he his name is david webb crawford told her until five years ago he was a foreign services officer his wife was thai and they had two children one day while they were living in phnompenh a plane dropped two bombs on the area around his home and killed his family oh god said marie quietly whose plane was it it was never identified webb went to saigon and trained for operation medusa he became delta and he was very dangerous the north vietnamese couldnt kill him so they caught his brother gordon and held him danjou was one of the men who went with webb to free him two of the others were in the pay of the north vietnamese one was bourne and webb killed him years later when treadstone was formed webb took his name what was he doing when he was called to treadstone teaching in a small american college leading a quiet life those are the most important facts but theres one more detail that must be understood he will now be protected twentyfour hours a day wherever he goes whatever identity he takes hes the only person alive who has seen carlos as carlos he knows who he is a public figure but carloss identity is locked away in his mind one day he may remember marie went to the window and looked out he was sitting quietly on the beach facing away from the armed guards the time here in the little house on the waterfront had been good to him his body was whole again and his dreams were less terrifying suddenly he jumped up and ran toward the house marie froze was the madness returning he rushed through the door stared at her and then spoke so softly that she could hardly hear him but she did hear him my name is david the end
