resnick exploits the master detective they say that there are a lot of differences between hong kong and some of the african cities i had recently left behind different people different cultures different buildings even different food of course there are a lot of similarities too same lack of consideration for those who are bold enough to tinker with the laws of statistical probability same steel bars in the local jail same concrete walls and floors same uncomfortable cots same awful food truth to tell id had a lot more time to consider the similarities than the differences id gotten right off the boat from portugese east africa checked into the luk kwok hotel which thoughtfully rented its rooms by the hour the night or the week spent the next hour in a local restaurant trying to down a bowl of soup with a pair of chopsticks and then realizing that my funds needed replenishing i got involved in a friendly little game of chance involving two cubes of ivory with spots painted on them it was when a third cube slipped out of my sleeve that i was invited to inspect the premises of the local jail that had been five days ago and i had spent the intervening time alternately trying not to mind the smell of dead fish which is what all of hong king smelled like back in and gaining some comfort by reading my wellworn copy of the good book which i aint never without the girl that brought my grub to me was a charming little thing named mei sung she was right impressed to be serving a man of the cloth which i was back in those days and i converted the bejabbers out of her three or four times a day which made my incarceration in durance vile a mite easier to take as time crawled by i got to know my fellow inmates there was a turkish dentist who had gassed a british officer to death in what he assured me was an accident and would certainly have been construed as such by the courts if he hadnt appropriated the officers wallet and wristwatch before reporting the poor fellows untimely demise there was a young brazilian student who sweated up a storm and kept screaming things about anarchy and tyrants and such and keeping everyone awake there were two chinamen dressed all in black who kept glaring at me every time i finished converting mei sung there was a frenchman who kept saying he was glad he had killed the chef and that anyone who ruined sole almondine that badly deserved to die and there was me the right reverend honorable doctor lucifer jones out of moline illinois by way of the dark continent where id done my best to illuminate the dark dreary lives of the godless black heathen despite certain minor disagreements with the constabularies of fourteen countries which culminated in my being asked to establish the tabernacle of saint luke on some other land mass but i already wrote that story and i aint going to go into it again since anyone whos read it knows that im a righteous and godfearing man who was just misunderstood on the fifth day of the thirty that i was to serve they gave me a roommate a welldressed australian with expensivelooking rings on all his fingers his name was rupert cornwall and he explained that he had come to hong kong because australia was a pretty empty country and he liked crowds and what do you do for a living brother rupert i asked him by way of being polite im an entrepreneur he said i put opportunists together with opportunities and take a little percentage for my trouble i didnt know being an entrepreneur was a criminal offense in hong king i said i was arrested by mistake he answered you too absolutely he said i expect to be out of here within the hour and what about yourself you look like a man of god with that turnedaround collar of yours you hit the nail right on the head brother rupert thats what i am a man of god here to bring comfort and spiritual uplifting to the heathen what religion do you belong to he asked one me and the lord worked out betwixt ourselves one sunday afternoon back in illinois i said hell the way i see it as long as were upright and holy and got a poorbox whats the difference he broke out into a great big smile i like you dr jones he said wheres your church located well i aint quite got around to building my tabernacle yet brother rupert but im taking donations for it if the spirits come upon you and youre so inclined i dont have any money with me he answered but look me up after were both out of here and i might have some work for you work wasnt exactly what i had in mind i said distastefully when you hear what i have to offer you might change your mind he said yeah he nodded i could use a man of the cloth in my operation i think we could enter into a mutually profitable relationship you dont say i replied well i suppose i could always take a brief fling at the entrepreneur business before i erect my tabernacle god being the patient and understanding soul that he is he reached into his vest pocket and handed me his card thats my business address remember to call on me well i could tell we were hitting it off right fine and i was going to ask him more about our pending partnership but just then a guard came by and unlocked the door they made your bail again rupert he said in a bored voice was there every any doubt asked rupert smugly you get arrested by mistake a lot i asked as he was leaving alomst daily he said personally i think theyre just jealous of my success then he was gone and i was left with my thoughts until mei sung came by for another conversion which left me so exhausted that i thought i might grab a quick forty winks i had snored my way through about twenty of em when the door opened again and the guard gestured me to follow him did somebody make my bail too i asked thinking of rupert cornwall he just chuckled and kept leading me down one corridor after another until we finally came to a little cubbyhole which was filled with a desk two chairs and a pudgy chinaman with a natty little mustache and goatee he was dressed in a white linen suit and hadnt bothered to take his panama hat off even though we were inside sit please he said smiling at me i sat myself down in the empty chair while he nodded at the guard who left the room you are mr jones said the chinaman doctor lucifer jones at your service i said that what we must talk about he said in pigeon english about whether im lucifer jones i asked puzzled about whether you are at my service he said because if not then you go back to cell for more days are you the guy who made my bail i asked no one make your bail he said please sit back and relax doctor jones i am inspector willie wong of hong kong police force perhaps you have heard of me cant say that i have brother wong i answered he looked right disappointed at that why are you wasting your time with me anyway i continued you ought to be trying to find the ungodly sinner that stuck that extra die up my sleeve that no concern of mine he said holding up a hand but am prepared to make deal dr jones you help me i help you yeah he nodded man in your cell named rupert cornwall what about him rupert cornwall biggest gangster in hong kong then why did you let him go beauty is in eye of beholder said wong i beg your pardon old chinese proverb perhaps it not translate very well he paused let rupert cornwall go for lack of evidence what has all this got to do with me i asked patience doctor jones said wong penny saved is penny earned another proverb he nodded very wise of you to notice you are man we need need for what brother wong i asked need gobetween rupert cornwall trust you you will meet with him learn about operation report back to me then when time is right we strike how long you figure thisll take he shrugged maybe week maybe month who know too many chefs spoil the soup i dont know brother wong i said after all i only got days left to serve he broke out into a great big grin you not acquainted with chinese calendar i take it how long is days on a chinese calendar i asked he shrugged again maybe week maybe month who know he looked across the desk at me we have deal i sighed we have a deal good knew i could count on man of cloth how do i report to you i asked he know what i look like so you will report to me through sons i dont know how to break this unhappy tiding to you brother wong i said but i aint got no sons i have he replied distastefully all currently unemployed and available to work for honorable father i repeated i dont envy your missus none have missuses he answered currently suing for back alimony thats why move here from honolulu my heart bleeds for you brother wong i said with as much sincerity as i could muster on the spur of the moment whenever i become depressed over situation i just remember old chinese proverb watched pot never boil he got to his feet and walked around the desk to stand in front of me i think for this case we use number nine and number twentysix sons what are their names just told you nine and twentysix ran out of names after number five son was born what do you call your daughters a through z wong threw back his head and laughed you fine fellow doctor jones wonderful sense of humor sincerely hope rupert cornwall not cut your tongue out before case is over uh lets just pause a second for serious reflection brother wong i said old rupert wouldnt really cut my tongue out would he no not really said wong thats better would have one of his hired killers do it for him you know i said upon further consideration i think the lord would want me to serve out my full sentence after all i was caught fair and square and somehow this seems unfair to the just and honorable man who sentenced me whatever you say doctor jones said wong he went back around the desk opened the drawer and pulled out a sheet of paper that was subdivided into hundreds of little squares this help you pass the time what is it i asked he smiled calendar of chinese week he tossed me a pencil you can mark off each day with this will bring new one when you run out of lead which is how i became an operative in the employ of the hong kong police youd think that the biggest gangster in hong kong would operate out of one of them beautiful old palaces that overlook the ocean or failing that hed set up headquarters in a penthouse suite in some luxury hotel so you can imagine my surprise when i wandered down a couple of back alleyways and found rupert cornwalls place of business to be a rundown little storefront right between a fish peddler and a shirtmaker the whole area smelled of incense and dead fish and there were lots of tall men dressed in black and wearing lean and hungry looks but i just ignored em all like the godfearing christian gentleman that i am and walked up to cornwalls door and pounded on it a couple of times a muscular guy who looked like a cross between an olympic weightlifter and a small mountain let me in and ushered me through a maze of unopened cardboard boxes to a back room where rupert cornwall sat in an easy chair smoking a havana cigar and going through the hong kong version of the daily racing form doctor jones he said my dear fellow i hadnt expected to see you again for almost a month he paused and looked around we just moved in here a few days ago i used to operate out of one of the hotels but my overhead was killing me yeah i know how expensive them luxury suites can be i agreed luxury suites nothing he corrected me it was making bail two and three times a day ah well youre here and thats all that matters suddenly his eyes narrowed just how exactly did you get here so soon im a fast walker brother rupert i answered i thought you were incarcerated for days i shrugged time flies when youre having fun i guess id been there longer than i thought yes i saw little mei sung he said with a grin well are you prepared to discuss the details of our first business venture thats what im here for brother rupert i said fine he said i want you to know up front that i am an honest businessman who would never dream of harming another soul dr jones i could tell that right off i said i seek no commendation for my work he continued im in the import export business hardly a noteworthy or romantic occupation i pay my bills on time i treat my help well i have virtually no social life i avoid the spotlight at all costs in point of fact i am a laissezfaire capitalist of the highest order and yet there is a local official who has harassed me threatened me tried to drive me out of business and caused me a considerable loss of revenue no i said shocked yes dr jones he replied i have borne his enmity silently up to now but he has become an intolerable nuisance and it is my intention to so embarrass him that he is forced to resign from his position if not leave hong kong alltogether what does this have to do with me brother rupert i asked i cannot procede with my plan alone for your complicity in ridding me of this vile and obdurate man i am willing to pay you the sum of one thousand british pounds sterling what do you say to that thats a right tidy sum i allowed just who is this here villain that we plan to put out of commission a man named wong would that be inspector willie wong of the hong kong police i suggested the very same how is it that you come to know his name dr jones oh they bandy it around a lot down at the jail i said have you any compunctions in helping me rid decent society of this man not a one i said why did you know that every single man he arrested swore that he was innocent we certainly cant have a man like that riding roughshod over the people of this fair city he broke out into a great big smile i believe we understand each other perfectly doctor jones i knew i had selected the right man how do we plan to deal with this menace to social stability and free enterprise i asked willie wongs reputation rests on the fact that he has never made a mistake never arrested an innocent man never let a guilty one get away said cornwall puffing on his cigar if we can publicly embarrass and humiliate him i believe his honor will demand that he retire from public service and just how do we aim to do that i have it on good authority that the empire emerald the largest gemstone in all of china will be stolen from the fung ping shan museum tomorrow night he said leaning forward in his chair i will arrange that every clue points toward you and knowing wong he will almost certainly bring you into custody within hours of the robbery it will then be revealed that he has wrongly arrested a man of god and that furthermore the emerald was stolen by one of his own sons he leaned back with a satisfied smile what do you think of that i think i want five hundred pounds up front and the name of a good bondsman just in case something goes wrong i said certainly my dear doctor jones he pulled out a wallet thick enough to choke a small elephant and peeled off five one hundredpound notes which he then handed over to me i distrust a man who doesnt look out for his own interest okay i said stuffing the money into my pocket what else do i have to know or do very little he said spend an hour browsing at the museum late tomorrow afternoon perhaps get into a slight altercation with one of the tourists so people will remember seeing you there keep off the streets between midnight and two oclock in the morning and put this in a safe place with that he handed me a small cloth bag that was closed with a drawstring whats in it i asked take a look i opened it up and found a lump of coal about the size of a golf ball that doctor jones will prove to be the undoing of willie wong hide it well but not so well that a thorough search cannot turn it up while you are spending the night in jail and his men are ransacking your room my own operatives will plant the real emerald on one of his brats an emerald this big is an awful high price to pay to get rid of one bothersome policeman i said he costs me more than that every week said cornwall it will be money well spent well considering that it aint yours to begin with i reckon i can see the logic in that i agreed and now doctor jones it is best that we part company i dont want anyone to know that weve been in contact since my release from jail he stood up and walked me to the door your remaining five hundred pounds will be delivered in an envelope to your hotel the morning after your arrest and you will be contacted later in the week concerning our next venture sounds good to me brother rupert i said shaking his hand its always nice to do business with a christian gentleman like yourself weve lots more business to do when this sordid little affair is over he said with a twinkle in his eye i kind of doubted it since he never asked me what hotel he was supposed to deliver my money to but with five hundred pounds in my pocket and willie wong on my side i decided that things were definitely looking up for the tabernacle of saint luke i had walked maybe half a mile from cornwalls office when i saw two young chinamen staring at me from a street corner so i strolled over to them nine i said to the bigger one there was no response twentysix i said make it thirty and youve got yourself a date he said with a giggle doctor jones yelled a young man from across the street were over here i turned and saw two more chinamen and made a beeline toward them are you willie wongs kids i asked the older one nodded weve got orders to take you to dad lead the way i said i followed them a couple of blocks to a dimlylit restaurant they left me at the door and as i entered it i saw wong nod to me from a table in the back you visit with mr rupert cornwall yes he said gesturing me to sit down yeah he doesnt like you much stitch in time save nine you ever consider writing a chinese proverb book i asked him please continue he said slurping his soup near as i can make out he plans to steal the empire emerald around midnight tomorrow ah so not only that i added but he plans to make it look like i stole it and while youre busy arresting me hes going to plant it on one of your sons very interesting he said with no show of interest whatsoever well thats it im done now right i said i mean youll be waiting for him at the museum and i can go off converting all you godless yellow heathen no offense intended and maybe build my tabernacle not that easy said wong why not i demanded cannot make omelet without breaking eggs what the hell is that supposed to mean so sorry he said wrong proverb he paused and tried again beauty only skin deep well that explains everything i said cannot capture mr rupert cornwall at museum where emerald reside continued wong as he finished his soup i already told you what time hes going to show up he will not steal emerald he will have underling do so i do not want little fish while big fish lead horse to water but cannot make him drink so what do you plan to do mr rupert cornwall expect me to arrest you i will not disappoint him that may not disappoint him i said but itll disappoint the hell out of me he shook his head just go through motions then catch him when he try to plant emerald on honorable son what if he has a henchman do that too i asked almost certainly will after all home is where heart is i dont think you understand me brother wong i said whats the difference if you catch a henchman stealing the emerald or you catch one planting it on your kid much easier to trace emerald back to mr rupert cornwall after he has stolen it than before explained wong and what happens to me i asked we arrest you with much fanfare in afternoon release you when we apprehend henchman that night then a particularly bothersome thought occurred to me what if he changes his mind and decides to keep the emerald then you have lied to me i take full credit for capturing you city give another medal to humble detective and i apprehend mr rupert cornwall some other day he smiled you see either way it all work out well i could see it all working out for willie wong and rupert cornwall a lot easier than it all working out for me so me and the lord decided that it was time to take matters into our own hands and what we did was this i went out shopping at a bunch of costume jewelry stores and when i finally came to a fake emerald about the size of the lump of coal i was toting around in the little cloth bag i bought it for twenty pounds and tucked it away in my pocket then i went over to bonham road and visited the fung ping shan museum a day early found the empire emerald and tried to figure out how to substitute my stone for the real one but since im a godfearing christian missionary who aint never had an illegal impulse in my life i finally had to admit that while the trip wires and the lock on the front door wouldnt give me no problems the alarm built into the case was a type i hadnt seen before and there was just no way i was going to be able to switch the emeralds without setting it off and waking up such dead as werent otherwise occupied at the time one thing i did notice though was that the guards were brits and not chinamen so i waited until they locked up the museum and followed one of them home i got his name off the mailbox and early the next morning right after hed left for work i called his wife and told her that my laundry shop had inadvertently ruined her husbands tuxedo but that we would be happy to make amends she explained that he didnt have a tuxedo and i told her i was sure it was his but just to make doubly certain i needed to know the name of the establishment she did her business with and as soon as she told me i popped over there and informed them i was a visiting relative who had been sent by to pick up any uniforms he might have left there sure enough they had one all bright and green and neatly pressed with shining brass buttons i tipped them a couple of pounds took it to the mens room in the back of a nearby tavern and slipped it on and an hour later i was patrolling the corridors of the museum nodding pleasantly to passersbye and keeping a watchful eye on the emerald then when the museum hit a slow period and the room containing the empire emerald had emptied out i walked into it with a beer in my hand set it down atop the glass case that covered the gemstone and tipped the bottle over i pulled the phony emerald out of my pocket lifted up the glass cover and as the alarm went off i quickly exchanged it for the real emerald got down on my knees pulled out a handkerchief and set about trying to clean the beer off the glass the room filled up to overflowing with guards about ten seconds later a couple of them even covered me with their pistols until they saw the emerald where it ought to be and then they helped me put the glass cover back on i explained that i was new on the job and that i was just trying to clean up after myself because i had spilled some beer and after telling me what a clumsy fool i was they told me to pack up my gear and go home that my services were no longer needed they managed to get the alarm turned off just about the time i was climbing down the museum steps to the sidewalk in front of the building i went back to my room at the luk kwok hotel where i had a little chat with my silent partner explaining to him that while what i did may have seemed a criminal act on the surface of it if he would examine the consequences carefully he would have to agree that it was for the best all the way around willie wong was still going to capture rupert cornwall so he would be happy the museum would never know they werent displaying the real empire emerald so they would be happy cornwall was going to go to jail anyway so at least he wouldnt be any less happy for not having the emerald in his possession for a couple of minutes and me i finally had sufficient capital to build the tabernacle of saint luke which i promised the lord i would do just as soon as i spent a few years scouting out the territory for the very best location everything went pretty smoothly the next day first thing i did was stop by the laundry and drop off the uniform so no one would notice it was missing and maybe start thinking about why it was missing then i scouted up some lunch that didnt smell of fish and wandered the streets a bit and at about two in the afternoon i walked over to the museum lingered there for an hour or two had a very public misunderstanding with a blonde frenchwoman and then headed back toward the luk kwok along the way i picked up some chewing gum and stuck a wad of it into my mouth then i stopped by a little gift shop and while the proprietor was speaking to another customer i stuck the empire emerald on the back of his radiator with the chewing gum since it was midsummer i knew he wasnt going to fiddle with the radiator for another few months and i figured to be back for it within just a day or two the very last thing i did was hide the cloth bag with the lump of coal inside the water tank behind the toilet once i returned to room in the luk kwok then i lay back on my bed pulled out the good book and whiled the night away reading about solomons more exotic dalliances the police showed up right on schedule at a quarter after two in the morning and hustled me off to jail i kept protesting my innocence the way i figured both willie wong and rupert cornwall would expect of me and then just after daybreak a guard came and unlocked my cell as far as i was concerned he could have waited another couple of hours since i hadnt yet got around to converting mei sung again but given the circumstances i didnt think it proper to protest so i let him escort me to freedom which turned out to be wongs little cubbyhole good morning doctor jones he said without getting up from his chair good morning brother wong i said howd it go last night apprehend whole gang he said happily rupert cornwall in cell one flight up from yours thats great news brother wong i said and did you get the emerald back empire emerald once again on display in fung ping shan museum i guess that closes the case he nodded cannot teach old dog new tricks well ill sure remember that the next time i run into an old dog brother wong i said i assume im free to go farther you go the better i beg your pardon it best you leave hong kong said wong many friends and clients of rupert cornwall not very pleased with you a telling point i agreed gimme just a couple of hours to get my gear together and ill be off thank you for help doctor jones said wong knew you were right man for job my pleasure brother wong i said then i took my leave of him went back to the luk kwok and looked around to see if there was anything i wanted to take along with me there were some old shirts and pants and socks and such but since i was about to pick up the empire emerald on my way out of town i decided that i really owed myself a new wardrobe so i finally left emptyhanded i moseyed over to the area where the gift shop was did maybe an hour of serious windowshopping up and down the street for the benefit of anyone who might have been watching me and finally entered the little store after i was sure i wasnt being observed you are lucifer jones are you not asked the proprietor the second i closed the door behind me how did you know i asked i dont recall talking to you last night i was given your description by inspector wong he replied he left a note for you he handed me a foldedup piece of paper which i opened and read dear doctor jones had feeling all along you were perfect man for job had honorable number ten fourteen seventeen and twentytwo sons observe you constantly since you left custody not only is rupert cornwall under arrest but we now know weakness in museum security system all thanks to you is old chinese custom to exchange gifts you will know where to look for yours your humble servant willie wong hong kong police ps money is root of all evil i threw the paper down on the counter and raced over to the radiator i reached behind it found my gum and the stone and pulled it out it was the same lump of coal rupert cornwall had given me two days ago is something wrong mr jones asked the storekeeper nothing i shouldnt have expected from trusting someone who aint a decent godfearing christian i said bitterly give me a map brother a map he repeated this towns seen the last of me i said im heading to where a man of the cloth can convert souls in peace and quiet without worried about getting flimflammed by gangsters and detectives and the like he pulled a map out from behind the counter i looked at it for a minute and then with four hundred and fifty pounds of rupert cornwalls money still in my pocket i lit out across the mouth of the pearl river for macao where i hoped to find a better class of sinner to listen to my preaching the sin city derby macau didnt smell a lot better than hong kong and it wasnt no cleaner but it offered more opportunities to an enterprising christian gentleman like myself in fact it offered more opportunities to just about everybody since it was where all the young hong kong bucks went to do their gambling and find their shortterm ladyfriends i got off the ferry trying to figure out what to do next when a young blond guy pulling an empty rickshaw stopped in front of me howdy brother i said take me to wherever it is that the white folks stay when theyre in town thatd be the bela vista hotel he said in perfect american but you can do better at the macau inn over on the travesso de padre narciso sounds good to me i said climbing into the seat let er rip i can also get you into half a dozen highclass gambling clubs he said as he began pulling the rickshaw down the street and if youve got an interest in the ladies well mostly im here to raise money for my tabernacle i said but i gotta admit it makes more sense to go where the money is than where it aint and of course part of my calling is to show wicked painted jezebels the power and the glory he turned and grinned at me it sounds like youve got yourself a mighty interesting religion preacher he said i wouldnt mind joining up myself howd a wellspoken young feller like you come to be in the rickshaw trade thousands of miles from church and home in the first place i asked him its a long story he said but the gist of it is that i hired on to work on an archeological dig in the gobi desert our boat docked in hong kong on a saturday afternoon and a bunch of us came over to the sin city of macau for one last fling before going out in the wilderness makes sense i allowed they told us to be back at sunup on monday which was when the truck was leaving i guess i overslept a little and they didnt wait for you i didnt get out of bed until half past tuesday and i figured they were all gone by then so i looked around for some way to earn my passage back home i thought i could be a croupier or maybe a personal manager for some ladies of the evening but all the good jobs were taken and so i wound up pulling this goddamned rickshaw he took a hard left turn and suddenly i could see the macau inn straight ahead of us here we are preacher he said sprinting the final fifty yards take it easy i said we aint in no race sorry he said coming to a stop in front of the hotel sometimes i pretend im still outrunning tacklers on the football field back in high school it helps to pass the time you played football sure did he answered and being an exhalfback gives me an edge on the competition if we see a single customer stepping off the ferry or out of a hotel i always get there first it was just about that instant that the lord smote me right betwixt the eyes with a great big heavenly revelation are you telling me there aint no coolie in town can match strides with you i said not a one he said i even had a couple of big ten scholarship offers until they threw me off the team for a few minor infractions that is what kind of infractions oh zelda thelma patti those kinds brother i said howd you like to get enough money for passage back to the good old u s of a and have a little pocket money left over for an occasional infraction youve got a curious expression on your face preacher he said i cant quite tell if youre joking or not i never joke about money i said its against the third and eighth commandments come on inside and lets talk a little business he pulled the rickshaw over to a side of the road and followed me into the macau inn there was a great big fountain in the middle of the lobby with about a dozen parrots dangling down from the ceiling in bamboo cages there was a fat white man in a wrinkled suit and a fez talking to a couple of turbaned indians in a corner and an englishman in tweeds was sitting on a leather chair smoking a pipe and reading a copy of the china morning post we walked past the checkin desk and turned left at the restaurant which was just about empty it being the middle of the afternoon have a seat i said escorting my rickshaw driver to a small table dont mind if i do he replied by the way brother i didnt catch your name harvey he said reaching out and shaking my hand harvey edwards and before we discuss any further business you still owe me for the ride how much tell you what he said buy me a couple of beers and well call it square i cant do that brother harvey i said reaching into my pocket and pulling out a couple of coins this ought to cover what i owe you you got something against beer preacher he asked not a thing i answered nothing slakes the thirst like a cold beer then whats the problem i aint got no problem brother harvey i said but you youre in training for what the rickshaw races he frowned what are you talking about there aint any rickshaw races in macau i grinned at him yet i said suddenly his eyes lit up like little candles oh brother harvey i been mulling on it and i cant see no reason why i should risk the lords money playing fantan and other games of chance with these local sharks when we can invite em into our pool you know said harvey with a great big smile i cant think of any reason either good i said then were in business fiftyfifty he replied i shook my head onethird for you one thirdfor me and onethird for the lord which is only fair since hes putting up the money he aint doing the running though said harvay adamantly well we hemmed and we hawed and we haggled and what it finally came down to was that harvey and i would split the first ten thousand pounds we made down the middle and the lord got himself a twenty percent option on the rest provided he produced fair weather and a fast track that settled we indulged in a couple of grilled macau pigeons and then i started asking him where we were likely to find the biggest plungers no question about it he said theyre all at the central hotel never heard of it youre about the first person ive run across who hasnt said harvey its the biggest building in town even if it is only nine stories tall you can see it from just about anywhere maybe i ought to rent a room there instead of here i suggested he laughed at that theyll be charging you rent every twenty minutes preacher he said it aint exactly your runof themill hotel which was an understatement if ever there was one we waited til the sun went down and then made our way over to the central hotel which despite its name wasnt a hotel at all we walked in the main entrance and found ourselves on the ground floor which was crawling with coolies there were smallstakes games of roulette and bacarat and fantan going on everywhere and the girls were just about all in need of a little soap and water and a good dentist these guys dont look like no high rollers to me i said as we began walking across the room theyre not replied harvey well then i asked follow me he said walking toward a huge winding staircase the coolies were a little betterdressed on the second floor and the girls looked a mite healthier by the third floor they were playing with british pounds instead of hong kong dollars and we ran into a bunch of indians on the fourth floor when we reached the fifth floor most of the players were europeans and welldressed chinamen and the girls were so downright beautiful that i remarked to harvey that i couldnt wait to see what theyd look like once we reached the penthouse the gambling ends on the sixth floor he answered the top three floors are just bedrooms so we made our way up one more flight and the only difference between the sixth floor of the central hotel and the casino at monte carlo was that a third of the players here were chinamen and the girls were all dressed for mighty warm weather see that big chinaman in the corner with his back to the wall whispered harvey gesturing to an ornerylooking feller sitting at a highstakes poker table hes lo chung he owns the place he pointed to the others at the table thats beta million reynolds over there is sir reginald thurmand and that little guy next to lo chung is gerhardt guenther the german ambassador he sighed must be fifty million dollars sitting at that one table they got a privy up here i asked as one of the hostesses passed by and she pointed it out to me i told harvey to stay put then went off by myself pulled out a handkerchief folded it into a nice neat square folded cornwalls money over it and then slapped a rubber band around the whole thing so it looked like i was walking around with maybe forty thousand pounds of cash rather than four hundred then i went back out onto the floor and rejoined harvey who was getting a little nervous in the presence of all that money we wandered around the room exchanged pleasantries with a couple of hostesses stopped to watch the action at the roulette wheel and the craps table and finally wound up at the fantan game where a greek and a korean were having a contest to see who could go broke first i whispered to harvey to go back to the rickshaw and that id meet him there in just a couple of minutes he looked kind of curious but he did what i told him i do love the smell of money i said turning back to the fantan table perhaps you would like to join us suggested the greek i shook my head too tame for me brother he laughed so loud that everyone turned to see what was going on you find fantan tame he said yeah its almost as dull as poker and craps i said i pulled out my bankroll tossed it carelessly in the air and caught it a couple of times and then stuck it back in my pocket guess ill go out looking for some real action at which point lo chung got up from his poker game and walked over to me good evening father he said bowing low as a matter of fact its reverend i said the right reverend lucifer jones it is not often that we play host to a man of the cloth he said we have a reputation as the sin city of the orient well im afraid its gonna be even less often brother i said i like excitement when i bet i reached into my pocket and fiddled with my bankroll again nothing all that exciting here except maybe for that little hostess with the green eyes and dress to match we try to accomodate all our guests reverend jones he said looking greedily toward my pocket perhaps if you would tell me what type of gambling excites you glad you asked brother i said kind of gently shoving him aside and speaking to the room at large ladies and gents i came here by rickshaw just like a batch of you folks did and i got forty thousand pounds that says my rickshaw puller can whip any rickshaw puller you put up against him at any distance from fifty yards to six furlongs at equal weights now just a minute reverend jones said lo chung this is my gambling establishment you cannot arrange your own transactions with my customers sorry brother lo chung i apologized i certainly didnt mean to step out of line i suppose id best take my leave of you i walked to the head of the stairs and then stopped and turned back to the room the race starts in front of the macau inn at nine oclock tomorrow morning i said ill cover any and all bets then i ran down the stairs just before a couple of lo chungs bouncers could throw me down i saw the cutest little lady serving drinks as i passed the third floor but i didnt have time to start no conversations and i figured if i just grabbed her and carried her down the stairs with me the extra weight would slow me down enough so the bouncers could catch me and so a brief and tender romantic moment went unrequitted i yelled to harvey to get ready to roll as i burst out through the front door with a couple of hundred coolies staring at me but no one followed me so thankfully he didnt have to use up no energy or calories or nothing getting us out of there and ten minutes later we were back at the macau inn sitting in the bar him sipping an iced tea and eyeing my beer the way i had eyed that little hostess on the third floor have you given any serious thought to how you plan to cover all those bets tomorrow he asked me and the lordll think of something i said after all we got all night aint we all night isnt that long preacher the lord made the world in six days i said thats one for each continent the way i figure it now if he could make asia in a day and have time left over for creating the sun and the moon and swiping one of adams ribs surely he dont need all night to solve this minor inconvenience i finished up my beer you just make sure you dont bust no legs coming out of the starting gate i could beat most of the local coolies on one leg answered harvey dont worry preacher its in the bag all right i said its about time you headed home and got a good eight hours so youll be all fresh and ready to go in the morning then i changed my mind you know now as i come to think on it its probably better than you spend the night here cant chance you running into traffic and getting all tuckered out on your way here tomorrow morning i dont have any money for a room i tossed him my room key take mine i said ill get another you can pay me out of your share of the winnings he picked up the key and headed off to the room then just to make sure he didnt do nothing to damage his wind on the eve of the big event i rounded up all the girls in the lobby rented another room and made sure that none of em were available just in case he came looking for a little infraction it was a long and arduous chore but i figured i owed it to him and i was sure that my silent partner would understand that i was only doing it for the benefit of his tabernacle i got up a bit before sunrise tiptoed out of the room and went down to the front desk where a young chinaman was smoking a waterpipe and doping out the races got a safe deposit box for hire brother i asked yes said the clerk pulling out a box and handing me the key thatll be one hong kong dollar howd you like to make some real money i said i wouldnt be adverse to it he admitted good i said comes nine oclock this place is gonna be crawling with rickshaws and big spenders a lot of them are going to want someone responsible to hold their bets i pulled a pair of hundredpound notes off my roll which was still wrapped around the handkerchief and handed them to him this ought to make it worth your while yes sir he said with a great big smile now as you can see i said sticking the roll into the box im putting forty thousand pounds in here youre my witness right he said barely taking his eyes off his own two hundredpound notes which was probably close to half a years wages for him okay i said handing him the box lock it up for safekeeping he put the box back in place locked it and returned the key to me now just so youve got this straight youre legally empowered to take bets up to forty thousand pounds once youve reached the limit or there aint no more money being wagered stick it in another lock box and keep the key yourself then what the winner gets the contents of both boxes i leaned across the counter and whispered in his ear and if things go right this could be a daily chore for you at the same rate of pay im more than happy to be of service sir he assured me with a greedy grin on his face somehow i thought you might be i replied then i went off to wake harvey took him down to the restaurant for a breakfast of orange juice and tea and walked back into the lobby at about a quarter to nine it was filled to overflowing with coolies and their backers all lined up to lay their bets with the clerk at nine oclock sharp we all walked outside where harvey and other rickshaw pullers lined up across the broad street then it was just a matter of setting the conditions which turned out to be twice around the block or just under half a mile harvey was pawing at the ground with his feet and his eyes were bright and excited and i thought he might break out whinnying any second there must have been a good five hundred people crowded up and down the street not all of them chinamen and finally we let betamillion reynolds fire the gun that started the race harvey opened up a quick two lengths on his field before they hit the first corner and was leading by twenty yards when they passed the finish line the first time they disappeared from sight around the corner a second time and when they hit the homestretch harvey was only leading by a length but as he passed by he winked at me and i realized he was just trying not to discourage the competition from trying him again he won by about half a length and before i could go to the desk to pick up our winnings sir reginald thurmund and ambassador gerhardt guenther were demanding a rematch that night i hemmed and hawed as if i thought harvey was too tuckered out to run again and finally let them talk me into it for midnight sharp we told the crowd when to come back and then harvey and me went to the desk and picked up beautiful british pounds counted it a couple of times and stood there admiring it for a few minutes and then put it back in the safe easiest money i ever made for a rickshaw ride he laughed we should just about double it tonight i said and then well start running you in handicaps handicaps yeah i said after this weekend well never get another even race so youll probably have to tote weights in your rickshaw just like a racehorse make the race downhill and the weights might actually help me go faster he suggested that little law of physics aint exactly lost on me i replied aint no law says you have to run the same course every time out well we loafed around the hotel for most of the afternoon but when i saw harvey smiling at a couple of earlyblooming flowers of the night i sent him to his room for a nap and then just to make sure that he couldnt give in to temptation i took them off to my own room for the next couple of hours where i got me an education in various chinese arts that were even more complicated than fantan i could have spent another few hours saving harvey from further temptation and generous christian gentleman that i am i was all set to do so but at about seven oclock he pounded on my door to say that he was going down to the restaurant to grab some dinner i didnt want his stomach to go cramping up on him so i took my leave of my lovely companions and went with him to supervise ill have a thick steak and make sure that its rare said harvey as the waiter approached us belay that order i said hell have two glasses of orange juice and a cup of coffee preacher he said irritably sooner or later you got to let me eat something solid or i aint gonna have the energy to run im starving you cant run a full stomach i told him sternly i cant run on one thats been empty for a day and a half neither youre really all that hungry i asked i am okay i said turning to the waiter bring us a thick steak rare added harvey yes sir said the waiter bowing does that come with a salad i asked yes sir fine bring em out at the same time and what will you have sir im having the steak my friend here gets the salad no dressing preacher ah what the hell i said giving in to my soft christian nature bring him a half order of dressing on the side thanks a heap muttered harvey he didnt say another word til the salad came and then he wolfed it down so fast i thought he might take a couple of bites out of the plate by mistake or maybe on purpose and i noticed that he licked my steak plate clean while i was settling the bill but when we left the restaraunt i was satisfied that he was in perfect shape for the race the crowds started showing up at about ten oclock and by a quarter to midnight there must have been a thousand people but the betting was going real slow since harvey had impressed the hell out of em in the morning and they wanted to wait to see the opposition and have the odds posted before they started laying their money down then suddenly everything got real quiet and a big black limosine pulled up and lo chung stepped out he looked like hed had happier days howdy lo chung i said stepping forward welcome to the sin city rickshaw racing club i thought youd be tending to business over at the central hotel all my customers have come here he said grimly well well shoot em right back to you once the race is over you must not continue to interfere with my business reverend jones he said whos interfering i said you run roulette wheels and fantan games i run rickshaw races i warn you reverend i am becoming seriously displeased with you six or seven weeks and everyonell get tired of trying to beat my champion and go back to blowing their paychecks over at your place lo chung i said you just gotta learn to be patient just remember doctor jones that my patience is not unending he said and got back into his limo and drove off to the central hotel well that kind of put a damper on things for a couple of minutes but then sir reginald and the german ambassador showed up each with what looked like a higher class of coolie and a few minutes later the race was under way and this time the coolies broke on top and harvey just kind of lagged behind in third place biding his time until the last hundred yards or so where he came on to win by just under a length we cleared another twenty thousand pounds stuck it with the rest of our money in the hotel safe and went to bed him alone and me with such temptations as i didnt want him to have no part of next morning i woke him up again and escorted him down to the restaurant you know what i dreamed about last night he said after id ordered him a grapefuit juice and a cup of coffee women i suggested nope america he shook his head food harvey im your manager i said you gotta trust me havent i made us close to pounds already sooner or later you gotta give me something to eat or im gonna be too weak to pull that damned rickshaw he protested after this mornings race i said well give you an hour to cool out and then you can have the biggest steak on the menu thatll give you more than twelve hours to digest it and sleep it off before you run again at midnight you promise he asked distrustfully i swear it on my mothers grave i said which seemed to please him at any rate it had to have pleased him more than knowing that my mother was currently running an establishment for fallen women in wichita which was in fact the case but somehow it just wouldnt have sounded as impressive to swear on my mothers sporting house well we finished breakfast and walked outside shouldering our way through a few hundred chinamen and what we came to was lo chung leaning against his limosine and doing his damnedest to look inscrutible youre up early today lo chung i said by way of greeting i finally decided that if i couldnt beat you i should join you he replied well thats right thoughtful of you i said but the sin city jockey club aint in the market for no partners i meant that i intend to join you as a competitor he explained let me make sure i have the conditions correct you state that your man can outpull any rickshaw in macau thats right and there are no other conditions i shot a quick look at harvey figuring that lo chung was thinking of bringing in some chinese track star who we hadnt never heard of but he just gave me a confident nod thats right i said theres aint no other conditions he pulled a huge wad of bills out of his pocket ill match whatever winnings youve accrued so far i looked at harvey again he looked fit and trim and confident even if his stomach was rumbling to beat the band okay lo chung you got yourself a bet i said and escorted him to the desk while he placed his roll on deposit in the safe shall we outline the course he asked as we were walking back to the street well usually they just run around the block a couple of times i said this may be the biggest wager ever made on a race in macau he answered i think more people should be able to see it i suggest that we race from the ruins of the st paul cathedral to the temple of kun iam thats pretty close to mile i noted isnt your man up to it he asked with a smile five yards five miles it makes no difference to me said harvey excellent said lo chung shall we walk to the starting line wouldnt you rather wait by the finish i asked all in good time reverend jones he said ill see the finish too never fear i figured that meant he planned to have his limo drive him to the finish line once the race was underway and made up my mind to hop a lift with him since i didnt relish walking all the way to the temple of kun iam in the morning sun the st paul cathedral which had fallen into a mild state of disrepair and now consisted of nothing but four walls a staircase and a lot of weeds was about half a mile from the macau inn harvey surrounded by a bunch of kids who all wanted his autograph started toting the rickshaw there with me and lo chung and a few hundred betters tagging along behind as we were walking i realized that id been so busy watching harveys diet that id neglected to eat breakfast myself so i stopped by a local food stand and bought a couple of sandwiches and an apple stuffed the apple and one of the sandwiches in my pocket and munched on the other as we made our way to the starting line by the way i aint seen your rickshaw yet brother lo chung i said its waiting for us at the cathedral when we got to within maybe fifty yards of the cathedral i turned to him you must be wrong brother lo chung i said aint nothing there but a horse and buggy a horse and rickshaw he corrected me well thats one way of getting it here i said wheres your puller right there reverend jones he replied but thats a horse how clever of you to notice that aint in the rules get rid of it and get yourself a man to pull your rickshaw you explicity stated that your man could outpull any rickshaw on macau said lo chung you never said that it had to be pulled by another man that is my puller no way i yelled you get a man in front of that rickshaw or the bets off the bet is on reverend jones he said and suddenly i was looking down the barrels of a couple of dozen pistols in the hands of his friends and relations all of who were dressed in black perhaps next time you will think more carefully before cutting in on someone elses business well maybe ill just tie our rickshaw onto the back of a car i said that would be against the rules said lo chung youve already named your puller hes the one taking on all challengers remember im gonna have to think about this i said well think quickly said lo chung the race starts in seven minutes i walked over to harvey what about it i asked in low tones think you can beat a horse not a chance he said dejectedly then an interesting notion struck me dont be so allfired sure of that i told him the horse dont know hes in a race does he what are you driving at preacher asked harvey when the race starts why dont you just walk calm and naturallike toward the temple of kun iam if he aint got no reason to run hell either stay right where he is or fall into step behind you maybe we can win this thing without you breaking out of a walk i think youve got something there preacher he said excitedly lets give it a try okay lo chung i said walking back to the chinaman we accept your puller good he said walking over to his rickshaw i knew youd see the light of reason he began clambering up onto the seat now what the hell are you doing i demanded im willingly giving my puller a handicap of pounds he said you cant do that there is nothing in the rules prohibiting me from sitting in my rickshaw during the race he said as one of his henchmen handed him a whip and another began putting a bridle over the horses head i made the rules i shouted and i say that aint legal shall we put it to a vote asked lo chung all right i said furiously lets just do that lo chung nodded to his men who turned their pistols on the crowd will any man who thinks my actions constitute a breach of the rules please fall down with a bullet in his chest he said in a loud clear voice nobody fell down or did much of anything else he smiled at me there you have it reverend a unanimous vote now if you have no further objections ill send some of my men ahead to make sure no one absconds with the money i had plenty of objections but it didnt seem all that desirable to voice them at that particular moment i suggested to my silent partner that time was running out fast and that if he was going to intervene hed better do it quick and damned if he didnt come up with an idea i looked around until i found an old coolie with a bamboo fishing pole maybe ten or twelve feet long and asked if i could borrow it i dont think he understood a word i said but he just kept chattering and bowing until finally i took it out of his hands going fishing reverend asked lo chung with a chuckle i thought you were here to watch a rickshaw race you got a whip i said its only fair that i should have a whip and with that i climbed into the chair of harveys rickshaw are you crazy preacher he demanded i cant beat the damned horse without you fair is fair i said smiling back at lo chung and when we win i dont ever want anyone saying we done it because harvey didnt have a passenger and the horse did lo chung busted out laughing at that and harvey kept muttering to himself and a couple of minutes later we were lined up nose to nose in front of st pauls cathedral pointing toward the temple of kun iam about a mile away are the contestents ready asked sir reginald who had volunteered to be the official starter not quite i said fiddling with the wire on the end of the fishing pole what are you doing reverend jones demanded lo chung suspiciously just making sure my whip is in working order i said you whip me with that thing and ill give you the beating of your life muttered harvey under his breath okay now im ready i said after another moment or two splendid said sir reginald he pulled out his little ivoryhandled revolver on your marks get set go he shot the pistol off just as i swung the fishing pole with my apple attached to it in front of the horses face he lunged at it almost throwing lo chung out of the rickshaw and harvey got off to a quick lead whats going on back there preacher he asked as he ran along where the hell is the horse you worry about the running and leave the horse to me i said hanging over the side and dangling the apple just in front of the horses nose whenever he reached for it i flicked my hand and moved it a few inches away from him lo chung was beating the horse with his whip and cussing a blue streak but evidently the poor animal hadnt had no more to eat than harvey had because he just ignored lo chung and kept his eyes peeled on the apple well we ambled along like that for almost three quarters of a mile and i took a quick peek ahead and could see the temple of kun iam maybe three hundred yards ahead of us then our rickshaw hit a big dip in the road and i almost fell out and by the time i had regained my balance the horse had reached out and finally got his teeth into the apple and bit it off step it up harvey i yelled we got problems the horse didnt speed up but he didnt slow down none either and i could see that he was going to be done with the apple before we crossed the finish line and there wasnt no doubt in my mind that once that particular event came to pass he would finally respond to the whip that lo chung kept beating him with then i remembered the other sandwich that i had tucked away in my pocket and i figured what worked for one puller might work for another so i quick tied it to the end of the fishing rod just about the time the horse downed the last of the apple and we had maybe forty yards to go i reached out and stuck it just out of harveys reach and he took off with a burst of speed that would have done jim thorpe proud lo chungs rickshaw was coming up fast on the left but harvey was inspired and we crossed the finish line a good half length in front i let harvey grab the sandwich then and he kept running as he stuffed it in his mouth you can stop now i said we won i saw fifteen of lo chungs friends and relations standing there in front of the temple with their guns out and looking very upset for this early in the day he hollered back at me but we got all our money back at the macau inn i said its only money whats so only about money i demanded you do what you gotta do preacher said harvey heading straight toward the dock me im getting out of town alive and intact therell be other rickshaw races and i aim to have my legs still attached to the rest of me when i run in em i looked back and saw lo chung standing beside his rickshaw raising all kinds of a ruckus and then a few of his friends and relations looked after us and fired a couple of shots in our direction and suddenly a boat trip to the mainland started looking better and better after all i said aloud what is a man profited if he wins a hundred thousand pounds sterling and loses his innerds harvey said amen and jacked up the pace as the temple of kun iam faded into the distance behind us the insidious oriental dentist once we hit the mainland harvey and i parted company he wanted to get right back into the rickshawracing business but i decided to head off to peking which was the capital city of china and figured to have not only the most sinners in need of saving but the most opportunities to raise funds for my tabernacle well let me tell you something it aint no short hop from macau to peking it took me six months to get there during which time i picked up a smattering of the language fell in love fourteen or fifteen times and only got a personal tour of one calaboose that was in a little town called poshan where the apple of my eye turned out to be the fruit of the local warlords loins but even that worked out for the good because i lost a quick ten pounds on the prison grub and was more handsome than ever by the time i got the jailkeeper interested in a little game of chance involving the number twentyone and won my freedom by the time i finally got within hailing distance of peking i wasnt looking my very best not having changed clothes for the better part of half a year and despite taking a plunge into any river i passed i wasnt exactly on the verge of turning into any nosegay neither so i started scouting around the countryside for some of the christian missions id heard had been built in these parts it didnt take too long to find one where i stopped in for a meal and a little discussion of the good book im kind of weak on the sermon on the mount but ill match my knowledge of the why and how of all the begattings with the best of em and on the way out i borrowed a new set of missionary clothes that i found drying on a clothesline since i knew these fellers wouldnt begrudge them to a fellow christan and besides i figured an act of inadvertent charity would put them in real tight with the lord who appreciates such things if not done to excess i was still some fifty miles out of peking when i managed to land a ride in the back of a truck that was hauling bales of hay into the city it was getting on toward winter and i didnt have no overcoat so i just kind of burrowed into the hay and decided to catch a quick thirty or forty winks i was awakened by a tall thin englishman jabbing me with his cane you he said get out of there and be quick about it i sat up rubbed my eyes and saw that he was pointing a revolver at my middle which got my attention right fast what were you doing in there he demanded and as i climbed out i saw that he had the driver out of the cab too mostly i was being woke up by a englishman with a gun i said if this is a holdup brother i got to inform you that im a man of the cloth whos taken a temporary vow of poverty i aint got nothing to my name but the clothes on my back and my copy of the good book he turned to the driver and jabbered something in chinese so quick that i couldnt follow what he was saying the driver who looked scared to death nodded his head and grunted all right said the englishman you can go go where i said i dont even know where i am the driver said something else and this time it was the englishman who nodded and grunted and a minute later the driver hopped back into the cab and took off now how am i gonna get into the city i said ill drive you said the englishman where are you going peking i mean where in peking i aint figured that out yet i said just getting here was effort enough he peered at me intently youve never been here before as god is my witness he kept on staring at me and youre really a man of the cloth i held up two fingers and pressed them together me and god are just like that i assured him excellent he walked me over to his jeep which we both got into whats your name he asked as we headed off toward peking the honorable right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service baptisms and funerals done cheap how would you like the opportunity to help me defeat satan incarnate reverend jones he asked satan incarnate i repeated he nodded his head vigorously he lives in peking does he i said peking is his headquarters but he has residences all over the world how many residences he shrugged fifteen twenty who can say which made the odds fifteen or twenty to one that he wouldnt be at home today and i got to thinking that maybe i could appropriate a few satanic artifacts for the local pawn shop sure i said standing up to satan is one of the very best things i do me being a standin for god and all excellent said the englishman its been a long lonely battle but with you on our side we just might win he paused for a minute allow me to introduce myself i am sir mortimer edgertonsmythe please to meet you i said who else is on our side theres just you and me he said and how many are in the opposition who can say surely thousands possibly hundreds of thousands perhaps millions have you ever heard of doctor aristotle ho cant say that i have he is the fiend who heads this secret organization said sir mortimer his eyes blazing with hatred his father was a grecian ambassador his mother the daughter of a chinese warlord nothing is known of his childhood we do know that he spent three years practicing dentistry in hangchou before he began his nefarious career by taking over the leadership of the local tong from there he spread out assimilating one criminal organization after another until today he is the most powerful villain on the continent his tentacles are everywhere reverend jones they reach not only into peking but to the capitals of europe itself he dreams of worldwide conquest and he is more than halfway to his goal and yet so careful has he been so circumspect that almost no one has ever heard of him youve met this doctor aristotle ho i asked twice said sir mortimer the first time was in england where i prevented him from stealing the crown jewels the second time was in chunking where i barely escaped with my life i assume youre working for the british government thats correct why dont you guys just march in an army or two and blow him away i asked were operating in a foreign land reverend jones he said we cant just send our troops in and destroy him our only hope is to prove that he is guilty of breaking international law and then arrest him and how do you plan to do that i asked the dragon is the key to it dragon doctor ho keeps an enormous dragon on his estate began sir mortimer there aint no such things i said theyre just imaginary beasts like dinosaurs and unicorns and honest redheads named bernice thats what i thought too until i saw it with my own eyes said sir mortimer but it exists and its the way we shall bring him down you plan to feed him to this here dragon i asked curiously he shook his head no he said britain is a nation of laws i intend to use the law to put an end to his villainy how is a dragon gonna help you do that i asked i thought they didnt do much except eat knights and virgins and things like that this dragon eats just about anything that moves answered sir mortimer the truck in which you were riding belongs to doctor ho it was carrying hay and grain to fatten the cattle he feeds to the dragon thats why i inspected it i wanted to see if he was smuggling anything else into his fortress you still aint told me how the dragon is gonna cause doctor hos downfall i said im coming to that said sir mortimer every year doctor ho ships the dragon to a different city for the chinese new year festival honk kong shanghai once even san francisco the dragon remains for a week and is then shipped back last year he shipped it to rio de janeiro so reverend jones he said triumphantly there are only seventeen chinese in rio de janeiro and eleven of them dont even celebrate the new year the man is obviously smuggling something and if we can just find out what it is we can put him behind bars for life whens the next chinese new year coming up i asked soon the dragon is due to be shipped out tomorrow exactly what do you think hes smuggling sir mortimer i asked that remains to be discovered and just how do we plan to discover it tonight after dark well sneak into the dragons enclosure and examine both the beast and its cage if theres any contraband there from drugs to jewels well find it and that will be the undoing of the insidious aristotle ho the only reason i didnt hop out of the car right then and there was because i didnt believe in dragons i figured sir mortimer was like so many other englishmen id met who had a passion for foreign lands but never remembered to properly protect his head from the vertical rays of the sun and was now just a bit on the dotty side so you can imagine my surprise when we drove out to this huge estate after dark and the first thing i heard was a roar that was like unto a volcano erupting good whispered sir mortimer were in time they havent shipped him off yet i opened the door well sir mortimer i said it sure has been nice knowing you and if you ever need spiritual comforting why you just be sure to look me up i started walking back in the general direction of peking but he ran around the car and grabbed me just where do you think youre going he demanded wheres the dragon i asked right over there he said pointing to the left good i said heading off to the right im going this way i need your help damn it you need a short list of funeral prayers for crazy englishmen i said little yellow guys who want to take over the world dont bother me none but i aint going into no corral with no dragon i thought you were sworn to combat evil wherever you found it i didnt swear to go hunting it up when its peacefully minding its own business in its pasture my people have posted a millionpound reward to the man who brings doctor ho to justice he said desperately ill split it down the middle with you which put a whole new light on things well my tabernacle does need a new alter i admitted along with walls and floors and pews and a steeple and a ceiling you got yourself a deal sir mortimer good lets get busy he led me over to a huge paddock with a high fence around it hes inside in the barn whispered sir mortimer how do you know i asked kind of nervouslike if he was outside hed have heard us by now and would be roaring and spouting flames that would illuminate the whole area just how big is this here dragon i asked perhaps half a city block i was about to ask if that was a long new york block or a short macau block when it suddenly occurred to me that it didnt really make an awful lot of difference given the current situation sir mortimer led me around the paddock to a broad driveway that led to an oversized barn youre sure this is the only way to get the goods on artistotle ho i asked as he reached out for the door just dont make any sudden movements he said uh i dont wanna sound like i lack confidence in this here operation sir mortimer but have you ever searched a dragon before as a matter of fact ive searched this dragon four previous times answered sir mortimer each of the past four years just before hes shipped out ive gone over him with a finetoothed comb ive checked his harness for jewels ive gone over every inch of his cage ive even gone through his stool in case doctor ho is trying to ship some contrband inside him and you aint never found nothing never he admitted then why bother doing it all over again tonight i asked because im convinced that the answer lies with the dragon he frowned resolutely ill just have to be more thorough this time the building shook with another roar if youve done this before you dont really need me i suggested oh ive always had help he said yeah he nodded poor chaps he opened the door and pulled me inside before i had a chance to ask what happened to them given the sight that met my eyes that was probably all for the best there was just one stall in the barn it was made of steel bars and it was maybe feet long and feet wide and while it was filled with straw and food troughs and water drums what it was mostly filled with was a dragon he was green on top bright yellow on the bottom and scaley all over the second i looked at him i decided he was big enough to eat a couple of dinosaurs for lunch and still be ready to polish off the eiffel tower or some similar tidbit for dinner he had the longest ugliest face i ever did see with big red eyes the size of basketballs and a nose that kept snorting smoke good evening cuddles said sir mortimer gently cuddles i repeated its my pet name for him said sir mortimer it makes him seem less formidable cuddles roared again and a flame a dozen feet long shot out of his mouth and barely missed us they really shouldnt keep him on straw bedding noted sir mortimer hes likely to set the place on fire he paused hmm i suppose if we dont find the contraband i could always report doctor ho to the local branch of the spca how in the world do they ship something like this i asked sir mortimer pointed to a number of barred cage sections piled up against the wall theres his traveling cage he said theyll assemble it tomorrow morning and then drive him into it he sighed deeply well i daresay wed best get to work couldnt we just kind of examine him from right here i asked positioning myself directly behind sir mortimer no he said if the contraband could be spotted from outside his cage it would have been what makes you so sure there is any contraband i asked there has to be answered sir mortimer firmly its the only way doctor ho can finance his farflung enterprises i know all his other sources of income and they simply dont amount to enough no reverend jones its got to be here and with that he opened the door to the stall and taking me by the arm pulled me inside ill check out his feet said sir mortimer pulling out a flashlight youd be surprised what can be hidden inside nails this size what do i do i asked nervously as the dragon turned his head to face me hes wearing a halter on his head said sir mortimer make sure there are no jewels attached to it i cant see none check the underside of the leather youre kidding right im perfectly serious i took another look at the dragon which looked like it was just itching for a little snack of charred missionary you got to be kidding i insisted you dont expect me to at that instant the dragon roared again and i just barely ducked the flames that shot out at me ah i see theyve chemically treated the straw so it cant catch fire said sir mortimer too bad so much for reporting dr ho to the spca he went back to examining the dragons toenails and i took a tentative step toward the dragons face nice cuddles i said cute cuddles cuddles glared at me and growled no fire came out but i damned near choked to death on the smoke sweet cuddles i said taking a couple of more steps that brought me right beneath his face careful now said sir mortimer pulling a hammer and an icepick out of his pocket this may hurt he stuck the icepick up against one of the dragons toenails and banged on it cuddles let out another roar that could be heard all the way to sioux city damn it sir mortimer i yelled sorry just being thorough i turned back to cuddles who was still staring at me now just take it easy feller i said i just want to look at your harness i reached up to let him smell the back of my hand like youre supposed to do with dogs and such he took a sniff and practically inhaled my whole arm sir mortimer i hollered quiet or youll wake the whole fortress hissed sir mortimer but my arms stuck in his nose and he wont give it back sir mortimer nodded his head sadly without looking up from the dragons toenails yes that happened to poor archie too who was poor archie i asked trying to pull my arm loose the assistant i lost on my second or was it my third no definitely my second inspection of the dragon i looked up at cuddles who was staring at me with a kind of stupid expression on his face okay i said funs fun now leggo of my arm cuddles just kept looking at me and not doing much of anything and it occured to me that dragons maybe didnt breathe more than once every ten or twenty minutes sir mortimer i really could use a little help here i said not now reverend i yanked once or twice more to no effect then i started twitching my fingers just to make sure they were still attached and suddenly cuddles let out with a sneeze that blew me halfway across the stall stop clowning around said sir mortimer taking a look at me as i rolled to a stop this is serious business right at that second i would have been hard pressed to tell you which of them i hated more cuddles or sir mortimer but i think sir mortimer was in the lead in fact the only reason i approached the dragons head again was because i knew sir mortimer wasnt going to let me out of that barn until wed finished our search this time i knew better than to stick out my hand in fact the more i studied old cuddles the more i got to wondering how anyone approached him and that led to my wondering how they got him into and out of the barn and into his cage and that led me to think that someone had to have trained him to obey some simple commands so i looked him right in his red eyes and said in the sternest voice i could muster under the circumstances sit and damned if he didnt sit right down on his haunches what did you do reverend asked sir mortimer running to my side i got a way with dumb animals i explained to sir mortimer now stand back and give him room down cuddles cuddles collapsed in a heap amazing said sir mortimer i started going over the harness while sir mortimer examined whatever it was he was examining but we had to admit after another ten minutes that there wasnt nothing hidden on cuddles i think id best examine his bedding next said sir mortimer do you think hell be willing to follow you outside i cant see no reason why not i said sliding open the door to his pasture come cuddles cuddles almost trampled sir mortimer as he got to his feet and bounded out into the pasture behind me he was feeling right frisky and he galloped once or twice around it before i noticed that he was starting to spout a little fire and i told him to stop then i saw a couple of lights go on in the fortress up on the hill overlooking the pasture which didnt bode no good and i figured that if i was gonna get in any kind of a setto with doctor aristotle ho and his friends that the safest thing to have on my side was a dragon so i told cuddles to stand still and then i ran to his south end and climbed all the way up his tail and back until i was sitting on top of his neck that made me feel a mite safer even though he didnt smell none too good and i waited for sir mortimer to finish going through the bedding and come out but when he finally showed up he did so in the company of three or four meanlooking chinamen who were pointing guns at him and following them was a thin chinaman with twoinch fingernails and a droopy mustache dressed all in black satin pajamas good evening reverend jones said the thin chinaman i dont know who you are brother i said but if you take one more step toward me im turning this here dragon loose on you for some reason that seemed to strike his funnybone because he kind of chuckled and didnt back off so much as a step i am doctor aristotle ho he said and that is my dragon i raised him from an infant and he would no more attack me than the sun and moon would veer from their heavenly courses he uttered a couple of terse commands in chinese and cuddles kneeled down and stretched out his neck flat on the ground there didnt seem much point to staying on him when he was like that so i climbed off doctor ho said something else and cuddles got up and meekly went back into his stall now the insidious oriental dentist turned to sir mortimer with an amused smile on his face trespassing breaking and entering stealing dragons he counted off what am i to do with you sir mortimer sir mortimer gave him a stiff upper british lip and didnt say a word and you he said turning to me why should you be conspiring against me lucifer jones what harm have i ever done to you howd you know my name i asked i know all about you he replied since the moment sir mortimer picked you up i have had my mignons tracing your every movement for the past five years i know about your misadventures in cairo and johannesburg about your arrests in nairobi and dar essalaam and mozambique about your ivory poaching and slave trading about the mutiny you led aboard a ship on the west coast of africa about your being banished from the continent forever a series of misunderstandings i said nothing more about your theft of the empire emerald in hong kong he continued unperturbed i even know that lo chung has put a price on your head he has and now here you are invading my property even riding my dragon frankly reverend jones i suspect that you are something less than a credit to your church let me tell you one doctor to another that i aint never done nothing to be ashamed of i said heatedly and if you got a couple of hours and maybe a cold drink with just enough alcohol to pound the germs into submission ill be happy to explain my side of all them incidents you just recited your explanation couldnt interest me less said doctor aristotle ho in fact under other circumstances i could have used a man of your peculiar abilities on my payroll well truth to tell the facts didnt run all that far amuck i said quickly what kind of job did you have in mind reverend jones said sir mortimer sternly you are speaking to the most insidious villain in this part of the world i got nothing but your word for that sir mortimer i pointed out all i know about this here gentleman is that he treats his animals well and he probably aint on speaking terms with the local manicurist you interest me reverend jones said aristotle ho are you going to believe that foul demon or are you going to believe me demanded sir mortimer i tell you doctor ho is planning the conquest of the entire world doctor ho turned and stared at sir mortimer for a minute more groundless accusations sir mortimer he said microdots shouted sir mortimer suddenly thats it hes hidden microdots on the dragons scales doctor ho shook his head sadly poor deluded man thats got to be the answer persisted sir mortimer weve searched everywhere else somewhere on that dragons skin are some microdots that doctor ho is selling to our enemies in europe probably the position of the pacific fleet if i let you examine every inch of my dragon will that finally satisfy you sir mortimer asked doctor ho you havent got the nerve said sir mortimer you know ill find what im looking for doctor ho turned to his men make sir mortimer comfortable for the night and when we ship the dragon tomorrow morning make sure that sir mortimer accompanies him he walked over to sir mortimer it will take approximately seven weeks for the dragon to reach its destination you will be given free access to him all the way there and all the way back his men started dragging sir mortimer off well that rids me of his unpleasant presence for the next few months said dr ho as he began walking back to his fortress hey i said what about me what about you asked doctor ho i thought we were gonna talk a little business i said i dont believe we shall said doctor ho why the hell not i demanded i took your side didnt i the alternative would have been a swift and painful death whats that got to do with anything reverend jones he said you are perhaps the only man of my acquaintance with even less regard for the laws and morals of society than i myself possess while i do not necessarily consider that a failing it does make it difficult for me to trust you well as i see it doctor ho you got two choices i told him you can take me on as a partner or have me as an enemy now if we was to become partners and you really do take over the world you could give me a little chunk of it like say australia and we could plunder it six ways to sunday and split the take right down the middle if on the other hand you decide youd rather have me as an enemy youre not only taking on me but the lord as well and take my word for it the lord can whip you in straight falls without working up much of a sweat there is a third alternative you know he said yeah what is that he pulled out a little pearlhandled revolver i can kill you right here and now which in my eagerness for gainful employment was an alternative i had plumb forgotten to take into account you look pale reverend jones said doctor ho and your knees are starting to shake i fear you must be coming down with fever well maybe ill just mosey back into peking and lie down for a week or two i suggested hopefully he nodded it would be best he reached out a bony hand and took mine in it let us part friends reverend jones that suits me more and more as i come to think on it i said sincerely i am glad to have had this little chat with you he continued you are a most interesting man i have the distinct feeling that our paths will cross again you do yes and next time the outcome may not be so pleasant you still plan to conquer the world that is a very indiscreet question reverend jones he said let me answer it this way whatever my plans may be sir mortimer will never thwart them again you mean there aint nothing hidden on the dragon or in his cage i said that is correct then how come sir mortimer is dead convinced that youre smuggling something out every time you ship the dragon sir mortimer is right said doctor ho with a smile the poor fool cannot see the forest for the trees doctor ho i said whatever happens in the future were parting friends tonight just between you and me and the gatepost no friend would keep another friend sleepless for days wondering what the hell he was shipping out in that cage he looked me up and down for a couple of minutes and then shrugged all right reverend jones said doctor ho this is the very last time i shall need this ploy so your knowledge will never be able to be used against me i will tell you the secret because it amuses me to do so and because only a mind like yours can fully appreciate the subtlety of it he paused sir mortimer will spend every day for the next seven weeks searching the dragon the straw the food and the water for these imaginary microdots and nonexistent jewels and drugs he will never find what he is looking for and he will never prevent me from receiving the money i need to continue my operations and yet hundreds of times each day he will be in physical contact with that which he seeks i dont think i follow you i said the cage reverend jones he said with a laugh the bars are made of pure platinum for five years sir mortimer has microscopically examined everything within the cage and has never thought to examine the cage itself well ill be damned i said that is a foregone conclusion doctor ho took me by the arm now that you know im afraid you must remain as my guest for a week until the cage is well on its way after that you are free to go anywhere you wish well he took me up to this stone fortress of his and gave me my own room and three squares a day and every afternoon he stopped by to play chess with me until he caught me moving one of his pieces when i thought he wasnt looking and after the week was up he gave me one final breakfast and had one of his men drive me into peking i read a few weeks later that there was a real live dragon on display in sydney so i figured doctor aristotle ho had gotten the funds he needed to conquer the world but as you will see i was just a little too preoccupied to worry much about it at the time the great wall the very first thing i learned in peking is that chinamen like games of chance every bit as much as white christian gents do the very last thing i learned in peking is that they are even quicker to spot a marked deck of cards than your average american or european the two learning experiences came about twenty minutes apart and before the morning was half over i was back on the road looking for some new place to settle down and build my tabernacle it was about this time that china was pretty much divided up into kingdoms and each kingdom was ruled by a warlord which may have been a little harsh on some of the local citizenry but sure saved a lot of time and effort at the ballot box and it occurred to me that after all the time they spent fighting each other at least some of the armies were probably in need of some spiritual comforting such as could only be brung to them by a sensitive and caring man of the cloth such as myself id picked up a smattering of chinese while on my way from macao to peking so once i was a few miles out of the city i stopped an old man who was taking his cow out for a walk and asked him where the nearest warlord had set up shop he told me that a general sim chows barracks were about forty miles south along the road we were on but suggested that the warlord most in need of spiritual uplifting and best able to pay for it due to his propensity to trade in certain of his homelands perishable commodities was general ling sen whose headquarters were many days march to the west i thanked him for his time and trouble and decided that id give general sim chow the first crack at my services since he was so much closer i began reappraising the situation when i came to a pile of bodies about ten miles later and when i saw a christian mission on fire a mile after that i decided that general ling sen sounded so deeply in need of salvation that there wasnt no time to waste so i took a hard right and started walking west id gone maybe seven or eight miles when i heard a drunken voice singing god save the king except when i got close enough to make out the words it was more like god save the liverpool ruggers team which truth to tell made a lot more sense as the liverpool ruggers team was in fifth place in the standings the last time id seen a paper in macau whereas the king didnt have no serious competition for the throne that i was aware of i kept walking and came upon an english soldier all dolled up in his parade best with a bright red jacket and a pith helmet sitting by the side of the road drinking from a bottle of rice wine come join me friend he said when he looked up and saw me and being the goodnatured christian that i am i mosied over and took a swig from his bottle are we still in china he asked after a moment unless they moved peking when i wasnt looking its half a days march from here i answered damn he said i dont think the wine will hold out he lowered his voice and pointed to a backpack full of wine bottles im drinking my way back to jolly old england aint you attached to some army unit or other i asked he shook his head unhappily theyre all lost but me i went out on a bit of a bender last month and when i came back everyone was missing so now im going back to england to report that my entire unit has gone awol and i alone am escaped to tell thee he reached his hand out merriweathers the name he added corporal marmaduke merriweather the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service i replied shaking his hand did you say doctor he said ive got a boil on my back that could use lancing i aint that kind of doctor i answered i suppose i could recite some of queen shebas racier amorous escapades over it if you think that might help he considered it for a moment then finally shook his head no i think not when all is said and done its the lot of the british soldier to suffer pain quietly and nobly well you got the noble part down pat brother merriweather but i heard you singing from half a mile away i keep hoping my army might hear me he responded glumly well i took another drink just as a show of solidarity and sympathy and then he took one and before long wed finished that bottle and another one and then night fell and we slept beneath a tree alongside the road and when morning came he decided to walk along with me until he came across his unit or england whichever came first well thats right neighborly of you i said i always feel safer in the company of his majestys armed forces and well you should he replied of course i traded my rifle for the wine and i seem to have misplaced my ammunition but still its my function in life to protect all things british i dont want to cause you no serious moral consternation brother merriweather i said but i aint british you speak british he said thats enough for me he paused for a moment by the way reverend jones i know where im going but you havent told me where youre heading yet im seeking the headquarters of general ling sen i said to offer them poor beleaguered soldiers a fighting shot at spiritual atonement if you will accept a gentle word of advice said merriweather spiritual atonement probably does not rank very high up on general ling sens list of priorities oh i said you know something about him he shook his head i know absolutely nothing about him then how do you figure that hes not in the market for a preacher the mere fact that i havent heard of him means that no one who has had any dealings with him has lived long enough to pass on that information to us he shrugged still i suppose its in our best interest to seek him out it is i asked since he had just loaded me down with a mighty tall heap of misgivings he nodded im already out of money and ill be out of rice wine in another few days possibly i can hire on as an advisor what kind of combat do you specialize in brother merriweather i asked combat he repeated do you think i joined the army to fight im an accountant an accountant some body has to pay for the uniforms and weapons and bullets and transportation and consumables he replied i mean empire is all very well and good reverend jones but only if it can remain cost effective and you figure this here general ling sen is in serious need of an accountant i asked him hes got an army to run hasnt he answered merriweather why with the things i could teach him about doubleentry bookkeeping alone he could continue to devastate the countryside for an extra three or four months at no additional cost well we kept on walking and drinking from merriweathers diminishing supply of rice wine and he kept trying to explain the more esoteric principles of taxloss carryforwards to me and one day kind of melted into another until one morning about a month later we came smackdab up against this great big wall and couldnt go no farther looks like general ling sen dont take kindly to visitors i opined as i looked both right and left and couldnt see the end of the wall nowhere in sight with a wall like this around his barracks one might say that he seems absolutely hostile to them agreed merriweather still i said a man who can build a wall this big probably aint exactly destitute true added merriweather in fact hes probably more in need of an accountant than most and if this here wall is half as long as it looks to be i got a feeling general ling sen ought to be happy to pay for a little heavenly insurance to make sure it dont get wiped out by earthquakes or floods or other such disasters as god is inclined to bring to them who dont toss a few coins into the poorbox every now and then i do believe were in business reverend jones said merriweather just then i heard some feet shuffling which one hardly ever tends to hear when standing on grass like we was so i looked up and sure enough there were three chinese soldiers looking down on us from atop the wall what are you doing here asked one of them in chinese just looking for general ling sens headquarters i answered why weve come all the way from across the sea to bring him spiritual and fiduciary comfort i said if you guys work for him why dont you run off and tell him his lucky day has arrived the three of them conferred for a long minute and then one ran off along the top of the wall and the other two trained their rifles on us do not move said one of them we must decide what to do with you a minute later a door opened about fifty feet away and the soldier who had run off stepped out of the wall and motioned us to come to him when we got there we found ourselves facing half a dozen armed soldiers who escorted us up this winding staircase and after we climbed up maybe fifty feet or so we stepped out through another door onto the top of the wall which was a lot broader than it looked from the ground i heard a motor off to my left and when i turned i saw a brandnew bentley sedan driving right toward us i was still wondering how they managed to get it onto the wall in the first place when it came to a stop and a big fat chinaman stepped out his chest and most of his belly all covered with medals i have been told that you wish to speak with me he said in english we do if youre general ling sen i said general ling sen is no longer in charge here he said i am general chang well i said with a shrug it aint like general ling sen was a close personal friend or nothing this here is corporal marmaduke merriweather of his majestys armed forces and im the honorable doctor jones internationallyknown man of the cloth which was probably true since there were still warrants out for my arrest in illinois and egypt and morocco and kenya and the congo and south africa and i didnt suppose they could all have forgotten me so soon doctor lucifer jones he said now howd you come to know that i asked surprised he smiled your reputation precedes you doctor jones he answered already you have become something of a legend in hong kong and macau you dont say i very much do say replied general chang he turned to merriweather and what have we here a deserter from the british army they deserted me replied merriweather im still here at my post why have you sought me out doctor jones asked general chang i hear tell you run a territory of considerable size and complexity i said so i just naturally figured that such a big bunch of ignorant yellow heathen meaning no offense would probably be in dire need of spiritual uplifting and maybe a nightly bingo tournement the profits of which the tabernacle of saint luke would be more than happy to split with the employer of these poor lost souls and you asked general chang turning back to merriweather i should like to enlist in your army said merriweather good we can always use more men i trust that youre accomplished at garroting and gouging out eyes well actually my specialty is accountancy said merriweather our specialties are conquest pillage and rape said general chang youll just have to adjust he turned to two of his men take him away and see that hes properly equipped but began merriweather no please dont thank me said general chang as they began ushering merriweather away all i ask is total unquestioning loyalty and obedience you can keep your gratitude for another occasion so general i said when merriweather was out of earshot have we got a deal i think not doctor jones said general chang christianity is such a sterile repressed religion not the way i practice it i assured him the answer is no he said firmly which is not to say that i might not have some other use for you long as the pay is good and it dont involve no heavy lifting i suppose the good lord could spare me for a couple of weeks i answered come with me back to my quarters he said signaling his car to turn around well talk as we drive suits me i said climbing into the bentley by the way just where is this kingdom of yours youre on it i mean how far does it extend i asked looking off at the hills that rose up in the distance hundreds of miles he replied really i said you must own half of china even better he said with a smile i own a sixhundred mile section of the great wall any traffic from one side to the other must pay me a healthy tribute yeah he nodded and it just so happens that our most fertile poppy fields are on the west side of the wall while our best markets for them are on the east side he paused in truth i cannot take credit for it it was general ling sen who first saw the potential of taking control of the wall and of course the wall itself was built to be easily defended he lit up a cigar yes theres no question of it general ling sen was a visionary of the highest order what happened to him i asked ah poor general ling sen said general chang with feeling surrounded by selfish disloyal officers he was betrayed by the most vicious of them who was that i asked me said general chang it was a dreadful villainous despicable thing to do and if i had the slightest vestige of a conscience i am quite certain i would be thoroughly ashamed of myself he smiled at me however to be perfectly candid with you i must confess that i am enjoying the consequences of my unspeakable actions beyond my wildest expectations well they say confession is good for the soul i replied it strikes me that youre doing your poor blackened soul a heap of good just by telling me all this you are a man after my own heart doctor jones said general chang it is so rare that i meet anyone with whom i see eye to eye and then when i do i am usually forced to kill him before he can do the same to me it seemed like a good time to change the subject so i asked him exactly what kind of work he had in mind for me as you know doctor jones my kingdom is some six hundred miles long so you said on the other hand it is only sixtyfive feet wide that means that he pulled a pencil and paper out of a pocket and did some quick calculating the full extent of my kingdom is less than seven square miles but as real estate goes theyre prime miles i pointed out nevertheless i have decided to expand my empire gonna take over more of the wall i asked he shook his head no matter how much of the wall we own we remain at the mercy of anyone who wishes to lay siege to us i have decided that it is time to take over general how kungs territory where is this general how kung located i asked he pointed out the window to the west he owns everything your eye can see and beyond if i had his territory not only could i be assured of feeding my men but i would never have to worry about fighting a twofront war he smiled at me thats where you come in me yes doctor jones for reasons i cannot fathom general how kung distrusts me probably he is still carrying a childish grudge simply because i burned his village and stole his wife at any rate you shall be my emissary he paused you will seek him out guarantee his safety agree to any conditions he sets and get him to come and meet with me suddenly he smiled then after i murder him i shall pay you the sum of one thousand british pounds i dont want to throw no spanner in the works i said cautiously but aint this general how kung likely to have some friends and relations that might consider such treatment unnecessarily harsh we live in a darwinian world reverend jones replied general chang to the victor belongs the spoils how do you think how kung got to be a general in the first place the bentley came to a stop in front of a guardhouse that had been built into the wall ah here we are would you care to join me in a drink plotting to kill chinese warlords can be pretty thirsty work so i got out of the car with him and followed him into his house where he pulled out a bottle of whiskey while i was admiring all the treasures he had picked up during his travels he poured us each a large glass and we got to talking about this and that and pretty soon he was asking me all about my adventures on the dark continent and i was asking him all about his wars of conquest and suddenly it was getting on to midnight and we were on our third bottle im feeling dizzy said general chang getting kind of unsteadily to his feet i think i need a breath of fresh air sounds good to me i said getting up and following him out onto the wall lovely night said general chang staggering just a bit it was on a night just like this that i killed general ling sen poor fellow how did you do it i asked he walked to the eastern edge of the wall i called him over to this very spot told him i thought i saw someone prowling around on the ground and then when he leaned over to look i pushed him off i mosied over to where he was standing and looked down that must be a good fifty feet or so i said it was a relatively painless death said general chang starting to slur his words i dont believe he felt a thing for the first fortynine feet maybe we ought to plant a cross or something to commemorate the unhappy event i said i like that said general chang someday hundreds of years from now historians can come to the wall and see the very spot where i became a general i like the way you think doctor jones perhaps i shall permit you to become my biographer he balanced himself precariously on the very edge of the wall and pointed down he hit the ground right there by them little white flowers i asked no he said peering into the darkness and swaying precariously it was right next to the bush i cant see no bush i said maybe its further down the wall nonsense said general chang i know where i pushed him off well maybe the bush died then i said but all i can see is grass and some flowers you must be even drunker than i am doctor jones he said irritably its right down there he leaned over the wall and pointed and suddenly he wasnt there any more and a second later i heard a yell of oh shit and then a loud thud and i looked down and there was general chang lying flat on his back fifty feet below me we were both right he mumbled just before he died the bush is in blossom well this turn of events caused me no little consternation as you might imagine especially since i wasnt the only one who had heard him fall suddenly soldiers began approaching me from every direction and i suggested to my silent partner that if he had stockpiled any miracles in my heavenly account this might be a pretty good time for me to cash a couple of them in the soldiers came to a stop a few feet away from me and a couple of them walked over to the edge of the wall and looked down you have killed general chang said one of them in a shocked whisper i can explain everything i said it aint my fault do not be so modest general jones said another general jones i repeated to the victor belongs the spoils he said yeah you defeated general chang in personal combat that makes you our leader at least until someone defeats you i looked around and saw at least half a dozen oversized chinamen who looked like they were chomping at the bit to do just that what would have happened if hed just gotten drunk and fell off the wall i asked since he was in your company wed probably put you to death for not protecting him well as long as were being open and aboveboard i said i got to admit that he put up one hell of a fight not that the outcome was ever in doubt i added for the benefit of those who were thinking of moving up in the ranks he was our greatest warrior said the soldier many of our strongest men have challenged him but none was ever victorious all in a days work i said with becoming modesty the soldier turned to his companions general chang is dead he yelled long live general jones long live general jones they all shouted back well now thats a right touching sentiment i said and me and the lord will certainly do our best to lead you to victory after victory when the cheering had stopped i explained to them that i was going to set up housekeeping in general changs quarters while i plotted out our future conquests that set off a whole new round of cheering except for the five or six biggest of them who had such lean and hungry looks whenever they stared at me that i decided it was time to leave the celebration and go to general changs guardhouse to consider my situation a couple of minutes after i got there i heard a knock at the door and then marmaduke merriweather let himself in i heard the news he said when he had closed the door behind him i suppose congratulations are in order thanks brother merriweather i said if i may be so bold as to say so i think a hasty retreat might be in even better order he continued somehow you dont seem to frighten them the way general chang did are a couple of em considering challenging me i asked its more like a couple of them arent he replied the rest are practically drawing straws to see who will be first i was kind of afraid they might take that attitude i said it doesnt seem fair somehow said merriweather sympathetically i always thought that being a warlord was a lifetime position oh it is brother merriweather i assured him the problem is that lifetime seems to be a very elastic term in these here parts what do you plan to do about it he asked im still mulling on it i said after all ive only been the warlord for about twenty minutes i aint got all the nuances of the job nailed down yet well as i see it he said youve got two choices you can flee to the east or you can flee to the west running away is against my principles i said especially when theres a fortune in jade knickknacks in the next room but the only alternative is to fight every challenger he pointed out well i suppose thats what ill have to do i said me being the honorable christian gentleman that i am meaning no disrespect he said but if i were making book on the event youd be a fiftytoone underdog against each and every opponent thats what they said about old jonah i replied and he wound up harpooning the whale i hate to correct you reverend jones but he wound up inside the whale said merriweather only in the british translation i said now i appreciate your concern brother merriweather but my minds made up get some of them soldiers in here so i can announce my intentions he shrugged and walked out onto the wall then returned a minute later with a couple of soldiers in tow you sent for us general jones asked one of them snapping off a nifty salute yeah i said its come to my attention that some of the men think they can advance in rank pretty much the same way i did is that right i believe so general jones i think were gonna have to nip this in the bud i said i want you to pass the word up and down the wall that i plan to take em all on one at a time comes morning our army extends for three hundred miles in each direction general jones he replied it will take at least two days for word to pass up and down the ranks all right i said whats tomorrow tuesday fine you tell em that im going into training and that on thursday morning i plan to drive to the bentley to south end of the army and work my way north taking on all challengers one at a time what about the ones who are outside right now theyll just have to wait their turn i said after all fair is fair tell em i should be able to get to them by friday afternoon you have that much confidence in your ability asked the soldier i beat general chang without working up a sweat didnt i i answered well he didnt have no answer to that so he just saluted and left and started spreading the word like i told him to is there anything i can do to help reverend jones asked merriweather when we were alone again well id sure hate to be late for all these battles to the death i said why dont you spend the next couple of days making sure that the bentley is all fueled up and in good working order i had in mind something more like lowering you down the side of the wall with a rope he said if solomon had run from goliath where would we all be now i replied he just stared at me sighed shook his head and walked out into the night i locked the door behind him spent the next couple of hours doing a quick inventory of general changs jade collection and finally hunted up the bedroom and went to sleep i hung around the guardhouse for the next two days finishing up general changs store of imported scotch whiskey and watching merriweather work on the bentley just before sundown on wednesday i wandered over to the building they were using for a mess hall found an empty straw basket and packed myself a big lunch so i wouldnt have to waste any time hunting up a restaurant between fights and left a wakeup call for five in the morning i got up at about four oclock dumped the lunch under my bed and filled up the basket with a pile of general changs better jade trinkets then i went out to where the bentley was parked and put a couple of tengallon drums of gas into the trunk merriweather knocked on my front door at five on the dot and i loaded the straw basket into back seat saluted the row of soldiers that were lined up to see me off and climbed into the car beside him wake me when weve got about ten miles to go i said as he headed off down the middle of the wall how can you sleep at a time like this demanded merriweather im a nervous wreck just relax and trust to the lord i said closing my eyes and leaning back i must have fell sound asleep then because the next thing i knew the car had come to a stop reverend jones said merriweather shaking my shoulder gently yeah what is it you said to let you know when we were within ten miles of our destination thanks i said im gonna stretch and get some of the kinks out i opened the door and stepped out into the morning air some soldiers had gathered around so i popped open the trunk and asked one of em to load the canisters of gasoline into the tank while i walked over to the edge of the wall and attended to a call of nature ill drive the rest of the way i told merriweather when i returned to the car itll help get my reflexes sharp he scooted over to the passengers side and i spent the next couple of minutes getting used to the bentley which was a mighty fine car except that someone had gotten all mixed up and put the steering wheel and pedals on the wrong side i wonder how fast this baby can go i said as we got to within two miles of my first fistic encounter the speedometer goes up to one hundred and fifty he answered is that miles or kilometers i asked he shrugged i dont know lets open her up and find out i said pressing the gas pedal down to the floor careful reverend jones he yelled as we barreled along the top of the wall sending soldiers jumping for cover youll get us killed only if i stop or slow down i said sincerely and suddenly we were past the last of the soldiers and merriweather finally figured out what was happening and started laughing his head off we heard some gunfire behind us but whoever built that wall just didnt know when to call it quits and we drove another four hundred miles before we finally ran out of gas and had to get out and start walking we came to a pair of towers in about half a mile one on each side of the wall each with a staircase leading down to the ground well its been a fascinating experience reverend jones said merriweather walking over to the staircase that led to the west but ive really got to continue my journey to england the sooner they know the army is missing the sooner they can send out search parties somehow the notion of footslogging across the gobi desert didnt seem as appealing to me as it did to him so i bid him farewell and clambered down the stairs on the east side of the wall all set to sell general changs jade baubles to the highest bidder so i could finally get around to building my tabernacle the abominable snowman i spent the next week walking south since i had the gobi to the west and a bunch of warlords to the east i kept thinking that a town ought to pop into view any minute but i didnt see nothing except a bunch of farmfields and an occasional former warlord being hung out to dry and i began thinking that my picnic basket could have used a little less jade and a little more lunch i was sitting down in the shade of a tree thinking that whoever had called china a crowded country hadnt actually tried walking across it when i heard a familiar voice coming from behind me well ill be damned if it aint the reverend lucifer jones i got to my feet and turned around and found myself facing capturing clyde calhoun decked out in his usual khakis and pith helmet and leading a safari column well howdy clyde i said i aint seen you since mozambique what are you doing in these here parts same as usual he said walking up and shaking my hand collecting animals for my circus them what survives getting captured anyway the rest go to museums and gourmet chefs and other interested parties i aint seen hide nor hair of any animals since i got here i said well they take a heap of finding he said but i just picked up seventythree giant pandas from the bamboo forest up north thats a lot of pandas i said i hear tell theyre an endangered species they are now he agreed patting his rifle fondly maybe you should have left some for the chinese i suggested oh i left em enough to breed he assured me suddenly he frowned unless both of em was females he took a swig from his canteen and then offered it to me how about yourself lucifer he continued as i took a long drink of water what are you doing out here in the middle of china mostly looking for a way out i admitted well im headed for tibet he said why dont you come along with me i could use a little companionship none of my bearers speak any american whats so special about tibet i asked thats where well find the abominable snowman he replied sounds ugly i said or at least sadly lacking in manners hes worth a pretty penny back in the states confided calhoun fifty grand stuffed and mounted and at least twice that much if hes still mildly alive and twitching he paused for a minute tell you what you come along with me and ill not only give you three squares a day but ill split the take with you if you find him first which suddenly make tibet start looking a whole lot more interesting clyde i said you got yourself a deal whats for lunch he had a couple of his people set up a table and his chef whipped us up some panda sandwiches and we washed em down with a few beers and got to reminiscing about old times and before we knew it it was getting dark so we wound up spending the night right there we were up bright and early the next morning and we made pretty good time especially considering that clyde had this habit of stopping every couple of minutes to shoot birds or squirrels or anything else that this regretable tendancy to breathe in and out i kept expecting to run into some warlord or other but clyde kept shooting so much that all the local warlords must have figured the imperial army was on the march and hightailed it out of our path because we didnt see nary a one during the whole trek after a couple of months it started getting right chilly at night and pretty soon the days werent much warmer and finally we had to stop long enough to make us a pair of fur coats out of panda skins when we finally hit the kunlun mountains clyde paid off about eighty of his bearers and skinners and sent em packing and just kept a cook and a couple of trackers with us now its entirely possible that theres a piece of level ground somewhere in tibet but if there is i never did see it we started following footpaths up the mountains hunting for a pass to the other side where clyde was sure he could get a line on the abominable snowman in a little town called saka but once we found the pass all it did was lead us out of the kunlun mountains into the tangkula mountains which were even higher and colder and before long we were sitting in a cave at about ten thousand feet in the middle of a howling blizzard warming our hands next to a fire hed built and trying real hard not to listen to our teeth chattering the weather had cleared by morning and as we wandered out of the cave we came upon some tracks in the snow looks like we had some polar bears hanging around last night i said aint no polar bears in tibet answered clyde squatting down and examining them these here tracks was made by something what walks upright and stands maybe eight feet tall he looked up at me with a great big smile i dont think were gonna have to go to saka after all i think maybe we just lucked out and are sharing this mountain with the abominable snowman yeah he nodded vigorously lets split up forces and go out searching for him ill follow his tracks and you go the other direction just in case he circled around and well meet back at the cave at nightfall he started walking off aint you gonna take your gunbearer or your tracker with you i asked too dangerous he shouted back best to leave this kind of work to experienced hunters i dont want to cast no pall of gloom on the proceedings clyde but i aint an experienced hunter or even an inexperienced one if push comes to shove then wait in the cave with the others ill be back in a few hours which made excellent sense and which is what i did clyde piled in at twilight with little icicles hanging down from his moustache and immediately sat down by the fire howd it go i asked since i didnt see no snowman abominable or otherwise in tow the tracks vanished about a mile from here he said holding his hands out to warm them i spent most of the afternoon hunting for his lair but i couldnt find it he paused thoughtfully i think tomorrow ill lay some traps for him tell me more about this here snowman i said aint that much to tell answered clyde the locals call him the yeti and near as i can figure out he spends most of his time hanging around the mountain doing abominable things anybody ever seen him probably said clyde but i get the distinct impression that them whats actually encountered him have passed on to the next plane of existence with remarkable alacrity i wonder what he eats i mused hoping that he hadnt developed a taste for christian missionary somewhere along the way beats me said clyde if its anything but snow and rocks he must be one hungry snowman suddenly he looked up say you gave me an idea lucifer i think ill bait some of them traps with the last of the panda meat i told him i thought it was a good plan especially since id had my fill and then some of panda steaks and then we turned in and the next morning clyde was out laying his traps as soon as the sun came up i asked kim our cook to fix me up some coffee he came back a couple of minutes later with a pot of tea i said i wanted coffee i told him coffee all gone he said you drink tea i didnt think no more of it but when clyde went out the next morning to bait more traps i asked for tea and this time what i got was a pitcher of hot water tea all gone too explained kim just how much tea did clyde drink last night i asked him no drink tea at night just whiskey maybe he took it with him this morning i suggested twenty pounds of it replied kim that did seem like a lot of tea no matter how eleven oclockish clyde might feel so i got to thinking and it didnt take me long to figure out that someone was swiping our supplies and since the bearer and the tracker hadnt gone out in two days and there wasnt no place inside the cave to stash it i figured it had to be someone else and since there was only one other person who was crazy enough to be wandering around on the mountain in this weather i decided that things were suddenly looking up for my bank account clyde returned at sunset and immediately started warming himself by the fire howd it go i asked oh hes out there all right answered clyde and hes a smart one too how so he managed to pick up one of the panda steaks without getting snared ill have to camouflage my traps better we talked for a while settled down for a hard evenings drinking and fell asleep just about the time the nightly blizzard started blowing the next morning i waited until clyde had left then told kim to fix me up a dozen sandwiches while he was busy making them i got into my panda coat and picked up one of clydes auxiliary rifles when kim was done i put the sandwiches into a backpack and then as an afterthought i added twelve bottles of beer and told him i was going out for a little exercise and to maybe hunt up a grocery store i saw clydes footprints heading off to the left so i turned right and began following a narrow ridge that wound its way down the mountain i stopped about every half mile took a sandwich and a beer out of my backpack and placed them on the snow after about three miles the path i was on started branching every which way but that didnt bother me none since all i had to do to get back was turn around and follow my footprints so i just kept on wandering and setting down sandwiches and beer the snow was right deep and the altitude wasnt exactly a boon to serious breathing and by the time id emptied my backpack i figured it was getting on toward midafternoon so i turned around and started heading back to the cave id gone about half a mile and was just turning a corner around a big boulder when i saw this huge shaggy figure maybe eight feet high standing about two hundred yards away with its back to me eating a sandwich and washing it down with a beer i figured the safest course was to fire a warning shot just to kind of get its attention and let it know i was armed so i pointed the rifle straight up at the sky and pulled the trigger i think i ought to break into my narrative at this point to make a suggestion born of bitter experience if you ever find yourself on a narrow ledge of a snowcovered mountain in tibet firing a nitro express into the air probably aint the smartest course of action available to you when i woke up i felt kind of constricted i thought i heard the sounds of digging but i couldnt move or even turn my head to see what was happening then after a couple of minutes had passed i felt two huge hands grab me by the shoulders and pull me up through the snow and suddenly i was facing this great big guy who was wearing a shaggy coat made out of sheepskin all right he said holding me off the ground by my shoulders and shaking me who are you the right reverend doctor lucifer jones youre from guido scarducci right he said finally putting me down i aint never heard of him i said brushing myself off then why did you shoot at me he demanded i thunk you was the yeti whats a yeti he asked well as near as i can tell a yeti is you i said except it sure sounds to me like youre speaking one hundred percent pure american of course i am he said i was raised in butte montana whats a fellow american doing on a mountain in tibet i asked its a long and tragic story doctor jones he said sitting down on a big rock my name is sam hightower by the time i was fifteen years old i was seven feet tall and still growing so i figured that playing basketball was my calling in life and as soon as i got out of high school i latched onto a semipro team called the butte buccaneers about a week before we were scheduled to play the great falls geldings for the championship for which we were a real big favorite a gambler called guido scarducci came up and offered me five thousand dollars to make sure we didnt win by more than ten points no sense embarrassing the other team i said sympathetically those were my feelings precisely said hightower the problem is that the next night another gambler named vinnie bastino offered me twenty thousand to make sure we won by fifteen points or more i can see where that might present a serious moral and economic dilemma i said well i was young and innocent and didnt view it as such said hightower i just figured id pay mr scarducci his five thousand back out of my earnings and wed be all square and thered be no hard feellngs and we might even have a laugh about it over a drink or two i take it he didnt quite see it that way i said i realized he and i had a little communication problem when he blew up my car and set fire to my apartment that night said hightower and when he missed me and shot six of my teammates during the victory parade the next day i figured it was probably time to take my leave of the fair city of my birth so i hopped the first train heading east and wound up in new york he paused problem is he found me there too and in london and in rome i finally decided that its not all the easy to disappear in a crowd when youre eight foot two inches tall so after he found me again in athens i made up my mind to go where there werent any crowds at all and ive been living on this damned mountain for six years now waiting for guido scarducci to hunt me down you hang around here much longer and youre gonna get yourself hunted by a lot more people than guido scarducci i told him why he asked surely borrowing a little coffee and tea isnt a capital offense even in tibet this aint got nothing to do with coffee or tea i said you ever hear of the abominable snowman i heard legends when i was growing up just like i heard about bigfoot and paul bunyon well most folks in these parts think youre him why on earth should they think that he asked kind of bewildered well the notion of an eightfoot basketball player hiding out from gamblers on top of a mountain in tibet probably aint had time to take root yet i explained yeah he said thoughtfully now that i come to consider it i can see your point i assume thats why you were shooting at me i nodded after all you did go for my bait you know how hard it is to find food up here he replied he rubbed his jaw and i damned near broke a tooth on that frozen meat you put out yesterday i didnt put it out i said which reminds me wed better get back to my cave so i can tell capturing clyde not to shoot you capturing clyde calhoun he said excitedly youve heard of him ive seen all his movies and read all his books said hightower hes one of my boyhood heroes im sure hell be mighty glad to hear it i said but surely im not in any danger from him continued hightower i mean doesnt capturing clyde always bring em back alive well now thats subject to various delicate shades of interpretation i said but i think its fair to say that them what he brings back without eating or skinning first is generally alive still i added if i was you id introduce myself to him right quick and preferably when he wasnt carrying his gun he stood up and looked up the mountain im afraid that wont be possible doctor jones he said why not i asked because when you fired your rifle you started an avalanche that seems to have brought down half the mountain we could be days or even weeks getting back to your cave what are we going to do in the meantime i asked ive got shelters hidden all over the mountain answered hightower well find one that hasnt been covered by the avalanche and use it for a headquarters while we try to clear the trail to your cave well i couldnt think of no better alternative and so i followed him to one of his shelters where he had a fire going and an old handcranked victrola and lots of rudy vallee records which werent really to my taste but were a lot better than just sitting there listening to the wind whistle by he was real interested in finding out what events of earth shaking import had transpired since hed left the states in rather a hurry so i told him about how the red sox had traded babe ruth to the yankees and how clara bow had encouraged the southern california football team to win the rose bowl and that one of our presidents had died but i couldnt remember which one he was especially glad to hear that morvich had won the kentucky derby i put all my money on him just before i took off he explained well you ought to have a tidy nest egg waiting for you when you finally go home i said i doubt it he replied with a sigh my bookie was guido scarducci maybe theres some subtle little nuance im missing here i said but aint guido scarducci the fellow thats out to kill you yes then why on earth did you bet your money at his particular establishment hightower shrugged he was the only bookie in montana i suddenly found myself silently agreeing that tibet was probably just the place for him to hang out while his survival skills were catching up with the rest of his growth but i kept these sentiments to myself since i make it a practice never to offend anyone over eight feet tall unless it aint avoidable the nightly blizzard came and went and we were out at sunrise the next morning digging a path up to clydes cave it wasnt all that hard to dig through the snow but every half hour or so wed come to a boulder that we couldnt climb over or walk around and as you might imagine it kind of slowed our progress hightower was afraid clyde might be trapped in his cave but i figured that clyde was used to taking care of himself in strange lands and ticklish situations and in truth the one thing that kept me going through all them days of digging and shoving boulders down the mountainside was the thought of all that jade sitting there in my picnic basket after a week we ran out of food and had to change shelters and after two more weeks all the shelters were plumb out of food and we figured if we didnt reach clyde in another day or two we were going to have to climb down the mountain and borrow a little food from some of the locals hightower assured me that it wouldnt be no problem since whenever they saw him they started screaming and running the other way which up to now had made him think he should maybe have packed some deoderant when he left athens but which he finally realized was just their reaction to him being the abominable snowman anyway we finally cleared the way to clydes cave on the twentysecond day and much to our surprise we found that it was deserted except for a note and some kind of printed ticket that hed stuck onto the wall right near the entrance and which i picked up and read as follows dear lucifer i went out looking for you after i heard the shot but i soon saw that you were probably buried under half the mountain if that is true and you are dead then read no further but if you are alive and manage to make your way back here i should tell you that after waiting a week for you to show up i have figgered that you and the yeti are both dead and have therefore decided to make tracks for australia where i got me a commission to hunt down a few hundred koala bears at least they figure to make better eating than panda meat it seems a shame to leave all your jade doodads to rot here in the cave so i am taking them with me back to civilization and will buy a drink to your sainted memory with some of the profits when i sell them and just in case you aint dead i want you to know that i am a honorable man what would never rob a friend and i am leaving you a lifetime pass to capturing clydes circus and wild animal show in exchange for taking the trinkets with me your pal or rest in peace whichever is applicable clyde calhoun i crumpled up both the letter and the lifetime pass and threw them to the floor of the cave the son of a bitch ran off with my jade i said you cant eat jade said hightower unhappily he might at least have left us some food well we got no money and we got no food i said i reckon its time we took our leave of this here mountain where will we go asked hightower im still a wanted man you know well theres no sense going back into china i said theyd probably just ask a bunch of bothersome questions about general changs knickknacks i figure our best bet is to head south if we go south well run into the himalayas said hightower religious sects dont bother me none i replied confidently ill convert em in no time flat i walked out of the cave and started heading south having wasted the better part of three months and a modest fortune in jade while wandering around the countryside with clyde and i promised my silent partner that the next time i took charge of a wall or an army or anything big like that i was setting up shop and finally building my tabernacle but as you will soon see it wasnt quite as easy as it sounds the land of eternal youth it took hightower and me another month before we hit anything resembling civilization at which time we found ourselves in katmandu which has a real exotic name but truth to tell aint a lot different from boise or dubuque except that its a hell of a lot colder in the summers and hardly any of the locals speak english still mathematics is a universal language and i soon replenished our coffers in a series of friendly little contests involving pasteboards and various combinations of the number twentyone it was only after a couple of disgruntled losers started complaining that my deck added up to a lot more twenty ones than their decks did that i decided it was time to hit the road again where are you heading asked hightower someplace warm i said whats south of here india then thats where im heading i cant go with you he said why not i asked from everything i hear indias a pretty crowded place he answered and the bigger the crowd the more i stand out ill be much safer finding a nice little village in nepal and settling down here guido scarduccis probably forgot all about you by now i said have you ever known a bookie to forget a debt he asked well i didnt have no quick and ready comforting answer to that so i bid him goodbye packed enough food for a month and lit out of katmandu just in time to avoid a tedious discussion about the laws of statistical averages with some of the locals i made pretty good progress for a week or so but then a major league blizzard came up and by the time it ended two days later all the roads and trails were covered and within another week i was forced to admit that i was about as lost as people ever get to be then one day i came to a pass that led to a winding trail down a mountainside and suddenly it wasnt so cold anymore and before long the snow vanished and i was walking on grass i could see a great big green valley stuck smack in the middle of the mountains and i decided to head on over to it to see if i could rustle up a hot meal and maybe a friendly game of chance or two just before i reached the valley i came to a rickety wooden bridge leading over a stream and on the other side of it was a bunch of men who looked kind of chinese lining a path that led up to this enormous white temple which in turn was surrounded by a batch of little white houses well they just stared at me without saying nothing so i put on my friendliest smile and crossed the bridge and was about to introduce myself when the strangest damned thing happened the second i got to their side of the creek they all got to their knees and bowed their heads which could have meant anything from them all being ready for a friendly game of craps to this being the quickest mass conversion in my experience as a man of the cloth then a tall thin man came out of one of the houses and walked up to me greetings he said i am tard me too i said this place take a heap of getting to you misunderstand me he said tard is my name and im the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service i said group weddings and funerals done cheap we have been waiting for you doctor jones said tard you have i said yes he replied welcome to the kingdom of shalimar i dont recall seeing anyplace called shalimar on any of the maps of the area i said he just kind of chuckled at that you must be tired and hungry after your journey i will have your rooms prepared while you are eating well thats right neighborly of you brother tard i said it is my job to serve you he answered if there is anything you want anything at all you have but to tell me and it shall be arranged you act like this to all your guests i asked you are our first visitor in almost two hundred years he replied probably just as well i said admiring the sight of some young ladies walking through the fields with water pitchers on their heads if the travel agents ever find out about this place theyll ruin it still i added i dont know how you could have been expecting me this little stopover wasnt exactly on my itinerary nonetheless we have been expecting you doctor jones he paused doesnt it strike you as unusual that everyone has knelt down the instant they have seen you truth to tell i been mulling on it brother tard i admitted i finally figured that theyd just never seen such a goodlooking white man before and didnt know quite what else to do about it he shook his head this is their traditional way of greeting the high lama he looks a lot like me does he i asked he has been dead for one hundred and thirtyfour years answered tard but according to our legends the day would come when a pale man from a distant land would cross over the bridge to shalimar and he would become the high lama he turned to me and now the legend has come true well now thats right interesting brother tard i said what does the job pay i dont think you understand doctor jones said tard the high lama is the absolute ruler of shalimar he is our physical master and our conduit to god the absolute ruler you say that is correct i looked at a couple of nubile young maidens who were coming out of the temple and winked at one of em who blushed and got down on her knees right quick the high lama is your conduit to god thats right and anything the high lama says goes of course well brother tard i said shooting him a great big smile your prayers have been answered talking to god is one of the best things i do me being a man of the cloth and all i pulled a cigar out of my pocket and lit it up while surveying my kingdom why dont you join me for lunch and explain some of the intricacies of the job i am merely your chief administrator said tard it would be better for the high priestess to discuss the more esoteric details of your position with you sounds good to me i said ive always had a soft spot in my heart for high priestesses we entered the temple and i found myself facetoface with a big golden statue of a lion which had rubies the size of golf balls for eyes and a bunch of diamonds for teeth as i looked around i saw a bunch of other little gemcovered trinkets that put general changs collection of jade knickknacks to shame doctor jones said tard after id spent a proper amount of time appreciating them please follow me he led me through a batch of rooms each bigger and finer than the last and finally we came to one that had a huge table in the middle of it at the center of the table was an ornate silver bowl filled with fruit please make yourself comfortable said tard i will go fetch the high priestess he walked to a doorway and turned to me she will be so happy to know that you have finally arrived doctor jones she has been waiting seventy years to instruct you shes seventy years old i asked no shes much closer to one hundred and ten answered tard but shes only been the high priestess for seventy well as you can imagine this kind of dampened my enthusiasm but i didnt see no way out of meeting with her so i just pulled an apple out of the bowl and started munching on it and about the time i was done i looked up and there in the doorway was this voluptuous young lady with long black hair and big brown eyes all done up in a white silk outfit that didnt hide anywhere near as much as she seemed to think it did good afternoon doctor jones she said in the sweetest voice i ever did hear its getting better by the minute i agreed whats your name lisara she said giving me a great big toothy smile well lisara honey i said i got to meet with some wrinkled old high priestess in the next couple of minutes but once i get rid of her what do you say to coming up to my room for an intimate little dinner for two i am the high priestess doctor jones she said i guess the thought of meeting with the high lama was too much for the last one huh i said send my regrets to her family and remind me to bring a wreath to the funeral i have been the high priestess for seventy years she said come on i said you cant be much more than nineteen or twenty years old i am one hundred and eleven youre kidding right no i truly am one hundred and eleven years old then how come you look like you do i asked i avoid all fats and starches she said and i jog five miles every morning and thats all there is to it well thats why i look fit she explained as for why i look young it is because i live in shalimar this is the land of eternal youth no one ever ages here come to think of it i didnt see no old codgers on the path up to the temple i said there arent any said lisara the oldest of us all is tard he was alive when the last high lama died she paused it is something in the air i think then why do you keep this place such a secret i asked you could put miami beach and the riviera out of business we have everything we need she replied we have no desire to be overrun by outsiders you could at least send a team to the senior olympics and clean up making side bets on em she shook her head sadly once a citizen of shalimar leaves the aging process accelerates before he passes beyond the mountains that surround us he is a gnarled and withered travesty of a human being yeah i can see where that might present a problem or two i said especially in the sprints and high hurdles but we have no wish to leave she continued our life here has been idyllic and now that we once again have a high lama it will be perfect well now that you brought the subject up i said just what does the high lama do you are our spiritual leader she explained it is your job to probe the eternal verities i can think of a lot of em that need probing i agreed getting into the spirit of it like why do elevators all arrive at the same time or why does it always rain right after you wax your car why does traffic always move faster in the other lane those are not precisely the ones i had in mind she said why dont you come up to my room tonight i said we can discuss what you got in mind plus a couple of things i got in mind oh i couldnt do that doctor jones she said well if its a problem i could come to your room i said agreeably she shook her head the high lama must avoid even the appearance of impropriety whats the point of being the high lama in the first place if i cant pay a social call on a lovely young lady when im of a mind to i asked it simply isnt done she said you are our spiritual leader no reason why i cant do both i said i always set aside sunday mornings for saving souls you do not understand doctor jones she said the high priestess must forsake all earthly pleasures thats kind of a rigid job qualification aint it i said no one ever said that being the high priestess was easy she answered i made up my mind then and there to issue an executive order or whatever it was high lamas did to the effect that it was okay for the high priestess to indulge in a little hankypanky from time to time and was about to mention it to her when a couple of lesser priestesses arrived with lunch and since i hadnt seen no cooked food for almost a month i sat right down and started eating away tard came in just when i was finishing up dessert and told lisara that he had to prepare me for the inauguration or coronation or whatever gets done to them what is elected high lama and that she could continue talking to me at dinnertime she bowed and left the room and tard sat himself down next to me you will officially become our high lama in a ceremony this afternoon he said i think it would be best if you shaved and bathed before it begins ill have a couple of servants prepare your bath well you can imagine my disappointment when i found out that the servants were of the masculine persuasion so i scrubbed right quick shaved off three weeks growth and got into this white robe theyd laid out for me id barely had time to light up a cigar when tard came by and ushered me down to a huge open courtyard in the middle of the temple it seemed like the whole town was there to greet me all of em young and beautiful except for them what was young and handsome and pretty soon lisara showed up looking better than ever and started talking at me in some unfamiliar language and then she and everyone else seemed to be waiting for an answer so finally i said i sure do and she put this gold amulet around my neck and then everyone knelt down again and suddenly i was the high lama i figured at least wed have a few drinks to celebrate and maybe do a little serious dancing and i was already preparing a speech about how i was gonna clean up all the mistakes of the previous administration and lower taxes and put a chicken in every pot when they all kind of wandered off back to their houses and i was left alone with tard and lisara thats it i said it is accomplished said tard aint there even no inauguration ball i asked it would be anticlimactic after your investiture said tard are you trying to tell me that there little ceremony was the high point of the day for most of our people it was the high point of their lives said lisara well i can see were gonna have to make some changes around here i said that might not be a wise idea said tard im the high lama aint i i said yes as i understand it that means that any idea i got is a quality idea but you are supposed to spend your life in serene contemplation said tard i been contemplating nonstop since i got here i said i spent half the afternoon contemplating what that gold lion would be worth on the open market and i spent the rest of it contemplating how much rent i could save the government by having lisara move in with me i dont think you understand your position doctor jones he said you are the high lama of shalimar right i said and that means what i say goes within limitations said tard nobody ever mentioned no limitations for me when i applied for the job arent you aware of the fact that you just took vows of poverty and celibacy in front of the entire community said tard i did what its true doctor jones said lisara thats what you agreed to at the end of the ceremony i thought i was agreeing to be the high lama i said you were she said and the high lama is penniless and celibate i took off the amulet and handed it to tard that being the case i hereby resign from the high lama business you cant he said i just did i urge you to consider the consequences of your actions said tard if you are not the high lama then you are just an intruder from the outside world and it is our obligation to kill you why i demanded what have i ever done to you we must keep our location secret or we will be overrun with adventurers who will steal our women and loot our treasures lets calm down and be reasonable brother tard i said i can see why you dont want no foreign devils messing with your women or your trinkets but it seems to me that a naturalized devil who also happens to be the high lama ought to have a little more leeway thats out of the question he said and then held out the amulet in one hand and drew his sword with the other you can be the high lama or you can be put to death the choice is yours well i said staring at his sword i can see now that i may have been a little hasty in my previous decision i suppose theres worse things than being the high lama first and foremost of which was the thought of getting cut up into fishbait tard reached over and placed the amulet around my neck again you are young and hotblooded and impetuous as i once was he said putting his sword back in its sheath fortunately its a phase that only lasts for two or three centuries well thats a definite comfort brother tard i said glumly i think ill take a walk around the kingdom and mull over everything youve said certainly doctor jones answered tard dinner will be served at sunset lisara why dont you come with me to make sure i dont get lost i said i am yours to command she said i must have looked right approving of that because she quickly added within limitations we started walking through the fields and everywhere i went people kept kneeling down the second they saw me and i tried to to imagine a couple of centuries of seeing nothing but the tops of peoples heads try not to be disappointed doctor jones said lisara you will soon adjust to the contemplative life well truth to tell for the past five minutes the only contemplating id been doing was how to get out of shalimar with maybe a few diamonds and rubies for my trouble and perhaps a handful of lesser priestesses for warmth and companionship of a cold winters night but lisara was going on so rhapsodically about the pleasures of the mind that i figured that this probably wasnt the most propitious time to share my thoughts with her we got back to the temple just in time for dinner and afterward lisara went off to wherever it was that the priestesses hung out and tard came up and asked me if there was anything he could do for me before i turned in well now that you come to mention it brother tard i said i still got some questions about this whole setup yes i nodded like for example nobody ever grows old or gets sick here right that is correct then what did the last high lama die of he tried to cross the bridge and leave shalimar and so i was forced to kill him answered tard was he a visitor like me i asked he nodded so were the three before him let me guess you killed them all for trying to leave curious isnt it said tard that so many high lamas would want to leave our little paradise beats the hell out of me i said was that all you wished to know doctor jones i got a few more questions if you got the time to answer them certainly he said just out of curiosity i said is there anything a high lama can do that constitutes a firing offense as opposed to a killing offense absolutely nothing he said as long as you obey your vows you are virtually allpowerful in shalimar which was like telling me that as long as exterminator didnt break no legs he was a fairtomiddling racehorse is there anything else you wish to know doctor jones he asked no i guess thats about it if you need anything just send for me he said bowing i am your servant which was just when the lord suggested to me that there was more than one way to skin a cat just a minute i said yes doctor jones who appointed you my servant we are all your servants okay then who made you the chief administrator i have been chief administrator for more than three hundred years but if i was to make an official pronouncement that youd be better fit to clean the royal stables youd show up for work there tomorrow morning with a broom and a shovel right have i displeased you in some way doctor jones not a bit brother tard i said but i just did my first serious visualizing of the cosmic all tonight and for some reason i keep seeing you sweeping up behind horses why am i being demoted he asked dont view it as a demotion at all i said if i was you id consider it an opportunity to get back in touch with the common people them what dont hold their noses and run the other way when you approach is this change in my status temporary or permanent he asked kind of frowning well seeing that no one ever gets old here i think you can view it as temporary i said i figure six or seven hundred years ought to do the trick he swallowed hard one more thing i said as your last official duty pass the word that ill be interviewing potential chief administrators tomorrow morning he stared at me and didnt say nothing and since id said everything i had to say i gave him a friendly pat on the shoulder and went up to my room tard showed up maybe half an hour later perhaps i was mistaken he said yeah the high lama is incapable of making an unwise decision he said and since it is patently unwise to send such a qualified person as myself to work in the stables for the next five hundred years you perforce cannot be the high lama i do believe youve hit the nail on the head brother tard i said therefore he continued the best thing to do is sneak you out of here under cover of night i was wondering how long it would take you to come around to that conclusion i said how soon can you be ready to leave he asked ive been all packed for the past twenty minutes i told him where is your luggage right there on the bed i said pointing to my backpack excuse me for a moment he said and started rummaging through it it was after hed pulled out the fifteenth and last of the statues that he turned to me and said did you plan to leave us anything these are just little keepsakes to remind me of the pleasant hours i spent here as the high lama i said i mean it aint as if you got any picture postcards i can take with me the amulet he said holding out his hand well his other hand was perched on the handle of his sword so i sighed and took it off from around my neck and tossed it onto the bed then i followed him down to the main level of the temple out the door across the fields and over to the bridge all the guards took one look at me and immediately knelt down and bowed their heads and i was across the bridge before anyone looked up they hooted and hollered a lot but i knew none of em would cross the stream to come after me as long as doing so would qualify em for a quick trip to the old age home as i headed toward india i decided that the land of eternal youth wasnt all it was cracked up to be especially since it seemed to go handinglove with eternal poverty and i redirected all my more serious contemplating toward rounding up a grubstake and building the tabernacle of st luke secret sex there are worse things than walking down the streets of delhi on a hot summer day for one thing you could be walking down the streets of delhi on a hot summer day with a bunch of knifewielding gamblers hot on your trail for trying to pay off your losses with a pandaskin coat or you could be walking down the streets of delhi on a hot summer day with half the british raj hunting for you because you figured that white men ought to stick together in foreign climes and you borrowed a few thousand rupees from the local church and left an iou in its place so that you could pay off all them disgruntled gamblers or you could be walking down the streets of delhi on a hot summer day with the royal governors private guards searching for you after you figured youd raise a little capital by selling tours to the executive mansion to a group of british clergymen and when you got a mite confused and turned right instead of left you came across the royal governor and a pair of chambermaids reenacting a solemn blblical scene what probably took place on a regular basis between solomon and a couple of his more athletic wives or you could be walking down the streets of delhi looking out for the father and eight burly brothers of one of the citys fairest flowers who in their enthusiasm to welcome a little fresh blood into the family seemed totally unable to differentiate between a declaration of eternal love and a bonafide proposal of marriage all of which had happened to me through a series of innocent misunderstandings but which nonetheless imbued me with a pretty strong desire to take my leave of delhi until everyone calmed down and was willing to listen to reason it was when i saw a handful of the royal governors men standing in the middle of the road comparing notes with a couple of gamblers that i decided it might be a good idea to duck into a nearby building and wait for nightfall before clearing out so i walked through the nearest door and found myself in the lobby of the victoria hotel which looked like it had been sadly in need of a spring cleaning for the better part of half a century or so may i help you sahib asked the desk clerk who was a skinny little indian with a dirty turban yeah i said looking out the window as the governors men started looking into all the shops and stores i need a place to stay kind of short term we have a number of empty rooms he said i dont need nothing for the whole night i said five or ten minutes should do the trick he frowned we have never rented a room for less than the night sahib he said i aint got no time to haggle i said flashing my last fifty rupees and walking around behind the desk next to him ill just rent this here floor space for half an hour payable when i get up and leave i sat down about ten seconds before a couple of soldiers entered the lobby and walked over to the clerk were looking for an american masquerading as a minister said one of them have you seen him i shoved half the rupees into the clerks hand no sahibs he answered no one has come in here all day well if he should let us know certainly sahibs he said he waited until they walked out and closed the door behind them then turned and looked down at me you can stand up now he said theyre gone its kind of comfortable down here i said besides they were just the first wave of an unending ocean of misfortune there are more people looking for you he asked no moren eighty or ninety i answered what did you do hardly anything at all i said these english fellers just cant stand the fact that we whipped em at bunker hill all i can figure is that theyre still carrying a grudge i hate the english too he said even now we are planning to drive them from our country as you americans did you dont say i do say he replied he paused and stared at me for a minute or two would i be correct in assuming you plan to leave delhi when night falls i got to admit that sticking around waiting to get tarred and feathered aint real high on my list of priorities i answered they will be watching all the major roads and train stations he said if you try to get out by foot or car or train they will stop you thats right depressing news i said but i can get you out he added well as one revolutionary to another let me say that thats mighty neighborly of you i will be happy to help you thwart the british he said and once you are safely away from delhi i hope you will do me a favor in return doing favors for ignorant brown heathen is part of my calling i assured him no offense intended none taken exactly what kind of favor did you have in mind i will tell you when the time comes he said handing me a room key in the meantime i have arrangements to make wait for me in this room i will knock three times at midnight sounds good to me i said getting up onto my feet by the way i never did catch your name gunga and no bad jokes please why would i make a joke brother gunga i asked the british seem to find it hilarious he said bitterly it dont bother me none i said i take it you dont like kipling it aint never been one of my favorite sports i replied and by the bye im the right reverend honorable doctor lucifer jones at your service youd better get to your room now before anyone else comes looking for you suggested gunga well i did like he said and spent a few minutes finding solace for my present situation in the good book before i drifted off to sleep i must have been tireder than i thought because the next thing i knew gunga was knocking at the door are you ready sahib he whispered ready and rarin i said opening the door everything has been prepared he said walking into the room sounds good to me i said how am i getting out by car or by train neither he answered take off your clothes i can hardly blame you for being smitten by my manly good looks i said sternly but us men of the cloth dont go in for no degenerate activity get into this he said tossing me a white loincloth its part of your disguise now that i knew he wasnt gonna attempt no unnatural perversions i got undressed right quick and clambered into the loincloth then he walked over and tied a turban around my head how do i look i asked he studied me thoughtfully for a moment like an american in a loincloth and turban he said still it will have to do follow me please he walked out the door and down the stairs with me right behind him and then we went through the kitchen and out the back door where i bumped smackdab in an elephant say hello to akbar said gunga he will take you out of delhi i dont know how to tell you this brother gunga i said staring at akbar of whom there was an awful lot to stare at but i aint never rode no elephants before the british will never be looking for a coolie atop an elephant said gunga you should pass by unnoticed thats a powerful lot of elephant to pass by anything unnoticed i said trust me reverend jones said gunga it is your only chance you i trust i said akbar i got my doubts about he is trained to respond to whoever is his mahout his what his rider said gunga he handed me a stick with a metal hook at one end to make him go just say kush use the stick to turn him he looked up and down the alleyway i must leave shortly how do i get on top of him just stand in front of him and tell him to lift you up thats all there is to it i asked dubiously trust me reverend jones well i suppose i ought to thank you for going to all this trouble brother gunga i said you can repay a favor with a favor he replied just name it i said keeping my fingers cross behind my back in case it involved giving money to one of his pet charities take akbar to the town of khajuraho which is south and east of here once you arrive there you will be contacted by our leader rashid jahan he looked around nervously now i must leave before my absence is noticed he darted back into the hotel and i was left alone with akbar who looked like he didnt trust me a whole lot more than i trusted him which was not at all still i couldnt just stand there in the alley forever so i finally walked around to his front end and said lift his trunk snaked out and wrapped itself around me and before i could scream for help or ask my silent partner to intervene i was sitting on top of his head i tucked a leg behind each ear said kush and off old akbar went when we came to a corner i jabbed him with the stick and sure enough he turned just the way he was supposed to we made it to the edge of town in less than an hour and the british soldiers just waved me past without even looking at me and then we started kushing south akbar wasnt the type to travel on an empty stomach and he ate on the march so to speak and by the time morning rolled around i decided that maybe he had the right idea about things so i steered him to a nearby apple orchard and told him to stop but evidently he didnt speak no american because he just kept on plodding along at the same brisk pace i managed to grab a couple of apples off a lowhanging branch or i could have starved for all akbar gave a damn about noon we hit a forest and started plowing through it and then suddenly old akbars trunk shot straight out and his ears stopped flopping and started listening and a minute later he began trumpeting to beat the band and just about the time i was sure he was trying to warn me that the royal governor was waiting in ambush i heard an answering trumpet and then a wild elephant broke into a clearing i started whacking akbar with my stick to make him turn around because even though this wild elephant was a couple of feet smaller than him i still didnt relish sitting on his head while he indulged himself in a friendly little fight to the death but he just kept walking forward and at the last second i realized that the wild elephant was of the female persuasion and i was about to become an inadvertent participant in an affair of the heart well akbar stopped when he was maybe two feet away and trumpeted again and she trumpeted back and pretty soon you could have sworn that a brass band was giving a concert of john philip sousa marches what with all the trumpeting that was going on then the lady elephant gave akbar a playful shove that could have brought a house down and akbar started prancing around like a puppy and then suddenly there was a great crashing of bushes and trees and another elephant broke into the clearing some forty yards away this one was bigger than akbar and he had a jealous husbandly look about him and akbar right quick decided he had urgent business elsewhere because he took off like a bat out of hell and didnt slow down until we reached the end of the forest and broke out into the open once again losing the love of his life seemed to take all the zip out of akbars stride but it didnt affect his appetite none so he munched and plodded his way across the countryside for the rest of the day and all the next night it was dawn when we hit the outskirts of khajuraho and the first thing i saw was this temple which wasnt like no other i had ever seen and truth to tell reminded me a lot more of the rialto burlesque theater back in kansas city than a house of worship there were a bunch of figures carved as big as life all over the walls of the temple most of em dressed for extremely warm weather and all of them doing exactly what akbar had planned to do with his lady elephant we went a little farther and came to another temple with even more enthusiastic figures on the walls and by the time we hit a third temple that was just like the first two only moreso i figured i had finally found the perfect community to build my tabernacle i turned akbar toward town and when we came to a rundown hostelry called the janata hotel i pointed him toward a brick wall since i didnt know no other way to stop him and while he was pushing against it i took a stroll down the middle of his back and slid off when i came to his tail then i walked around to the front and told the desk clerk to give me a room with a bath and tend to my elephant for me im sorry he said staring at me but we do not cater to the native trade which was when i remembered that i was all done up like a coolie dont pay no nevermind to these duds i said i was just out getting a suntan you sound like an american he said i thought only we british ran around naked in the midday sun in tropical climes i aint so much running around as trying to rent a room i pointed out he got out the register right quick and i signed in and a few minutes later i was sitting in my bathtub washing off the smell of elephant of which id acquired an awful lot when there was a knock at the door come on in i hollered it aint locked a little indian feller walked into the room and headed over to the tub you are lucifer jones he asked the right reverend honorable lucifer jones at your service i said i have been waiting for you ever since i got a telegram from my cousin gunga he said i am rashid jahan you hunted me up kind of fast brother rashid i remarked well we knew we were looking for a white man wearing a loincloth and riding an elephant he replied youd be surprised how very few of them come through town in a day so what can i do for you brother rashid i understand from my cousin gunga that the two of you discussed expelling the british from our country yeah i recall his mentioning something about it i said and i further understand that you share our philosophy now i couldnt figure out how gunga had known that since i hadnt seen any of the temples until i hit khajuraho but i allowed that he was dead right excellent said rashid he also mentioned that you had promised to do us a favor in exchange for his help true enough i said then i wonder if you would be willing to visit our secret sex tonight he said your secret sex i said he nodded we could draw enormous inspiration from an american like yourself i thought for a moment about the temples i had passed by on my way into town and i figured that if that was their notion of public sex i couldnt wait to see what kind of secret sex they practiced i consider it a debt of honor brother rashid i said ill inspire the hell out of em excellent he said i shall tell them that you will join us as often and as vigorously as i can i promised where do i find this here secret sex wait until ten oclock tonight and then come south of town to the temple of kali ill be there with bells on i assured him he bowed and left and i spent the next couple of hours just soaking in the tub then just after sunset i got out and changed into my best sunday gotomeeting clothes after which i shaved and slapped a bunch of grease on my hair to slick it down i didnt have no file to clean the dirt out from under my fingernails so i bit em off instead i didnt have any cologne neither so i wandered down to the bar and slapped a little napoleon brandy on my face when the barkeep wasnt looking then since i high hopes of meeting a lady of quality at this secret sex affair i moseyed out into the hotels garden and picked a couple of dozen flowers which i wrapped in a copy of the bombay times that someone had left in the lobby finally i went looking for akbar and found him munching peacefully on some greenery down the street lift i said and he did and soon we were heading down the road to the temple of kali i still hadnt figured out how to make him stop so i just aimed him up against a huge pillar and while he was pushing away at it i climbed down and walked around to the front door holding the flowers behind my back since i didnt want to give em to the first lady i saw just in case a prettier one was hanging back just waiting for a handsome young buck like me to sweep her off her feet i knocked on the door and rashid opened it youre right on time reverend jones he said well i didnt want no one to start without me i said which way to the secret sex follow me he said walking me past a couple of dozen statues that looked so acrobatic that the models could probably have gotten jobs with the ringling brothers if theyd put their clothes on we took a hard left and then went down a flight of stairs to this big ornate door where rashid stopped and turned to me you are a westerner he said unused to our ways i warn you that you may be shocked by some of the things that you will see before the evening is over different strokes for different folks i said i admire your openmindedness reverend jones he reached out for the door and was just about to open it when a figure darted out of the shadows and cracked him over the head with a blackjack and he just kind of smiled and blinked once or twice and then collapsed on the floor reverend jones whispered the figure which was dressed all in black what in blazes are you doing here i turned to face him and realized that i was looking at sir mortimer edgertonsmyuthe howdy sir mortimer i said last time i saw you you were heading into the sunset with dr aristotle hos dragon what happened that foul fiend duped me said sir mortimer but now ive gotten wind of his latest plot to take over the world and i plan to bring him to justice and you figure hitting my friend rashid on the noggin is going to have a deleterious effect on a chinaman whos four thousand miles away from here i asked i did it to save you reverend jones he said now i must have an answer to my question what are you doing here i been invited to participate in some secret sex i said and while i dont mean to be critical or nothing youre putting a real damper on the festivities you fool he snapped you have no idea whats going on behind that door im a quick study i assured him youre totally unprepared for this i considered what he said and looked down at my flowers you think i should have brung candy instead you shouldnt have come at all he said take my advice and go right back to your hotel now just a minute sir mortimer i said im glad to share some of this here secret sex with you you being a fellow white man and all but ill be hanged if im gonna leave and let you have it all to yourself whats going on behind that door is a meeting of secret sects you blithering idiot he said secret sects i repeated dr aristotle ho has resurrected the thuggees and other ancient sects with the purpose of overrunning india and eventually all of asia with himself as their leader tonight is the night that they have all gathered under one roof so that he can address them and spell out his plans now do you understand what you have blundered into you mean there aint no women in there i asked thats what ive been trying to tell you and i got all decked out in my sunday best for nothing dont you understand anything ive said demanded sir mortimer i understand that dr aristotle ho has got a lot to answer for i told him this was a downright cruel and unfeeling trick to play on a christian missionary who never did nobody no harm sir mortimer stared at me for a minute i dont suppose it matters what your motive is as long as youre against him what do you say reverend jones will you throw in with me and bring this insidious villain to justice i should consider my answer very carefully before i gave it doctor jones said a familiar voice and we turned to find ourselves facing doctor aristotle ho and maybe a dozen of his henchmen all of em with their guns drawn you hissed sir mortimer our paths cross once again sir mortimer said doctor ho you are becoming a serious annoyance to me i should have killed you the last time we met this time i will correct that oversight well i can see you two have lots to talk about i said so if youll excuse me i think ill be on my way not so fast doctor jones he said as a couple of his men blocked my path why are you here in the first place its a saturday night and i was looking for a little female companionship i explained at a meeting of the thuggees in the temple of kali he said kind of arching an eyebrow i was the victim of false doctrine i said everybody kept talking about all this secret sex that was going on and i thought id partake of some of it he stared at me for an awfully long and uncomfortable minute nobody can be that foolish doctor jones he said not even you therefore i must conclude that you are working in concert with sir mortimer i didnt even know he was gonna be here i protested i even brung these flowers along for the lucky lady of my choice an excellent disguise said doctor ho nodding approvingly who would suspect such a naive bumbling idiot of being a master spy i aint no master spy i said im just an innocent man of the cloth bringing spiritual comfort across the face of asia to all you unwashed heathen please do not insult my intelligence doctor jones said aristotle ho do you think i am unaware of your exploits since last we met you killed one of my most trusted agents general chang in handtohand combat atop the great wall and then made off with my jade he paused and glared at me you fooled me the first time we met but now i know just how dangerous you are sir mortimer i said tell him i aint working for you you know you fooled me too doctor jones said sir mortimer admiringly who are you working for the united states government or some private organization of super assassins thanks a heap sir mortimer i said glumly enough talking said doctor ho now you shall see what happens to those who are foolish enough to attempt to hinder me in my goal of world conquest open the door one of his henchmen pulled the door open and we marched into this huge chamber that had about three hundred men in it all of em wearing red robes with weird designs on em a couple of men were laying on stone alters but since their heads were missing i figured they werent in any real serious pain at the moment the second the guys wearing the robes saw us they pulled out their swords and knives but then doctor ho raised his hand and everyone stood stock still i have captured these two spies he announced what shall we do with them well just about everyone in the room screamed death but i did hear one voice say lets rape them first which implied to me that at least one other person had come looking for a little secret sex himself how shall we kill them demanded doctor ho the death of a thousand cuts yelled a batch of em do you know what the death of a thousand cuts is doctor ho said to me sounds like trying to shave with a hangover i opined i am afraid not doctor jones he said first we will string you up and hang you a few feet above the floor then we will start slicing you to ribbons but we will not deliver the fatal blow until the thousandth cut the pain will be exquisite i assure you i got a better idea i said if you really want to string this out why not give me one cut tonight then i could go back to my hotel and sleep it off and i promise to show up each of the next nine hundred and ninetynine nights what kind of fool do you take me for demanded doctor ho do your worst bellowed sir mortimer i will show you how an englishman dies well i wasnt right anxious to show anyone how an american died so i turned back to doctor ho again this is silly i said to him i aint no spy and you probably aint go no followers what can count all the way up to a thousand why dont we just shake hands and let bygones be bygones ill even buy you a drink back at the janata hotel you have heard the verdict of my thuggees replied doctor ho sternly they demand blood as long as sir mortimer seems bound and determined to bleed why not settle for him i suggested ill even do some of the cutting just as a gesture of christian goodwill i admire your coolness in the face of an excruciatingly painful death doctor jones said aristotle ho under other circumstances we could have been great friends it still aint too late i said i feel a burst of friendship coming over me right this second he shook his head you are much too dangerous to be allowed to live he turned to his men prepare them both for the death of a thousand cuts remember said sir mortimer as they dragged us to the center of the room we represent the civilized world dont give them the pleasure of screaming in agony no matter how terrible the pain keep a stiff upper lip i was about to point out the difficulty of keeping a stiff upper lip once they chopped if off but by then we were surrounded by thuggees who placed us on a large platform and ripped our jackets and shirts off and started to tie our hands behind our backs when doctor ho stepped forward again one moment he said and everything came to a stop i know you think me a barbaric fiend sir mortimer he continued but actually i am one of the more civilized fiends i know to that end i will allow you to make a last statement if you so desire sir mortimer was already getting into his impersonation of the strong silent type and he just glared at doctor ho without saying a word doctor jones said aristotle ho have you any last words i looked up toward the ceiling lord i said pay attention now this is your friend and admirer lucifer jones suggesting that if you ever plan to manifest yourself you couldnt pick a much more opportune time than this here moment to bring the temple crumbling down doctor ho threw back his head to laugh but before a sound had a chance to come out we heard a great crashing noise and the whole temple started shaking a couple of seconds later the ceiling started caving in and half the thuggees were buried under it while the rest lit out for the hills with a speed and grace that would have done jim thorpe proud suddenly there was no one left except me and sir mortimer and aristotle ho and he just glared at us furiously for a second and then said you have thwarted me today lucifer jones but you havent heard the last of me and then before we could say anything he melted into the shadows thanks a lot lord i shouted now i owe you a favor then we heard a mournful trumpeting and we raced up what remained of the stairs and there was old akbar beating his head against a wall of the temple hed been pushing against the pillar where i left him until it finally collapsed on top of the thuggees private meeting room and since nobody had told him to stop hed just proceeded forward a few feet until he came to the wall which wasnt near as thick and was already starting to buckle well doctor jones said sir mortimer once again weve put a crimp in that insidious fiends plan to conquer the world well done sir well thats what he gets for leading an innocent gentleman on with promises of secret sex i said righteously i must be on my way to report the nights proceedings to my government he said it was nice collaborating with you again he paused allow me to give you one last piece of advice do not return to your hotel tonight theres always a chance that aristotle ho will be waiting there for you well i hadnt planned on returning anyway since there was a dead certainty that the desk clerk and the hotel manager would be waiting there for me and i had a feeling that they wouldnt accept payment in elephants so i bade sir mortimer goodbye got atop old akbar again and making a vow not to be duped by doctor aristotle ho ever again i headed off in search of fame fortune and maybe a little public sex with an obliging lady of quality the flame of bharatpur twentyfive rupees didnt buy a lot of food even back in so akbar and i kept pretty much to the countryside eating whatever we could find in the fields and heading in a kind of westerly direction after a couple of weeks we hit the rajasthan province and the landscape got a little prettier and we started passing an occasional old temple and here and there we came to deserted cities but since i still didnt know how to make him come to a stop i didnt get no chance to examine them it was when we were nearing jaipur where i had every hope of finding a used elephant lot and trading old akbar in for a grubstake and maybe finding a friendly little game of chance that we came across a field of tall grasses backing up to a forest i was about to head for the trees in the hope that some of em might have something nourishing hanging down from their branches when i saw a movement in the grass off to my left and i heard this voice whispering help me so i steered akbar in that direction then when we were about twenty yards away i heard a great big oof kind of sound like something had had all the air squoze out of it so i jumped off akbar to see what was the matter and what i found was that he had accidentally stepped on this tiger and crushed it flatter than a board i walked over to where the voice had come from and found a white man all torn up and bleeding lying in the grass thank god he whispered when he saw me what seems to be the problem brother i asked kneeling down next to him well he was kind of delirious and he kept mumbling about a tiger hunt and jealous lovers and murder and some kind of flame or fire and finally i figured id better get him to a doctor right quick so i called akbar over and told him to lift us up and once i laid the man across akbars neck and perched myself on his head we made tracks for jaipur where we went to the nearest hospital i left akbar pushing his head against the wall of the emergency room while i turned the patient over to a couple of doctors who carted him off and went right to work on him i decided to hang around for awhile inasmuch as i didnt have no place better to go anyway and before long i made fast friends with a pretty little nurse who rustled up some hospital grub for me and then after a couple of hours one of the doctors hunted me up to say that the patient was going to live and wanted to see me and not to do anything to wear him out as if he was expecting me to arm wrestle him or something i entered the room and walked over to the bed where the fellow i had saved was all covered in bandages im told that i owe you my life he said weakly all in a days work i said me being a servant of the lord and all well your intervention was divinely inspired he said he reached out a hand to me my name is geoffrey bainbridge the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service i replied taking his hand kind of gingerly just out of idle curiosity brother bainbridge what in tarnation were you doing alone and unarmed in tiger country its a complicated tale of desire and deceit doctor jones he said thats my very favorite kind of tale brother brainbridge i said take all the desire and deceit out of the good book and you wouldnt have more than a handful of chapters left it all revolves around the flame of bharatpur he said yeah maybe i should begin at the beginning he said im a bachelor doctor jones some months ago while judging a livestock show i made the acquaintance of lady edith quilton the widow of lord randolph quilton who owns the largest estate in all of rajasthan we struck up a friendship and shared many an afternoon tea together and finally i proposed marriage to her he paused i shall be perfectly honest with you doctor jones while i enjoy her company and admire her adventurous spirit the real reason i wanted to marry her was to gain possession of the flame of bharatpur i take it this flame of bharatpur is worth a bundle of money i said the flame of bharatpur is perfection itself he said suddenly he frowned but even as i was pressing my suit another gentleman entered her life he wanted the flame of bharatpur too i asked he wants everything she owns replied bainbridge she is quite the wealthiest woman in the province and he is a low deceitful fortune hunter well truth to tell i couldnt see much difference between a selective fortune hunter and a generalized one but i just sat there and listened to bainbridge pour out his story we disliked one another at first sight although we continued to behave in a civilized manner toward each other but things reached a head this morning lady edith organized a tiger hunt and i found myself sharing a howdah with this villain feigning enthusiasm he drove our elephant far ahead of the others and when the beaters flushed a tiger he grabbed my rifle and pushed me out of the howdah racing off and leaving me to face the tigers charge unarmed and on foot the brute knocked me down and raked me with its claws and was about to finish me off when you providentially arrived he leaned his head back against the pillow all wore out from telling his story and now although i owe my life to you and can never repay you i must nevertheless ask you one last favor doctor jones what did you have in mind brother bainbridge i asked just kind of figuring to humor him until he drifted off to sleep i realize that it was wrong of me to propose a loveless marriage simply to gain possession of the flame of bharatpur he said but i cannot leave poor edith to the mercies of her current suitor and i will be in no condition to confront him for weeks or possibly even months you must prevent that filthy fortune hunter from possessing the flame of bharatpur even if it means marrying her yourself well now thats a right interesting proposition brother bainbridge i said and now that i come to mull on it i can see that its my christian duty to save this poor woman from such a scoundrel even if it means i got to spend the rest of my life helping her manage her fortune rather than bringing the word of the lord to these poor deprived brown heathen then youll do it he said brother bainbridge i said its as good as done you are truly one of natures noblemen he said and suddenly he was sound asleep and i kind of tiptoed out of his room before he could wake up and change his mind and a couple of minutes later me and akbar were headed off to lady ediths estate on the edge of town i didnt know her exact address but when i came to a house that was just a little bit smaller than buckingham palace and had even nicer gardens i knew id hit paydirt so to speak i figured akbar might prove to be a bit of a social handicap especially since hed recently developed a taste for flowers so i pointed him down the road wished him well and took my leave of him last i saw of him he was just vanishing over the top of a small hill and with no one to tell him to stop i figured hed keep going until he hit the indian ocean by which time he could probably use a little seaside vacation then i wandered up the long winding driveway and knocked on the front door a couple of indians dressed all in white let me in and one of them escorted me to the drawing room while the other went and fetched lady edith while i was waiting for her i decided to take a look around and see just what i was marrying into i knew right off that lady edith liked the ballet because there were a bunch of paintings of ballerinas hanging on the wall all done by some frenchman and i could see that her late husband had an eye for the ladies because there were also a few paintings of halfnaked island girls by yet another frenchman which were so racy i would have thought shed toss em out once her husband departed this mortal coil but i couldnt see no signs of conspicuous wealth until i noticed a little glass case in the corner i walked over to it and there setting on a little gold pedestal was the biggest reddest ruby i ever did see and i knew right off that this had to be the flame of bharatpur that all the fuss was about i heard a little feminine cough behind me and turned to find myself facing a vigorouslooking woman of about fifty years she was decked out in riding togs and she held a leather crop in her hand just admiring your taste in gemstones maam i said you must be lady edith i am afraid you have the advantage of me mr reverend maam i said the right reverend doctor lucifer jones at your service fresh from risking life and limb to save geoffrey bainbridge from a tiger attack my goodness she said is he all right the doctors say hell be up and around in a couple of months i said how did it happen well its a long story maam and being the modest christian gentleman that i am i hate to set myself up as a fearless hero what dragged poor geoffrey from the jaws of death and dispatched a tiger with my bare hands so its probably best left untold i paused i do bring a message from him though what is it she asked due to the delicate nature of one of his injuries he regrets to inform you that hes no longer on the marriage market and he hopes youll understand and wont think no less of him for it the poor man she said we wondered what happened to him when he didnt show up for lunch after the hunt he was probably preoccupied with bleeding to death at the time i said it was just a stroke of providence that i came by when i did you must tell me all about it she said well id enjoy doing so lady edith but geoffrey aint the only one what missed out on lunch and i think now that ive delivered his tragic message to you id best be getting back to town to hunt up some dinner nonsense she said you will have dinner here with us reverend jones its the very least i can do for such a noble and courageous man well id surely like to lady edith i said but i also aint got no place to stay and id better scare me up a room before all the hotels are sold out for the night i wont hear of it she said ill have my servants make up a room for you right now i couldnt impose on you like that maam i protested even though i give all my money to the poor i usually hold enough back to rent a cot in some flophouse youre staying here and thats all there is to it she said firmly well i spent a couple of more minutes letting her argue me into it and then i went up to my room and freshened up a bit when my stomach told me that it was dinnertime i opened the door and started walking down the hall to the big winding staircase that lead to the main floor and the dining room when i bumped into a familiarlooking figure coming out of his own room doctor jones said rupert cornwall what the hell are you doing here howdy brother rupert i greeted him you still on the run from inspector willie wong he put a finger to his lips i must ask you to be more discreet he said which i took to be an affirmative no problem at all brother rupert i said but just out of curiosity whats hong kongs most notorious criminal kingpin doing hiding out in lady ediths house he grabbed me by the shoulder and pulled me into his room then closed the door behind us im not hiding out doctor jones he said in point of fact im here to press my suit upon her sounds painful i said wouldnt an ironing board do just as well you misunderstand said rupert im courting lady edith so youre the guy who pushed geoffrey bainbridge out of the howdah i said how did you know that he demanded i happened along just in time to save him from getting et by a tiger you mean hes here right now asked rupert a kind of wild look about his eyes no hell be indisposed for the next couple of months rupert kind of chuckled at that good he said ill have her married long before then well now i sure wouldnt count on it brother rupert i said he stared at me kind of suspiciously why not you might say that another player just entered the game i answered you he sneered you havent got a chance with her well that remains to be seen dont it i said i want you to know that i resent your intrusion doctor jones he said im the one who found this setup i think its very unfair of you to come along now and try to horn in after ive laid all the romantic groundwork before you get to feeling too righteous brother rupert i said let me remind you that id still be in hong kong spending our illgotten gains if some criminal kingpin had played square with me that was just business he said innocently surely a man of the world like yourself doesnt hold that against me this is just business too brother rupert i said ill make you a deal though i wont tell her how and where we met if you dont i agree he said and may the best man win especially if hes a handsome godfearing christian missionary i added we left his room then and went down the stairs to dinner where we were joined by lady edith and maybe a dozen other house guests most of them titled and all of them very old and very british afterward i recounted how i had pulled this raging tiger off poor geoffrey bainbridges torn and tattered body and choked the life out of it and when lady edith insisted that i stay over for a week or two i shot rupert a triumphant grin and figured that the flame of bharatpur was as good as mine we were up bright and early the next morning and lady edith offered to show me around the place she was dressed in her walking britches and looking vigorous as all getout and she set a mighty fast pace pointing out all her various flowers that had won prizes in flower shows then we visited the stables and i saw her prizewinning horses and after that we went to the kennels where i saw her prizewinning dogs and by the time we got to the barn to look at her prizewinning cattle and her prize winning pigs i began to get the impression that lady edith was more than a little bit on the competitive side i show them all over the continent she said pointing to a pair of bulls who were snorting to beat the band and looked like they wanted nothing more than a matador breakfast this one even took a first in england last year before i imported him one of the pigs started squealing and she walked over and petted him this is sylvester my pride and joy she confided to me hes won prizes in five different countries well i looked at sylvester and sylvester looked at me and all i could think was that hed go mighty well with fried eggs and maybe some hashbrown potatoes but i didnt want to offend lady edith so i allowed that sylvester was about the prettiest pig id ever seen that seemed to satisfy her and we moved along past the ducks and the chickens most of which had blue ribbons tacked up next to their coops and finally we finished the tour and returned to the house its such a lovely day why dont we have breakfast on the terrace she suggested well that suited me fine since it meant i wouldnt have to share her company with my rival and i followed her to a glass table with an umbrella over it we sat down and a couple of servants appeared from nowhere to serve us tea and little biscuits and then they vanished again and just as i was trying to figure out the best way to start charming her she turned to me and reached her hand out for mine im so glad you decided to stay lucifer she said well id had ladies fall in love with me before but never quite that fast and i figured this was going to be even easier than id thought well thats perfectly understandable you being the vigorous and attractive woman you are in the prime of life so to speak and me being a dashing christian gentleman of noble mind and bold spirit you are the answer to my prayers she continued yeah i said wondering whether to pop the question now or wait a respectable amount of time like maybe another five minutes tell me about em ive been so worried what with all the tigers in the area she said tigers i said surprised who in tarnation is talking about tigers we are she replied thats why im so thrilled that youre here lucifer as long as there are tigers in the area all of my prize livestock is at risk and to be perfectly honest mr cornwall while a fine and thoughtful gentleman really isnt the sort to comb the countryside looking for tigers whereas you the man who killed the tiger that attacked geoffrey bainbridge with your bare hands well it wasnt quite with my bare hands i interrupted her uneasily dont be so modest lucifer she said one of the local natives found and skinned the tiger and the shopkeeper who bought the pelt said that there wasnt a bullet hole or even a knife wound anywhere on it she paused and stared at me will you agree to lead a tiger hunt this afternoon id sure like to maam i said but usually i set afternoons aside for prayer and meditation me being a man of the cloth and all couldnt you forego your meditation this one time lucifer she said you would have my undying gratitude well it wasnt quite the same as her undying love but it was a step in the right direction and besides i suddenly had a notion of how to impress the bejabbers out of her and make rupert cornwall look feeble by comparison well god is a pretty understanding critter i said i suppose he wouldnt mind if i took an afternoon off to clear up your tiger problem thank you she said with a great big smile of course you understand that i dont make of point of rasslin tigers handtohand i continued it takes too much time and its right hard on my clothes we have all the guns you could possibly need she assured me i can supply you with beaters trackers gunbearers elephants anything you want well i thank you for the offer maam i said but i couldnt risk the lives of very heathen that i came to india to save no i think itd be best if i just go out alone and match my wits and skills with the fearsome beasts of the jungle what a remarkable man you are lucifer she said i didnt know such brave adventurous spirits still existed thats because you been associating with men like rupert cornwall too long i said nature aint run totally out of noblemen just yet you may just have a point lucifer she said and i figured that i had just pulled ahead of rupert right then and there well i spent the rest of the morning loafing around and by noontime most of lady ediths guests were up and around and even rupert wandered downstairs looking for a little grub so we all had lunch together while lady edith told em what a brave and fearless deed i was about to do on her behalf and i modestly explained that it wasnt nothing special and indeed was all part of a days work for a christian gentleman of high moral standards what was intent on serving his fellow man or woman as the case happened to be rupert just kept looking at me like i was crazy but everyone else was right impressed and when it came time for me to pick up a gun and head out the door all of the guests came up and hugged me one by one which was a most fortuitous thing since it enabled me to lift of couple of the old gentlemens wallets once i got outside i pulled about five hundred pounds out of em then went back and announced that i was feeling mighty lucky this afternoon and thought id probably better take some extra ammunition along we all hugged each other again which allowed me to replace the wallets and then i was out the door and walking boldly into the wild fields that surrounded lady ediths estate i walked for nearly a mile and when i was sure no one was following me i took a hard right and headed off to jaipur it took me the better part of an hour to get there and once i arrived i went right up to the first indian i saw on the street and asked him where the local taxidermist was he pointed out a shop down the block and i went over to it and opened the door good afternoon on you sahib said a pudgy indian with a neat little beard how may i be at your service im in the market for tiger skins i said you got any for sale how many do you want he asked i dunno i replied how many have you got you come back and see he said escorting me through a door to his workshop well there were skins galore back there everything from tigers to leopards to deer to whathaveyou along with a fair sampling of elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns he pulled out a tigerskin rug and held it up for me very nice rug very nice price sahib he said forty pounds i dont want no rugs i said just skins he ran over to another pile and held up a skin beautiful tiger skin this one sahib the notorious maneater of dindori for you twentyfive pounds what about those over there i asked pointing to a pile of skins that had flies buzzing around them he shook his head oh you do not want these sahib he said i have not had time to prepare them yet they just arrived this week how many of em are there i asked seven tell you what i said ill take em all off your hands for fifty pounds apiece his jaw dropped so far i thought it was going to hit the floor then he gave me a great big smile and nodded his head you drive a hard bargain sahib he said but what is a poor shopkeeper to do ill tell you what hes to do i said sahib he said looking kind of puzzled for another hundred and fifty pounds hes to keep his mouth shut about this little transaction for just a minute there i had the feeling that he was going to get down on his knees and kiss my feet but he showed admirable restraint and a few minutes later i had loaded all seven skins into a cart he loaned me and started back toward lady ediths estate when i was maybe three miles away i made a big semicircle and wound up in the fields where akbar had accidentally saved geoffrey bainbridges life the day before and i took my rifle and fired seven quick shots into the air then i sat down and smoked a cigar hid the cart in the woods and started lugging the tiger skins up to lady ediths house just about the time i hove into view a bunch of her servants ran out to greet me screaming and cheering wildly and took the skins from me and then all the guests started yelling hip hip hooray and lady edith ran up and planted a great big kiss on me and rupert looked like if someone had given him a shovel hed have dug a hole and crawled right into it about an hour later we all sat down for dinner and i recounted the story about how id wiped out all the tigers in the neighborhood adding a number of properly heroic embellishments and lady edith couldnt take her eyes off me and everyone kept asking me to tell it over and over again and rupert just sat and looked like something hed et had disagreed kind of violently with him we adjourned to the drawing room where i gave em a few last thrilling details of the hunt and then they started heading off to their bedrooms and lady edith gave me another kiss and shook ruperts hand goodnight and finally i didnt have no one left to tell my story to so i went up to my room i hadnt been there more than a minute or two when rupert came in and closed the door behind him all right doctor jones he said i dont know how you did it but youve managed to turn her head temporarily well its mighty decent of you to acknowledge that brother rupert i said i didnt come here to flatter you said rupert i came here to talk business what will it take to buy you off what makes you think i want to be bought off i asked why spend the rest of your life in a loveless marriage when i can make you independently wealthy he said aint that what you plan to do i replied thats beside the point said rupert name your price okay i said after mulling on it for a minute or two i want the flame of bharatpur he looked at me kind of funnylike thats it he asked well not quite i said i hate farewell scenes with love crazed women so im going to leave tonight while everyones asleep and i want you to give her a note from me saying that i was called away because my wife is having a baby which should help ease her sorrow ill take the flame of bharatpur with me on the way out thats impossible he said she has guards posted everywhere theres no way you can take the flame tonight without being caught out well i said then i guess ill just have to stick around and marry her no wait said rupert lowering his head in thought for a minute finally he looked up ill tell you what leave in the middle of the night like you planned and go to geoffrey bainbridges house ill remove the flame of bharatpur tomorrow when security isnt so tight and have it delivered there before dark i trust in human nature as much as any man i said but id rest a mite easier if youd write me a letter saying that you gave me the flame of bharatpur in exchange for ending my courtship of lady edith just in case something happens to the flame in the meantime well he hemmed and he hawed but finally he sat down and wrote the letter and i jotted down a note to lady edith and a few hours later i was walking down the road to the hospital which i reached just after daylight they didnt want to let bainbridge out but when i told him that the flame of bharatpur was being delivered to his house that day nothing they could say could make him stay there and finally his chauffeur drove up and packed us into the car i cant believe you got the flame of bharatpur in just one day said bainbridge as we drove down the road toward his house well its our little secret i said after id told him the deal id made with rupert cornwall lady edith dont know nothing about it yet i fully understand he replied what i plan to do is keep the flame against the day when she regains her senses and sends the rascal packing thats all well and good for you i said but what about me after all im the one who got rupert to part with it you will not go unrewarded doctor jones good i said because i figure half of the flame of bharatpur belongs to me and that probably translates into three or four million pounds on the open market he turned and stared at me are you crazy he said okay i said agreeably i forgot theres a depression on ill settle for a million we reached bainbridges house and suddenly the car screeched to a halt just before it ran into a pig that was munching some flowers at the edge of the driveway looks like rupert aint been here yet i said but i suddenly found i was talking to an empty seat because geoffrey bainbridge had gotten out of the car and was kneeling bandages and all next to the pig running his hand lovingly over its head nice sylvester he was crooning sweet sylvester you know i said climbing out of the car lady ediths got a pig called sylvester that looks just like this one aint that a striking coincidence this is him said bainbridge yeah whats he doing here it means that rupert cornwall kept his word what are you talking about i demanded sylvester he said champion the flame of bharatpur hes won prizes in five different countries isnt he gorgeous the flame of bharatpur is a pig hes not merely a pig said bainbridge he is the greatest swine i have ever seen well right at that moment i had my own opinions about the greatest swine i had ever seen and rupert cornwall and geoffrey bainbridge were running neckandneck for the award i couldnt go back and rekindle my romance with lady edith because by now shed read my note and i didnt see sylvester bringing no multimillion dollar price on the black market even if i could convince bainbridge to part with him and id spent every penny i had on tiger skins so i decided then and there that i would take bainbridges reward and go to some country where folks wasnt so allfired deceitful and an honest man of god could build a tabernacle and finally get around to doing some serious preaching the scorpion lady id pretty much had my fill of india and i figured that id use bainbridges reward to get as far away from it as i could it turned out that his notion of generous and mine differed considerably and when the dust had cleared i found i only had enough money to fly to siam i landed in bangkok found out that most of the white folks stayed at the oriental hotel checked into a room there and then set out to find some sinners that were more in need of redemption than most this led me to the lumpini stadium where they were holding their nightly kickboxing tournement and when i heard that one of the combatants was named moses i figured it was a signal from my silent partner and i put all my remaining money on him with one of the local bookmakers and sure enough moses kicked the bejabbers out of his opponent and suddenly i had about six hundred dollars in my pocket and i figured as long as god was looking over my shoulder there was no reason why i shouldnt let my money keep working for me a couple of discreet inquiries led me to the scorpion club a few blocks away it had an exoticlooking doorway and inside there was a long bar a bunch of itinerant bellydancers and a few gaming tables and before trying my luck i decided to slake my thirst on something with just enough alcohol to kill any germs i might have picked up during the day good evening father said a voice at my left and i turned to see that a nattilydressed englishman had sat down next to me its reverend i said the reverend lucifer jones at your service reginald mccorkle he said extending his hand its very rare that one meets a man of the cloth in these surroundings trolling for sinners is a lot like trolling for fish i explained you got to go where they congregate makes sense at that he agreed will you allow me to buy you a drink i suppose i could hold my natural generosity in check long enough to accept your kind offer i allowed you work around here brother mccorkle he nodded and yourself i just stepped off the plane this afternoon i said youre staying at the oriental i presume yeah i said its a nice enough temporary residence until i decide where to build my tabernacle its about three miles away from here he noted how did you happen to find this place it was highly recommended as a prime source of lost souls i answered i was about to tell him about the kickboxing but just then the door opened and the most beautiful lady i ever did see walked in she was eurasian and dressed in a slinky black gown and she was wearing a necklace made of enormous pink pearls and she had a huge jeweled scorpion pinned to her dress right between her lungs and she had so many rings on her fingers that i figured it must have kept a diamond mine working all year around just supplying the stones for them she glanced at me and reginald mccorkle for just a second and then walked over to a staircase and up to the second floor close your mouth reverend jones said mccorkle you never know what might fly into it in a place like this i dont want to cut short an enjoyable conversation brother reginald i said but i think ive just been smitten by cupids capricious arrow she does have that effect on people said mccorkle you know her i asked i think just about everyone in siam knows her or at least knows of her he replied whats her name she has more names than you can shake a stick at said mccorkle in this part of the world shes known as the scorpion lady she gets around a lot does she i asked quite a lot good i said we can compare travel notes once we get to know each other you dont want to get to know her reverend jones continued mccorkle shes the most dangerous woman in all of southeast asia a pretty little lady like that i said disbelievingly he nodded she runs the biggest smuggling operation in siam and is probably responsible for half the murders in bangkok shes so powerful that even the notorious doctor aristotle ho give her territory a wide berth so what youre saying is that shes probably not responsible for half the murders in bangkok i said trying to look on the bright side she owns this club added mccorkle its her headquarters whenever shes in the country how do you know all this brother reginald i asked him its common knowledge ask anyone or read a newspaper well i thank you for all this advice i said and for the drink as well but my hearts been overcome by the siren song of true love i warn you reverend he said shes more than just a pretty face i know i said shes got one of the finest sets of lungs its ever been my rare privilege to encounter i figured any further conversation would just depress me so i took my leave of him then and headed over to the stairway and when no one tried to stop me i climbed up to the second floor there was a door opposite the stairs with a light coming out from under it so i walked up to it and knocked enter said the most melodious voice i ever heard and i pushed the door open she was sitting in front of a mirror kind of admiring herself which is just what id have done if i was her and suddenly she spotted me in the mirror and turned to face me who are you she demanded im the honorable right reverend doctor lucifer jones miss scorpion lady maam and ive come to tell you that you are the most beautiful sight to grace my eyes since i landed on this continent some four years ago and also to inquire delicately as to your current marital status she just stared at me for a minute without saying a word then she smiled how flattering doctor jones maam you got a voice like unto a symphony i said every word is a thing of undying beauty wont you have a seat doctor jones said the scorpion lady thank you maam i sure will i said plopping myself down on a dainty little chair that had all kinds of motherofpearl designs inset it it and you can call me lucifer thank you lucifer she said and you may call me the scorpion lady just as a nonsequitur maam aint it scorpions that eat their husbands at a most indelicate point in their connubial relationship no those are black widow spiders lucifer she replied why oh no reason in particular maam i said i was just kind of curious why such a gorgeous little lady with a face like an angel and a tiny waistline and all other kinds of attributes would call herself the scorpion lady while some real highclass names like fifi and fatima are going begging i have a passion for scorpions she replied as you can see most of my jewelry is shaped into facsimiles of them and mighty fine jewelry it is maam i said though it pales into insignificance compared to your own beauty i do believe you are trying to make me blush lucifer she said with a smile i aint never seen an oriental lady blush before i answered it might be a pretty interesting and educational experience some other time she said your wish is my command i said you just name that other time and ill be here with bells on why in the world would you want to wear bells she asked thats just a figure of speech maam i explained actually what im trying to say is that youve won me over heart and soul what if i dont want you heart and soul she asked that aint my problem maam i said i had enough trouble just finding you and falling in love i dont hardly see that making you fall in love too can rightly be considered my responsibility you have an interesting notion of romancing a woman lucifer she said im just here to announce my feelings and intentions i said the romancing comes a little later after ive run my bankroll up at your tables downstairs though i added if you want to get a head start on the romancing i got no serious objections to that i could bring us up a couple of beers and lock the door behind me im afraid im a bit busy right now no problem i said i can come back in an hour or two after youve slipped into something more comfortable like maybe the bedroom is this the way you sweep them off their feet in america she asked with a smile well truth to tell maam i aint been back to america in quite some time and i aint never encountered an american girl with your virtues or if she had em they sure as hell werent in the same places i assume thats a compliment she said no maam i said its a statement of absolute fact i know you got your detractors here in bangkok but i aint one of em oh she said and who are my detractors well one of em is an english feller named reginald mccorkle who was buying me drinks down in the bar until i was smitten by your rare and exotic beauty what did reginald mccorkle tell you nothing important i said probably he just wants you for himself which is an understandable but unacceptable position she stared at me for a long moment while i stared right back my attention kind of torn betwixt her jewelry and her lungs you are the most interesting man i have encountered in years lucifer she said at last i do believe i shall let you pay court to me i knew you couldnt say no to a goodlooking young buck like me i said happily and being as how im a man of the cloth itll likely do wonders for your reputation too there are a few ground rules we have to agree to lucifer she said i wasnt aware that sex had any different ground rules in siam than anywhere else in the world but i perked up and paid attention just so i wouldnt break no local taboos and wind up in the hoosegow while the scorpion lady wasted away grieving after me i do not tolerate any competition she said if you make a commitment to me you make it willingly and totally you got it i said should i get the drinks now im not finished she said i also pledge to make a total commitment if we are to become romantically involved everything i have is yours she paused that includes my nightclub my house my business interests everything i suppose i could adjust to that i allowed from this moment on you are a full partner lucifer she said in fact i think that starting tomorrow morning i will turn my importexport business over to you well thats mighty generous of you scorpion lady i said and i promise you wont be sorry you done it she got to her feet as i said i have business to attend to tonight but why dont you come back at shall we say six oclock in the morning ill bring my toothbrush my pajamas and me i promised she walked me to the door then grabbed me and gave me one of the more memorable kisses id ever got from a gorgeous lady smuggler and then i was out in the hall and i heard the door lock behind me i climbed down the stairs and walked over to the bar for a celebratory drink and found reginald mccorkle still sitting there well he said brother reginald i said you were dead wrong shes the sweetest prettiest friendliest flower in all of siams gardens i take it you hit it off with her you might say that its too bad he said you may have seen her first i said but i spoke up first try to be a good loser brother reginald i dont plan to be any kind of loser at all reverend he replied youre too late i said shes head over heels in love with me he pulled out his wallet and flashed a couple of official looking cards at me do you know what this means he said it means youre a civil service employee i answered read it carefully reverend jones he said i am in charge of the british high commission in siam weve been after the scorpion lady for three years that aint none of my concern i said i hope to make it your concern he said i want to enlist your help out of the question brother reginald i said i love her with a mad and allencompassing passion i just want you to consider it never i said shes the heart of my heart and soul of my soul i should add that theres a millionpound reward for any information leading to her capture and conviction he said on the other hand shes just a woman i said i can always get more he grinned i knew i could appeal to your better nature when are you seeing her again six in the morning ill tell you what he said ill be waiting in that little restaurant across the street as soon as you leave here come over and well discuss what youve learned well i figured the best he could expect was a lecture on whatever oriental love techniques i learned but i agreed to meet with him and then i started walking back to the hotel but a couple of ladies of the evening stopped me and struck up a conversation and i decided that by the time i got to the hotel id just have to turn around and walk right back to the black scorpion and besides i couldnt see that my pledge of eternal fidelity officially took effect until six in the morning so one thing kind of led to another and i left their company at about five oclock feeling mightily refreshed and ready to seize the day at such time as it should make an appearance i was banging away at the door to the black scorpion at six on the dot and the scorpion lady clambered down the stairs and let me in here i am in all my masculine glory i told her you ready to play romeo and juliet or have you got something more exotic and oriental in mind ah lucifer she said sadly i wish that i had time to introduce you to the more esoteric delights of the flesh but we have a business to run it will simply have to wait it will i said she nodded you are in charge of my importexport business remember she said i had in mind something more in the way of importing a little ecstasy to you and exporting the memories of a brief but happy encounter with me when i left here i said tonight she promised me but for now you have work to do tonight for sure for sure she said okay i said what do i have to do in the alley behind the black scorpion you will find an empty truck with the keys in the ignition she said i want you to take it to the acme fertilizer company on phaya tai road and pick up a shipment from them a shipment of what fertilizer of course she said then drive to the river and pull up to the scorpion freight company and then what i asked she smiled thats all just leave the truck there and come home theyll unload it and return it tonight let me get this straight i said i pick up a load of fertilizer from acme i drive it over to your shipping company and thats everything thats right son of a gun i said i thought there was more to running a milliondollar business than that ill be here by noontime you may be she said but i wont be back until nine in the evening ill be waiting for you then you wont have long to wait i promised her all right she said starting to shut the door ill see you then lucifer as long as i got all day i dont suppose theres no harm in my going across the street and grabbing a little breakfast first i said none at all she said until tonight my love til tonight my uh scorpion i replied and then i moseyed across the street and sat myself down at a table reginald mccorkle pulled up a chair a minute later well he said i got to pick up a shipment of fertilizer at the acme fertilizer company and deliver it to the scorpion freight company i told him when he asked no particular time i said long as i deliver it before dark there aint no problem thats it he said no other pickups no stops in between thats it then weve got her he exclaimed youll drive directly to acme fill up the truck by seven oclock and then take it to a secret warehouse that ive leased on set siri road well have almost ten hours to discover what shes smuggling before you have to drive to her freight office this is the break weve been waiting for reverend jones i got a special request brother reginald i said what is it whatever we find dont arrest her before midnight oh why not i got a romantic assignation arranged for nine oclock tonight and id hate to see the love of my life get marched off to the hoosegow without a chance at one last fling with a handsome and caring young man like myself all right reverend jones he said its a deal weve been trying to arrest her for three years i suppose an extra few hours wont make all that much difference now wed best be started after i eat breakfast i said and since im working for the british high commission i think its only fair and fitting that you pick up the check all right but be quick about it well so as not to cause him undue consternation i ate a light breakfast consisting of nothing but orange juice and oatmeal and steak and eggs and hash browns and toast and biscuits and a few cups of coffee and then i went into the alley behind the black scorpion and found this beautiful brandnew truck waiting for me sure enough the keys were in the ignition just like the scorpion lady had promised and i drove out to phaya tai road and cruised up and down it til i finally found the acme fertilizer company i backed up to one of their shipping docks and before i could even tell em who i was or what i wanted they began loading the truck up with bag after bag of fertilizer and after about twenty minutes when it was filled to the brim they had me sign for it and then i was on my way again i spotted reginald mccorkles car waiting for me just outside the fertilizer factory and i followed him to the warehouse he had leased on set siri road and pulled into it behind him he closed the door and turned on the lights while i climbed out of the cab of the truck what now i asked him now we start examining your cargo and see what shes trying to smuggle out of the country surely you got a staff to do that kind of menial labor aint you i asked no he said there was no one i could be sure i could trust theres just you and me reverend he unbuttoned his shirt cuffs and rolled up his sleeves lets get to work we each pulled a bag of fertilizer out of the back of the truck and he tossed me a knife open them very carefully along the tops he said so that we can close them when were through and no one will know that theyve been examined i did as he said and poured the contents out on the dirt floor what have you got there he asked while working on his own bag looks like about fifty pounds of elephant shit to me i said smells like it too sift through it carefully he told me there could be a bag of drugs or diamonds in the very middle of it sift through it with what i asked your fingers of course he said kneeling down and going to work on his own pile after five minutes we had both determined that the bags contained exactly what they were supposed to contain and nothing else ah shes a sly devil that one said mccorkle never losing his enthusiasm probably only one or two bags contain the goods you aint seriously suggesting that after we pick all this stuff up and throw it back into the bags and seal em up that we do the same thing all over again with the other seventy or eighty bags i said do you know a better way he demanded not off hand i said but that dont mean there aint one more work and less talk he said pulling another bag off the truck just keep thinking of the reward well i spent the next five hours thinking of the reward and the three hours after that thinking of a bath and by the time four oclock rolled around we had to admit that what i had in my truck was a few tons of elephant shit and nothing else probably this was just a test run he said when wed gotten em all loaded back into the truck once you deliver it and show up back at the black scorpion shell know she can trust you tomorrow youll pick up the real stuff ill be waiting for you in the restaurant again well i drove on down to the river and spent about an hour hunting up the scorpion freight company and then i left the truck there like she had told me to and walked the four or five miles back to my hotel id done more lifting and working than id done in years and i ached everywhere and i took a long hot bath and finally stopped smelling like an elephant about halfway through it i showed up at the black scorpion club a little after nine and dragged myself up the stairs to the scorpion ladys room you look terrible lucifer she said its been a long hard day i said well get around to the hankypanky in a couple of minutes but first i just gotta lie down here for a second i walked over to her bed and collapsed on it and the next thing i knew she was shaking my shoulder and telling me that it was six in the morning and it was time to take the truck back to the acme fertilizer company and make another pickup i walked over to the restaurant all blearyeyed had my usual modest breakfast with a little more coffee than usual and an hour later reginald mccorkle and me were sifting through another five tons of elephant shit looking for the elusive contraband that the scorpion lady was smuggling out of the country once again we didnt find it well this went on for the better part of two weeks us examining tons of elephant shit every day and me falling asleep on the scorpion ladys bed every night before we could get around to consumating our romance and just about the time i was ready to call it quits and give up on the reward and just spend the next few years enjoying a little preconnubial bliss she told me that i was all through going to acme fertilizer company and would now be making my pickups at the prime fish hatcheries excellent news said reginald while i was eating my breakfast now were getting somewhere i had thought that the first day was a test but obviously she is a very careful woman she sent you there fourteen days in a row before she knew she could trust you and now were finally going to pick up her contraband goods the truck was waiting for me in the alley all cleaned and polished and looking like new as usual and i drove it over to the prime fish hatcheries where they loaded it up and half an hour later me and reginald were in his warehouse looking at maybe twenty thousand dead fish damn but shes a clever one he muttered she is obviously shes put the goods inside one or more of the fish but only her contact can tell which ones well just have to cut them open one by one until we come to whatever it is were looking for well we spent ten hours looking through fish guts for diamonds or microfilms or opium and mostly what we found were fish guts i smelled worse than ever when i left the truck at her freight office and trudged back to the hotel and it took longer than usual to wash all the odors away and as a result i didnt have no time for dinner before i showed up at the black scorpion and i was so tired and weak from hunger that this time i didnt even climb the stairs and fall asleep in her bed but instead i sat down at the bar to catch my breath and the next thing i knew the sun was shining in and the scorpion lady was shaking me awake and then i gobbled some breakfast and me and reginald spent another day cutting fish open with no hint of success two weeks later the scorpion lady told me to skip the hatchery and go back to the acme fertilizer company and reginald attacked the elephant shit with the same enthusiasm he had attacked it a month earlier as for me i was discovering that the life of a millionaire businessman wasnt all it was cracked up to be and i made up my mind that the next morning at breakfast i was calling it quits and spending the next few years romancing the true love of my life that night i was so tired that i didnt even make it out of my hotel i fell asleep in the tub woke up when the water got cold and barely made it to my bed before i fell asleep again i got up at about five thirty in the morning and hopped a cab over to the black scorpion it was locked and i figured the scorpion lady must have had a pretty hard night too because no matter how much i banged on the door nobody came down the stairs to let me in finally i decided to go across the street and grab some breakfast and give reginald my notice but when i got there i couldnt spot him so i just sat down and had the waiter bring me the usual i was just polishing off the last of my steak and eggs when a welldressed englishman walked over and sat down across from me are you lucifer jones he asked the right reverend doctor lucifer jones i corrected him and who are you my name is winston spiggot he said i work for the british high commission did reginald mccorkle send you i asked reginald mccorkle is in no position to send anyone anywhere he replied in fact even as we speak he is being sent home in black disgrace you dont say i said what all did he do he bungled his assignment and let the scorpion lady escape escape i said what are you talking about she fled the country during the night when she got word that i had replaced mccorkle i missed her by no more than an hour i dont suppose she left no forwarding address i said trying to soothe my broken heart dont be foolish doctor jones he said a number of people at the high commission wanted me to take you into custody but as i see it you were simply an unwitting dupe he paused nonetheless you have caused us a great deal of trouble and i think it might be best for all concerned were you also to leave siam well with the love of my life on the lam i cant see no compelling reason to stay here i said but i think you guys have got her figured all wrong me and reginald went over every truckload of fertilizer and dead fish with a fine tooth comb and i guarantee she wasnt smuggling nothing out of the country certainly she was said winston spiggot i wouldnt expect you to have figured it out but mccorkle was a professional he should have known what was it i asked something in the fish or something in the elephant shit neither you mean it was the fish and the fertilizer themselves idiot he said you helped her smuggle twentynine brand new armored trucks to doctor aristotle hos army it was with a heavy heart that i took a boat down the chao phraya river to the ocean that afternoon and hopped the next ship north for japan where i planned to forget the duplicitous love of my life in the arms of as many geisha girls as my anguished soul and bankroll could mutually accommodate at one time the other master detective it took the ship the better part of five days to reach japan by which time i was more than happy to take my leave of it especially since the cabin girl with whom i wiled away a couple of pleasant afternoons happened to have a brother on the crew who took an instant dislike to me for no discernable reason and spent half of the last evening hunting for me with a samurai sword while i huddled in a lifeboat and counted off the last few hours until we hit shore tokyo was one of the more crowded cities i ever saw ive been mulling on it all these years now and i think the reason is that theyve got too many people crowding into too few streets and if i ever go back i plan to tell the emperor or whoevers in charge these days that itd be a good idea to move some of em out to the suburbs still i was young and adventurous back then and it didnt bother me none because the more people there were the more likely i was to find some who didnt mind sharing their money with an upstanding man of the cloth who was all ready to settle down and build his tabernacle and get to work on his lifes calling there wasnt a lot of white folks in japan in those days and them that found themselves there split their loyalties between the imperial hotel and the nikkatsu hotel and since the nikkatsu was closer to the ginza and had the biggest gaming room in town i made a beeline toward it have you any luggage mr jones asked the desk clerk after id signed in thats reverend jones and no i aint got naught but the clothes on my back me being a servant of god and all i said then i am afraid i must ask if you can afford to pay for your room he said i flashed him my six hundred dollars which i hadnt touched since the kickboxing matches in siam and he looked much relieved excellent reverend jones he said will you be wanting a room with or without with or without what i asked with or without a geisha with i think i said they tend to brighten up a room dont you agree he marked something down on my form do you want a single or a double i didnt know geishas came in different sizes i replied ill have to spend a moment or two considering it i meant a single or a double room reverend jones said the desk clerk a single room sounded like id expend less energy chasing her around it so that was what i asked for fine he said a bellboy will be by to show you to your room in just a moment and if you would like anything at all just ask well you might recommend a good restaurant i said id be happy to he answered the momonjiya just across the street specializes in monkey brains if you find that too exotic for your taste then go to the taiko down the block the taiko huh what do they serve the sexual organs of oxen highly spiced dont anyone around here cook no hamburgers i demanded he looked shocked please not so loud reverend jones we dont wish to offend the clientele well id kind of lost my appetite during the conversation anyway so i followed the bellhop to the staircase and up two flights to the third floor where we walked down to the end of the hall and he unlocked my door and kind of stood there jingling his change in his pocket but since i hadnt had any luggage for him to tote i just laid my hand on his head and blessed him and he walked off muttering to himself in japanese i entered my room and took a look around the bed wasnt much it was a pile of silks on a wood board but it beat the hell out of the furniture which was more to look at than sit on there was a knock at the door and i figured it was the bellhop back to argue about the tip but when i opened it the cutest little geisha girl i ever set eyes on entered the room and minced over to the window you have a beautiful view here she said in a voice that was a lot deeper than anyone looking at her would have expected well now that youre here i got two beautiful views i said whats your name honey miyoshi she said turning around and facing me well thats a right pretty name i said and you can call me lucifer would you perhaps like a massage before your bath said miyoshi i walked over to her hows about we indulge in a little mutual massaging i said i think i reached out to her to demonstrate what i meant but things happened awfully fast then and its kind of hard to remember all i know is that about two seconds later i was flying through the air and i landed on my back with a thud and miyoshi was kneeling on top of me with her fists doubled up and growling kind of deep in her throat i guess i got to work on my timing huh i muttered im sorry said miyoshi and now her voice was yet another octave lower and most of her accent was gone it was a reflex action you got the healthiest reflexes i ever encountered miyoshi i said now hows about hopping off my chest im having trouble breathing my name isnt miyoshi said the geisha standing up and removing her wig and i saw now that she was a man i am sorry for the deception but it was necessary youre a geisha boy i said getting painfully to my feet i didnt know they came in both flavors he shook his head i am toshiro mako of interpol he said perhaps you have heard of me im afraid not i said the only oriental detective i know is inspector willie wong of the hong kong police that bumbling incompetent with his stupid platitudes and his legion of apelike children said mr mako contemptuously you aint on real good terms with him i take it i am a master of disguise said mr mako i speak seventeen languages possess a black belt in karate and hold the chair of antiquities at pacific university in my spare time but do i ever get any publicity no its always that hong kong clown with his pigeon english and his idiot parables he always gets the best cases suddenly his eyes flashed with triumph but this time will be different this time i mr mako will make headlines the world over for impersonating a geisha girl i said them aint exactly the kind of headlines designed to endear you to the public mr mako he shook his head this is just a disguise doctor jones he explained my quarry has a room down the hall and i am keeping him under surveillance just waiting for the opportune moment to strike who are you after i asked him have you ever heard of doctor aristotle ho the insidious oriental dentist he said the name aint totally unfamiliar to me i said is he staying here at the nikkatsu mr mako nodded his head yes hes got some criminal coup in mind i havent been able to determine what it is but i plan to dog his steps night and day and when he makes his move i shall make mine hes already wanted all over asia i said why dont you just arrest him now and cart him off to the calaboose i want his entire organization said mr mako as a kind of fanatical glow spread across his face then let them talk about willie wong well i wish you all the luck in the world mr mako i said but i think im gonna move over to the imperial hotel just to get out of the line of fire so to speak i reached out a hand its been nice meeting you im afraid i cant permit that doctor jones he said any sudden unexplained activity could draw doctor hos attention ill explain it at the desk i said ill just say that i was looking for something in the way of a blonde geisha girl he shook his head i cant run the risk of alerting him you will have to stay here he paused in fact i may have to impress you into service what are you talking about i cant keep watching him every moment of the night and day said mr mako even i have to sleep and eat and answer calls of nature yes the more i think about it the more i see that i need your help i dont know about this i said reluctantly think of the publicity doctor jones he said not only will we rid the world of this vermin but well push inspector willie wong off the front page i aint got nothing against willie wong i protested and now that i come to think of it i aint got nothing against doctor aristotle ho neither do you have anything against rewards i got a lot against risking life and limb for em i said that wont be necessary said mr mako you just follow him when im unavailable take notes of where he goes and who he meets and keep out of sight ill take over from there youre sure thats all i gotta do i said absolutely said mr mako im willing to share the reward with you but i want the glory of capturing him myself ill show the world you dont need twentyeight sons and a handful of trite aphorisms to be asias finest detective well he seemed pretty sincere to me so i finally agreed provided that when it was all over hed also tell the world that he was just in disguise as a geisha girl and he and i didnt have no degenerate relationship going on behind the scenes and then he went to sleep on the couch and left the bed for me but about two in the morning i finally decided that i had to get something to eat even if it meant eating at the momonjiya or the taiko so i climbed into my clothes and tiptoed out into the hall so as not to wake the sleeping mr mako and then i climbed down the stairs and headed out the door of the hotel into the street figuring id just walk up and down the row of restaurants until i came to one with some civilized food in the window and then suddenly i saw a familiarlooking figure walking ahead of me and i realized that it was doctor aristotle ho i hid in the shadows until he got a little farther away from me and then fell into step behind him and followed him for about a mile and suddenly we were in the ginza and every building was either a casino or a bar or a drug den or a whorehouse and while it made me feel right at home i didnt dare relax or partake in none of the entertainments with the insidious oriental dentist just ahead of me finally he turned into a small tavern and i stopped about fifty feet away and decided to wait til he came out rather than go in after him suddenly i heard some gunshots coming from the tavern and then there was a scream and then a whole bunch of little yellow fellers raced out and a crowd started gathering around the place and then doctor ho walked out calm as you please with a smoking pistol in his hand he tucked it into the belt of his brocaded robe looked contemptuously at the crowd all of whom backed away and then turned to his right and started walking away one little old grayhaired japanese feller stepped out of the crowd and started following him and i walked over and grabbed him by the shoulder hey neighbor i said you dont want to get involved thats the notorious doctor aristotle ho he yelled something in japanese at me and i hung on to his arm he shoots people for a livelihood i explained leave this to the authorities and maybe you wont get your damnfool head blown off well by now doctor ho had heard the commotion and he turned and recognized me and pulled out his pistol and fired twice just as i pulled the old japanese guy to the ground when i looked up again he was gone fool muttered the old guy i had him within my grasp he started pulling off his mustache and wig and suddenly i was looking at mr mako why the hell didnt you tell me it was you i demanded he would have overheard what are you doing here in the first place i said i left you sleeping back at the hotel i heard you leave said mr mako and since i couldnt be sure that doctor ho hadnt seen through my geisha disguise i thought id better come along to protect you dont you ever go anywhere as just plain mr mako i asked he shook his head i am much too famous only my ability as a master of disguise allows me the freedom of movement a couple of bystanders had been watching him as he plucked off his mustache and wig and got rid of his cane and one of them walked up may i have your autograph he said you see said mr mako to me it happens everywhere i go ive followed all your cases from honolulu to tokyo inspector wong continued the man what brings you to our fair city mr mako started cursing a blue streak and didnt stop until the autograph seeker had run off in fear of his life come on mr mako i said when he had finally run out of breath its just been one of those days ill buy you a beer saki he said whats that i asked a japanese brand he just glared at me and walked into the nearest bar and he didnt start loosening up until hed had his fourth or fifth saki which is this oriental beer with no head on it that they serve in tiny little glasses i was so close he murmured so close well the thing to remember mr mako i said is that doctor ho was just as close to you and he was the one with the gun besides i added he was all alone and you said you wanted his whole gang his whole gang encompasses entire armies and governments said mr mako what i meant was that i wanted his japanese operatives whats he doing here anyway i asked i thought he operated on the mainland mr mako shrugged that is something else we have to discover but i suspect that it involves our pearl industry you grow a lot of pearls in japan do you i asked you make it sound like you think they grow on trees doctor jones he said amused nonsense i said everyone knows you dig for em in mines he just stared at me for a minute and then continued recently we heard through the underworld grapevine that a criminal mastermind was planning to steal our entire supply of pearls doctor hos presence here would seem to confirm it where do you keep all your pearls mr mako i asked in a building a fortress really called the pearl exchange on the edge of shiba park right next to the ancient buddhist temple it is there that doctor ho will strike well then its just as well he got away tonight aint it i said you are quite right doctor jones he said in my enthusiasm i moved too soon i owe you an apology happily accepted i said now why dont we get on back to the hotel and grab forty or fifty winks you go ahead he said i am wide awake now and perhaps it would be best for me to do some reconnoitering i didnt put up no objections especially since he had left his geisha duds back in the hotel and i figured it wouldnt enhance neither of our reputations to be seen going into my room together so i left him there and returned to the nikkatsu hotel and was sound asleep and snoring to beat the band a couple of minutes later the room was still empty when i got up at noon so i shaved and dressed and went out hunting for a little breakfast that didnt have no monkey brains or ox organs or dead fish in it but i found that i couldnt read the menus which were all printed in japanese so after walking into and out of three or four restaurants i finally sat myself down and pointed to a pot of tea and settled for drinking my breakfast with a bit of milk and sugar it was only as i was pouring my second cup that i realized that the placed suddenly seemed a lot less crowded than it had and as i looked up i saw all the customers and waiters and cashiers running for the door and i figured the place must have caught fire or something and i jumped to my feet to join them when a heavy hand landed on my shoulder and shoved me back down and then the proud owner of the hand sat down and i found myself staring across the table at doctor aristotle ho we meet again doctor jones he said look i said im right sorry that your temple collapsed and it put your plans of worldwide conquest on hold but it wasnt my fault why do you continue to torment me doctor jones he said no sooner do you leave sir mortimers company in india than i find you in tokyo working in concert with mr mako what have you got against me nothing i said cross my heart and hope to die be careful what you wish for doctor jones he said it may come true sooner than you think the only reason i was with mr mako was because i thunk he was a geisha girl he just stared coldly at me and didnt make no reply i guess that requires some further explanation right i am in no mood for your drolleries doctor jones said doctor ho i have come here to ask you to deliver a message for me a message i want you to tell mr mako that if he persists in trying to thwart me he will not survive the week youd make him a lot madder if you told him you were an admirer of inspector willie wongs i said helpfully just deliver the message right i said as for yourself he continued this is the third time our paths have crossed well its the fourth time actually i said there was your farm in china and then the secret sex ceremony in india and then last night and now this afternoon silence he snapped do not contradict me when i am about to deliver an ultimatum okay i said we just wont count last night since it was an accident anyway shut up he screamed whatever you say he took a deep breath and continued that was the first time i have lost my temper in fiftythree years you have a strange effect on me doctor jones you probably just aint used to dealing with christian gentlemen that was brung up to respect the ten commandments and the bill of rights and such i said sympathetically be quiet he snapped and then started blinking his eyes right fast i quite forgot what i was going to say beats me i said so if youll excuse me i think ill just be moseying back to my hotel now and sit down and be still he said still fighting to control his temper i have remembered what i had to say to you he leaned across the table and stared into my eyes the next time our paths cross will be the last time well i sure am relieved to hear that doctor ho i said i was afraid we were going to keep bumping into each other every few months for the rest of our lives you planning on taking an extended trip somewhere you dont understand what i am saying to you he said with a frown sure i do i said you figure were only gonna meet once more and then i said that can you possibly be this stupid or is it all an act he interrupted i resent that never mind he said wearily just see to it that mr mako receives my message happy to doctor ho i told him he got up and walked out of the restaurant and suddenly all the customers and crew came back in and the manager tore up my bill and just asked me to leave real quick which i thought was a right gentlemanly thing of him to do simply because id attracted a local celebrity to his establishment and i walked back to the hotel to deliver doctor hos message to mr mako but the room was still empty i was about to go out in search of a friendly little game of chance or maybe a geisha who didnt change genders every time i turned around when i saw a piece of paper lying on the table next to the phone so i picked it up and read it doctor jones pearl exchange pm the net is closing mr mako this put me in a bit of a quandry since i knew mr mako didnt want no help apprehending doctor ho but on the other hand i thought the very least i should do as a lawabiding christian gentleman was deliver doctor hos message to him so he could reconsider his plans if he was of a mind to protect life and limb and other vital organs i mulled on it for a couple of minutes and finally went down to the front desk and asked where the pearl exchange was but the directions were so complicated that i finally gave up and hired a rickshaw to take me there it was maybe when i arrived which meant i had half an hour to find mr mako before he went up against doctor ho the pearl exchange was a huge building which looked like it had withstood a lot of charges and sieges over the centuries before someone got the bright idea of stashing all of japans pearls there there were bars on all the windows and soldiers standing guard all around the place and a bunch of english and american and chinese and arab merchants kept coming and going and since i knew mr mako was a master of disguise i scrutinized each and every one of them trying to spot him but within ten or fifteen minutes they had all left the building and suddenly there wasnt no one left inside but me and an old indian gentleman in a wheelchair and a uniformed japanese feller standing guard on one of the balconies i checked my watch and saw that the doors were due to close in another few minutes and then i finally realized that i was watching the master of disguise in action and that the old indian in the wheelchair was really mr mako i was about to walk up and congratulate him on his getup but i didnt want to give him away to doctor ho who was probably lurking in the shadows somewhere so i just stood back and admired him for a minute or two then i saw a flash of motion out of the corner of my eye and i looked up and saw that the uniformed guard was walking along the balcony to where he could get a clearer view of mr mako and that as he did so he unsnapped the leather cover on his holster and wrapped his fingers around the handle of his pistol i raced up the stairs just as he pulled his pistol out and was taking aim and hit him with a tackle that under other circumstances would have got me a contract to play for the chicago bears no i hollered you cant shoot him thats mr mako we rolled along the floor a bit and his gun got jarred loose and then mr mako jumped up out of his wheelchair and looked up at us and shook a fist in the air and ran out of there hell for leather and suddenly i listened to the guard cursing and hollering at me and his voice sounded awfully familiar fool he screamed idiot imbecile he ripped his eyebrows and beard and mustache off i am mako that was doctor aristotle ho well how the hell was i to know i said he is getting away and it is all your fault yelled mr mako worse still our informants tell us that his next port of call is hong kong now inspector willie wong will get all the glory again it aint my fault i said i was just trying to protect you well poor mr mako just broke down and cried and i did my best to comfort him and explained that even though hed lost aristotle ho he had saved the countrys pearls but he wouldnt have no part of it and finally he got control of himself and insisted that i come with him to his car and then he drove me to his office and told his secretary to bring him any file interpol might have on me and wouldnt let me light up a cigar or have a beer or nothing until she returned lugging this huge folder you have been a busy man since you arrived in asia doctor jones he said after hed spent a few minutes reading what shed brought him well i try to keep active i said active is an understatement he said still thumbing through the folder not only did you help doctor aristotle ho escape from me today but it seems that you are wanted for setting up an illegal gambling operation in macau i didnt make a penny on that i said defensively let me continue the chinese government has issued a warrant for your arrest for the murder of a general chang a simple misunderstanding i said tibet is after you for absconding with a national treasure he continued he wasnt no national treasure i protested he was just a basketball player on the lam from the mob he wasnt even a tibetan the government of india wants you for your complicity in the destruction of a national shrine as well as killing eight tigers without a license he said i didnt kill em i just sort of appropriated em i said well seven of em anyway and the government of siam has charged you with smuggling armored vehicles i can explain all that i said and worst of all he said glaring at me when you were in hong kong you helped willie wong grab yet another headlilne he got to his feet and walked around to the front of his desk speaking in my capacity as the chief representative of interpol on the asian continent i must inform you that your presence here is no longer tolerable doctor jones i could of course turn you over to any of the governments that seek to bring you to trial but relations between your country and my own have become strained recently and i do not wish to exacerbate an already tense situation therefore if you will sign a pledge agreeing never to return to asia i will put you on the transsiberian express and let you become europes headache and if i dont sign it i asked then i will have to devise a series of coin tosses to determine which government gets to incarcerate you first the choice is yours well it wasnt all that much of a choice that i could see and i figured that if all my efforts to bring the word of the lord to these brown and yellow heathen were that unappreciated it was probably time for me to pull up stakes and take my leave of the place anyway so i signed his paper and he flew me to siberia where i really could have used my pandaskin coat and placed me on the train and pointed me to the west and that was the end of my attempt to civilize the barbaric hordes of asia which aint to say that my preaching days were over during the next few years i came to grips with some mighty interesting folks and critters in the glittering capitals of europe and made and lost a fortune or two and discovered a lost continent and fell hopelessly and eternally in love fifteen or twenty times and even was king of my own country for a spell but that is another story and writing is mighty thirsty work
