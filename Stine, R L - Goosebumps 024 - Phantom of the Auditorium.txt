a mysterious phantom haunted our school no one ever saw him no one knew where he lived but he haunted our school for more than seventy years my best friend zeke and i were the ones who found him we found him while we were doing a school play about a phantom our teacher told us that the play was cursed but we didnt believe her we thought it was all just a big joke but when i saw the phantom for myself i knew it was no joke it was all true every bit of it the night we found the phantom was the scariest night of our lives but i should start at the beginning my name is brooke rodgers and im in the sixth grade at woods mill middle school zeke matthews is my best friend a lot of the other girls think its weird that my best friend is a boy but i dont care zeke is cooler and funnier than any girls i know he is also a big horror movie fan like me zeke and i have been best friends for nine years we know just about everything about each other for instance i know that zeke still wears kermit the frog pajamas he hates it when i tell people that his face always turns a bright shade of red then his freckles stand out even more zeke hates his freckles almost as much as i hate my glasses i dont know why hes so hung up over a couple of freckles after a while you hardly even notice them and in the summer when he gets tan they practically disappear altogether i wish my glasses could disappear they make me look so nerdy but if i dont wear them i walk into walls some girls at school think zeke is cute i never think about him that way i guess its because ive known him for nearly my entire life ever since our moms met in their bowling league and discovered they lived on the same street the excitement about the phantom started a couple of fridays ago school had ended for the day and i was trying to get my locker open i pushed my hair off my face and turned the combination dial the stupid lock always jams and it drives me crazy after trying the combination four times i finally got it open i threw my books inside and slammed the door shut no way was i dragging home any textbooks over the weekend as of right this second i was on vacation two whole days of no school excellent before i could turn around a fist came whizzing by my ear and punched my locker with a loud bang whats up brookie a voice called from behind me no homework this weekend i didnt have to turn around to know who it was only one person in the whole world can ever get away with calling me brookie i turned around to see zekes dopey grin his blond hair which was really long in the front and very short almost shaved in the back fell over one eye i smiled then stuck my tongue out at him real mature brookie he muttered then i flipped my eyelids up so they stayed that way its a really gross talent i have that usually makes people scream and gag zeke didnt bat an eye he has seen my eyelid trick at least a zillion times nope no homework i replied no books no nothing im totally free this weekend then i got a great idea hey zeke i said do you think rich can take us to see the creature festival tomorrow i was dying to see the three creature movies playing at the cineplex one was supposed to be in d zeke and i go to scary movies all the time just to laugh at the scary parts we have nerves of steel we never get scared maybe zeke answered brushing his hair away from his face but rich is grounded he cant use the car for a week rich is zekes older brother he spends most of his life being grounded zeke shifted his backpack onto his other shoulder forget about the creature festival brooke arent you forgetting something he narrowed his eyes at me something big i scrunched up my nose forgetting something i couldnt think of a thing what i asked finally come on brookie think i really had no idea what zeke was talking about i pulled my long hair into a ponytail and tied it together with the hair scrunchie that was on my wrist i always wear a hair scrunchie on each wrist i like to be prepared you never know when youre going to need a hair scrunchie really zeke i dont know i said making a tight ponytail why dont you just tell me and thats when it hit me the cast list i yelled slapping my forehead how could i have forgotten zeke and i had been waiting two long weeks to find out if we got parts in the school play come on lets check it out i grabbed hold of zekes flannel shirtsleeve and i pulled him all the way to the auditorium zeke and i had both tried out for the play last year we had small parts in the musical guys and dolls ms walker our teacher told us that the play this year was going to be scary thats all zeke and i had to hear we had to be in this play we found a big crowd of kids at the bulletin board they were all trying to read the cast list at once i was so nervous i cant look zeke i cried you check okay yeah no prob wait ill do it i yelled changing my mind i do that a lot zeke says it drives him crazy i took a deep breath and pushed through the crowd of kids biting my left thumbnail i crossed the fingers on my right hand and stared up at the list but when i saw what was posted up there i nearly bit off my whole thumb tacked on the board beside the cast list was a sign attention brooke rodgers please report to mr levys office you have been suspended from school suspended i gasped in shock had mr levy found out that i was the one who let the gerbil loose in the teachers lounge suspended i felt sick to my stomach my parents were going to be so horrified then i heard giggling i spun around to find zeke laughing his head off other kids were laughing too i stared angrily at zeke did you put that sign up of course he replied laughing even harder he has a sick sense of humor i didnt believe it for a second i lied i turned back to the board to read the cast list i had to read the list three times i couldnt believe what i saw zeke i shouted over the other kids heads you and i were the stars zekes mouth dropped open in surprise then he grinned at me yeah for sure he muttered rolling his eyes no really i cried we got the two biggest parts come check it out for yourself you got the part of the phantom no way zeke still didnt believe me shes telling the truth zeke a girl behind me said tina powell a seventhgrader pushed through the crowd i always get the feeling that tina powell doesnt like me very much i have no idea why i hardly even know her but she always seems to be frowning at me like i have a piece of spinach caught on my tooth or something let me see that list zeke demanded pushing past everyone wow i did get the starring part im going to be esmerelda i read i wonder who esmerelda is hey maybe shes the phantoms crazy old stepmother or maybe shes the headless wife who comes back from the dead to give it a rest brooke tina said frowning at me esmerelda is just the daughter of some guy who owns a theater she said it as if esmerelda were a nothing part uh what part did you get tina i asked tina shifted uncomfortably a few other kids turned to hear her reply im your understudy she muttered staring down at the floor so if you get sick or something and you cant be in the show ill play the part of esmerelda im also in charge of all the scenery she boasted i wanted to say something mean and nasty something to put miss highandmighty tina powell in her place in front of everybody but i couldnt think of anything im not a mean nasty person and its hard to think of mean nasty things to say even when i want to so i decided to ignore her i was too excited about the play to let tina powell get to me i pulled on my denim jacket and swung my backpack over my shoulder come on phantom i said to zeke lets go haunt the neighborhood on monday afternoon we started rehearsing the play ms walker my teacher was in charge she stood on the stage in the auditorium staring down at us she clutched a tall stack of scripts in her arms ms walker has curly red hair and pretty green eyes she is very skinny as skinny as a pencil she is a very good teacher a little too strict but a good teacher zeke and i chose two seats next to each other in the third row i glanced around at the other kids everyone was talking everyone seemed really excited do you know what this play is about corey sklar asked me he was playing my father i mean esmereldas father corey has chestnutbrown hair like me and he also wears glasses maybe thats why we were playing relatives beats me i answered him with a shrug nobody knows what the play is about i just know its supposed to be scary i know what its about tina powell announced loudly i turned around in my seat how do you know i demanded ms walker hasnt passed out the scripts yet my greatgrandfather went to woods mill middle school a long long time ago he told me all about the phantom tina bragged i started to tell tina that nobody cared about her greatgrandfathers dumb story but then she added he also told me about the curse on the play that shut everyone up even me even ms walker was listening now zeke nudged me his eyes wide with excitement a curse he whispered happily cool i nodded very cool i muttered my greatgrandfather told me a really scary story about this play tina continued and he told me about a phantom in the school a real phantom who tina ms walker interrupted stepping to the front of the stage she peered down sharply at tina i really dont think you should tell that story today huh why not i cried yeah why not zeke joined in i dont think this is a good time to listen to scary stories that may not be true ms walker replied sternly today im going to pass out the scripts and do you know the story tina demanded yes ive heard it ms walker told her but i wish you would keep it to yourself tina its a very scary story very upsetting and i really dont think tell us tell us tell us zeke started to chant and instantly we were all grinning up at our teacher and chanting loudly tell us tell us tell us why didnt ms walker want us to hear the story i wondered how scary could it be tell us tell us tell us we all continued to chant ms walker raised both hands for us to be silent but that only made us stamp our feet in time to our chanting tell us tell us tell us okay she shouted finally okay ill tell you the story but remember its just a story i dont want you to get too scared you cant scare us zeke cried everyone laughed but i was staring hard at ms walker i could see that she really didnt want us to know this story ms walker always said we could talk about anything we wanted to with her i began to wonder why she didnt want to talk about the phantom the story starts seventytwo years ago ms walker began the year woods mill middle school was first built i guess tinas greatgrandfather was a student here that year yes he was tina called out he was in the first class that went to this school he told me there were only twentyfive kids in the whole school ms walker crossed her skinny arms over the front of her yellow sweater and continued her story the students wanted to put on a play a boy was hunting around in the basement of the old woods mill library he found a script down there it was called the phantom it was a very scary play about a girl who is kidnapped by a mysterious phantom the boy showed it to his teacher the teacher decided it would be fun to perform the play it would be a grand production with the best scary special effects they could create zeke and i exchanged excited glances the play had special effects we loved special effects rehearsals for the phantom began ms walker continued the boy who had discovered the play at the library won the lead role of the phantom everybody turned to look at zeke he smiled proudly as if he had something to do with it they practiced the play after school every day ms walker continued everyone was having a really good time everyone was working really hard to make it a good play it was all going smoothly until until she hesitated tell us i called out loudly tell us tell us a few kids started chanting again i want you all to remember this is just a story ms walker said again theres no proof that it ever happened we all nodded ms walker cleared her throat then continued on the night of the play the kids were all in costume parents and friends filled the auditorium this auditorium the kids were really excited and nervous their teacher called them together to give them a pep talk the play was about to start but to everyones surprise the boy playing the phantom was nowhere to be found ms walker began pacing back and forth on the stage as she continued the story they called to him they looked for him backstage but they couldnt find the phantom the star of the show they spread out they searched everywhere but they couldnt find him the boy had vanished they searched for an hour ms walker continued everyone was so upset so frightened especially the boys parents finally the teacher stepped out onstage to announce that the play could not go on but before she could speak a horrible scream rang out over the auditorium ms walker stopped pacing it was a frightening scream people said it was like an animal howl the teacher ran toward the sound she called to the boy but now there was only silence a heavy silence no more screams once again the entire school was searched but the boy was never found ms walker swallowed hard we were all silent no one even breathed he was never seen again she repeated i guess you could say that the phantom became a real phantom he just disappeared and the play was never performed she stopped pacing and stared out at us her eyes moved from seat to seat weird someone behind me murmured do you think its true i heard a boy whisper and then beside me corey sklar let out a gasp oh no he cried pointing to the side door there he is theres the phantom i turned along with everyone else and saw the hideous face of the phantom grinning at us from the doorway corey sklar screamed a lot of kids screamed i think even tina screamed the phantoms face was twisted in an ugly grin his bright red hair stood straight up on his head one eyeball bulged out from its socket black stitches covered a deep scar that ran all the way down the side of his face boo the phantom yelled bursting into the aisle more screams i just laughed i knew it was zeke i had seen him wear that dumb mask before he kept it in his locker in case he needed it zeke give us a break i called he pulled the mask off by the hair his face was red underneath it zeke grinned at everyone he knew he had just pulled off a really good joke kids were laughing now someone threw an empty milk container at zeke another kid tried to trip zeke as he headed back to his seat very funny zeke ms walker said rolling her eyes i hope we wont have any more visits from the phantom zeke dropped back into the seat next to me why did you scare everyone like that i whispered felt like it zeke grinned back at me so will we be the first kids to perform this play corey asked ms walker our teacher nodded yes we will after the boy disappeared seventytwo years ago the school decided to destroy all the scripts and the scenery but one copy of the script was kept locked up in the school vault for all these years and now were going to perform the phantom for the first time kids started talking excitedly it took ms walker a while to quiet us down now listen she said putting her hands on her pencilthin waist this was just a story an old school legend ill bet even tinas greatgrandfather will tell you that it isnt true i only told it to put you all in a horror mood but what about the curse i shouted up to her tina said there was a curse yes tina called out my greatgrandfather said the play is cursed the phantom wont let anyone perform it grandpa says the phantom is still here in the school the phantom has been haunting the school for over seventy years but no one has ever seen him excellent zeke declared his eyes lighting up some kids laughed some kids looked kind of uncomfortable kind of scared i told you its just a story ms walker said now lets get down to business okay who wants to help me pass the scripts out ive made a copy for each of you i want you to take them home and begin studying your parts zeke and i practically fell over each other running up to the stage to help ms walker she handed us each a stack of scripts we climbed back down and started to hand them out when i came to corey he pulled his hand back whwhat if the curse is true he called up to ms walker corey please she insisted enough talk about the phantom and the curse okay we have a lot of work to do and she didnt finish instead she screamed i turned back to the stage where ms walker had been standing a second before she was gone she had vanished into thin air the scripts fell from my hands i turned and made a dash for the stage i heard kids shouting and crying out in surprise she just disappeared i heard corey utter but thats impossible a girl shrieked zeke and i scrambled onstage together ms walker where are you i called ms walker silence ms walker can you hear me zeke called then i heard ms walkers faint cry for help im down here she called down where zeke cried down here down below the stage thats where her voice seemed to be coming from help me up ms walker called again whats going on here i wondered how come we can hear her but we cant see her i was the first to spot the big square hole in the stage zeke and the other kids gathered around it i stepped to the edge of the opening and peered down ms walker stared up at me she was standing on a small square platform five or six feet below the stage youll have to raise the platform she said how do we bring it up zeke asked press that peg over there on the stage ms walker instructed she pointed to a small wooden peg to the right of the trapdoor got it zeke cried he pushed down the peg we heard a clanking sound then a grinding sound then a groaning sound slowly the platform came rising up ms walker stepped off the platform she grinned at us and brushed off the back of her blue slacks i forgot about the trapdoor she said i could have broken a leg or something but i think im okay we all gathered around zeke dropped down on his hands and knees staring down at the trapdoor i forgot to mention the best part about this play ms walker told us this trapdoor was built for the first production of the phantom it was totally forgotten its never been used in a school play until now my mouth dropped open a trapdoor how awesome ms walker reached down and tugged zeke back from the opening careful youll fall she said i lowered the platform earlier i forgot it was still down zeke climbed to his feet i could see he was really interested in the trapdoor when the phantom was first supposed to be performed ms walker told us the school had this trapdoor built so that the phantom could disappear or rise up from below back then it was a very impressive special effect i turned my eyes to zeke he seemed about to explode with excitement am i the only one who gets to use it in the play he asked eagerly can i try it now please not yet zeke ms walker replied firmly i still need to have it checked out for safety reasons until it has been checked i dont want anybody fooling with the trapdoor zeke was already back on his hands and knees inspecting the trapdoor ms walker cleared her throat loudly is that clear zeke she asked zeke glanced up he sighed yes ms walker he muttered good ms walker said now lets get back to our seats id like to read through the play once before we leave today just to give you an idea of the story and the characters we returned to our seats zekes expression caught my eye id seen that look on his face before his forehead was wrinkled and his left eyebrow was up i could tell he was deep in thought it took more than an hour to read through the play the phantom was a really scary play it was about a man named carlo who owns a very old theater where plays and concerts are performed carlo thinks his theater is haunted it turns out that there really is a phantom living in the basement his face is scarred he looks like a monster so he wears a mask but carlos daughter esmerelda falls in love with the phantom she plans to run away with him but her handsome boyfriend eric finds out eric is in love with esmerelda he tracks down the phantom in his secret home in a dark passage far beneath the theater they fight and eric kills the phantom this breaks esmereldas heart she runs away never to be seen again and the phantom survives as a ghost he will haunt the theater forever pretty dramatic huh i think we all enjoyed reading through the play we could see that it was going to be a lot of fun to perform when i read my lines as esmerelda i tried to picture what it would be like to be in costume saying the lines onstage once i glanced back and saw tina mouthing my lines silently to herself she stopped when she caught me watching her she frowned at me the way she always does tina is totally jealous i told myself she really wants to be esmerelda for a moment i felt bad for tina i didnt like tina very much but i didnt want her to hate me because i had the part she wanted to play but i didnt have much time to think about tina i had a lot of lines to read esmerelda was onstage a lot in this play it was a really big part when we finally finished reading the play we all clapped and cheered okay go home everyone ms walker instructed waving us to the door start learning your parts well meet again tomorrow as i began to follow the other kids to the door i felt a hand pull me back i turned to find zeke pulling me behind a wide concrete beam zeke what are you doing i demanded he raised a finger to his lips shhhh his eyes were really excited let them all go he whispered i peeked out from behind the pillar ms walker lowered the lights then she collected her papers and made her way out through the auditorium door why are we hiding here i whispered impatiently zeke grinned at me lets try out the trapdoor he whispered back huh lets try it out quick while theres no one in here i glanced quickly around the auditorium dark and empty come on dont be a wimp zeke urged pulling me toward the stage lets try it out okay what could happen i turned uncertainly to the stage okay i said zeke was right what could happen zeke and i climbed on to the stage it was darker than before and it felt colder our sneakers thudded over the floorboards every sound seemed to echo over the whole auditorium this trapdoor is so cool zeke exclaimed too bad you dont get to use it in the play i gave him a playful shove and started to reply but i suddenly felt one of my sneezing attacks coming on the dusty auditorium curtain must have triggered my allergies i have the worst allergies in creation i am allergic to absolutely everything you name it dust pollen cats dogs even some sweaters when i have an allergy attack sometimes i sneeze thirteen or fourteen times in a row my alltime record is seventeen zeke likes to count my sneezes he thinks hes a riot he slaps the floor and yells seven eight nine haha after ten sneezes in a row im in no mood for jokes im usually a pitiful dripping mess with foggy glasses we tiptoed over to the trapdoor check the floor around there zeke said quietly find that peg that makes it work zeke stood on the trapdoor while i searched for the peg in the darkness i desperately tried to hold in my sneezes but it wasnt easy then the small peg on the stage floor caught my eye hey i found it i shouted happily zeke glanced nervously around the auditorium ssshhh someone will hear you sorry i whispered then i realized i couldnt hold out any longer my eyes were watering like crazy and i just had to sneeze i grabbed a handful of tissues from my pocket and put the whole wad up to my nose then i started sneezing i tried to keep them as silent as possible four five zeke counted luckily it wasnt a recordbreaking attack i only made it to seven i wiped my nose and shoved the dirty tissues in my pocket it was gross but i had nowhere else to throw them okay zeke here goes i cried i stepped on the peg and jumped beside zeke on the trapdoor we heard a clanking sound then a rumbling then a grinding the square section of floor began to lower itself zeke grabbed my arm hey this thing is kind of shaky he cried youre not scared are you i challenged him no way he insisted the clanking grew louder the square platform shook beneath us as we slid down down down until the stage disappeared and we were surrounded by darkness i expected the platform to come to a stop just beneath the stage thats where it stopped for ms walker but to my surprise the platform kept dropping and it picked up speed as it slid farther and farther down hey whats happening zeke cried holding on to my arm how far down does this thing go i wondered out loud ohh zeke and i both cried out as the platform finally hit the bottom with a hard thud we were both thrown to the floor i scrambled to my feet quickly are you okay yeah i guess zeke definitely sounded scared we seemed to be in a long black tunnel dark and silent i dont like to admit it but i was very close to being scared too suddenly the silence was broken by a soft raspy noise i felt panic choke my throat that sound what was it the sound repeated softly steadily like breathing my heart pounded in my chest yes breathing the raspy breathing of a strange creature so close to me right next to me zeke zeke why are you breathing like that i demanded feeling my heartbeat slow to normal breathing like what he whispered oh never mind i muttered he was breathing that way because he was scared we were both scared but there was no way we would ever admit it to each other we both raised our eyes to the auditorium ceiling it was a small square glow in the far distance it seemed to be miles and miles above us zeke turned to me where do you think we are were about a mile beneath the stage i replied feeling a chill no kidding sherlock zeke replied nastily if youre so smart you tell me i challenged him i dont think its the basement he said thoughtfully i think were way below the basement it feels like its a big tunnel or something i said trying to keep my voice from shaking want to explore he didnt answer for a long moment too dark to explore he replied finally i didnt really want to explore i was just pretending to be brave usually i liked having the creeps but being way down here was too creepy even for me well come back with flashlights zeke said softly yeah flashlights i repeated i didnt plan to ever come back i played nervously with the denim hair scrunchie on my wrist and stared out into the darkness something bothered me something didnt make sense zeke i said thoughtfully why would the stage trapdoor come all the way down here i dont know maybe so the phantom can get home quicker after he haunts the auditorium zeke joked i punched him in the arm no jokes about the phantom okay if there really is a phantom i told myself this is where he would live lets get out of here zeke said staring up at the square of light so far above our heads im going to be late for dinner yeah sure i replied folding my arms across my chest just one question mr knowitall what question zeke asked uncertainly how do we get back up we both thought about that one for a while after a minute or so i saw zeke drop to his knees and begin running his hand along the platform floor theres got to be a peg to push down here he said no the peg is up there i replied pointing way up to the stage floor then theres got to be a switch or a lever or a button to push zeke cried his voice grew high and shrill where where could it be my voice sounded just as shrill just as frightened we both started feeling around in the darkness feeling for something we could push or pull or turn something to make the little square platform rise up again and carry us back up to the auditorium but after a few minutes of desperate searching i gave up were trapped down here zeke i murmured were trapped this is all your fault i muttered i dont know why i said that i guess i was so frightened i didnt know what i was saying zeke forced a laugh hey i like it down here he boasted i may just stay down here for a while you know do some exploring he was trying to sound brave but his voice came out tiny and trembling he wasnt fooling me no way how could you bring us down here i cried you wanted to come too he shot back i did not i screamed ms walker told us this thing isnt safe and now well be down here all night maybe forever unless were eaten by rats zeke joked im sick of your stupid jokes i shouted i totally lost it i gave him a hard shove with both hands he went sprawling off the platform it was so dark i couldnt see him for a moment ow i cried out as he shoved me back then i shoved him harder then he shoved me harder than that i stumbled back onto some kind of a switch my back hit the switch a loud clanking sound made me nearly jump out of my skin brooke jump back on quick zeke screamed i leaped back onto the platform just as it started to move up up sliding slowly but steadily the square of light above our heads grew larger and brighter as we rose back up to the auditorium hey i cried out as the platform stopped with a jolt way to go brookie zeke yelled happily he slapped me on the back dont celebrate yet i told him we still werent back on the stage the platform had stopped about five feet down from the top just where it had been for ms walker i guessed that the only way to raise it all the way up was to step on the peg onstage give me a boost up zeke urged eagerly i cupped my hands together he lowered his sneaker into my hands wait he cried stepping back down whoa what if the phantom is up there waiting for us maybe you should go first haha very funny i said rolling my eyes remind me to laugh later okay okay ill go first he muttered he put his sneaker into my cupped hands reached up to the stage floor and i gave him a boost i watched him scramble on to the stage he disappeared from view i waited for him to reach down for me a whole minute went by zeke the word came out tiny and weak i waited some more listening hard i couldnt hear him up there where was he zeke where are you i called up come on raise the platform or give me a hand i called up i cant make it by myself another minute passed it seemed like an hour i suddenly realized what zeke was trying to do that big jerk he was trying to scare me hey enough i shouted i had had more than enough of zeke matthews for one day zeke i yelled give me a break get me up finally his hands lowered down over the side its about time i shouted angrily i grabbed both hands and let him pull me up to the stage i shook my hair back my eyes were slowly adjusting to the brighter light you know youre not funny i snapped keeping me waiting down there was really i stopped and swallowed hard it wasnt zeke who had pulled me from the trapdoor a strange pair of dark angry eyes stared into mine i swallowed hard a strange little man stared back at me an angry scowl on his face he wore baggy gray pants and a loosefitting gray sweatshirt torn at the collar his thick white hair fell wild and unbrushed over his forehead like a floor mop he had a deep purple scar down the side of his face nearly as long as the scar on zekes creature mask i could see that he was old but he was tiny no bigger than a kid he stood only an inch or two taller than zeke as he squinted at me with his strange gray eyes his face twisted into an ugly frown he looks like a phantom the frightening thought flashed through my mind whwho are you i stammered im emile the night janitor the man rasped wheres my friend zeke i demanded in a shrill frightened voice brooke im over here zeke called out from behind me i whirled around zeke stood on the other side of the trapdoor he had his hands shoved deep into his jeans pockets he was biting his lower lip zeke i cried whats going on why the school is closed the janitor growled he had a hoarse voice like sandpaper what are you two doing in here zeke and i exchanged glances zeke took a step forward we uh stayed for play rehearsal he told the man thats right i chimed in we had a late rehearsal the janitor continued to squint suspiciously at me play rehearsal he repeated then where is everybody else i hesitated this guy was scaring me so much my legs wobbled we left i blurted out but we had to come back to get my jacket behind emile i saw zeke nodding approving my lie how do you know about the trapdoor the janitor demanded in his sandpaper voice i hesitated its strange that ive never seen him in the school building before i thought ms walker our teacher showed it to us zeke said softly i could see that he was as scared as i was the man leaned closer to me squinting so that one side of his face was completely twisted up dont you know how dangerous it is he whispered he leaned even closer so close that i could feel his hot breath on my face his pale gray eyes stared into mine dont you know how dangerous it is zeke and i talked on the phone that night that man wasnt trying to warn us i told zeke he was trying to scare us well he didnt scare me at all zeke boasted im sorry if he got you upset brookie oh wow i thought sometimes zeke is such a phoney if you werent scared how come you were shaking all the way home i demanded i wasnt shaking i was just exercising zeke joked you know working out the calf muscles give me a break i moaned how come weve never seen that janitor before because hes not a janitor he is the phantom zeke cried in a deep scary voice i didnt laugh get serious i told him it wasnt a joke he was really trying to frighten us hope you dont have nightmares brookie zeke replied laughing i hung up on him on tuesday morning i walked to school with my little brother jeremy as we walked i talked about the play i told jeremy the whole story but i left out the part about the trapdoor ms walker said it would be better if we kept it a secret until the performance is it really scary jeremy asked me jeremy is seven and he gets scared if you say boo to him once i made him watch the movie poltergeist with me and he woke up screaming every night for three weeks yeah its pretty scary i told him but not scary like friday the th scary jeremy seemed relieved he really hated scary things on halloween he hid in his room i would never make him watch friday the th he would probably have nightmares till he was fifty the play has a surprise i added and its a pretty awesome surprise what is it jeremy demanded i reached over and messed up his hair its chestnutbrown like mine if i told you that i said making a funny voice it wouldnt be a surprise would it you sound just like mom jeremy cried what an insult i dropped him off at his school and then crossed the street to my school as i made my way down the hall i thought about my part in the play esmerelda had so many lines i wondered if i could memorize them all in time and i wondered if my old stage fright would come back last year i had terrible stage fright in guys and dolls and i didnt even have any lines to say i walked into the classroom said good morning to some kids made my way to my table and stopped hey a boy i had never seen before was at my place he was kind of cute he had dark brown hair and bright green eyes he was wearing a big redandblack flannel shirt over black sweatpants he had made himself right at home his books and notebooks were spread out and he was tilting back in my chair with his black hightops resting on the table youre in my place i said standing over him he gazed up at me with those green eyes no im not he replied casually this is my place excuse me i said staring down at him he blushed i think this is where ms walker told me to sit he glanced around nervously i saw an empty spot at the table behind mine she probably meant over there i said pointing ive been in this seat all year next to zeke i motioned to zekes chair zeke wasnt there he was late as usual the boy blushed even darker sorry he muttered shyly i hate being the new kid he started to gather his books together this is your first day i asked i introduced myself im brian colson he replied climbing to his feet my family just moved to woods mill from indiana i said id never been to indiana it was a boring thing to say but it was true youre brooke rodgers he asked studying me i heard you got the starring role in the play how did you hear that already i demanded some kids were talking about it on the bus you must be a good actress huh he added shyly i guess i dont know sometimes i get pretty bad stage fright i told him i dont know why i told him all that sometimes i just rattle on i guess thats why my parents call me babbling brooke brian smiled shyly and sighed back at my school in indiana i was in all the plays he told me but i never had the lead role i wish i had moved here sooner then i could have tried out for the phantom i tried to picture brian onstage in a play but i couldnt he didnt seem like the acting type to me he seemed so shy and he kept blushing all the time but i decided to give the poor guy a break brian why dont you come to rehearsal with me this afternoon i suggested maybe you can get a small part or something brian smiled as if id just offered him a million dollars you mean it he asked wideeyed sure i replied no big deal zeke came slinking into his seat his eyes on ms walkers desk am i late he whispered i shook my head then i started to introduce him to brian but ms walker stepped into the room and closed the door time for class to begin brian hurried to his place at the other table i started to sit down but realized id left my science notebook in my locker be right back i called to ms walker i hurried out the door and jogged around the corner to my locker hey to my surprise the locker door stood half open thats weird i thought i remembered locking it i pulled the door open the rest of the way started to reach inside for my notebook and let out a startled gasp someone was in there and he was staring right at me his ugly blueandgreen face grinned out at me i gasped again and clamped my hand over my mouth then i cracked up laughing zeke and his dumb rubber creature mask well you got me this time zeke i murmured out loud then i saw the foldedup sheet of paper dangling beneath the mask some kind of note i pulled it out and unfolded it scribbled in red crayon was a message stay away from my home sweet home haha i murmured very good zeke very amusing i pulled out my science notebook slammed the locker shut and locked it then i hurried back to the classroom ms walker stood behind her desk she had just finished introducing brian to everyone now she was reading the morning announcements i slid into my seat beside zeke you didnt scare me one bit i lied he looked up from his math notebook zeke always did his math homework first thing in class huh he flashed me his innocent look your mask i whispered it didnt scare me mask what mask he replied tapping the pencil eraser against my arm i shoved him away stop acting stupid i said sharply your note wasnt funny either you can do better than that i didnt write you any note brooke zeke replied impatiently i dont know what youre talking about really for sure i said rolling my eyes you dont know anything about the mask in my locker or the note right shut up and let me finish my math he said staring down at his textbook youre not making any sense oh well i guess the real phantom did it then i said he ignored me he was scribbling equations in his notebook what a phoney baloney i thought zeke did it and he knows it for sure after school i led brian to the auditorium i practically had to drag him up on the stage he was so shy ms walker are there any parts still available i asked brian is really interested in being in the play ms walker glanced up from the script in her hands i saw that she had scribbled notes all over the script she studied brian im really sorry brian she said shaking her head you came to school a few days too late brian blushed ive never seen anyone blush so often there arent any speaking parts left ms walker told him theyve all been given out do you need a standin for anyone brian asked im a very fast memorizer i could memorize more than one part wow i thought he really is eager to be in the play well we really dont need any more standins ms walker told him but i have an idea you can join the scenery crew if you wish great brian exclaimed with real enthusiasm go see tina over there ms walker told him pointing to the group of kids meeting at the back wall of the stage tina was busily pointing out where she wanted the scenery to go motioning dramatically with both hands making everyone follow her all around the stage brian seemed really happy i watched him trot over to find tina i took a seat in the auditorium and concentrated on my script i was in practically every scene how could i possibly memorize my whole part i sighed and slouched back in the seat slinging my feet over the seat in front of me i was memorizing my third line in the play which went what proof do you have that this man might be dangerous when all the lights suddenly went out a total blackout i couldnt see a thing kids started to shout hey who turned out the lights i cant see whats happening turn them back on i sat straight up when i heard the shrill scream a terrifying scream like an animal howl that ripped through the darkness and exploded over the auditorium no noooo i heard corey sklar moan and then i heard someone else cry out its coming from up on the catwalk another shrill wail rose up over the frightened cries of my friends turn on the lights i heard corey plead please turn on the lights other frightened voices called out who is screaming somebody do something theres someone up on the catwalk the auditorium lights flickered back on another long howl from above the stage forced me to raise my eyes and i saw him a greenandbluemasked creature wearing a shiny black cape gripping a long heavy rope he came swinging down from high on the catwalk as he swung down to the stage he threw his head back and laughed a horrifying evil laugh i jumped to my feet and stared in amazement the phantom the phantom landed hard on his feet his shoes hit the stage floor with a thud he let go of the rope and it flew away from him the greenandblue face glanced quickly around the stage tina and her scenery crew stood frozen against the wall staring at him in horrified silence ms walker appeared stunned she had her arms tightly crossed over her chest the phantoms cape swirled around him as he stomped one shoe on the stage hes short i realized standing and staring from down in the second row of seats hes about zekes height maybe an inch or two taller or maybe hes exactly zekes height because he is zeke zeke hey zeke i called the ugly masked face peered out to the auditorium the phantom started to sink his feet disappeared the legs of his dark pants down down he had stepped on the peg and was riding the trapdoor down zeke i yelled i ran up the aisle and pulled myself up onto the stage zeke youre not funny i shouted but the phantom had vanished below the stage i ran up to the opening in the stage and stared down into the darkness ms walker stepped up beside me an angry scowl on her face was that zeke she asked me was that really zeke i im not sure i stammered i think so zeke ms walker called down into the opening zeke are you down there no reply the platform had lowered all the way down i couldnt see anything but a deep well of blackness kids gathered around the opening chattering excitedly laughing and teasing each other was that zeke i heard corey ask was zeke wearing that dumb mask again is zeke going to ruin our rehearsal today ms walker demanded angrily does he think we need to be scared every afternoon i shrugged i couldnt answer maybe it wasnt zeke i heard corey say he sounded very frightened it had to be zeke zeke are you here ms walker shouted cupping her hands around her mouth she turned slowly her eyes darting over the stage and then all the seats of the auditorium zeke matthews can you hear me no answer no sign of zeke hes your friend brooke tina said nastily dont you know where he is cant you tell him to stop ruining our play i sputtered an answer i was so angry i didnt know what i was saying i mean zeke is my friend but im not responsible for him tina was just trying to make me look bad and score some points with ms walker okay scenery people ms walker instructed back to work ill take care of this the rest of you she stopped we all heard it the loud clanking sound a loud hum rose up over the clanking the trapdoor its coming back up i cried pointing good ms walker said crossing her arms over her chest again she narrowed her eyes at the opening in the stage floor now i will let zeke know how we feel about his little joke his last little joke if i have anything to say about it uhoh i thought poor zeke ms walker was a really good teacher and a really nice person too until you got on her bad side but once you did that once you made her angry once you had her crossing her arms and squinting her eyes at you then you were in major trouble because she could be really mean i knew that zeke was just having some fun he loved being the center of attention and he loved to scare people he especially loved to scare me this was a game for him i knew he was trying to show everyone that they were scaredycat wimps and he wasnt zeke played this game all the time but this time it had backfired this time he had gone too far and ms walker was waiting for him arms crossed eyes squinting will she toss him out of the play i wondered or will she just yell at him until his ears curl the hum grew louder the stage floor vibrated we all heard the platform stop its usual five feet below the stage poor zeke i thought hes standing there innocently he doesnt know what hes in for poor zeke i peered down into the opening and gasped the platform was empty no one there zeke or whoever it was had sent it back up empty and had disappeared into the dark tunnels far below the school zeke wouldnt do that i told myself even zeke wouldnt be crazy enough to go down in that darkness by himself without a flashlight without a clue as to what was down there would he yes he would i answered my own question if he thought he could really terrify us zeke would do anything ms walker canceled the rehearsal she told the scenery crew to stay and paint the backdrop she told the rest of us to go home and study our parts im going to have a long talk with zeke when i find him she muttered then she turned and made her way quickly out of the auditorium i took my time walking home i thought about zeke all the way i was thinking so hard i walked right past my house down the block i saw zekes mothers red pontiac pull up their driveway shielding my eyes against the late afternoon sun i saw mrs matthews climb out of the car and then i saw zeke on the other side hey zeke i shouted as i went running across the lawns toward him zeke his mother waved to me and disappeared into the house zeke looked surprised to see me is play rehearsal over so early he asked yes thanks to you i muttered huh he gave me his innocent look again what did i do you didnt scare me zeke i told him no one thought it was funny and now youre in a load of trouble with ms walker he narrowed his eyes and scrunched up his face pretending not to understand what are you talking about brooke how can i be in trouble i wasnt even there you were there long enough i told him he shook his head his freckles seemed to grow darker his blond hair fluttered in the wind no i wasnt he said quietly i told ms walker i wouldnt be there i told her this morning that i had to miss rehearsal so you could get into your mask and cape and come flying down from the catwalk i demanded suspiciously no i told her i had a dentist appointment i gaped at him in shock my mouth dropped open whats your problem brooke he demanded it was only a checkup you you really werent at school i stammered he shook his head no way then who was the phantom i asked in a tiny voice a strange smile spread over zekes face it was you i cried angrily you did your phantom act and then you went to your dentist appointment didnt you zeke didnt you he only laughed he wouldnt answer after school the next afternoon i walked with brian to the auditorium he looked cute in a black vest over a plain white tshirt and faded jeans how are you doing with tina i asked okay i guess brian replied shes a little bossy but shes letting me design the backdrop pretty much on my own i waved to some kids who were heading out the door for home we turned the corner i saw corey and tina walking into the auditorium did zeke work things out with ms walker brian asked i saw him talking to her this morning i guess i replied shes letting zeke stay in the play for now do you think it was zeke who pulled that stunt yesterday brian asked i nodded yes i do zeke likes scaring people hes been doing it since we were little i think zeke is trying to scare us hes trying to make us think theres a real phantom in the school i smiled at brian but i dont scare so easy i declared soon after rehearsal started ms walker called zeke and me onstage she said she wanted to walk us through one of our scenes together she wanted to show us where we should stand when we said our lines she called it blocking she also asked tina powell and robert hernandez zekes understudy to come up onstage ms walker said they should know all the blocking too just in case just in case i thought then i remembered tinas warning in case you get sick or something on the night of the play i get to play your part well tina i hate to disappoint you i muttered to myself but i plan to be perfectly fine so have fun painting your scenery its the only time youll be onstage i know i know thats kind of mean but tina deserved it ms walker showed zeke where to stand i stood off to the side of the stage with tina waiting for my cue to go on i guess ms walker and zeke worked things out tina said i heard him this morning telling her he was at the dentists and so he couldnt be the one to swing down from the ceiling i started to tell tina to be quiet so i could hear my cue but i was too late i already heard ms walker calling my name brooke rodgers she sounded angry whats going on over there youre supposed to be onstage thanks a bunch tina i muttered under my breath i ran out onto the stage glancing back i could see tina laughing to herself i couldnt believe it tina had made me miss my cue on purpose onstage i didnt know where i was supposed to stand i didnt even know what page of the script we were on what was my next line i couldnt remember in a panic i stared out at the kids in the auditorium seats they all stared back at me waiting for me to speak i opened my mouth but nothing came out the line is is somebody down here tina yelled loudly from offstage oh wow i thought unhappily tina will do anything to show me up shes just hoping ms walker will kick me out of the play i felt so angry my head was spinning i couldnt think straight i repeated the line then took a deep breath to calm down zeke had the next line he was supposed to appear onstage and scare esmerelda but zeke wasnt onstage he wasnt anywhere in sight i peered out into the auditorium ms walker stood at the foot of the stage she had her hands on her waist she tapped one toe impatiently on the hard floor the auditorium grew silent except for that tap tap tap tap tap tap ms walker seemed to be very annoyed where is zeke she asked wearily what is he doing now is he going to come flying down from the catwalk in full costume or something i should have guessed what zeke was up to but it didnt dawn on me until i heard a familiar noise the loud clanking followed by the hum the trapdoor platform it was rising i sighed here comes zeke i told ms walker and a second later zekes blueandgreen masked head appeared i stepped back and watched him rise from down below it looked awesome really dramatic slowly he appeared rising up over the stage floor he reached the top and just stood there for a long moment staring out at the auditorium as if posing for a picture he was in full costume his mask a black cape down to his ankles black shirt and pants what a ham i thought he really loves having everyone stare at him and think hes hot stuff and then he stepped toward me taking quick strides through the mask he raised his eyes to me i tried to remember what i was supposed to say next but before i could utter a sound he grabbed both of my shoulders he shook them really hard too hard ease up zeke i thought its only a rehearsal go away he cried in a furious whisper i remembered what i was supposed to say i opened my mouth to speak but then i froze i saw someone waving to me from the edge of the stage waving frantically it was zeke i knew i was in major trouble if zeke was standing way over there who was shaking my shoulders grinning at me through the ugly mask help somebody help me i screamed struggling to free myself no brooke ms walker called out to me the line is help help me father she didnt get it couldnt she see that there was a real phantom up here trying to shake me to death suddenly the phantom lowered his masked face and whispered harshly in my ear stay away stay away from my home sweet home i gazed into his eyes they looked familiar to me who was he i knew id seen him before but before i could remember he spun away from me took a diving leap off the stage and ran up the long aisle his cape flowing behind him i stood watching in horror as he disappeared out through the auditorium doors some kids laughed i heard tina mutter to someone was that in the script zeke came running over to me brookie are you all right i i dont know i replied i felt really shaken up that was weird zeke exclaimed ms walker came striding across the stage swinging her clipboard in one hand she had a very confused expression on her face can anyone explain what just happened here she asked theres a real phantom in this school zeke said softly he narrowed his eyes at me thoughtfully we were sitting in the front row of the auditorium brian scraped at a smudge of black paint on the back of his hand i sat between the two boys studying zeke the lights had been dimmed rehearsal had ended a few minutes before i could hear a few voices out in the hall the door had just closed behind ms walker why are you staring at me like that zeke demanded im still wondering if you arent responsible for everything i told him bluntly he rolled his eyes yeah sure he muttered how could i be in two places at once today brooke answer me that thats pretty tricky even for someone as brilliant and clever as me i laughed its possible i replied i cant get this paint off brian moaned look i got it on my shirt too is it washable paint zeke asked how should i know brian replied unhappily i didnt read the label on the can do you read labels on cans zeke only reads cereal boxes i joked will you stop kidding around zeke demanded impatiently weve got a real phantom in this school and for some reason hes trying to mess up our play i was still studying zekes face trying to figure out if he was telling the truth i saw you talking to andy seltzer this morning before school i told zeke you could have planned this whole phantom thing with him you gave andy the costume right you told him what to do you and andy planned out the whole thing right zekes mouth dropped open huh why would i do that to scare me i replied to scare everyone to make us think theres a real phantom and then when you get us really scared you laugh and say gotcha and we all feel like total jerks a smile crossed zekes face wish id thought of that he murmured but im serious brooke i know you dont believe me but i didnt plan anything with andy and i didnt tina hopped down from the stage i guessed shed been working on scenery behind the curtain are you feeling better brooke she asked coldly i turned to her feeling better im okay what do you mean you looked so stressed out onstage i thought maybe you were sick tina replied nastily are you coming down with the flu i hear theres a really bad one going around im fine i replied curtly is this paint washable brian asked tina tina shrugged beats me try turpentine she smiled at brian youre doing a good job on the backdrop then she turned back to me and her smile faded at least someone is doing a good job on this play before i could reply she turned and hurried across the aisle and out the auditorium door shes praying i get the flu i told zeke isnt that sick he didnt reply he was thinking so hard about the phantom i dont think he even heard me do you think tina could be doing all these terrible things i asked just to frighten me away so she can be esmerelda thats crazy zeke replied softly yeah i guess i agreed brian just kept trying to peel the black paint off his hand lets go home i suggested its really late maybe we can talk about the phantom later i climbed to my feet zeke glared up at me you still dont believe me do you he accused you still think this is all some plot just to scare you maybe maybe not i replied climbing over him to get to the aisle i really didnt know what to think brian got up and followed me toward the door i turned back to zeke who was still in his seat are you coming are you going to walk with us zeke stood up without replying yeah i guess we were heading down the hall to our lockers when zeke suddenly stopped oh i forgot he uttered forgot what i asked it was nearly dinnertime i was eager to get home my mom was probably wondering if id been run over by a bus or something mom always imagines me run over by a bus i dont really know why i never knew anyone who was ever run over by a bus my math book zeke said i have to go to the office i left it in the auditorium the other night ive got to see if anyone turned it in ill see you later brian said backing down the hall where do you live i called to him he pointed in a direction south i think see you tomorrow he turned and jogged around the corner i followed zeke to mr levys office all the lights were on but the office was empty except for dot the secretary she was shutting down her computer getting ready to go home did anyone turn in my math book zeke asked her leaning on the counter math book she squinted back at zeke thoughtfully i left it in the auditorium the other night zeke said i thought maybe that guy emile turned it in dots expression turned to confusion who who is emile you know zeke replied the little old guy with the white hair the night janitor dot shook her head youre a little mixed up zeke she said theres no one named emile who works at the school we dont have a night janitor tina powell called me at home that night just wanted to see how youre feeling she said you looked so pale brooke im not getting the flu i shouted i really lost my cool but i couldnt help it i heard you sneezing a lot yesterday tina said pretending to be concerned i always sneeze a lot i replied bye tina who was that other phantom who jumped onstage this afternoon tina asked before i could hang up i dont know i said i really that was kind of scary tina interrupted i hope you werent too scared or anything brooke see you tomorrow tina i said coldly i hung up the phone before she could say anything else tina was really becoming a pain i decided how much does she want to play esmerelda i found myself wondering just how much does she want the part enough to try to scare me away zeke called later and convinced me that emile had to be our phantom he lied to us right zeke asked excitedly he told us he worked for the school and he tried to frighten us its got to be him zeke insisted yeah probably i replied twirling the hair scrunchie on my wrist hes the right size zeke continued and he knew about the trapdoor zeke took a breath and why was he there brookie why was he there in the auditorium at night because hes the phantom i asked it made sense i agreed to get to school early so that zeke and i could tell ms walker about emile that night i dreamed about the play i was onstage in my costume the spotlights were all on me i stared out at the seats filled with people the auditorium grew silent everyone was waiting for esmerelda to speak i opened my mouth and realized i didnt remember what i was supposed to say i stared out at the faces of the audience i had forgotten everything every word every line the words had all flown away like birds leaving a nest my nest was empty my mind was a total blank i stood there in panic i couldnt move i couldnt speak i woke up in a cold sweat my entire body trembled my muscles had all knotted up i had kicked all the covers onto the floor what a horrible dream i couldnt wait to get dressed and get to school i wanted to forget about that awful nightmare as quickly as i could i had to walk jeremy to school so i didnt get there as early as i wanted jeremy kept asking me about the play he wanted to hear more about the phantom but i really didnt feel like talking about it i kept remembering my dream remembering the panic of standing in front of three hundred people and looking like a total jerk i dropped jeremy off then hurried across the street i found zeke waiting for me by the front door he was staring impatiently at his watch i dont know why it doesnt have the correct time on it its one of those digital watches with seventeen different controls on it zeke cant figure out how to set it he can play games on it and play a dozen different songs but he cant get it to tell the time sorry im late i said he grabbed my arm and pulled me right into the classroom he wouldnt even let me get my books from my locker or take off my coat we marched up to ms walker who was sitting behind her desk glancing over the morning announcements she smiled at us but her smile faded as she saw the solemn looks on our faces is something wrong ms walker asked could we speak to you zeke whispered glancing at the kids already in class in private ms walker gazed up at the wall clock cant it wait the bell is going to ring in two minutes it will only take a minute zeke promised she followed us out into the hall and leaned her back against the tile wall whats the problem theres a phantom in the school zeke told her breathlessly a real one brooke and i have seen him whoa ms walker murmured raising both hands to say stop no really i insisted we did see him ms walker in the auditorium we sneaked in to use the trapdoor and you did what she cried narrowing her eyes first at me then at zeke i know i know zeke said blushing we werent supposed to but thats not the point theres a phantom i said and hes trying to stop the play i know you think ive been doing all those things zeke added but i havent its the phantom he ms walker raised her hands again she started to say something but the bell rang right over our heads we raised our hands to protect our ears when the bell finally stopped clanging ms walker took a few steps toward the classroom door it was really noisy inside the kids were all taking advantage of her not being in there im sorry i upset you with that story she told us huh zeke and i both cried out i never should have told that old phantom story ms walker said fretfully it got a lot of kids upset i apologize for scaring you but you didnt zeke protested we saw a guy and have you been having nightmares about a phantom ms walker demanded she didnt believe us she didnt believe a word we had said listen i started all three of us jumped when we heard a loud crash inside the room a crash followed by wild laughter lets get inside ms walker said she pointed at zeke no more practical jokes okay no more jokes we want the play to be good dont we before we could answer she turned and hurried into the room what am i doing here brian moaned he shivered and stared up at the dark trees why am i doing this you came with us because youre a nice guy i told him patting the shoulder of his sweater no because im an idiot brian corrected me this was all zekes idea he came to my house after dinner i told my parents we had our play rehearsal a lie then zeke and i walked to school we met brian on the front walk where hed promised to wait for us i cant believe ms walker didnt believe us zeke fretted would you believe such a nutty story i demanded well were going to find the phantom and prove were right zeke said firmly we have no choice now i mean if ms walker wont help us well have to find him on our own you just like a good adventure i teased him he raised his eyes to mine well brookie if youre too scared but what am i doing here brian repeated staring at the dark school building we need all the help we can get i told him i gave zeke a shove lets go ill show you whos scared and who isnt i think im a little scared brian admitted what if we get caught whos going to catch us zeke asked him you heard what dot said in the office theres no night janitor but what if theres an alarm or something brian demanded you know a burglar alarm for sure i replied rolling my eyes our school cant even afford pencil sharpeners no way theyve got burglar alarms well were going to have to break in zeke said quietly his eyes on the street a station wagon rolled by without slowing he tugged at the front doors again theyre locked tight maybe a side door brian suggested we crept around to the side of the building the playground stretched out silent and empty the grass glowed all silvery under the bright halfmoon the side doors were locked too and the back door that led into the band room was also locked i raised my eyes to the roof the building hovered over us like some kind of dark creature the windows reflected the white moonlight it was the only light i could see hey that window is open zeke whispered we ran full speed up to the halfopen window in a groundfloor classroom it was the home ec room i saw mrs lamston probably left the window open to let out the horrible smell of the muffins we baked that afternoon zeke raised both hands to the window ledge and hoisted himself up sitting on the ledge he pushed the window open wider a few seconds later brian and i followed him into the home ec room the aroma of burned cranberry muffins lingered in the air we tiptoed through the darkness to the door ouch i cried out as i banged my thigh into a low table be quiet zeke scolded hey i didnt do it on purpose i whispered back angrily he was already out the door brian and i followed moving slowly carefully the hall was even darker than the classroom we kept pressed against the wall as we made our way toward the auditorium my heart was racing i felt all tingly my shoes scraped loudly over the hard floor nothing to be afraid of i told myself its just the school building the building youve been in a million times and theres no one else here just you zeke brian and a phantom a phantom who doesnt want to be found i dont think i like this brian whispered as we edged our way around a corner im really pretty scared just pretend youre in a scary movie i told him pretend its just a movie but i dont like scary movies he protested ssshhh zeke warned he stopped suddenly i bumped right into him try not to be a klutz brookie he whispered try not to be a jerk zekey i replied nastily i squinted into the darkness we had reached the auditorium zeke pulled open the nearest door we peered inside total blackness the air in the auditorium felt cooler cool and damp thats because a ghost lives in here i thought that made my heart pump even harder i wished i could control my thoughts a little better zeke fumbled with his hand against the wall and clicked on a row of lights over the section of seats to our left the stage came into view empty and silent someone had left a ladder leaning against one wall several paint cans were lined up beside the ladder how about turning on all the lights brian suggested he sounded really frightened no way zeke replied his eyes on the stage we want to take the phantom by surprise dont we we dont want to warn him that were coming huddled close together we made our way slowly down the center aisle toward the stage in the dim light long shadows fell over the seats ghostly shadows i thought did a shadow move near the stage no stop it brooke i scolded myself dont let your imagination go wild not tonight i kept moving my eyes back and forth checking out the stage and the rows of seats as we slowly made our way to the front where is he i wondered where is the phantom does he live in that dark chamber so far below the stage we were just a few feet from the stage when we heard the sound a footstep a floorboard creaking all three of us stopped all three of us heard it i grabbed zekes arm i saw brians green eyes go wide with fright and then we heard another sound a cough were nnot alone i stammered whwhos there i called but my voice caught in my throat is anybody up there zeke called to the stage no reply another footstep brian took a step back he grabbed the back of a seat and held on hes back there zeke said leaning close to me his eyes excited i know hes back there where i demanded choking out the word it was hard to talk with my heart in my throat i stared up at the stage i couldnt see anyone i jumped when i heard another cough and then a clanking sound rose up over the stage and echoed through the auditorium at first i thought the trapdoor was about to move was someone riding up on it was the phantom about to rise in front of our eyes no i cried out when i saw the backdrop begin to unfurl the clanking sound grew louder the backdrop was slowly being lowered at the back of the stage who is doing it i whispered who on earth is sending it down zeke and brian stared straight ahead and didnt reply zekes mouth was wide open his eyes didnt blink brian gripped the back of the chair with both hands the painted backdrop clanked down unrolling as it lowered all three of us gasped as we saw what had been done to it it had been a gray brick theater wall brian and several other kids had worked for days on it sketching it out then painting it brick by brick who who did that to my painting brian cried out zeke and i remained staring at it in silent horror the gray wall had been covered with red paint splotches and thick red smears it looked as if someone had dipped a wide brush in red paint then smeared and stabbed it all over the backdrop its ruined brian declared shrilly zeke was the first to move he raised his hands to the stage floor and pulled himself up onto the stage brian and i followed after him whos here zeke called out cupping his hands around his mouth whos in here silence someone is here i knew someone had to lower that backdrop so that we could see what had been done to it whos here where are you zeke repeated again no reply we moved closer making our way slowly keeping close together and as we stepped up to it words came into view they were scrawled across the bottom thick letters in heavy red paint i stopped and squinted to read the message in the dim light stay away from my home sweet home whoa i murmured i felt a chill roll down my back then i heard a side door being pulled open all three of us turned away from the backdrop in time to see a figure step into the auditorium we cried out in surprise when we saw who it was she stood gaping up at us she blinked her eyes several times as if she didnt believe what she was seeing i i am really shocked ms walker said finally i swallowed hard i struggled to say something but no sound would come out zeke and brian stood frozen like me i am so disappointed in all three of you ms walker said stepping closer breaking and entering is a serious crime and the three of you have no business she stopped short and let out a little gurgle as her eyes fell on the backdrop she had been so surprised to find zeke brian and me onstage she hadnt seen it until now oh no oh good heavens she cried raising both hands to her face she tilted sort of toppled from side to side i thought she was about to fall over how could you she gasped she hurried across the stage her eyes on the paintsplotched backdrop how could you ruin it all the students worked for so many days to get it right how could you ruin it for everyone we didnt zeke said quietly we didnt do it i repeated she shook her head hard as if trying to shake us away im afraid ive caught you redhanded she said quietly almost sadly i saw tears brim in her eyes ms walker really i started she raised a hand to stop me was it so important to you three to have your little joke she asked her voice trembling ms walker was it so important to make everyone believe there is a phantom so important that you broke into the school committed a serious crime and then completely destroyed the scenery for our play was your joke so important we really didnt do it i insisted my voice trembling too ms walker stepped forward and rubbed a finger over a red paint splotch on the backdrop when she pulled the finger away it was smeared with red paint the paint is still wet she said her eyes burning accusingly into mine theres no one else here are you going to keep lying to me all night if youd just give us a chance zeke started im especially disappointed in you brian ms walker said shaking her head a frown tightening her features you just started at this school a week or so ago you should be on your best behavior brian blushed redder than ive ever seen a human blush he lowered his eyes as if he were guilty i took a deep breath ms walker you have to let us explain i cried shrilly we really didnt do this we found it like this really ms walker opened her mouth to speak but changed her mind okay she crossed her arms over her skinny chest go ahead but i want the truth the truth i said i raised my right hand as if swearing an oath brian zeke and i did sneak into the school we didnt really break in we climbed in through a window why ms walker demanded sternly what are you doing here why arent you home where you should be we came to look for the phantom zeke broke in he swept his blond hair back with one hand he always did that to his hair when he was really tense we told you about the phantom this morning but you didnt believe us of course i didnt believe you ms walker declared its an old legend just a story she frowned at zeke zeke let out a frustrated sigh we saw the phantom ms walker brooke and i we saw him hes the one who painted all over the backdrop not us hes the one who swung down from the catwalk and grabbed brooke at rehearsal why should i believe that ms walker demanded her arms still tightly crossed in front her because its true i said zeke brian and i we came to the auditorium to look for the phantom where were you going to look for him ms walker asked well zeke stammered probably underneath the stage you were going to take the trapdoor down ms walker asked i nodded maybe if we had to but i clearly instructed everyone to stay away from the trapdoor she said i know i told her and im sorry were all sorry but we are really desperate to find the phantom to prove to you that he is real that were not making him up her expression remained hard she continued to glare at us i havent heard anything to convince me she said when we got here we heard some noises zeke told her shifting uncomfortably from foot to foot footsteps floorboards creaking so we knew someone else was here and then the backdrop started to come down brian broke in his voice shaky and small we just stood here and watched it ms walker thats the truth and then when we saw how it was messed up we we couldnt believe it ms walkers expression softened a little brian sounded so upset i think she was starting to believe him i worked so hard on that backdrop brian continued it was the first thing i ever worked on at this school and i wanted it to be good i wouldnt wreck my own backdrop for a dumb joke i really wouldnt ms walker uncrossed her arms she glanced at each of us then returned her eyes to the backdrop her lips silently formed the words of the scrawled message stay away from my home sweet home she shut her eyes and kept them shut for a long moment then she turned back to us i want to believe you she confessed with a sigh but i just dont know she began to pace back and forth in front of us i drove back to school because id forgotten your math test papers i heard voices in the auditorium i come in here and i find you on the stage the scenery totally smeared and destroyed the paint still wet and you ask me to believe that a mysterious phantom from over seventy years ago is responsible i didnt say a word neither did zeke or brian i dont think we had anything more to say the weird thing is im starting to believe you ms walker said frowning the three of us let out relieved sighs at least im starting to believe that you didnt paint on the backdrop she shook her hair hard her skinny body shuddered its getting late she said softly lets all go home i need to think about this maybe we need to ask mr levy for an investigation maybe he can help us find the culprit who is trying to ruin our play oh no i thought not the principal what if he decides to cancel our play but i didnt say anything none of us did we didnt even look at one another we followed ms walker out into the hall i was just so relieved that she had started to believe us and that she was letting us go she clicked on a hall light so we could see our way we took a few steps walking behind her then we all stopped at once we all saw the red paint spots on the hall floor a trail of red paint spots well look at this ms walker declared our painter was a little careless he or she left a trail to follow she clicked on more lights we followed the red paint splotches down the long hall we could clearly see a shoe print in one of the bigger paint puddles i dont believe this zeke whispered to me someone left a trail im glad i whispered back maybe the paint drips will lead us to the one who splotched up the backdrop you mean the phantom zeke whispered we turned a corner we passed a small paint smear at least this will prove to ms walker that were telling the truth brian said softly we turned another corner the paint trail stopped suddenly one last tiny red puddle stood in front of a locker hmmmm ms walker said thoughtfully moving her eyes from the paint smear to the locker the trail seems to lead right to here hey zeke cried out startling all of us i could see his eyes go wide with shock thats my locker no one said anything for a moment i could hear zekes breaths short and fast i turned to him he was staring at his locker staring hard at the gray metal door as if he could see inside open your locker zeke ms walker instructed she said it through gritted teeth huh zeke gaped at her as if he didnt understand what she meant he lowered his eyes to the smear of red paint on the floor under his locker door go ahead open your locker ms walker repeated patiently she suddenly looked very tired zeke hesitated but theres nothing in there he protested just books and notebooks and stuff please ms walker motioned to the combination lock with one hand please zeke its really late but you dont think zeke started ms walker motioned to the lock again maybe somebody wanted to make it look like zeke was the one with the paint i suggested maybe someone deliberately made that trail of paint lead to zekes locker maybe ms walker replied calmly thats why i want him to open his locker okay okay zeke muttered his hand shook as he reached for the combination lock he leaned his head forward and concentrated as he spun the dial first one direction then the other give me some light he said edgily i backed up sorry i didnt realize i was standing in his light i glanced at brian he had his hands shoved in his pockets he leaned against the wall and stared intently at zekes hands as zeke twirled the lock finally zeke pulled the lock open with a loud click he lifted the handle and pulled open the door i leaned forward to peer inside at the same time as ms walker we nearly bumped heads we both saw the can of paint at the same time a small can of red paint resting on the locker floor the lid wasnt on tight splashes of red paint dripped over the side of the can but it isnt mine zeke wailed ms walker let out a long sigh im sorry zeke it isnt mine zeke whined really ms walker it isnt im going to call your parents to come in for a serious talk ms walker said biting her lower lip and of course youre out of the play oh nooo zeke moaned he slammed the locker door shut as hard as he could the crash echoed down the long empty hall ms walker flinched from the sound she flashed zeke an angry look then she turned to brian and me so you two were also involved tell the truth no brian and i both called out we didnt do it i added i started to say neither did zeke but i could see that it was too late there was no way to argue against the can of paint in the locker zeke was a cooked goose if i find out that you and brian had anything to do with it ill remove you from the play and call your parents in too ms walker threatened now go home all of you we turned and trudged out the door without another word the night air felt cold against my hot skin i shivered the halfmoon was covered by a sheet of gray mist the mist looked like a ghostly figure floating over the moon i followed zeke and brian down the concrete steps a gust of wind made my jacket flap behind me do you believe it zeke muttered angrily do you believe it no i replied shaking my head poor zeke i could see he was really messed up and when his parents got that call from ms walker zeke was going to be even more messed up how did that paint get in your locker brian asked him his eyes peering into zekes zeke turned away how should i know he snapped we made our way to the sidewalk zeke angrily kicked an empty cardboard juice box into the street see you tomorrow i guess brian said unhappily he gave us a little wave then turned and started walking slowly toward his house zeke jogged off in the other direction arent you going to walk home with me i called no he shouted back and kept going in a way i was glad he had left i didnt really know what to say to him i just felt so bad i started walking slowly my head down thinking hard when i saw a small round light floating toward me through the darkness the light grew bigger i realized it was a bicycle headlight the bike turned out of the school parking lot and rolled smoothly steadily toward me when it was a few feet away i recognized the bike rider tina i cried in surprise what are you doing here she squealed to a stop bouncing in the seat her dark eyes caught the light of the streetlamp above us she smiled an odd smile hi brooke hows it going she asked was she in the school i wondered did she just come out of the school whered you come from i repeated her strange smile remained on her face a friends she said im just coming from a friends were you in the school i blurted out the school no not me she replied she shifted her weight then raised her feet to the pedals better zip up that jacket brooke she said you dont want to catch a cold do you on saturday we had play rehearsals all day long in the auditorium the performance was only a week away we all worked hard and the rehearsal went well i only forgot my lines twice but it wasnt the same without zeke robert hernandez had taken zekes place i like robert but hes a very serious guy he doesnt get my jokes and he doesnt like to kid around or be kidded after lunch robert and corey were rehearsing a scene together ms walker still hadnt returned from lunch i wandered over to brian he had a paintbrush in his hand dripping with black paint he was leaning over the new backdrop putting some final touches on the gray bricks looks good i told him i had a sudden urge to slap him on the back and make him smear black paint all over but i decided that might not go over too well i dont know where these sudden urges come from hows it going brian asked without looking up he was filling in some spots he had missed okay i guess i replied across the stage i saw tina working with a large glue pot she was brushing a thick layer of glue onto a cardboard chandelier robert is going to be a good phantom brian said scratching his chin with the tip of the paintbrush handle yeah i agreed but i kind of miss zeke brian nodded then he turned to look up at me you know what there hasnt been one practical joke since zeke left no scenery ruined no mysterious phantoms leaping out at us no threatening words scrawled on the walls nothing nothing bad since ms walker kicked zeke out i hadnt thought about it until that second but brian was right ever since zeke had been removed from the play the phantom had totally disappeared everything had been going so smoothly i hadnt even stopped to realize it did this mean that zeke actually was the phantom that zeke had been doing all those horrible things after all did zekes parents have a cow when ms walker called them in to school brian asked did he get punished for sure i replied still thinking about the phantom his parents grounded him for life and they took away his vcr that means no horror movies zeke cant live without horror movies brian snickered maybe zeke has seen too many horror movies he said okay people a voice called loudly i turned to see that ms walker had returned from lunch lets take it from the opening of act two she called well do the whole act i said goodbye to brian and hurried to the front of the stage esmerelda was in just about every scene of act two this time i was determined to remember every word as i stepped beside robert i saw ms walker pick up her script from the table where she always left it she grasped it in both hands and started to open it to act two i watched her expression change as her hands worked at the script she let out a short angry cry then she tugged some more at the thick script hey she shouted angrily now whos the joker ms walker whats wrong robert called she raised the script and shook it furiously the pages of my script theyve all been glued together she fumed startled gasps rose up around the stage thats it ms walker cried she heaved the script at the wall that was the last joke the play is canceled everybody go home its canceled did ms walker change her mind zeke asked i nodded yeah she calmed down after a few seconds and said the play could go on but she was in a really bad mood for the rest of the day at least this time she couldnt blame me zeke said quietly he tossed a pink rubber ball across the living room and buster his black cocker spaniel went scrambling after it brian and i had dropped by zekes house to tell him how things were going zeke was grounded probably forever and couldnt leave the house his parents were at the movies theyd be home in a few hours buster dropped the ball and started barking at brian zeke laughed he doesnt like you brian he picked up the ball and bounced it over the carpet again but buster ignored the ball and kept barking at brian brian blushed he reached out to pet the dogs head whats your problem fella im not a bad guy buster scampered away from brian and crossed the room to search for the ball which had rolled into the hallway well i guess this proves theres some other joker in the class zeke said his smile fading he settled back on the couch guess this proves that it wasnt me doing all the bad things i started to make a joke but i caught the serious expression on zekes face so i didnt say anything theres a phantom and it isnt me zeke said and now everyone thinks im a liar ms walker thinks i tried to ruin the play even my parents think ive turned into a bad guy you were a much better phantom than robert i said trying to cheer him up theres less than a week to go and robert still keeps messing up his lines he says hes sorry he tried out for the play he doesnt even want to be in it now zeke jumped to his feet if we could prove that im not the phantom ill bet ms walker would give the part back to me uhoh i said i could see zekes mind working i knew what he was going to say next uhoh brian echoed he also knew what zeke was going to say lets go to school zeke said his eyes wide with excitement lets find the phantom this time i really want to get my part back i shook my head no way zeke i started i really want to show everyone that i didnt try to ruin the play zeke insisted brian tossed the ball to the dog the dog watched it bounce away but youre grounded remember brian said to zeke zeke shrugged if we find the phantom and prove that im innocent my parents will be glad i went and i wont be grounded anymore come on guys one more try please i stared back at zeke thinking hard i didnt think it was a good idea the last time we sneaked into the auditorium we ended up in major trouble i could see by brians expression that he didnt want to go either but how could we say no to zeke he was practically begging us it was a warm night but i felt chilled just the same as we walked to school i kept seeing shadows moving close as if reaching for us but when i turned to see them they vanished brooke you have too much imagination i scolded myself i wished my heart would stop thudding like a bass drum i wished i were home watching tv with jeremy i had a bad feeling about our little adventure a very bad feeling we didnt waste any time trying the doors we climbed into the school through the same home ec room window then once again we made our way silently down the dark halls to the auditorium one row of lights had been left on at the back of the seats the stage lay dark and bare except for the gray brick backdrop against the back wall zeke led the way down the center aisle he had given us each a flashlight we clicked them on as we made our way to the stage the beams of light played over the empty rows of seats i raised mine to the stage and swept it from side to side no one up there no sign of anything unusual zeke this is a waste of time i said whispering even though no one could hear us he raised a finger to his lips were going down below the stage zeke said quietly his eyes straight ahead and were going to find him brooke this time were going to find him i had never seen zeke so serious so determined a chill of fear went slowly down my back but i decided not to argue with him uh maybe i should stay up on the stage while you two go down brian suggested i could stand guard stand guard against what zeke demanded raising his flashlight to brians face i could see brians frightened expression against anyone who might come he replied weakly all three of us have to go down zeke insisted if we do find the phantom i want two witnesses you and brooke but the phantom is a ghost right brian demanded how do we find a ghost zeke glared at him well find him brian shrugged we could both see that there was no point in arguing with zeke tonight the floorboards on the stage creaked as we made our way to the trapdoor our flashlights moved over the outline of the square platform in the floor brian and i huddled close together in the center of the square zeke stomped hard on the little wooden peg then jumped beside us we heard the familiar clanking sound then the gentle hum as the platform started to lower the stage appeared to rise up all around us in a few seconds we were surrounded by four black walls the light from our flashlights washed over the walls as we sank lower and lower under the stage my heart felt as if it were sinking too down to my knees the three of us stood pressed together in the center of the platform the clanking and grinding sounds grew louder as we went down finally we hit the bottom with a hard thud for a few seconds none of us moved zeke was the first to step off the platform he raised his flashlight and swept it slowly around we were in the middle of a large empty chamber it tunneled out in two directions here phantom here boy zeke called softly as if calling his dog here phantom where are you phantom he called in a singsong voice i stepped off the platform and gave him a shove stop it i insisted i thought you were serious about this why are you making a joke of it just trying to keep you from getting too scared zeke replied but of course i knew the truth he was trying to keep himself from getting too scared i turned back to brian in the dim tight he looked scared enough for both of us theres no one down here can we go back up now he pleaded no way zeke told him follow me keep your light down on the ground so we can see where were going walking side by side brian and i followed zeke into the chamber we stepped into a long tunnel took a few steps then stopped to listen silence my legs were trembling in fact my entire body was shaking but zeke was acting so brave there was no way id let him know how frightened i was this tunnel probably stretches all the way under the school zeke whispered moving his light ahead of us maybe even farther maybe it goes under the entire block we took another few steps then stopped when we heard a noise behind us a clanking followed by a loud hum hey brian cried out shrilly the trapdoor all three of us spun around and started running back toward it our heavy footsteps echoed loudly through the dark tunnel my chest was aching so hard by the time we got back to the trapdoor platform i could hardly breathe it its going back up zeke cried we stood there helplessly gazing at the platform as it rose over our heads climbing back up to the stage push the switch zeke cried to me bring it back down i fumbled on the wall till i found the switch i tried to move it but it was stuck no it had been locked it wouldnt budge the trapdoor platform stopped high above us a heavy silence fell over the three of us as we stared up in the darkness zeke now were trapped down here i uttered theres no way back up were totally trapped we waited to see if someone was coming down but the trapdoor remained closed up there brian let out a frightened sigh somebody did it he whispered staring up to the platform somebody pushed the switch and sent it back up the phantom i cried i turned to zeke now what zeke shrugged now we have no choice if we want to get out of here we have to find the phantom our circles of yellow light trembled over the floor as we turned and headed back into the tunnel no one said a word as we followed it around one curve then another the floor became soft and muddy the air grew cooler i heard a soft chittering sound in the distance i hoped it wasnt a bat brian and i had to hurry to keep up with zeke he was taking long strides his flashlight swinging back and forth in front of him suddenly i heard low musical humming it took me a while to realize it was coming from zeke he was humming a tune to himself come on zeke give me a break i thought youve got to be scared you cant fool me with a little cheerful humming you are as scared as i am i started to tease him about it but the tunnel suddenly ended and we found ourselves at a low doorway brian hung back but zeke and i stepped up to the door our flashlights beaming over it anyone in there zeke called in a strange tiny voice no reply i reached out and pushed the door it creaked open zeke and i raised our flashlights and aimed them inside a room all furnished i saw a folding chair a beatup couch with one of the cushions missing bookshelves along one wall my flashlight fell over a small table a bowl and a box of cornflakes stood on the table i swept the light around and saw a small unmade bed against the far wall zeke and brian followed me into the room our beams of light slid slowly over every object every piece of furniture an oldfashioned record player stood on a low table a stack of old records was piled beside it do you believe this zeke whispered a grin spread over his face i think weve found the phantoms home i whispered back his flashlight tilting in front of him brian made his way to the table he peered down at the cereal bowl the phantom he was just here brian said the cereal isnt soggy yet this is amazing i cried someone actually lives down here way below the i stopped because i felt a sneeze coming on maybe a whole sneezing fit i tried to hold it in but i couldnt i sneezed once twice five times stop it brooke brian pleaded hell hear you but we want to find him zeke reminded brian i sneezed seven times then one more for good luck finally i was all sneezed out he heard that i know he did brian fretted his eyes darted around in fear the door slammed shut nooo we all jumped and cried out my heart leaped to my mouth every muscle in my body tied itself into a knot we turned to stare at the door someone had closed it i knew it hadnt been blown shut by any wind zeke was the first to move lowering his flashlight he hurtled to the door he grabbed the knob and pushed hard the door didnt budge zeke lowered his shoulder against the door twisting the knob he pushed again still no success he banged his shoulder against the door pushed again strained against the door with all his weight when he turned back to us his face revealed his fear for the first time we were locked in he said softly i rushed up beside zeke maybe if all three of us try i suggested maybe zeke replied but i could see he didnt have much hope i swallowed hard seeing zeke so frightened made me even more frightened yeah lets all push together brian agreed stepping up beside me we can break the door down if we have to way to go brian i thought hes finally showing some spirit we lined up against the door and prepared to push i took another deep breath and held it i was trying to calm myself down my arms and legs felt as if they were made of chewing gum this is just so scary i realized if we are locked in this tiny room and cant get out we could be here for the rest of our lives we are miles and miles away from the rest of the world everyone will search and search up above and theyll never find us and even if we yell and scream at the tops of our lungs for help theres no way anyone could hear us well be trapped here forever i took another deep breath okay on the count of three i said on three everybody push zeke started to count one two whoa wait a minute i interrupted i stared at the door we pushed the door to get in here right yeah i guess zeke replied staring hard at me so it wont push open from inside i said we have to pull it open hey youre right zeke cried i grabbed the knob twisted it and pulled hard the door slid open easily and there was a man standing in the doorway my flashlight moved up to his face i recognized him instantly emile the little whitehaired man who said he was the night janitor he blocked the doorway and glared in at us an ugly menacing scowl on his scarred face let us go i shrieked he didnt move his strange gray eyes moved from zeke to brian to me you have to let us out of here i insisted and then i added meekly please his scowl grew even angrier the light from the flashlight made the long scar on his cheek look even deeper he didnt budge from the doorway why are you down here he demanded in his hoarse whisper of a voice why are you in my home so you are the phantom i blurted out he narrowed his eyes at me in surprise phantom his expression turned thoughtful i guess you could call me that brian uttered a low cry this is my home sweet home the man said angrily why are you here why didnt you listen to my warnings your warnings i asked i was shaking so hard the light from my flashlight was dancing all over the wall i did everything i could to keep you away the phantom said to keep you from my home you mean the paint on the backdrop swinging down from the catwalk the scary mask in my locker with the note i cried in astonishment the phantom nodded i tried to warn you i didnt want to hurt anyone but i had to protect my home and so you tried to stop our play zeke demanded huddling close to me you tried to ruin our play so we wouldnt use the trapdoor and find you down here the phantom nodded and what happened seventytwo years ago i asked him what happened to you the first time the play was supposed to be performed why did you disappear that night the phantoms expression changed i saw confusion in his silvery eyes i i dont understand he stammered staring hard at me his white hair falling over his forehead seventytwo years ago i insisted a bitter smile formed on his lips hey im not that old he replied im only fiftyseven then youre not the phantom zeke asked uncertainly emile shook his head he let out a weary sigh i dont understand this phantom talk young man im just a poor homeless guy trying to protect my little space all three of us studied him trying to decide if he was telling the truth i decided that he was youve been living here under the school i asked softly how did you know about this room down here my father worked at the school for thirty years emile replied he used to bring me here with him when i was a kid when i lost my apartment in town i remembered this space ive been living here ever since for nearly six months now his eyes glared angrily again he brushed the hair off his forehead as his ugly scowl returned but youre ruining it for me arent you he said sharply youre ruining it all for me he moved quickly stepping from the doorway entering the room walking toward us with that menacing expression i stumbled back whwhat are you going to do to us i cried you ruined everything everything he repeated moving toward us now wait i cried raising my hands as if to shield myself then i heard a sound from out in the tunnel a low clanking sound i turned to zeke and brian they heard it too the trapdoor it was moving coming down we could hear it at the other end of the tunnel i think all three of us had the same idea at once we had to get to that trapdoor it was our only chance of escape you ruined everything emile repeated suddenly sounding more sad than angry why didnt you listen to my warnings without saying a word to each other zeke brian and i charged for the door oh i bumped into emile as i scooted past to my surprise he didnt reach out to grab me didnt try to stop me i led the way out the door running at full speed my legs still felt as rubbery as chewing gum but i forced them to move one running step then another i didnt glance back but i could hear zeke and brian at my heels and then i heard emiles voice echoing through the tunnels you ruined everything everything was emile chasing after us i didnt care i just wanted to get to that trapdoor platform and get out of there i plunged blindly through the dark curving tunnel my sneakers sank into the soft dirt floor as i ran my shoulder scraped the rough wall but i didnt slow down the light bounced over the ground at my feet i raised it as the trapdoor platform came into view i was gasping for breath my side ached from running huh what are you doing down here a mans voice called zekes dad zeke brian and i scrambled on to the platform squeezing beside him whats going on mr matthews demanded whose voice is that up i managed to choke out take us up zeke reached out and flipped the switch this time it moved with a hard jerk the platform started to raise itself i gazed back to the tunnel had emile followed after us no no sign of him he hadnt even chased us weird i thought so weird i heard a mans voice who was that mr matthews demanded again a homeless guy living beneath the stage i said explaining what happened and how he had been trying to scare us for weeks how did you know we were down there zeke asked his dad you were supposed to be at home he replied sternly you were grounded youre still grounded but when you werent at home i figured id find you poking around the stage again the side door to the school was open i entered the auditorium and heard the trapdoor moving i decided to see what was going on im so glad i cried i felt like hugging mr matthews as soon as the platform stopped we scrambled to the stage zekes dad hurried to call the police he told them there was a homeless guy living under the school the police arrived quickly we watched them go down the trapdoor we waited for them to bring emile up but they returned a few minutes later without him no one down there an officer reported he removed his helmet and scratched his black wavy hair no sign of anyone either just a bed and some old furniture what about his food his books i asked all gone the officer replied guess he cleared out real fast the basement door was still slightly open after the police left brian said good night and headed out of the auditorium zekes dad was going to drive me home i turned to zeke so theres your phantom i said with a little sadness just a poor homeless man not a seventytwoyearold ghost whos been haunting the school since it was built just a poor homeless man yeah its disappointing zeke replied frowning i really wanted to meet a real ghost a real phantom his expression brightened but at least now ms walker will believe me and ill get my part in the play back the play id almost forgotten about the play zeke was right i thought happily hell get his part back now everything will go fine the phantom is gone now we can all relax i thought now we can enjoy ourselves and put on a great performance wow was i wrong the night of the performance i sat in the girls dressing room smearing globs of stage makeup all over my face id never worn so much makeup before and didnt think i was doing it right i didnt even want to wear the gunk in the first place but ms walker said we all had to even the guys she said it cuts down on the glare from the lights and makes your face less shiny on stage it was a wild scene in the girls dressing room we were all struggling into our costumes and brushing on makeup lisa rego and gia bentley two fifthgraders who didnt even have big parts in the play were hogging the fulllength mirror laughing and giggling and admiring themselves by the time i got to check myself out the stage manager was calling places places everyone my stomach jumped calm down brooke i ordered myself this is supposed to be fun remember i stepped out of the dressing room crossed the hall entered the auditorium through the stage door and took my place at the side of the stage someone tapped me on the shoulder and i jumped a mile man was i jittery i whirled around and found myself facetoface with the phantom i knew it was only zeke in his costume and mask but he startled me just the same zeke you look so real you look awesome i told him zeke didnt reply he gave me a very formal bow from the waist then hurried to take his place the curtain was closed but i could hear the steady rumble of voices out in the auditorium i peeked out of the side of the curtain wow every seat was filled that thought sent my stomach doing jumping jacks all over again the lights began to dim the audience instantly became silent the stage lights went up the music started go for it brooke i told myself just go for it the play didnt get strange until the end of the first act we were all doing really well until then when the curtain opened and the audience applauded the set i stepped out onstage with corey and i completely forgot about my stage fright be careful daughter corey warned playing my father theres a creature living beneath this theater a twisted phantom scarred and ugly i do not believe you father i replied as esmerelda you are only trying to control me to keep me a child the audience seemed to be having a great time they laughed in the right places and applauded several times this is excellent i thought i was excited without being nervous i was enjoying every minute of the performance and as the first act drew near its end i knew the real highlight of the show was coming a fog of dry ice swept slowly over the stage blue lights swirled through the twisting fog making it appear eerie and unreal i heard the clank of the trapdoor i knew it was carrying zeke in his phantom costume up from down below in seconds the phantom would make his big entrance rising up in the blue fog the audience will love it i thought watching the fog billow up over my long yellow dress phantom is that you i called are you coming to see me the phantoms blueandgreen mask floated up in the fog then his blackcaped shoulders hovered into view the audience gasped and then cheered as the phantom rose standing stiffly in the fog his black cape billowing out behind him and then he stepped toward me walking slowly majestically oh phantom we are together at last i cried with all the emotion i could put into it i have dreamed of this moment for so long i took his gloved hand and led him through the swirls of blue fog to the front of the stage a white spotlight captured us both i turned to face him stared into his eyes behind the blueandgreen mask and realized instantly that it wasnt zeke i started to cry out but he squeezed my hand his eyes burned into mine he seemed to be begging me with his eyes begging me not to say anything not to give him away who is he i wondered frozen in the bright spotlight why does he look familiar i turned back to the audience silent waiting for me to speak i took a deep breath and said esmereldas next line phantom why do you haunt this theater please tell me your story i will not be afraid the phantom swept his cape behind him his eyes were still locked on mine his gloved hand still squeezed mine tightly as if to keep me from escaping i have lived under this theater for more than seventy years he declared my story is a sad one you might even call it tragic my fair esmerelda please continue i exclaimed who is he i asked myself who i was chosen to star in a play the phantom revealed a play in this very theater it was to be the greatest night of my life he paused to take a long deep breath my heart skipped a beat he isnt reciting the script i realized those arent the right words what is he saying but my great night was never to be the phantom continued still gripping my hand you see my dear esmerelda an hour before the play was to begin i fell i plunged to my death i gasped he was pointing to the trapdoor i realized who he was now he was the boy who had disappeared the boy seventytwo years ago who was to star as the phantom but disappeared and was never found here he was standing beside me on the same stage here he was revealing to us all how he had disappeared why the play was never performed there he cried pointing to the opening in the stage floor thats where i fell there i fell to my death i became a real phantom and ive waited down there ever since waiting waiting hoping for a night like tonight where i could finally play my greatest role as he finished this speech the audience burst into cheers and loud applause they think its part of the play i realized they dont know the true pain behind his words they dont know that hes revealing his true story to them the phantom took a deep bow the applause grew even louder the fog billowed over us both who is he who the question repeated in my mind i had to know the answer i had to know who the phantom was as he stood up from his bow i pulled my hand free of his then i reached up and tugged off his mask i squinted into the thick blue fog desperate to see his face the bright spotlight flashed in my eyes blinding me for a moment in that moment the phantom covered his face with both hands i reached to pull away his hands no he screamed no you cant he staggered back away from me staggered and lost his balance no no he cried you cant you cant and toppled backwards into the open trapdoor and vanished in the swirling blue fog i heard his scream all the way down then silence a horrible still silence the audience rose to its feet and burst into loud applause and cries of bravo they all thought it was part of the play but i knew better i knew that the phantom had finally revealed himself after seventytwo years that he had finally had his moment on the stage and that he had died all over again as the curtain closed muffling the excited cheers of the audience i stood at the opening in the floor my hands pressed to my face i couldnt speak i couldnt move i stared down into the hole in the floor and saw only blackness then raising my eyes i saw zeke running across the stage to me wearing jeans and a white tshirt he lurched toward me his expression dazed zeke i cried ow someone hit me i think he moaned rubbing the back of his head ive been out cold he raised his eyes to mine brooke are you okay did the phantom i cried he took your part zeke he hes down there i pointed into the opening weve got to find him i stepped on the peg the trapdoor clanked and groaned the platform returned to the top zeke and i climbed aboard we rode it down down to the dark chamber below we searched every corner we didnt find him we didnt find the mask or the costume or anything somehow i knew we wouldnt somehow i knew we would never see him again great job people great job ms walker called to us as we trooped offstage phantom i liked the new lines you added great job see you all at the cast party zeke and i struggled to get to the dressing room so we could get changed but we were mobbed by people who wanted to congratulate us and tell us how talented and terrific we were the play was a major success i searched for brian i wanted to tell him all about the phantom but i couldnt see him in the excited crowd of friends and parents come on lets get out of here zeke cried he pulled me by the hand out of the auditorium and into the hall wow were a hit i exclaimed feeling totally wrecked and pumped and dazed and crazed all at the same time lets just get our coats and get changed at home zeke suggested we can try to figure out who played my part on the way then we can meet at my house to go to the party okay i agreed but we have to hurry my parents are waiting to tell me what a fabulous star i am the sound of excited chattering and laughter drifted from the auditorium and followed us as we made our way to our lockers hey i stopped in front of my locker look zeke the door is open i didnt leave it unlocked weird zeke murmured i pulled the door all the way open and a book toppled out onto the floor i bent to pick it up it was an old book its brown cover worn and dusty i turned it around squinting to read the cover in the dim hall light its a really old yearbook i told zeke look its from this school woods mill but its from the s huh howd it get in your locker zeke asked staring down at it my eyes fell on a torn sheet of paper tucked inside a bookmark gripping the heavy old book in both hands i opened to the pages marked by the bookmark wow zeke cried i dont believe it we were staring at a yearbook article about the play we had just performed the phantom to be performed in the spring read the headline at the top this must have been written early that school year i said we know the play was never performed we know the whole story of what happened back then hold the book up to the light zeke instructed lets check out the pictures i raised the book and we both stared down at the small photographs that covered the two pages then we saw it a small blurred blackandwhite photo of the boy who had won the starring role the boy who was to play the phantom the boy who had disappeared the boy was brian
