the antarean dynasties by mike resnick to thank the maker of all things for the birth of his first male offspring the emperor maloth iv ordered his architects to build a temple that would forever dwarf all other buildings on the planet it was to be made entirely of crystal and the spire covered roof which looked like a million glistening spearpoints aimed at the sun would be supported by columns to honor his forebears when struck each column would sound a musical note that could be heard for kilometers calling the faithful to prayer the structure would be known as the temple of the honored sun for his heir had been born exactly at midday when the sun was highest in the sky the temple took standard years to complete and although races from all across the galaxy would come to antares iii to marvel at it maloth further decreed that no aliens or nonbelievers would ever be allowed to enter it and desecrate its sacred corridors with their presence a man a woman and a child emerge from the temple of the honored sun the woman holds a camera to her eye capturing the same image from a dozen unimaginative angles the child his lip sparsely covered with hair that is supposed to imply maturity never sees beyond the game he is playing on his pocket computer the man looks around to make sure no one is watching him grinds out a smokeless cigar beneath his heel and then increases his pace until he joins them they approach me and i will myself to become one with my surroundings to insinuate myself into the marble walls and stone walkways before they can speak to me i am invisible you cannot see me you will pass me by hey fella were looking for a guide says the man you interested i stifle a sigh and bow deeply i am honored i say glad that they do not understand the subtleties of antarean inflection wow exclaims the woman aiming her camera at me i never saw anything like that its almost as if you folded your torso in half can you do it again i am reminded of an ancient legend possibly aprocryphal though i choose to believe it an ambassador who was equally fascinated by the way the antarean body is jointed once asked komarith i the founder of the th dynasty to bow a second time komarith merely stared at him without moving until the embarrassed ambassador slunk away he went on to rule for years and was never known to bow again it has been a long time since komarith almost seven millennia now and antares and the universe have changed i bow for the woman while she snaps her holographs whats your name asks the man you could not pronounce it i reply when i conduct members of your race i choose the name hermes herman eh hermes i correct him right herman the boy finally looks up he said hermes dad the man shrugs whatever he looks at his timepiece well lets get started yeah chimes in the child theyre piping in the game from roosevelt iii this afternoon ive got to get back for it you can watch sports anytime says the woman this may be your only chance to see antares i should be so lucky he mutters returning his attention to his computer i recite my introductory speech almost by rote allow me to welcome you to antares iii and to its capital city of kalimetra known throughout the galaxy as the city of a million spires i didnt see any million spires when we took the shuttle in from the spaceport says the child whom i could have sworn was not listening a thousand or two maybe there was a time when there were a million i explain today only remain each is made of quartz or crystal in late afternoon when the sun sinks low in the sky they act as a prism for its rays creating a flood of exotic colors that stretches across the thoroughfares of the city races have come from halfway across the galaxy to experience the effect sixteen thousand murmurs the woman i wonder what happened to the rest no one knew why antareans found the spires so aesthetically pleasing they towered above the cities casting their shadows and their shifting colors across the landscape tall delicate exquisite they reflected a unique grandness of vision and sensitivity of spirit the rulers of antares iii spent almost years constructing their million spires during the second invasion it took the canphorite armada less than two weeks to destroy all but of them the woman is still admiring the spires that she can see in the distance finally she asks who built them as if they are too beautiful to have been created by antareans the artisans and craftsmen of my race built everything you will see today i answer all by yourselves is it so difficult for you to believe i ask gently no she says defensively of course not its just that theres so much kalimetra was not created in a day or a year or even a millennium i point out it is the cumulative achievement of antarean dynasties so were in the rd dynasty now she asks it was zelorean ix who officially declared kalimetra to be the eternal city neither war nor insurrection had ever threatened its stability and even the towering temples of his forefathers gave every promise of lasting for all eternity it was a golden age and he could see no reason why it should not go on forever the last absolute ruler of the rd dynasty has been dust for almost three thousand years i explain since then we have been governed by a series of conquerers each alien race superceding the last thank goodness they didnt destroy your buildings says the woman turning to admire a water fountain which for some reason appears to her to be a mystical alien artifact she is about to take a holo when the child restrains her its just a goddamned water bubbler ma he says but its fascinating she says imagine what kind of beings used it in ages past thirsty ones says the bored child she ignores him and turns back to me as i was saying it must be criminal to rob the galaxy of such treasures yeah well somebody destroyed some buildings around here interjects the child who seems intent on proving someone wrong about something remember the hole in the ground we saw over that way he points in the direction of the footprint looks like a bomb crater to me you are mistaken i explain leading them over to it it has always been there its just a big sinkhole says the man totally unimpressed it is worshipped by my people as the footprint of god i explain once many eons ago kalimetra was in the throes of a yearslong drought finally jorvash our greatest priest offered his own life if god would bring the rains god replied that it would not rain until he wept again and we had not yet suffered enough to bring forth his tears of compassion but he promised that he would strike a bargain with jorvash i pause for effect but the man is lighting another cigar and the child is concentrating on his pocket computer the next morning jorvash was found dead inside his temple while god had created this depression with his foot and filled it with water it sustained us until he finally wept again the woman seems flustered um i hate to ask she finally says but could you repeat that story my recorder wasnt on the man looks uncomfortable shes always forgetting to turn the damned thing on he explains and flips me a coin for your trouble lobilia was the greatest poet in the history of antares iii although he died during the rd dynasty most of his work survived him but his masterpiece the long night of the exile the epic of bagatas exile and his triumphant return was lost forever though he was his races most famous bard lobilia himself was illiterate unable even to write his own name he created his poetry extemporaneously embellishing upon it with each retelling he recited his epic just once and was so satisfied with its form that he refused to repeat it for the scribes who were waiting for a final version and hadnt written it down thank you says the woman deactivating the recorder after i finish she pauses can i buy a book with some more of your quaint folk legends i decide not to explain the difference between a folk legend and an article of belief they are for sale in the gift shop of your hotel i reply you dont have enough books mutters the man she glares at him but says nothing and i lead them to the tomb which always impresses visitors this is the tomb of bedorian v the greatest ruler of the th dynasty i say bedorian was a commoner a simple farmer who deposed the notorious maelastri xii himself a mighty warrior who was the last ruler of the th dynasty it was bedorian who decreed universal education for all antareans what did you have before that our females were not allowed the privilege of literacy until bedorians reign how did this guy finally die asks the man who doesnt really care but is unwilling to let the woman ask all the questions bedorian was assassinated by one of his followers i reply a male no doubt says the woman wryly before he died i continue he united three warring states without fighting a single battle decreed that all antareans should use a common language and outlawed the worship of kreneks what are kreneks they are poisonous reptiles they killed many worshippers in nameless obscene ceremonies before bedorian iv came to power yeah says the child alert again what were they like what is obscene to one being is simply boring to another i say terrans find them dull which is not true but i have no desire to watch the child snicker as i describe the rituals what a shame says the woman though her voice sounds relieved still you certainly seem to know your history i want to answer that i just make up the stories but i am afraid if i say it she will believe it where did you learn all this stuff she continues to become a licensed guide i reply an antarean must undergo fourteen years of study and must also speak a minimum of four alien languages fluently terran is always one of the four thats some set of credentials comments the man i made it through one year of dental school and quit and yet it is you who are paying me im surprised you dont work at one of the local universities he continues i did once which is true but i have my family to feed and tourists tips however small and grudgingly given are still greater than my salary as a teacher a rapu an antarean child insinuates his way between myself and my clients scarcely more than an infant he is dressed in rags and his face is smudged with dirt there are open sores on the reticulated plates of his skin and his golden eyes water constantly he begs plaintively for credits in his native tongue when there is no response he extends his hand in what has become a universal gesture that says you are rich i am poor and hungry give me money yours asks the man frowning as his wife takes half a dozen holos in quick succession no he is not mine what is he doing here he lives in the street i answer my compassion for the rapu alternating with my humilation at having to explain his presence and situation he is asking for coins so that he and his mother will not go hungry tonight i look at the rapu and think sadly timing is everything once long ago we strode across our world like gods you would not have gone hungry in any of the dynasties the human child looks at his antarean counterpart i wonder if he realizes how fortunate he is his face gives no reflection of his thoughts perhaps he has none finally he picks his nose and goes back to manipulating his computer the man stares at the rapu for a moment then flips him a twocredit coin the rapu catches it bows and blesses the man and runs off we watch him go he raises the coin above his head yelling happily and a moment later we are surrounded by twenty more street urchins all filthy all hungry all begging for coins enoughs enough says the man irritably tell them to get the hell out of here and go home herman they live here i explain gently right here demands the man he stomps the ground with his foot and the nearest rapus jump back in fright on this spot okay then tell them to stay here where they live and not follow us i explain to the rapus in our own tongue that these tourists will not give them coins then we will go to the ugly pink hotel where all the men stay and rob their rooms that is none of my concern i say but if you are caught it will go hard with you the oldest of the urchins smiles at my warning if we are caught they will lock us up and because it is a jail they will have to feed us and we will be protected from the rain and the cold it is far better than being here i have no answer for rapus whose only ambition is to be warm and dry and wellfed but merely shrug they run off laughing and singing as if they are human children off to play some game damned aliens mutters the man that is incorrect i say oh a matter of semantics i point out gently they are indigenous you are the aliens well they could do with some lessons in behavior from us aliens then he growls we walk up the long ramp to the tomb and are about to enter it when the woman stops id like a holo of the three of you standing in the entrance she announces she smiles at me just to prove to our friends we were here and that we met a real antarean the man walks over and stands on one side of me the child reluctantly moves to my other side now put your arm around herman says the woman the child steps back and i see a mixture of contempt and disgust on his face ill pose with it but i wont touch it you do what your mother says snaps the man no way says the child stalking sulkily back down the ramp you want to hug him you go ahead you listen to me young man says the man but the child does not stop or give any indication that he has heard and soon he disappears behind a temple it was tcharock the founder of the th dynasty who decreed that the person of the emperor was sacrosanct and could not be touched by any being other than his medics and his concubines and then only with his consent his greatest advisor was chaluba who extended tcharocks rule to more than of the planet and halted the hyperinflation that had been the th dynastys legacy to him one night during a state function chaluba inadvertantly brushed against tcharock while introducing him to the ambassador from far domar the next morning tcharock regretfully gave the signal to the executioner and chaluba was beheaded despite this unfortunate beginning the th dynasty survived for standard years the woman embarrassed begins apologizing to me but i notice that she too avoids touching me the man goes off after the child and a few moments later the two of them return which is just as well for the woman has begun repeating herself the man pushes the child toward me and he sullenly utters an apology the man takes an ominous step toward him and he reluctantly reaches out his hand i take it briefly the contact is no more pleasant for me than for him and then we enter the tomb two other groups are there but they are hundreds of meters away and we cannot hear what their guides are saying how high is the ceiling asks the woman training her camera on the exquisite carvings overhead meters i say the tomb itself is meters long and meters wide the body of beldorian v is in a large vault beneath the floor i pause thinking as always of past glories on the day of mourning the day the tomb was completed a million antareans stood patiently in line outside the tomb to pay their last respects i dont mean to ask a silly question says the woman but why are all the buildings so enormous ego suggests the man confident in his wisdom the maker of all things is huge i explain so my people felt that any monuments to him should be as large as possible so that he might be comfortable inside them you think your god cant find or fit into a small building asks the man with a condescending smile he is everyones god i answer and while he can of course find a small temple why should we force him to live in one did beldorian have a wife asks the woman her mind back to smaller considerations he had five of them i answer the tomb next to this one is known as the place of beldorians queens he was a polygamist i shake my head no beldorian simply outlived his first four queens he must have died a very old man says the woman he did not i answer there is a belief among my people that those who achieve public greatness are doomed to private misery such was beldorians fate i turn to the child who has been silent since returning and ask him if he has any questions but he merely glares at me without speaking how long ago was this place built asks the man beldorian v died standard years ago it took another years to build and prepare the tomb years he muses thats a long time we are an ancient race i reply proudly a human anthropologist has suggested that our rd dynasty commenced before your ancestors crossed over the evolutionary barrier into sentience maybe we spent a long time living in the trees says the man clearly unimpressed and just a bit defensive but look how quickly we passed you once we climbed down if you say so i answer noncommittally in fact everybody passed you he persists look at the record how many times has antares been conquered i am not sure i lie for i find it humiliating to speak of it when the antareans learned that mans republic wish to annex their world they gathered their army in zanthu and then marched out onto the battlefield strong they were the cream of the planets young warriors gold of eye the reticulated plates of their skin glistening in the morning sun prepared to defend their homeworld the republic sent a single ship that flew high overhead and dropped a single bomb and in less than a second there was no longer an antarean army or a city of zanthu or a great library of cthstoka over the millennia antares was conquered four times by man twice by the canphor twins and once each by lodin xi emra ramor and the sett empire it was said that the parched ground had finally quenched its thirst by drinking a lake of antarean blood as we leave the tomb we come to a small skinny rapu he sits on a rock staring at us with his large golden eyes his expression rapt in contemplation the human child pointedly ignores him and continues walking toward the next temple but the adults stop what a cute little thing enthuses the woman and he looks so hungry she digs into her shoulder bag and withdraws a sweet that she has kept from breakfast here she says holding it up would you like it the rapu never moves this is unique not only in the womans experience but also in mine for he is obviously undernourished maybe he cant metabolize it suggests the man he pulls a coin out steps over to the rapu and extends his hand here you go kid the rapu his face frozen in contemplation makes no attempt to grab the coin and suddenly i am thinking excitedly you disdain their food when you are hungry and their money when you are poor could you possibly be the one we have awaited for so many millennia the one who will give us back our former glory and initiate the th dynasty i study him intently and my excitement fades just as quickly as it came upon me the rapu does not disdain their food and their money his golden eyes are clouded over life in the streets has so weakened him that he has become blind and of course he does not understand what they are saying his seeming arrogance comes not from pride or some inner light but because he is not aware of their offerings please i say gently taking the sweet from the woman without coming into actual contact with her fingers i walk over and place it in the rapus hand he sniffs it then gulps it down hungrily and extends his hand blindly begging for more it breaks your heart says the woman oh its no worse than what we saw on bareimus v responds the man they were every bit as poor and remember that awful skin disease that they all had the woman considers and her face reflects the unpleasantness of the memory i suppose youre right at that she shrugs and i can tell that even though the child is still in front of us hand outstretched she has already put him from her mind i lead them through the garden of the vanished princes with its tormented history of sacrifice and intrigue and suddenly the man stops what happened here he asks pointing to a number of empty pedestals history happened i explain or avarice for sometimes they are the same thing he seems confused so i continue if any of our conquerers could find a way to transport a treasure back to his home planet he did anything small enough to be plundered was plundered and these statues that have been defaced he says pointing to them did you do it yourselves so they would be worthless to occupying armies no i answer well whoever did that he points to a headless statue ought to be strung up and whipped whats the fuss asks the child in a bored voice theyre just statues of aliens actually the human who did that was rewarded with the governorship of antares iii i inform them what are you talking about says the man the second human conquest of the antares system was led by commander lois kiboko i begin she defaced or destroyed more than statues many were physical representations of our deity and since she and her crew were devout believers in one of your religions she felt that these were false idols and must be destroyed well the man replies with a shrug its a small price to pay for her saving you from the lodinites perhaps i say the problem is that we had to pay a greater price for each successive savior he stares at me and there is an awkward silence finally i suggest that we visit the palace of the supreme tyrant you seem such a docile race she says awkwardly i mean so civilized and unaggressive how did your gene pool ever create a real honesttogoodness tyrant the truth is that our gene pool was considerably more aggressive before a seemingly endless series of alien conquests decimated it but i know that this answer would make them uncomfortable and could affect the size of my tip so i lie to them instead i am ashamed to admit that lying to aliens becomes easier with each passing day indeed i am sometimes amazed at the facility with which i can create falsehoods every now and then each race produces a genetic sport i say and i can see she believes it and we antareans are so docile to use your expression that this particular one had no difficulty achieving power what was his name i do not know i thought you took fourteen years worth of history courses she says accusingly and i can tell she thinks i am lying to her whereas every time i have actually lied she has believed me our language has many dialects and they have all evolved and changed over years i point out some we have deciphered but to this day many of them remain unsolved mysteries in fact right at this moment a team of human archaeologists is hard at work trying to uncover the tyrants name if its a dead language how are they going to manage that in the days when your race was still planetbound there was an artifact called the rosetta stone that helped you translate an ancient language we have something similar ours is known as the bosperi scroll that comes from the great tyrants era where is it asks the woman looking around i regret to inform you that both the archaeologists and the bosperi scroll are currently in a museum on deluros viii smart says the man they can protect it better on deluros from who asks the woman from anyone who wants to steal it of course he says as if explaining it to a child but i mean who would want to steal the key to a dead language do you know what it would be worth to a collector answers the man or a thief who wanted to ransom it they discuss it further but the simple truth is that it is on deluros because it was small enough to carry and for no other reason when they are through arguing i tell her that it is because they have devices on deluros that will bring back the faded script and she nods her head thoughtfully we walk another kilometers and come to the immense palace of the kings it is made entirely of gold and becomes so hot from the rays of the sun that one can touch the outer surface only at night this was the building in which all the rulers of the th through the th dynasties resided it was from here that my race received the nine proclamations of ascendency and the charter of universal rights and our most revered document the mabelian declaration it was a wondrous time to have lived when we had never tasted defeat and all problems were capable of solution when stately caravans plied their trade across secure boundaries and monarchs were just and wise when each day brought new triumphs and the future held infinite promise ipoint to the broken and defaced stone chair once there were jewels and precious stones embedded in the throne the child walks over to the throne then looks at me accusingly where are they he demands they were all stolen over the millennia i reply by conquerers of course offers the woman with absolute certainty yes i say but again i am lying they were stolen by my own people who traded them to various occupying armies for food or the release of captive loved ones we spend a few more minutes examining the vanished glory of the palace of the kings then walk out the door and approach the next crumbling structure it is the hall of the thinkers revered to this day by all antareans but i know they will not understand why a race would create such an ediface to scholarship and i havent the energy to explain so i tell them that it is the palace of the concubines and of course they believe me at one point the child making no attempt to mask his disappointment asks why there are no statues or carvings showing the concubines and i think very quickly and explain that lois kibokos religious beliefs were offended by the sexual frankness of the artifacts and she had them all destroyed i feel guilty about this lie for it is against the code of just behavior to suggest that a visitors race may have offended in any way ironically while the child voices his disappointment i notice that none of the three seems to have a problem accepting that another human would destroy millenniaold artwork that upset his sensibilities i decide that since they feel no guilt this one time i shall feel none either i see the man anxiously walking around looking into corners and behind pedestals and i ask him if something is wrong wheres the can he says i beg your pardon the can the bathroom the lavatory he frowns didnt any of these goddamned concubines ever have to take a crap i finally discern what he wants and direct him to a human facility that has been constructed just beyond the western door he returns a few minutes later and i lead them all outside past the towering onyx obelisk that marked the beginning of the almostforgotten th dynasty we stop briefly at the temple of the river of light which was constructed over the river so that the sacred waters flow through the temple itself we leave and turn a corner and suddenly a single structure completely dominates the landscape whats that asks the woman that is the spiral ramp to heaven i answer what a fabulous name she enthuses i just know a fabulous story goes with it she turns to me expectantly there was a time before our scientists knew better that people thought you could reach heaven if you simply built a tall enough ramp the child guffaws it is true i continue construction was begun during the nd dyntasy and continued for more than years until midway through the rd it looks as if you can see the top from here but you actually are looking only at the bottom half of it the rest is obscured by clouds how high does it go asked the woman more than nine kilometers i say three kilometers higher than our tallest mountain amazing she exclaims perhaps you would like a closer look at it i suggest you might even wish to climb the first kilometer it is a very gentle ascent until you reach the fifth kilometer yes she replies happily i think id like that very much im not climbing anything says the man oh come on she urges him itll be fun the airs too thin and the gravitys too heavy and its too damned much like work one of these days im going to choose our itinerary and i promise you it wont involve so goddamned much walking can we go back and watch the game asks the child eagerly the man takes one more look at the spiral ramp to heaven yeah he says ive seen enough lets go back we really should finish the tour says the woman well probably never be in this sector of the galaxy again so what its just another backwater world replies the man dont tell your friends about the stairway to the stars or whatever the hell its called and theyll never know you missed it then the woman comes up with what she imagines will be the clinching argument but youve already agreed to pay for the tour so well cut it short and pay him half as much says the man big deal the man pulls a wad of credits out of his pocket and peels off three tencredits notes then he pauses looks at me pockets them and presses a fiftycredit note into my hand instead ah hell you kept your end of the bargain herman he says then he and the woman and child begin walking back to the hotel the first aliens ever to visit antares were rude and ill mannered barbarians but perganian ii the greatest emperor of the st dynasty decreed that they must be treated with the utmost courtesy when the day of their departure finally arrived the aliens exchanged farewells with perganian and one of them thrust a large flawless blue diamond into the emperors hand in payment for his hospitality after the aliens left the courtyard perganian let the diamond drop to the ground declaring that no antarean could be purchased for any price the diamond lay where it had fallen for three generations becoming a holy symbol of antarean dignity and independence it finally vanished during a dust storm and was never seen again end
