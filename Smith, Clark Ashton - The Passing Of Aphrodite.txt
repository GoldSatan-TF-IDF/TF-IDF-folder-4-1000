the passing of aphrodite by clark ashton smith in all the lands of illarion from mountainvalleys rimmed with unmelting snow to the great cliffs of sand whose reflex darkens a sleepy tepid sea were lit as of old the green and amethyst fires of summer spices were on the wind that mountaineers had met in the high glaciers and the eldest wood of cypress frowning on a skyclear bay was illumined by scarlet orchids but the heart of the poet phaniol was an urn of black jade overfraught by love with sodden ashes with unmelting snow to the great cliffs of sard whose reflex and because he wished to forget for a time the mockery of myrtles phaniol walked alone in the waste bordering upon illarion in a place that great fires had blackened long ago and which knew not the pine or the violet the cypress or the myrtle there as the day grew old he came to an unsailed ocean whose waters were dark and still under the falling sun and bore not the memorial voices of other seas and phaniol paused and lingered upon the ashen shore and dreamt awhile of that sea whose name is oblivion then from beneath the westering sun whose bleak light was prone on his forehead a barge appeared and swiftly drew to the land albeit there was no wind and the oars hung idly on the foamless wave and phaniol saw that the barge was wrought of ebony fretted with curious anaglyphs and carved with luxurious forms of gods and beasts of satyrs and goddesses and women and the figurehead was a black eros with full unsmiling mouth and implacable sapphire eyes averted as if intent upon things not lightly to be named or revealed upon the deck of the barge were two women one pale as the northern moon and the other swart as equatorial midnight but both were clad imperially and bore the mien of goddesses or of those who dwell near to the goddesses without word or gesture they regarded phaniol and marvelling he inquired what seek ye then with one voice that was like the voice of hesperian airs among palms at evening twilight in the fortunate isles they answered saying we wait the goddess aphrodite who departs in weariness and sorrow from illarion and from all the lands of this world of petty loves and pettier mortalities thou because thou art a poet and hast known the great sovereignty of love shall behold her departure but they the men of the court the marketplace and the temple shall receive no message nor sign of her goingforth and will scarcely dream that she is gone now o phaniol the time the goddess and the goingforth are at hand even as they ceased one came across the desert and her coming was a light on the far hills and where she trod the lengthening shadows shrunk and the grey waste put on the purple asphodels and the deep verdure it had worn when those queens were young that now are a darkening legend and a dust of mummia even to the shore she came and stood before phaniol while the sunset greatened filling sky and sea with a flush as of newblown blossoms or the inmost rose of that coiling shell which was consecrate to her in old time without robe or circlet or garland crowned and clad only with the sunset fair with the dreams of man but fairer yet than all dreams thus she waited smiling tranquilly who in life or death despair or rapture vision or flesh to gods and poets and galaxies unknowable but filled with a wonder that was also love or much more than love the poet could find no greeting farewell o phaniol she said and her voice was the sighing of remote waters the murmur of waters moonwithdrawn forsaking not without sorrow a proud island tall with palms thou hast known me and worshipped all thy days till now but the hour of my departure is come i go and when i am gone thou shalt worship still and shalt not know me for the destinies are thus and not forever to any man to any world or to any god is it given to possess me wholly autumn and spring will return when i am past the one with yellow leaves the other with yellow violets birds will haunt the renewing myrtles and many little loves will be thine not again to thee or to any man will return the perfect vision and the perfect flesh of the goddess ending thus she stepped from that ashen strand to the dark prow of the barge and even as it had come without wafture of wind or movement of oar the barge put out on a sea covered with the fallen fading petals of sunset quickly it vanished from view while the desert lost those ancient asphodels and the deep verdure it had worn again for a little darkness having conquered illarion came slow and furtive on the path of aphrodite shadows mustered innumerably to the grey hills and the heart of the poet phaniol was an urn of black jade overfraught by love with sodden ashes
