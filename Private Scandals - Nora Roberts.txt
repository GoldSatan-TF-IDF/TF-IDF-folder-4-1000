it was a moonless midnight in chicago but to deanna the moment had all the makings of high noon it was easy to see herself in the quietly dignified stalwart gary cooper role preparing to face down the canny vengeanceseeking gunslinger but damn it deanna thought chicago was her town angela was the outsider it suited angelas sense of the dramatic deanna supposed to demand a showdown in the very studio where they both had climbed ambitions slippery ladder but it was deannas studio now and it was her show that garnered the lions share of the ratings points there was nothing angela could do to change that short of conjuring up elvis from the grave and asking him to sing heartbreak hotel to the studio audience a ghost of a smile flitted around deannas lips at the image but there wasnt much humor in it angela was nothing if not a worthy opponent over the years she had used gruesome tactics to keep her daily talk show on top but whatever angela had up her sleeve this time wasnt going to work she had underestimated deanna reynolds angela could whisper secrets and threaten scandal all she wanted but nothing she could say would change deannas plans she would however hear angela out deanna thought she would even attempt one last time to compromise to offer if not friendship at least a cautious truce there was little hope the breach could be spanned after all this time and all the hostility but hope to deannas mind sprang eternal at least until it dried up focusing on the matter at hand deanna pulled into the cbc buildings parking lot during the day the lot would be crammed with cars technicians editors producers talent secretaries interns deanna would be dropped off and picked up by her driver avoiding the hassle inside the great white building people would be rushing to put out the news at seven am noon and five and ten pm and lets cook with bobby marks the weekly in depth with finn riley and the toprated talk show in the country deannas hour but now just after midnight the lot was nearly empty there were half a dozen cars belonging to the skeleton crew who were loitering in the newsroom waiting for something to happen somewhere in the world probably hoping any new wars would wait to erupt until the lonely night shift ended wishing she were somewhere else anywhere else deanna pulled into an empty space and shut off the engine for a moment she simply sat listening to the night the swish of cars on the street to the left the rumble of the huge air conditioning system that kept the building and the expensive equipment cool she had to get a handle on her mixed emotions and her nerves before she faced angela nerves were second nature in the profession shed chosen she would work with them or through them her temper was something she could and would control particularly if losing it would accomplish nothing but those emotions the ones that ran so strong and so contradictory were another matter even after all this time it was difficult to forget that the woman she was about to face was one she had once admired and respected and trusted from bitter experience deanna knew that angela was an expert in emotional manipulation deannas problem and many said her talent was an inability to hide her feelings they were there up front shouting to anyone who cared to listen whatever she felt was mirrored in her gray eyes broadcast in the tilt of her head or the expression of her mouth some said thats what made her irresistible and dangerous with a flick of her wrist she turned the rearview mirror toward her yes she mused she could see the sparks of temper in her own eyes and the simmering resentment the dragging regret after all she and angela had been friends once or almost friends but she could also see the pleasure of anticipation that was a matter of pride this bout had been a long time coming smiling a little deanna took out a tube of lipstick and carefully painted her mouth you didnt go oneonone with your arch rival without the most basic of shields pleased that her hand was rock steady she dropped the lipstick back in her purse climbed out of the car she stood a moment breathing in the balmy night while she asked herself one question calm deanna nope she thought what she was was revved if the energy was fueled by nerves it didnt matter slamming the car door behind her she strode across the lot she slipped her plastic id out of her pocket and punched it into the security slot beside the rear door seconds later a little green light blipped allowing her to depress the handle and pull the heavy door open she flicked the switch to light the stairway and let the door ease shut behind her she found it interesting that angela hadnt arrived before her shed have taken a car service deanna thought now that angela was settled in new york she no longer had a regular driver in chicago it surprised deanna that she hadnt seen a limo waiting in the lot angela was always always on time it was one of the many things deanna respected about her the click of deannas heels on the stairs echoed hollowly as she descended a level as she slipped her card in the next security slot she wondered briefly who angela had bribed threatened or seduced to gain entry to the studio not so many years before deanna had rushed down that same route wideeyed and enthusiastic running errands at the snap of angelas demanding fingers shed been ready to preen like an eager puppy for any sign of approval but like any smart pup shed learned and when betrayal had come with its keenedged disillusionment she might have whimpered but shed licked her wounds and had used everything shed learned until the student became the master it shouldnt have surprised her to discover how quickly old resentments long cooled could come rolling to a boil and this time deanna thought this time when she faced angela it would be on her own turf under her own rules the naive kid from kansas was more than ready to flex the muscles of realized ambition and perhaps once she did they would finally clear the air meet on equal terms if it wasnt possible to forget what had happened between them in the past it was always possible to accept and move on deanna slipped her card into the slot beside the studio doors the light blinked green she pushed inside into darkness the studio was empty that pleased her arriving first gave her one more advantage as a hostess escorting an unwelcome guest into her home and if home was where you grew from girl to woman where you learned and squabbled the studio was home smiling a little deanna reached out in the dark for the switch that controlled a bank of overhead lights she thought she heard something some whisper that barely disturbed the air and a feeling stabbed through that fine sense of anticipation a feeling that she was not alone angela she thought and flicked the switch but as the overhead lights flashed on brighter ones blinding ones exploded inside her head as the pain ripped through them she plunged back into the dark she crawled back inffconsciousness moaning her head heavy with pain lolled back against a chair groggy disoriented she lifted a hand to the worst of the ache her fingers came away lightly smeared with blood she struggled to focus baffled to find herself sitting in her own chair on her own set had she missed a cue she wondered dizzy staring back at the camera where the red light gleamed but there was no studio audience beyond the camera no technicians working busily out of range though the lights flooded down with the familiar heat there was no show in progress shed come to meet angela deanna remembered her vision wavered again like water disturbed by a pebble and she blinked to clear it it was then her gaze latched on to the two images on the monitor she saw herself pale and glazedeyed then she saw with horror the guest sitting in the chair beside hers angela her pink silk suit decorated with pearl buttons matching strands of pearls around her throat clustered at her ears angela her golden hair softly coiffed her legs crossed her hands folded together over the right arm of the chair it was angela oh yes there was no mistaking it even though her face had been destroyed blood was splattered over the pink silk and joined by more that ran almost leisurely down from where that lovely canny face should be it was then deanna began to scream chapter one chicago in five four three deanna smiled at the camera from her corner of the set of midday news our guest this afternoon is jonathan monroe a local author who has just published a book titled i want mine she lifted the slim volume from the small round table between the chairs angling it toward camera two jonathan youve subtitled this book healthy selfishness what inspired you to write about a trait most people consider a character flaw well deanna he chuckled a small man with a sunny smile who was sweating profusely under the lights i wanted mine good answer she thought but it was obvious he wasnt going to elaborate without a little prompting and who doesnt if were honest she said trying to loosen him up with a sense of comradeship jonathan you state in your book that this healthy selfishness is quashed by parents and caregivers right from the nursery exactly his frozen brilliant smile remained fixed while his eyes darted in panic deanna shifted subtly laying her hand over his rigid fingers just under camera range her eyes radiated interest her touch communicated support you believe the demand of adults that children share toys sets an unnatural precedent she gave his hand an encouraging squeeze dont you feel that sharing is a basic form of courtesy not at all and he began to tell her why though his explanations were delivered in fits and starts she was able to smooth over the awkwardness guiding him through the threeminutefifteensecond spot thats i want mine by jonathan monroe she said to the camera winding up available in your bookstores now thank you so much for joining us today jonathan it was a pleasure as a side note im currently working on my second book get out of my way i was here first its about healthy aggression best of luck with it well be back in a moment with the rest of the midday news once they were incommercial she smiled at jonathan you were great i appreciate your coming in i hope i did okay the minute his mike was removed jonathan whipped out a handkerchief to mop his brow first time on tv you did fine i think this will generate a lot of local interest in your book really absolutely would you mind signing this for me beaming again he took the book and pen she offered you sure made it easy deanna i did a radio interview this morning the dj hadnt even read the back blurb she took the autographed book rising part of her mind most of her energy was already at the news desk across the studio that makes it hard on everyone thanks again she said offering her hand i hope youll come back with your next book id love to but shed already walked away maneuvering nimbly over snaking piles of cable to take her place behind the counter on the news set after slipping the book under the counter she hooked her mike to the lapel of her red suit another screwball the comment from her coanchor roger crowell was typical he was very nice you think everyones very nice grinning roger checked his hand mirror gave his tie a minute adjustment he had a good face for the camera mature trustworthy with distinguished flecks of gray at the temples of his rustcolored hair especially the screwballs thats why i love you rog this caused snickering among the camera crew whatever response roger might have made was cut off by the floor director signaling time while the teleprompter rolled roger smiled into the camera setting the tone for a soft segment on the birth of twin tigers at the zoo thats all for midday stay tuned for lets cook this is roger crowell and deanna reynolds see you tomorrow as the closing music tinkled in her earpiece deanna turned to smile at roger youre a softy pal you wrote that piece on the baby tigers yourself it had your fingerprints all over it he flushed a little but winked just giving them what they want babe and were clear the floor director stretched his shoulders nice show people thanks jack deanna was already unhooking her mike hey want to get some lunch roger was always ready to eat and countered his love affair with food with his personal trainer there was no disguising pounds from the merciless eye of the camera cant ive got an assignment roger rose beneath his impeccable blue serge jacket he wore a pair of eye popping bermuda shorts dont tell me its for the terror of studio b the faintest flicker of annoyance clouded her eyes okay i wont hey dee roger caught up with her on the edge of the set dont get mad i didnt say i was mad you dont have to they walked down the single wide step from the glossy set to the scarred wood floor skirting around camera and cable they pushed through the studio doors together you are mad it shows you get that line between your eyebrows look he pulled her by the arm into the makeup room after flicking on the lights he stood behind her his hands on her shoulders as they faced the mirror see its still there deliberately she eased it away with a smile i dont see anything then let me tell you what i see every mans dream of the girl next door subtle wholesome sex when she scowled he only grinned thats the visual kid those big trustme eyes and peaches and cream not bad qualities for a television reporter how about intelligence she countered writing ability guts were talking visuals his smile flashed deepening the character lines around his eyes no one in television would dare refer to them as wrinkles look my last coanchor was a twinkie all blowdried hair and bonded teeth she was more worried about her eyelashes than she was punching the lead and now shes reading the news at the numbertwo station in la she knew how the business worked oh yes she did but she didnt have to like it rumors are shes being groomed for network thats the game personally i appreciate having someone at the desk with a brain but lets not forget what we are i thought we were journalists television journalists youve got a face that was made for the camera and it tells everything youre thinking everything youre feeling only problem is its the same off camera and that makes you vulnerable a woman like angela eats little farm girls like you for breakfast i didnt grow up on a farm her voice was dry as a midwest dust bowl might as well have he gave her shoulders a friendly squeeze whos your pal dee she sighed rolled her eyes you are roger watch your back with angela look i know she has a reputation for being temperamental she has a reputation for being a stone bitch stepping away from roger deanna uncapped a pot of cold cream to remove her heavy makeup she didnt like having her coworkers pitted against one another competing for her time and she didnt like feeling pressured into choosing between them it had been difficult enough juggling her responsibilities in the newsroom and on set with the favors she did for angela and they were only favors after all done primarily on her own time all i know is that shes been nothing but kind to me she liked my work on midday and the deannas corner segment and offered to help me refine my style shes using you shes teaching me deanna corrected tossing used makeup pads aside her movements were quick and practiced she hit the center of the wastebasket as consistently as a veteran freethrow shooter theres a reason angela has the toprated talk show in the market it would have taken me years to learn the ins and outs of the business ive picked up from her in a matter of months and do you really think shes going to share a piece of that pie she pouted a moment because of course she wanted a piece a nice big one healthy selfishness she thought and chuckled to herself its not as though im competing with her not yet but she would be he knew it surprised him that angela didnt detect the ambition glinting just behind deannas eyes but then he mused ego was often blinding he had reason to know just some friendly advice dont give her any ammunition he took one last study as deanna briskly redid her makeup for the street she might have been naive he mused but she was also stubborn he could see it in the way her mouth was set the angle of her chin ive got a couple of bumpers to tape he tugged on her hair see you tomorrow yeah once she was alone deanna tapped her eye pencil against the makeup table she didnt discount everything roger said because she was a perfectionist because she demanded and received the best for her show angela perkins had a reputation for being hard and it certainly paid off after six years in syndication angelas had been in the numberone spot for more than three since both angelas and midday news were taped at the cbc studios angela had been able to exert a little pressure to free up some of deannas time it was also true that angela had been nothing but kind to deanna she had shown deanna a friendship and a willingness to share that were rare in the highly competitive world of television was it naive to trust kindness deanna didnt think so nor was she foolish enough to believe that kindness was always rewarded thoughtfully she picked up the brush marked with her name and pulled it through her shoulderlength black hair without the cover of heavy theatrical makeup necessary for the lights and camera her skin was as elegantly pale as porcelain a dramatic contrast to the inky mane of hair and the smoky slightly slanted eyes to add another touch of drama shed painted her lips a deep rose satisfied she pulled her hair back in a ponytail with two quick flicks of her wrist she never planned to compete with angela although she hoped to use what she learned to boost her own career what she wanted was a network spot someday maybe a job on and it wasnt beyond the realm of possibility that she could expand the weekly deannas corner segment on the noon news into a fullfledged syndicated talk show of her own even that would hardly be competing with angela the queen of the market the nineties were wide open for all manner of styles and shows if she succeeded it would be because shed learned from the master she would always be grateful to angela for that if the son of a bitch thinks im going to roll over hes in for an unpleasant surprise angela perkins glared at the reflection of her producer in her dressing room mirror he agreed to come on the show to hype his new album tit for tat lew were giving him national exposure so hes damn well going to answer some questions about his tax evasion charges he didnt say he wouldnt answer them angela the headache behind lew mcationeils eyes was still dull enough to keep him hoping it would pass he just said he wont be able to be specific as long as the case is pending hed like it if you would concentrate on his career i wouldnt be where i am if i let a guest dictate my show would i she swore again ripely then wheeled in the chair to snarl at the hairdresser pull my hair again sweetie and youll be picking up curlers with your teeth im sorry miss perkins but your hair is really too short just get it done angela faced her own reflection again and deliberately relaxed her features she knew how important it was to relax the facial muscles before a show no matter how high the adrenaline the camera picked up every line and wrinkle like an old friend a woman meets for lunch so she breathed deeply closing her eyes a moment in a signal to her producer to hold his tongue when she opened them again they were clear a diamond bright blue surrounded by silky lashes and she smiled as the hairdresser swept her hair back and up into a wavy blond halo it was a good look for her angela decided sophisticated but not threatening chic but not studied she checked the style from every angle before giving the goahead nod it looks great marcie she flashed the highpowered smile that made the hairdresser forget the earlier threat i feel ten years younger you look wonderful miss perkins thanks to you relaxed and satisfied she toyed with the trademark pearls around her throat and hows that new man in your life marcie is he treating you well hes terrific marcie grinned as she gave angelas hair a large dose of spray to hold the style i think he might be the one good for you if he gives you any trouble you let me know she winked ill straighten him out with a laugh marcie backed away thanks miss perkins good luck this morning mmmhmmm now lew she smiled and lifted a hand for his the squeeze was encouraging feminine friendly dont worry about a thing you just keep our guest happy until airtime ill take care of the rest he wants your word angela honey you give him whatever he wants she laughed lews headache sprang into fullblown agony dont be such a worrier she leaned forward to pluck a cigarette from the pack of virginia slims on the dressing table she flicked on a gold monogrammed lighter a gift from her second husband she blew out one thin stream of smoke lew was getting soft she mused personally as well as professionally though he wore a suit and tie as dictated by her dress code his shoulders were slumped as if pulled down by the weight of his expanding belly his hair was thinning out too she realized and was heavily streaked with gray her show was known for its energy and speed she didnt enjoy having her producer look like a pudgy old man after all these years lew you should trust me angela if you attack deke barrow youre going to make it tough for us to book other celebrities bull theyre six deep waiting for a chance to do my show she jabbed her cigarette in the air like a lance they want me to hype their movies and their tv specials and their books and their records and they damn well want me to hype their love lives they need me lew because they know that every day millions of people tune in she smiled into the mirror and the face that smiled back was lovely composed polished and they tune in for me lew had worked with angela for more than five years and knew exactly how to handle a dispute he wheedled nobodys denying that angela you are the show i just think you should tread lightly with deke hes been around the countrymusic scene a long time and this comeback of his has a lot of sentiment behind him just leave deke to me she smiled behind a mist of smoke ill be very sentimental she picked up the note cards that deanna had finished organizing at seven that morning it was a gesture of dismissal that had lew shaking his head angelas smile widened as she skimmed through the notes the girl was good she mused very good very thorough very useful angela took one last contemplative drag on her cigarette before crushing it out in the heavy crystal ashtray on her dressing table as always every pot every brush every tube was aligned in meticulous order there was a vase of two dozen red roses which were brought in fresh every morning and a small dish of multicolored coated mints that angela loved she thrived on routine at being able to control her environment including the people around her everyone had their place she was enjoying making one for deanna reynolds some might have thought it odd that a woman approaching forty a vain woman would have taken on a younger lovely woman as a favored apprentice but angela had been a pretty woman who with time experience and illusion had become a beautiful one and she had no fear of age not in a world where it could be so easily combated she wanted deanna behind her because of her looks because of her talent because of her youth most of all because power scented power and for the very simple reason that she liked the girl oh she would offer deanna tidbits of advice friendly criticism dollops of praise and perhaps in time a position of some merit but she had no intention of allowing someone she already sensed as a potential competitor to break free no one broke free from angela perkins she had two exhusbands who had learned that they hadnt broken free they had been dispatched angela deanna angela flung out a hand in welcome i was just thinking about you your notes are wonderful theyll add so much to the show glad i could help deanna lifted a hand to toy with her left earring a sign of hesitation shed yet to master angela i feel awkward asking you this but my mother is a huge fan of deke barrows and youd like an autograph after a quick embarrassed smile deanna brought out the cd she was holding behind her back shed love it if he could sign this for her you just leave it to me angela tapped one perfect frenchmanicured nail along the edge of the cd and what is your mothers name again dee its marilyn i really appreciate it angela anything i can do for you sweetie she waited a beat her timing had always been excellent oh and there is a little favor you could do for me of course would you make reservations for dinner for me tonight at la fontaine seventhirty for two i simply dont have time to deal with it myself and i forgot to tell my secretary to handle it no problem deanna pulled a pad out of her pocket to make a note youre a treasure deanna angela stood then to take a final check of her pale blue suit in a cheval glass what do you think of this color its not too washedout is it because she knew that angela fretted over every detail of the show from research to the proper footwear deanna took time for a serious study the soft drape of the fabric suited angelas compact curvy figure beautifully coolly feminine the tension in angelas shoulders unknotted perfect then are you staying for the taping i cant i still have copy to write for midday oh the annoyance surfaced but only briefly i hope helping me out hasnt put you behind there are twentyfour hours in the day deanna said i like to use all of them now id better get out of your way bye honey deanna shut the door behind her everyone in the building knew that angela insisted on having the last ten minutes before she took the stage to herself everyone assumed she used that time to go over her notes that was nonsense of course she was completely prepared but she preferred that they think of her brushing up on her information or even that they imagine her taking a quick nip from the bottle of brandy she kept in her dressing table not that she would touch the brandy the need to keep it there just within reach terrified as much as it comforted she preferred they believe anything as long as they didnt know the truth angela perkins spent those last solitary moments before each taping in a trembling cycle of panic she a woman who exuded an image of supreme self confidence she a woman who had interviewed presidents royalty murderers and millionaires succumbed as she always did to a vicious violent attack of stage fright hundreds of hours of therapy had done nothing to alleviate the shuddering the sweating the nausea helpless against it she collapsed in her chair drawing herself in the mirror reflected her in triplicate the polished woman perfectly groomed immaculately presented eyes glazed with the terror of selfdiscovery angela pressed her hands to her temples and rode out the screaming roller coaster of fear today she would slip and they would hear the backwoods of arkansas in her voice they would see the girl who had been unloved and unwanted by a mother who had preferred the flickering images on the pitted screen of the tiny philco to her own flesh and blood the girl who had wanted attention so badly so desperately she had imagined herself inside that television so that her mother would focus those vague drunken eyes just once and look at her they would see the girl in the secondhand clothes and illfitting shoes who had studied so hard to make average grades they would see that she was nothing no one a fraud who had bluffed her way into television the same way her father had bluffed his way into an inside straight and they would laugh at her or worse turn her off the knock on the door made her flinch were set angela she took a deep breath then another on my way her voice was perfectly normal she was a master at pretense for a few seconds longer she stared at her reflection watching the panic fade from her own eyes she wouldnt fail she would never be laughed at she would never be ignored again and no one would see anything she didnt allow them to see she rose walked out of her dressing room down the corridor she had yet to see her guest and continued past the green room without a blink she never spoke to a guest before the tape was rolling her producer was warming up the studio audience there was a hum of excitement from those fortunate enough to have secured tickets to the taping marcie tottering in fourinch heels rushed up for a lastminute check on hair and makeup a researcher passed angela a few more cards angela spoke to neither of them when she walked onstage the hum burst open into a fullthrottle cheer good morning angela took her chair and let the applause wash over her while she was miked i hope everyones ready for a great show she scanned the audience as she spoke and was pleased with the demographics it was a good mix of age sex and race an important visual for the camera pans anyone here a deke barrow fan she laughed heartily at the next round of applause me too she said though she detested country music in any form id say were all in for a treat she nodded settled back legs crossed hands folded over the arm of her chair the red light on the camera blinked on the intro music swung jazzily through the air lost tms that greeneyed girl one wild heart those are just a few of the hits that made todays guest a legend hes been a part of country music history for more than twentyfive years and his current album lost in nashville is zooming up the charts please join me in welcoming to chicago deke barrow the applause thundered out again as deke strode out onstage barrelchested with graying temples peeking out from beneath his black felt stetson deke grinned at the audience before accepting angelas warm handshake she stood back letting him milk the moment by tipping his hat with every appearance of delight she joined in the audiences standing ovation by the end of the hour she thought deke would stagger offstage and he wouldnt even know what had hit him angela waited until the second half of the show to strike like a good host she had flattered her guest listened attentively to his anecdotes chuckled at his jokes now deke was basking in the admiration as angela held the mike for excited fans as they stood to ask questions she waited canny as a cobra deke i wondered if youre going by danville kentucky on your tour thats my hometown a blushing redhead asked well now i cant say as we are but well be in louisville on the seventeenth of june you be sure to tell your friends to come on by and see me your lost in nashville tours going to keep you on the road for several months angela began thats rough on you isnt it rougher than it used to be he answered with a wink i aint twenty anymore his broad guitarplucking hands lifted and spread but i gotta say i love it singing in a recording studio cant come close to what its like to sing for people and the tours certainly been a success so far theres no truth then to the rumor that you may have to cut it short because of your difficulties with the irs dekes congenial grin slipped several notches no maam well finish it out i feel safe in speaking for everyone here when i say you have our support in this tax evasion she rolled her eyes in disbelief they make you sound like also capone i really cant talk about it deke shuffled his booted feet tugged at his bola tie but nobodys calling it tax evasion oh she widened her eyes im sorry what are they calling it he shifted uncomfortably on his chair its a disagreement on back taxes disagreement is a mild word for it i realize you cant really discuss this while the matters under investigation but i think its an outrage a man like you whos brought pleasure to millions for two generations to be faced with potential financial ruin because his books werent in perfect order its not as bad as all that but youve had to put your home in nashville on the market her voice dripped sympathy her eyes gleamed with it i think the country youve celebrated in your music should show more compassion more gratitude dont you she hit the right button seems like the tax man doesnt have much to do with the country ive been singing about for twentyfive years dekes mouth thinned his eyes hardened like agates they look at dollar signs they dont think about how hard a mans worked how much he sweats to make something of himself they just keep slicing at you till most of whats yours is theirs they turn honest folk into liars and cheaters youre not saying you cheated on your taxes are you deke she smiled guilelessly when he froze well be back in a moment she said to the camera and waited until the red light blinked off im sure most of us here have been squeezed by the irs deke turning her back on him she held up her hands were behind him arent we audience there was an explosion of applause and cheers that did nothing to erase the look of sickly shock from dekes face i cant talk about it he managed can i get some water well put the matter to rest dont you worry well have time for a few more questions angela turned to her audience again as an assistant rushed out with a glass of water for deke im sure deke would appreciate it if we avoided any more discussion on this sensitive subject lets be sure to give him plenty of applause when we get back from commercial and give deke some time to compose himself with this outpouring of support and empathy she swung back toward the camera youre back with angelas we have time for just a couple more questions but at dekes request well close the door on any discussion of his tax situation as he isnt free to defend himself while the case is still pending and of course when she closed the show moments later that was exactly the subject on every viewers mind angela didnt linger among her audience but joined deke onstage wonderful show she took his limp hand in her firm grasp thank you so much for coming and the best of luck thank you shellshocked he began signing autographs until the assistant producer led him offstage get me a tape angela ordered as she strode back to her dressing room i want to see the last segment she walked straight to her mirror and smiled at her own reflection chapter two deanna hated covering tragedies intellectually she knew it was her job as a journalist to report the news and to interview those who had been wounded by it she believed unwaveringly in the publics right to know but emotionally whenever she pointed a microphone toward grief she felt like the worst kind of voyeur the quiet suburb of wood dale was the scene of sudden and violent tragedy this morning police suspect that a domestic dispute resulted in the shooting death of lois dossier thirtytwo an elementary school teacher and chicago native her husband dr charles dossier has been taken into custody the couples two children ages five and seven are in the care of their maternal grandparents at shortly after eight am this morning this quiet affluent home erupted with gunfire deanna steadied herself as the camera panned the trim twostory dwelling behind her she continued her report staring straight at the lens ignoring the crowd that gathered the other news teams doing their standups the sweet spring breeze that carried the poignant scent of hyacinth her voice was steady suitably detached but her eyes were filled with swirling emotion at eightfifteen am police responded to reports of gunfire and lois dossier was pronounced dead on the scene according to neighbors mrs dossier was a devoted mother who took an active interest in community projects she was well liked and well respected among her closest friends was her nextdoor neighbor bess pierson who reported the disturbance to the police deanna turned to the woman at her side who was dressed in purple sweats mrs pierson to your knowledge was there any violence in the dossier household before this morning yes no i never thought he would hurt her i still cant believe it the camera zoomed in on the swollen tear streaked face of a woman pale with shock she was my closest friend weve lived next door to each other for six years our children play together tears began to spill over despising herself deanna clutched the womans hand with her free one and continued knowing both lois and charles dossier do you agree with the police that this tragedy was a result of a domestic dispute that spiraled out of control i dont know what to think i know they were having marital problems there were fights shouting matches the woman stared into the void shellshocked lois told me she wanted to get chuck to go into counseling with her but he wouldnt she began to sob now one hand covering her eyes he wouldnt and now shes gone oh god she was like my sister cut deanna snapped then wrapped her arm around mrs piersons shoulders im sorry im so sorry you shouldnt be out here now i keep thinking this is a dream that it cant be real is there somewhere you can go a friend or a relative deanna scanned the trim yard crowded with curious neighbors and determined reporters a few feet to the left another crew was rolling tape the reporter kept blowing the takes laughing at his own twisting tongue things arent going to quiet down here for a while yes after a last sobbing breath mrs pierson wiped at her eyes we were going to the movies tonight she said then turned and dashed away god deanna watched as other reporters stabbed their microphones toward the fleeing woman your heart bleeds too much her cameraman commented shut up joe she pulled herself in drew a breath her heart might have been bleeding but she couldnt let it affect her judgment her job was to give a clear concise report to inform and to give the viewer a visual that would make an impact lets finish it we want it for midday zoom up to the bedroom window then come back to me make sure you get the hyacinths and daffodils in frame and the kids red wagon got it joe studied the scene the white sox fielders cap perched on his wiry brown hair tipped down to shade his eyes he could already see the pictures cut framed edited he squinted nodded muscles bunched under his sweatshirt as he hefted the camera ready when you are then in three two one she waited a beat while the camera zoomed in panned down lois dossiers violent death has left this quiet community rocked while her friends and family ask why dr charles dossier is being held pending bond this is deanna reynolds in wood dale reporting for cbc nice job deanna joe shut down the camera yeah dandy on her way to the van she put two rolaids in her mouth cbc used the tape again on the local portion of the evening news with an update from the precinct where dossier was being held on charges of seconddegree murder curled in a chair in her apartment deanna watched objectively as the anchor segued from the top story into a piece on a fire in a south side apartment building good piece dee sprawled on the couch was fran myers her curly red hair was lopsidedly anchored on top of her head she had a sharp foxy face accented by eyes the color of chestnuts her voice was pure new jersey brass unlike deanna she hadnt grown up in a quiet suburban home in a treelined neighborhood but in a noisy apartment in atlantic city new jersey with a twicedivorced mother and a changing array of stepsiblings she sipped ginger ale then gestured with her glass toward the screen the movement was as lazy as a yawn you always look so great on camera video makes me look like a pudgy gnome i had to try to interview the victims mother jamming her hands in the pockets of her jeans deanna sprang up to pace the room wiry energy in every step she wouldnt answer the phone and like a good reporter i tracked down the address they wouldnt answer the door either kept the curtains drawn i stayed outside with a bunch of other members of the press for nearly an hour i felt like a ghoul you ought to know by now that the terms ghoul and reporter are interchangeable but deanna didnt smile fran recognized the guilt beneath the restless movements after setting down her glass fran pointed to the chair okay sit down and listen to advice from auntie fran i cant take advice standing up nope fran snagged deannas hand and yanked her down onto the sofa despite the contrasts in backgrounds and styles theyd been friends since freshman orientation in college fran had seen deanna wage this war between intellect and emotion dozens of times okay question number one why did you go to yale because i got a scholarship dont rub your brains in my face einstein what did you and i go to college for you went to meet men fran narrowed her eyes that was just a side benefit stop stalling and answer the question defeated deanna let out a sigh we went to study to become journalists to get highpaying highprofile jobs on television absolutely correct and have we succeeded sort of we have our degrees im a reporter for cbc and youre associate producer of woman talk on cable excellent launching points now have you forgotten the famous deanna reynoldss fiveyear plan if so im sure theres a typed copy of it in that desk deanna glanced over at her pride and joy the single fine piece of furniture shed acquired since moving to chicago shed picked up the beautifully patinated queen anne desk at an auction and fran was right there was a typed copy of deannas career plan in the top drawer in duplicate since college she had modified her plans somewhat fran had married and settled in chicago and had urged her former roommate to come out and try her luck year one deanna remembered an oncamera job in kansas city done year two a position at cbc chicago accomplished year three a small tasteful segment of my own the current deannas corner fran said and toasted the segment with her ginger ale year four anchoring the evening news local which youve already done several times as substitute year five audition tapes and resumes to the holy ground new york which will never be able to resist your combination of style oncamera appeal and sincerity unless of course you continue to secondguess yourself youre right but no buts on this fran was firm she expended some of the energy she preferred to hoard by propping her feet on the coffee table you do good work dee people talk to you because you have compassion thats an advantage in a journalist not a flaw it doesnt help me sleep at night restless and suddenly tired deanna scooped a hand through her hair after curling her legs up she studied the room brooding there was the rickety dinette shed yet to find a suitable replacement for the frayed rug the single solid armchair shed had recovered in a soft gray only the desk stood out gleaming a testimony to partial success yet everything was in its place the few trinkets shed collected were arranged precisely this tidy apartment wasnt the home of her dreams but as fran had pointed out it was an excellent launching point and she fully intended to launch herself both personally and professionally do you remember back at college how exciting we thought it would be to sprint after ambulances interview mass murderers to write incisive copy that would rivet the viewers attention well it is letting out a sigh deanna rose to pace again but you really pay for the kick she paused a moment picked up a little china box set it down again angelas hinted that i could have the job as head researcher on her show for the asking onair credit with a significant raise in salary because she didnt want to influence her friend fran pursed her lips and kept her voice neutral and youre considering it every time i do i remember id be giving up the camera with a half laugh deanna shook her head id miss that little red light see heres the thing she plopped down on the arm of the couch her eyes were glowing again darkened to smoke with suppressed excitement i dont want to be angelas head researcher im not even sure i want new york anymore i think i want my own show to be syndicated in a hundred and twenty markets i want a twentypercent share i want to be on the cover of tv guide fran grinned so whats stopping you nothing more confident now that shed said it aloud deanna shifted resting her bare feet on the cushion of the sofa maybe thats year seven or eight i havent figured it out yet but i want it and i can do it but she blew out a breath it means covering tears and torment until ive earned my stripes the deanna reynoldss extended career plan exactly she was glad fran understood you dont think im crazy sweet pea i think that anyone with your meticulous mind your camera presence and your polite yet strong ambition will get exactly what she wants fran reached into the bowl of sugared almonds on the coffee table popped three in her mouth just dont forget the little people when you do what was your name again fran threw a pillow at her okay now that we have your life settled id like to announce an addition to the fran myerss my life is never what i thought it would be saga you got a promotion nope richard got one no though a junior partnership at dowell dowell and fritz may be in the offing she drew a deep breath her redheads complexion flushed like a blooming rose im pregnant what deanna blinked pregnant really laughing she slid down on the couch to grasp frans hands a baby this is wonderful this is incredible deanna threw her arms around fran to squeeze then pulled back sharply to study her friends face isnt it you bet it is we werent planning on it for another year or two but hell it takes nine months right last i heard youre happy i can see it i just cant believe she stopped jerked back again jesus fran youve been here nearly an hour and youre just getting around to telling me talk about burying the lead feeling smug fran patted her flat belly i wanted everything else out of the way so you could concentrate on me u no problem there are you sick in the mornings or anything me fran quirked a brow with my castiron stomach right what did richard say before or after he stopped dancing on the ceiling deanna laughed again then sprang up to do a quick spin of her own a baby she thought she had to plan a shower shop for stuffed animals buy savings bonds we have to celebrate what did we do in college when we had something to celebrate chinese and cheap white wine deanna said with a grin perfect with the adjustment of grade a milk fran winced then shrugged i guess ill have to get used to it i do have a favor to ask name it work on that career plan dee i think id like my kid to have a star for a godmommy when the phone rang at six am deanna pulled herself out of sleep and into a hangover clutching her head with one hand she fumbled for the receiver with the other reynolds deanna darling im so sorry to wake you angela who else would be rude enough to call you at this hour angelas light laugh came through the phone as deanna blearily looked at the clock i have an enormous favor to ask were taping today and lews down with a virus im sorry valiantly deanna cleared her throat and managed to sit up these things happen its just that were dealing with a sensitive issue today and when i considered it i realized you would really be the perfect one to handle the guests offstage thats lews area you know so im really in a bind what about simon or maureen her brain might have been cloudy but deanna remembered the chain of command neither one of them are suited for this simon does excellent preinterviews over the phone and god knows maureens a jewel at handling transportation and lodging arrangements but these guests require a very special touch your touch id be glad to help angela but im due in to the station at nine ill clear it with your producer dear he owes me simon can handle the second taping but if you could just see your way clear to helping me out this morning id be so grateful sure deanna shoved her tousled hair back and resigned herself to a quick cup of coffee and a bottle of aspirin as long as theres no conflict dont worry about that i still have clout with the news department ill need you here by eight sharp thanks honey all right but still dazed deanna stared at the phone as the dial tone hummed a couple of details had been overlooked she mused what the hell was this mornings topic and who were the guests that needed such special care deanna stepped into the green room with an uneasy smile on her face and a fresh pot of coffee in her hand she knew the topic now and scanned the seven scheduled guests cautiously like a veteran soldier surveying a mine field marital triangles deanna took a bracing breath two couples and the other women who had almost destroyed their marriages a mine field might have been safer good morning the room remained ominously silent except for the murmur of the morning news from the television im deanna reynolds welcome to angelas can i freshen anyones coffee thank you the man seated in a chair in the corner shifted the open briefcase on his lap then held out his cup he gave deanna a quick smile that was heightened by the amusement glittering out of soft brown eyes im dr pike marshall pike he lowered his voice as deanna topped off his cup dont worry theyre unarmed deannas eyes lifted to his held they still have teeth and nails she murmured she knew who he was the segment expert a psychologist who would attempt to cap this particular can of worms before the roll of ending credits midthirties she gauged with the quick expertise of a cop or a reporter confident relaxed attractive conservative judging by his carefully trimmed blond hair and welltailored chalkstriped suit his wing tips were polished to a high gleam his nails were manicured and his smile was easy ill watch your flank he offered if you watch mine she smiled back deal mr and mrs forrester deanna paused as the couple glanced toward her the womans face was set in a resentful scowl the mans in miserable embarrassment youll be on first with miss draper lori draper the last segment of the triangle beamed with excitement she looked more like a bouncy cheerleader ready to execute a flashy c jump than a sultry vamp is my outfit okay for tv over mrs forresters snort deanna assured her it was i know the basic procedure was explained to all of you in the preinterview the forresters and miss draper will go out first i dont want to sit next to her mrs forresters hiss squeezed through her tightly primmed mouth that wont be a problem i dont want jim sitting next to her either lori draper rolled her eyes jeez shelly we broke it off months ago do you think im going to jump him on national tv or what i wouldnt put anything past you shelly snatched her hand away as her husband tried to pat it were not sitting next to her she said to deanna and jims not going to talk to her either ever this statement set the match to the smoldering embers in triangle number two before deanna could open her mouth everyone was talking at once accusations and bitterness flew through the room deanna glanced toward marshall pike and was greeted with that same easy smile and a lift of one elegant shoulder all right deanna pitched her voice over the din as she stepped into the fray im sure you all have valid points and quite a bit to say why dont we save it for the show all of you agreed to come on this morning to tell your sides of the story and to look for some possible resolutions im sure we can arrange the seating to suit everyone she ran briskly through the rest of the instructions controlling the guests in the same way a kindergarten teacher controls recalcitrant fiveyearolds with determined cheerfulness and a firm hand now mrs forrester shelly jim lori if youll all come with me well get you settled and miked ten minutes later deanna stepped back into the green room grateful that no blood had been spilled while the remaining triangle sat stonily staring at the television screen marshall was up perusing a tray of pastries nicely done ms reynolds thank you dr pike marshall he chose a cinnamon danish its a tricky situation though the triangle was technically broken when the affair ended emotionally morally even intellectually it remains damn right she thought if anyone she loved cheated on her it would be he who would be broken in every way i suppose you deal with similar situations in your practice often i decided to focus on the area after my own divorce his smile was sweet and sheepish for obvious reasons he glanced down at her hands noting that she wore a single ring a garnet in an antique gold setting on her right hand youre not in the market for my particular skill not at the moment marshall pike was enormously attractive she mused the charming smile the long slender build that had even deanna who hit fiveten in her heels tilt her head up to meet the flattering interest in the deep brown eyes but at this moment she needed to focus the lions share of her attention on the sullen group behind him the program will start right after this commercial deanna gestured toward the set marshall you wont be going on until the final twenty minutes but it would help if youd watch the show to formulate specific advice naturally he enjoyed watching her the way she revved in neutral he could almost hear the engine gun of her energy dont worry ive done angelas three times ah a vet is there anything i can get you his eyes slid toward the trio behind him then came back to deannas a flak jacket she chuckled gave his arm a squeeze hed be just fine she decided ill see what i can do the show proved to be emotional and though bitter accusations flew no one was seriously wounded off camera deanna admired the way angela kept a light hand on the reins allowing her guests to go their own way then easing them back when tempers threatened to boil over she pulled the audience in as well with an unerring instinct she offered the mike to just the right person at just the right time then segued smoothly back to a question or comment of her own as for dr pike deanna mused they couldnt have chosen a more skilled mediator he exuded the perfect combination of intellect and compassion mixed with the concise teaspoonsize advice so necessary for the medium when the show was over the forresters were clutching hands the other couple had stopped speaking to each other and the two other women were chatting like old friends angela had hit the mark again decide to join us deanna roger pinched her arm as he swung up beside her i know you guys cant get through the day without me deanna wove her way through the noisy newsroom toward her desk phones were ringing keyboards clattering on one wall current shows from cbc and the other three networks were flashing on monitors from the smell of things someone had recently spilled coffee whats our lead she asked roger last nights fire on the south side with a nod deanna sat at her desk unlike most of the other reporters she kept hers meticulously neat sharpened pencils stood points down in a flowered ceramic cup a notepad aligned beside them her filofax was opened to todays date arson thats the general consensus ive got the copy weve got a taped interview with the fire marshal and a live remote at the scene roger offered her his bag of licorice and being a nice guy i picked up your mail so i see thanks caught a few minutes of angelas this morning he chewed thoughtfully on his candy doesnt discussing adultery so early in the day make people nervous it gives them something to talk about over lunch she picked up an ebony letter opener and slit the first envelope venting on national television she lifted a brow venting on national television seemed to have helped the forresters relationship looked to me like the other couple was heading for divorce court sometimes divorce is the answer is that what you think he kept the question light if your spouse was cheating would you forgive and forget or would you file papers well id listen id discuss it try to find out the reason it happened then id shoot the adulterous swine full of holes she grinned at him but thats just me and see hasnt it given us something to talk about she glanced down at the single sheet in her hand hey look at this she angled the sheet so they could both see it in the center of the paper typed in dark red ink was a single sentence deanna i love you the old secret admirer hmm roger spoke carelessly but there was a frown in his eyes looks that way curious she turned the envelope over no return address no stamp either i just pulled the mail out of your box roger shook his head somebody must have slipped it in its kind of sweet i guess she rubbed a quick chill from her arms and laughed and creepy you might want to ask around see if anybody noticed somebody sneaking around your mail slot its not important she tossed both letter and envelope in the trash and picked up the next excuse me oh dr pike deanna set down her mail and smiled at the man standing behind roger did you get lost on your way out no actually i was told id find you here dr marshall pike roger crowell yes i recognized you marshall offered a hand i watch you both often i just caught part of your act myself roger slipped his bag of candy into his pocket his thoughts were still focused on the letter and he promised himself hed slip it back out of her trash at the first possible moment we need copy on the dog show dee no problem nice to have met you dr pike same here marshall turned back to deanna when roger walked away i wanted to thank you for keeping things sane this morning its one of the things i do best id have to agree ive always thought you report the news with clearheaded compassion its a remarkable combination and a remarkable compliment thanks he took a survey of the newsroom two reporters were arguing bitterly over baseball phones were shrilling an intern wheeled a cart heaped with files through the narrow spaces between desks interesting place it is that id be glad to give you a tour but i do have copy to write for midday then ill take a rain check he looked back at her that sweet easy smile at the corners of his mouth deanna i was hoping since weve been through the trenches together so to speak youd be willing to have dinner with me dinner she studied him more carefully now as a woman does when a man stops being simply a man and becomes a possible relationship it would have been foolish to pretend he didnt appeal to her yes i suppose id be willing to do that tonight say seventhirty she hesitated she was rarely impulsive he was a professional she mused well mannered easy on the eyes and more important he had exhibited both intelligence and heart under pressure sure she took a square of notepaper from a smokedglass holder and wrote down her address chapter three coming up on midday the story of a woman who opens her home and heart to chicagos underprivileged children also the latest sports report with les ryder and the forecast for the weekend with dan block join us at noon the minute the red light blinked out deanna unhooked her mike and scrambled up from the news desk she had copy to finish and a phone interview scheduled and she needed to review her notes for the upcoming deannas corner in the two weeks since she had pinchhit for lew shed put in more than a hundred hours on the job without breaking stride she whipped through the studio doors and was halfway down the hall toward the newsroom when angela stopped her honey you only have two speeds stop and go deanna paused only because angela blocked the way right now its go im swamped ive never known you not to get everything done and at exactly the proper time to keep her in place angela laid a hand on her arm and this will only take a minute deanna struggled with impatience you can have two if we talk on the move fine angela turned and matched her stride to deannas ive got a business lunch in an hour so im a little strapped myself i need a tiny favor all right with her mind already on her work deanna swung into the newsroom and headed for her desk her papers were stacked according to priority the precise notes to be transcribed and expanded into copy the list of questions for the phoner and her cards for deannas corner she turned on her machine and typed her password while she waited for angela to explain angela took her time she hadnt been in the newsroom for months she mused possibly longer since her offices and studio were in what cbc employees called the tower a slim white spear that shot up from the building it was a notsosubtle way to separate the national and nonnews programs from the local ones im giving a little party tomorrow night finn rileys due back from london this evening and i thought id give a little welcomehome thing for him mmmhmm deanna was already working on her lead hes been gone so long this time and after that nasty business in panama before he went back to his london post i thought he deserved some r and r deanna wasnt sure a small bloody war should be called that nasty business but she nodded since its all so impulsive i really need some help putting everything together the caterers the flowers the music and of course the party itself making sure everything runs smoothly my secretary just cant handle it all and i really want it to be perfect if you could give me a couple of hours later today and tomorrow of course deanna battled back the sense of resentment and obligation angela id love to help you out but im booked angelas persuasive smile never altered but her eyes chilled youre not scheduled for saturday no not here though i am on call but i have plans deanna began to tap a finger on her notes a date i see angelas hand went to her pearls where her fingers rubbed one smooth glowing sphere rumor has it that youve been seeing a lot of dr marshall pike the evening news might run on facts and verified information but deanna understood that newsrooms and television studios ran on gossip weve been out a few times in the last couple of weeks well i wouldnt want to interfere and i hope you wont take this the wrong way dee to add intimacy to the statement angela rested a hip on deannas desk do you really think hes your type torn between manners and her own schedule deanna chose manners i dont really have one a type i mean of course you do with a light laugh angela tilted her head young well built the outdoorsy type athletic she continued you need someone who can keep up with the vicious pace you set for yourself and a good intellect naturally but not overly cerebral you need someone who can make his point in quick fifteensecond bites she really didnt have time for any of this deanna picked up one of her sharpened pencils and ran it through her fingers that makes me sound sort of shallow not at all angelas eyes widened in protest even as she chuckled darling i only want the very best for you id hate to see a passing interest interfere with the momentum of your career and as for marshall hes a bit slick isnt he temper glinted in deannas eyes and was quickly suppressed i dont know what you mean i enjoy his company of course you do angela patted deannas shoulder what young woman wouldnt an older man experienced smooth but to let him interfere with your work hes not interfering with anything weve gone out a few times in the last couple of weeks thats all im sorry angela but i really have to get back on schedule here sorry she said coolly i thought we were friends i didnt think a little constructive advice would offend you it hasnt deanna fought back a sigh but im on deadline listen if i can squeeze out some time later today ill do what i can to help you with the party as if a switch had been thrown the icy stare melted into the warmest of smiles youre a jewel tell you what just to prove theres no hard feelings you bring marshall tomorrow night angela now i wont take no for an answer she slid off the desk and if you could get there just an hour or two early id be so grateful no one organizes like you dee well talk about all of this later deanna leaned back in her chair when angela strolled away she felt as though shed been steamrolled with velvet with a shake of her head she looked down at her notes her fingers poised over her keyboard frowning she relaxed them again angela was wrong she thought marshall wasnt interfering with her work being interested in someone didnt have to clash with ambition she enjoyed going out with him she liked his mind the way he could open it to see both sides of a situation and the way he laughed when she dug in on an opinion and refused to budge she appreciated the fact that he was letting the physical end of their relationship develop slowly at her pace though she had to admit it was becoming tempting to speed things up it had been a long time since shed felt safe enough and strong enough with a man to invite intimacy once she did deanna thought she would have to tell him everything she shook the memory away quickly before it could dig its claws into her heart she knew from experience it was best to cross one bridge at a time then to prepare to span the next the first bridge was to analyze her relationship with marshall if there was a relationship and to decide where she wanted it to go a glance at the clock made her moan she would have to cross that personal bridge on her own time setting her fingers on the keyboard she got to work angelas staff privately called her suite of offices the citadel she reigned like a feudal lord from her french provincial desk handing out commands and meting out reward and punishment in equal measures anyone who remained on staff after a sixmonth probationary period was loyal and diligent and kept his or her complaints private she was admittedly exacting impatient with excuses and demanding of certain personal luxuries she had after all earned such requirements angela stepped into the outer office where her executive secretary was busily handling details for mondays taping there were other offices producers researchers assistants down the quiet hallway angela had long since left the boisterous bustle of newsrooms behind she had used reporting not merely as a steppingstone but as a catapult for her ambitions there was only one thing she wanted and she had wanted it for as long as she could remember to be the center of attention in news the story was king the bearer of the tale would be noticed certainly if she was good enough angela had been very good six years in the pressure cooker of onair reporting had cost her one husband netted her a second and paved the way for angelas she much preferred and insisted on the churchlike silence of thick carpets and insulated walls you have some messages miss perkins later angela yanked open one of the double doors leading to her private office i need you inside cassie she began to pace immediately even when she heard the quiet click of the door closing behind her secretary she continued to move restlessly over the aubusson past the elegant desk away from the wide ribbon of windows toward the antique curio cabinet that held her collection of awards mine she thought she had earned them she possessed them now that she did no one would ever ignore her again she paused by the framed photos and prints that adorned a wall pictures of angela with celebrities at charity events and award ceremonies her covers of tv guide and time and p she stared at them drawing deep breaths does she realize who i am she murmured does she realize who shes dealing with with a shake of her head she turned away again it was a small mistake she reminded herself one that could be easily corrected after all she was fond of the girl as she grew calmer she circled her desk settled into the custommade pink leather chair the ceo of her syndicate her former husband had given her when her show hit number one in the ratings cassie remained standing she knew better than to approach one of the mahogany chairs with their fussy needlepoint cushions until invited you contacted the caterer yes miss perkins the menus on your desk angela glanced at it nodded absently the florist they confirmed everything but the calla lilies cassie told her theyre trying to find the supply you want but suggested several substitutes if id wanted a substitute id have asked for one she waved her hand its not your fault cassie sit down angela closed her eyes she was getting one of her headaches one of those piledriving thumpers that came on in a rush of pain gently she massaged the center of her forehead with two fingers her mother had gotten headaches she remembered and had doused them with liquor get me some water will you ive got a migraine brewing cassie got up from the chair shed just taken and walked across the room to the gleaming bar she was a quiet woman in looks in speech and was ambitious enough to ignore angelas faults in her desire for advancement saying nothing she chose the crystal decanter that was filled with fresh spring water daily and poured a tumblerful thanks angela downed a percodan with water and prayed for it to kick in she couldnt afford to be distracted during her luncheon meeting do you have a list of acceptances for the party on your desk fine angela kept her eyes closed give a copy of it and everything else to deanna shell be taking care of the details from here yes maam aware of her duties cassie walked behind angelas chair and gently massaged her temples minutes clicked by counted off by the quiet tick of the long case clock across the room musically it announced the quarter hour you checked on the weather forecast angela murmured its projected to be clear and cool a low in the midforties then well need to use the heaters on the terrace i want dancing dutifully cassie stepped away to note the instructions down there was no word of thanks for her attentiveness none required your hairdresser is scheduled to arrive at your home at two your dress will be delivered by three at the latest all right then lets put all that aside for the moment i want you to contact beeker i want to know everything there is to know about dr marshall pike hes a psychologist with a private practice here in chicago i want the information as beeker collects it rather than waiting for a full report she opened her eyes again the headache wasnt in full retreat but the pill was beating it back tell beeker it isnt an emergency but it is a priority understood yes miss perkins by six that evening deanna was still going full steam ahead while she juggled three calls she beefed up copy that would be read on the late news yes i understand your position but an interview particularly a televised interview would help show your side deanna pursed her lips sighed if you feel that way of course i believe your neighbor is more than willing to tell me her story on the air she smiled when the receiver squawked in indignation yes wed prefer to have both sides represented thank you mrs wilson ill be there at ten tomorrow she spotted marshall coming toward her and lifted a hand in a wave as she punched down the next blinking light on her phone sorry mrs carter yes as i was saying i understand your position it is a shame about your tulips a televised interview would help show your side of the dispute deanna smiled as marshall stroked a hand down her hair in greeting if youre sure mrs wilson has agreed to tell me her story on the air tipping the receiver a safe inch from her ear deanna rolled her eyes at marshall yes that would be fine ill be there at ten bye hot breaking story hot tempers in suburbia deanna corrected as she disconnected i have to put in an hour or two tomorrow after all a couple of neighbors are engaged in a pitched battle over a bed of tulips an old incorrect survey and a cocker spaniel sounds fascinating ill give you the scoop over dinner she didnt object when he lowered his head and met his lips willingly the kiss was friendly without the pressure of intimacy youre all wet she murmured tasting rain and cool skin its pouring out there all i need is a nice warm restaurant and a dry wine ive got one more call waiting take your time want anything i could use a cold drink my vocal cords are raw deanna cleared her mental decks and punched in the next button mr van damme im terribly sorry for the interruption there seems to be a mixup with miss perkinss wine order for tomorrow night shell need three cases of taittingers not two yes thats right and the white wine deanna checked off her list as the caterer recited from his yes thats right and can i ease her mind about the ice sculpture she sent marshall another smile when he returned with a cold can of up thats wonderful mr van damme and you do have the change from tarts to petits fours terrific i think weve got it under control ill see you tomorrow then bye with a long exhale deanna dropped the phone on its hook done she told marshall i hope long day for you long and productive automatically she began to tidy her desk i appreciate your meeting me here marshall my schedule was lighter than yours mmm she took a deep drink then set the can aside before shutting down her workstation and i owe you one for changing plans for tomorrow to accommodate angela a good psychologist should be flexible he watched her as she straightened papers and organized notes besides it sounds like a hell of a party its turning out that way shes not a woman to do anything halfway and you admire that absolutely give me five minutes to freshen up then i promise to focus all my energy on relaxing with you over dinner when she stood he shifted so that his body just brushed hers it was a subtle move a subtle suggestion you look very fresh to me she felt the trickle of excitement run down her spine the warmth of awareness bloom in her stomach tilting her head to meet his eyes she saw the desire the need and the patience a combination that sent her pulse skipping she had only to say yes she knew and they would forget all about dinner and all about relaxing and for one moment one very long very quiet moment she wished it could be that simple i wont be long she murmured ill wait he would she thought when he moved aside to let her by and she would have to make up her mind soon whether she wanted to continue along the comfortable companionable road of this relationship or shift gears having your head shrunk dee she spotted the cameraman by the door biting into a milky way thats so lame joe i know he grinned around the chocolate there was a button that said available pinned to his tattered denim vest he had holes in the knees of his jeans techs didnt have to worry about appearance that was just the way joe liked it but somebodys got to say it did you set up those two interviews for the morning the tulip wars yeah sure you dont mind giving up your saturday morning not for overtime pay good delaneys still at the desk isnt he im waiting for him joe bit off more candy weve got a poker game tonight im going to hose him for the double shift he stuck me with last week do me a favor then and tell him were set both women ten oclock will do thanks deanna hurried away to do quick repairs on her hair and makeup she was applying fresh lipstick when joe burst into the ladies room the door slammed back against the wall echoing as he lunged at her jesus joe are you nuts get your butt in gear dee weve got an assignment and weve got to move fast he grabbed her purse from the sink with one hand and her arm with the other what for gods sake she tripped over the threshold as he hauled her out the door did somebody start a war almost as hot weve got to get out to ohare ohare damn it marshalls waiting fighting impatience joe let deanna tug her arm free if he had any complaints about her it was that her vision wasnt quite narrow enough she always saw the peripheral when the camera needed a tight shot go tell the boyfriend youve got to go be a reporter delaney just got word theres a plane coming in and its in trouble big time oh god she made the dash back into the newsroom with joe on her heels bursting through the pandemonium she snatched a fresh notebook from her desk marshall im sorry i have to go ive already gathered that do you want me to wait no she dragged a hand through her hair grabbed her jacket i dont know how long ill be ill call you delaney she called out the stout assignment editor waved the stub of his unlit cigar in her direction take off reynolds keep in touch on the twoway well be patching you in live get me a goddamn scoop sorry she called to marshall wheres the plane coming in from she shouted to joe as they raced up the stairs his motorcycle boots clattered on the metal like gunfire london theyll be feeding us the rest of the information as we go he shoved open the outside door and then plunged out into a torrent of rain his chicago bulls sweatshirt was immediately plastered to his chest he shouted over the storm while he unlocked the van its a more than two hundred passengers left engine failure some problem with the radar might have taken a hit of lightning to punctuate his words a spear of lightning cracked the black sky shattering the dark already drenched deanna climbed into the van whats the eta out of habit she switched on the police scanner under the dash dont know lets just hope we get there before they do hed hate to miss getting a shot of the crash he gunned the engine glanced at her the gleam in his eyes promised a wild ride heres the kicker dee finn rileys on board the crazy son of a bitch called in the story himself chapter four sitting in the forward cabin of the beleaguered was like riding in the belly of a dyspeptic bronco the plane bucked kicked shuddered and shook as if it were struggling mightily to disgorge its complement of passengers some of the people on board were praying some were weeping still others had their faces buried in airsickness bags too weak to do anything but moan finn riley didnt give much thought to prayer in his own way he was religious he could if the need arose in him recite the act of contrition just as he had through all those shadowy sessions in the confessional as a child at the moment atonement wasnt on the top of his list time was running out on his battery pack on his laptop computer hed have to switch to his tape recorder soon finn much preferred writing copy as the words flowed from his mind to his fingers he glanced out the window the black sky exploded again and again with spears of lightning like lances of the gods nope he decided deleting the phrase too corny a battleground nature against mans technology the sounds were definitely warlike he mused the prayers the weeping the groans the occasionally hysterical laugh hed heard them in trenches before and the echoing boom of thunder that shook the plane like a toy he used the last moments of his dying battery playing that angle once hed shut down he secured the disk and the computer in his heavy metal case hed have to hope for the best there finn mused as he slipped his minirecorder from his briefcase hed seen the aftermath of plane crashes often enough to know what survived was pure luck its may fifth sevenohtwo central time finn recited into the recorder were aboard flight approaching ohare though its impossible to see any lights through the storm lightning struck the port engine about twenty minutes ago and from what i could squeeze out of the firstclass flight attendant theres some problem with the radar possibly stormrelated there are two hundred and fiftytwo passengers on board and twelve crew youre crazy the man sitting next to finn finally lifted his head from between his knees his face under its sheen of sweat was pale green his upperclass british voice was slurred more than a little with a combination of scotch and terror we could be dead in a few minutes and youre talking into some bloody machine we could be alive in a few minutes too either way its news sympathetic finn dragged a handkerchief out of the back pocket of his jeans here thanks mumbling the man dabbed at his face as the plane shuddered again he laid his head weakly against the seat and closed his eyes you must have ice water for blood finn only smiled his blood wasnt icy it was hot pumping hot but there was no use in trying to explain that to a layman it wasnt that he wasnt afraid or that he was particularly fatalistic but he did have the reporters unique sense of tunnel vision he had his recorder his notebook his laptop these were shields that gave the illusion of indestructibility why else did a cameraman continue to roll tape when bullets were flying why did a reporter jab a mike into the face of a psychopath or run in instead of out of a building during a bomb threat because he was blinded by the shields of the fourth estate or maybe finn mused with a grin they were just crazy hey he shifted in his seat and aimed the recorder want to be my last interview his companion opened redrimmed eyes what he saw was a man only a few years younger than himself with clear pale skin shadowed by a hint of a beard shades darker than the tousled mane of wavy bronze hair that swept the collar of a leather bombers jacket sharp angular features were softened by a mouth spread in an engaging grin that featured a crooked eyetooth the grin brought out dimples that should have softened the face yet only made it tougher like dents in rock but it was the eyes that held the onlookers attention just now they were a deep misty blue like a lake dappled in fog and they were filled with amusement selfdeprecation and recklessness the man heard a sound bubble in his own throat and was stunned to realize it was a laugh fuck you he said grinning back even if we buy it on this run i dont think theyll air that network standards is this your first trip to the states jesus you are crazy but some of his fear was ebbing no i make the trip about twice a year whats the first thing you want to do if we land in one piece call my wife we had a row before i left silly business he mopped his clammy face again i want to talk to my wife and kids the plane lost altitude the pa crackled under the sounds of screams and sobs ladies and gentlemen please remain in your seats with your seat belts fastened we will be landing momentarily for your own safety please put your head between your knees grasp your ankles firmly once we land well begin emergency evacuation procedures or theyll scrape us up with shovels finn mused the vision of the wreck of pan am flight spread over scotland played uneasily in his mind he remembered too well what hed seen what hed smelled what hed felt when hed broadcast that report he wondered fatalistically who would stand in front of twisted smoking metal and tell the world about the fate of flight whats your wifes name finn asked as he leaned forward anna kids brad and susan oh god oh god i dont want to die think about anna and brad and susan finn told him pull them right into your head itll help cooleyed he studied the celtic cross that had worked its way out from under his sweater to dangle on its chain he had people to think about as well he closed his hand over the cross held it warm in his hand its sevenohnine central time the pilots taking us in can you see it yet joe can you see it cant see a goddamn thing through this goddamn rain he squinted hefting his camera rain ran off the bill of his fielders cap and waterfalled in front of his face cant believe theres no other crews here yet its just like finn to call the sonofabitching story in so wed get an exclusive theyll have heard about it by now straining to see through the gloom deanna shoved sopping hair from her eyes in the lights of the runway the rain looked like a hail of silver bullets we wont be alone out here for long i hope were right about them using this runway were right wait did you hear that i dont think that was thunder no it sounded like there she stabbed a finger toward the sky look thats got to be it the lights were barely visible through the slashing rain faintly she heard the mutter of an engine then the answering wail of emergency vehicles her stomach flipped over benny are you copying this she lifted her voice over the storm satisfied when she heard her producers voice come through her earpiece its coming down now yes she nodded to joe were set were going live she told joe and stood with her back to the runway go from me then follow the plane in keep on the plane theyve got us she murmured listening to the madhouse of the control room through her earpiece in five joe she listened to the leadin from the anchor and her cue weve just spotted the lights from flight as you can see the storm has become very violent rain is washing over the runways in sheets airport officials have refused to comment on the exact nature of the problem with flight but emergency vehicles are standing ready what can you see deanna this from the anchor desk back in the studio the lights and we can hear the engine as the plane descends she turned as joe angled the camera skyward there in the lightning flash the plane was visible a bright silver missile hurtling groundward there are two hundred and sixtyfour passengers and crew aboard flight she shouted over the scream of storm engines and sirens including finn riley cbcs foreign correspondent returning to chicago from his post in london please god she murmured then fell silent letting the pictures tell the story as the plane came into clear view it was laboring she imagined herself inside as the pilot fought to keep the nose up and level the sound must have been deafening almost she whispered forgetting the camera the mike the viewers as she kept her gaze riveted on the plane she saw the landing gear then the bright red white and blue logo of the airline slashed on the side of the plane there was only static in her earpiece i cant hear you martin stand by she held her breath as the wheels hit skidded bounced off the tarmac held it still as the plane slid and swayed chased down the runway by the flashing lights of emergency vehicles its skidding she called out theres smoke i can see what looks like smoke under the left wing i can hear the brakes screaming and its slowing its definitely slowing but theres a problem with control the wing dipped skimming the tarmac and shooting up a shower of sparks deanna watched them sizzle and die in the wet as the plane swerved then with a shuddering bump it stopped diagonally across the runway its down flight is on the ground deanna is it possible for you to assess the damage not from here just the smoke i spotted at the left wing which corroborates our unofficial reports of leftengine failure emergency crews are soaking down the area with foam ambulances are standing by the doors opening martin the chutes coming out i can see yes the first passengers being evacuated get closer the producer ordered were cutting back to martin to give you time to get closer well move closer to the scene and bring you more on flight which has just landed at ohare this is deanna reynolds for cbc youre clear her producer shouted g goddamn excitement pitched joes voice up an octave what pictures what pictures its fucking emmy time she shot him a look but was too used to the cameramans style to comment come on joe lets see if we can get some interviews they dashed toward the runway as more passengers slid down the emergency chute into the arms of waiting rescue workers by the time they reached the huddle of vehicles and reset for broadcast there were half a dozen people safely out one woman sat on the ground weeping into her folded arms with the singlemindedness of a newsman joe rolled tape benny were at the scene are you getting this absolutely its good film well be putting you back live get me one of the passengers get me riley joe shouted hey finn riley deanna glanced back toward the chute in time to see finn make his slide to earth on hearing his name called he turned his head eyes narrowed against the driving rain he focused on the camera and grinned he landed easily despite the metal case he clutched rain dripped from his hair skimmed down his leather jacket and soaked his boots in an easy lope he covered the ground from chute to camera you lucky son of a bitch joe beamed and punched finn on the shoulder good to see you joe excuse me a minute without warning he grabbed deanna and planted a hard kiss on her mouth she had time to feel the heat radiating from his body to register the shock of electricity from his mouth to hers a quick burst of power before he released her hope you dont mind he gave her a charming smile i thought about kissing the ground but you look a hell of a lot better can i borrow these a minute he was already tugging her earpiece free hey whos producing benny and i benny he snagged her mike yeah its me so you got my call he chuckled my pleasure anything i can do for the news department he listened a moment nodded no problem were going live in ten he told joe keep an eye on that for me he asked deanna and set his case down at her feet he dragged the hair out of his face and looked into the camera this is finn riley reporting live from ohare at six thirtytwo this evening flight from london was struck by lightning deanna wondered why the rain running off her clothes didnt sizzle as she watched finn make his report her report she corrected two minutes after hitting the ground and the sneaky bastard had usurped her stolen her piece and delegated her to gofer so he was good deanna fumed as she watched him leading the viewers on the odyssey of flight from london that was no surprise shed seen his reports before from london yes and from haiti central america the middle east shed even introd a few of them but that wasnt the point the point was that hed snatched her piece away from her well deanna decided he might have upstaged her but he was going to discover that stealing her newspiece wasnt a snap interviews were her strong point she reminded herself that was her job she told herself struggling to cool off and thats what she would do brilliantly turning her back on finn she hunched her shoulders against the downpour and went to look for passengers moments later there was a tap on her back she turned lifted a brow did you need something brandy and a roaring fire finn wiped rain from his face he was in gear fueled by the chaos and the immediacy of the report and the simple fact that he wasnt a dead man meantime i figured wed round out the piece with some interviews some passengers a few of the emergency crew some of the flight crew if were lucky we should be able to get it in for a special report before the late news ive already lined up a couple of passengers who are willing to talk to me on air good take joe and do it while i see if i can finagle an interview with the pilot she snagged his arm before he could pivot away i need my mike oh sure he handed it over then offered the earpiece she looked like a wet dog he mused not a mongrel no indeed one of those classy afghan hounds that manage to maintain dignity and style under the worst of circumstances his pleasure at being alive went up another notch it was a pure delight to watch her glaring at him i know you dont i arent you on the sunrise news not for the past several months im on midday congratulations he focused on her more intently the misty blue of his eyes turning sharp and clear diana no deanna right you have a good memory i dont believe weve spoken before no but ive caught your work pretty good but he was already looking beyond her there were some kids on the flight if you cant get them on mike at least get them on camera the competitions here now he gestured to where other newsmen were milling among the passengers lets work fast i know my job she said but he was already moving away he doesnt seem to have a problem with selfesteem beside her joe snorted hes got an ego the size of the sears tower and it isnt fragile the thing is when you do a piece with him you know hes going to do it right and he doesnt treat his crew like mentally deficient slaves too bad he doesnt treat other reporters with the same courtesy she spun on her heel lets get pictures it was after nine when they returned to cbc where finn was greeted with a heros welcome someone handed him a bottle of jameson seal intact shivering deanna headed straight for her desk turned on her machine and started writing copy this she knew would go national it was a chance she didnt intend to miss she tuned out the shouting and laughing and backslapping and wrote furiously referring now and then to the sketchy notes shed scribbled in the back of the van here she looked down and saw a hand widepalmed longfingered scarred at the base of the thumb set down a glass on her desk the glass held about an inch of deep amber liquid i dont drink on the job she hoped she sounded cool not prim i dont think a swallow of whiskeys going to impair your judgment and he said drifting easily into a rich pat obrien brogue itll put some heat in your belly you dont plan on operating heavy machinery do you finn skirted her chair and sat on the edge of her desk youre cold he handed her a towel knock it back dry your hair weve got work to do thats what im doing but she took the towel and after a moments hesitation the whiskey it might have been only a swallow but he was right it put a nice cozy fire in her stomach weve got thirty minutes for copy bennys already editing the tape finn craned his head around to scan her screen thats good stuff he commented itll be better if youd get out of my way he was used to hostility but he liked to know its source youre ticked because i kissed you no offense deanna but it wasnt personal it was more like primal instinct im not ticked because you kissed me she spoke between her teeth and began to type again im ticked because you stole my story hooking his hands around his knee finn thought about it and decided she had a small if not particularly salient point let me ask you a question which makes better film you doing a standup or me giving a playbyplay of the flight minutes after evacuation she spared him one heated glance and said nothing okay while youre thinking it over well print out my copy and see how it reads with yours she stopped what do you mean your copy i wrote it on the plane got a quick interview with my seatmate too the reckless amusement was back in his eyes should be good for human interest despite her annoyance she nearly laughed you wrote copy while your plane was going down those portable computers will work anywhere youve got about five minutes before benny comes along and starts tearing his hair out deanna stared after him when finn walked off to commandeer a desk the man was obviously a lunatic and a damned talented one she decided thirty minutes later the edited tape was completed the graphics set less than three minutes before airtime the copy reworked rewritten and timed was plugged into the teleprompter and finn riley still in his sweater and jeans was seated behind the anchor desk going national with his report good evening this is a special report on flight im finn riley deanna knew he was reading the news since she had written the first thirty seconds herself yet it felt as though he were telling a story he knew exactly which word to punch when to pause he knew exactly how to go through the camera and into the home it wasnt an intimacy she mused worrying her earring he wasnt settling in for a cozy chat he was bringing tidings she decided carrying the message and somehow staying aloof from it neat trick she thought since he had been on the very plane he was describing even when he read his own words words he had written while plunging through the sky in a crippled plane with its port engine smoking he was removed the storyteller not the story admiration snuck past her defenses she turned to the monitor when they switched to film and saw herself hair dripping eyes huge face pale as the water that rained over her her voice was steady yes she had that deanna thought but she wasnt detached the fear and terror were there transmitted as clearly as her words and when the camera shifted to capture the plane skidding on the runway she heard her own whispered prayer too involved she realized and sighed it was worse when she saw finn on the monitor taking over the story minutes after escaping the damaged plane he had the look of a warrior fresh from battle a veteran warrior who could discuss each blow and thrust concisely emotionlessly and he had been right it made better film at commercial deanna went up into the control booth to watch benny was grinning like a fool even as sweat popped onto his wide furrowed brow he was fat and permanently redfaced and made a habit of tugging on tufts of his lank brown hair but he was deanna knew a hell of a producer we beat every other station in town he was telling finn through the earpiece none of them have any tape of the landing or the initial stages of evacuation he blew deanna a kiss this is great stuff youre back in ten finn well be going to the tape of passenger interviews and cue through the last three and a half minutes benny continued to murmur to himself pulling at his hair maybe we should have put him in a jacket he said at one point maybe we should have found him a jacket no there was no use being resentful deanna put a hand on bennys shoulder he looks great and in those last moments in the air some like harry lyle thought of family others like marcia dewitt and kenneth morgenstern thought of dreams unfulfilled for them and all the others aboard flight the long night ended at sevensixteen when the plane landed safely on runway three this is finn riley for cbc good night up graphics music and were clear a cheer erupted in the control booth benny leaned back in his swivel chair and lifted his arms in triumph phones started to shrill benny its barlow james on two a hush fell over control and benny stared at the receiver as though it were a snake barlow james the president of the news division rarely phoned every eye was on benny as he swallowed and took the phone mr james benny listened a moment his ruddy face going ghostly then flushing hot candy pink thank you sir opening his mouth wide benny flashed a thumbs up and set the cheering off again yes sir finns one in a million were glad to have him back deanna reynolds he swiveled in his chair and rolled his eyes at deanna yes sir mr james were proud to have her on our team thank you very much ill let them know benny replaced the receiver stood and did a fast boogie that sent his belly swaying over his belt he loved it benny sang he loved it all they want the whole eight minutes for the affiliates he loved you benny grabbed deannas hands and spun her around he liked your fresh intimate style thats a quote and the fact that you looked good soaking wet with a choked laugh deanna stepped back and rammed straight into finn two pretty good qualities in a reporter finn decided he caught a whiff of her hair as he steadied her rain and apple blossoms nice job guys he released deanna to shake hands with the control crew really terrific mr james said welcome back finn benny said as he relaxed again the pudge of his belly sagged comfortably at his belt and hes looking forward to beating your butt at tennis next week in his dreams out of the corner of his eye he saw deanna descending the stairs thanks again he caught up with her in the newsroom just as she was shrugging into her coat it was a good piece he said yes it was reading copy isnt one of my priorities but reading yours was a pleasure its certainly a night for compliments she swung her purse over her arm thanks and welcome back to chicago need a lift no ive got my car i dont he flashed her a smile dimples winked out charmingly probably hell getting a cab in this weather she studied him in her heels she was about the same height he was and she got a good close look at those innocent blue eyes too innocent she thought especially in combination with that quick dashing grin and the wink of dimples he wanted to look innocent she decided therefore he did neat trick i suppose as a professional courtesy i could give you a ride home her hair was still wet he noted and she hadnt bothered to repair her makeup are you still ticked at me no actually im down to mildly miffed i could buy you a burger he reached out to toy with one of the buttons on her jacket maybe i could talk you down to slightly steamed these things generally run their course in any case i think your homecomings been exciting enough ive got a call to make she was involved with someone finn realized it was too bad really too bad just the lift then i appreciate it chapter five for some organizing a party was a casual affair food drink music and good company were tossed together and left to mix in their own way for deanna it was a campaign from the moment cassie had passed the torch to her barely twentyfour hours earlier no detail was left unattended to no list unfulfilled like a general rousing troops she inspected the caterer the florist the bartender the housekeeping staff she arranged rearranged and approved she counted stemware discussed the playlist with the band and personally tasted van dammes chicken kabobs in peanut butter sauce incredible she murmured her eyes closed her lips just parted as she savored the flavor really really incredible when she opened her eyes she and the slim young caterer beamed at each other thank god van damme offered her a glass of wine as they stood in the center of angelas enormous kitchen miss perkins wanted cuisine from around the world as her theme it took a great deal of thought and preparation in a short amount of time to come up with flavors that would complement one another the ratatouille the deepfried mushrooms a la berlin the tiny spanakopita the list went on deanna didnt know ratatouille from tuna fish but made appropriate noises youve done a wonderful job mr van damme deanna toasted him and drank miss perkins and all of her guests will be delighted now i know i can leave all of this in your hands she hoped there were half a dozen people in the kitchen rattling pans arranging trays bickering we have thirty minutes she took one last glance around every inch of angelas rosecolored counters was filled with trays and pots the air was thick with delicious smells van dammes assistants rushed about marveling that anyone could function amid the confusion deanna escaped she hurried toward the front of the house angelas lofty living room was all pastels and flowers delicate calla lilies streamed out of crystal vases fairy roses swam in fragile bowls the floral theme was continued with the tiny violets dotting the silk wallpaper and the pale pattern of the oriental carpets spread over the floor the room like all of angelas trim twostory home was a celebration of feminine decorating with soft colors and deep cushions deannas practiced eye scanned over the sherbetcolored pillows on the curvedback sofa the arrangement of slender tapers the presentation of pale pink and green mints in crystal candy dishes she could hear the faint sounds of the band tuning up through the closed terrace doors for a moment she imagined the house as hers more color she thought fewer frills but she would definitely enjoy the lofty ceilings and curved windows the cozy fireplace set with apple wood shed want some art on the walls bold prints sinuous sculptures and a few wellchosen antiques to mix with edgy modern pieces one day she mused and shifted a vase an inch on a tabletop satisfied she took a final tour of the main level she had just started across the foyer to the staircase when the door chimes pealed too early for guests she thought as she turned to answer she sincerely hoped it wasnt a lastminute delivery shed have to deal with finn stood on the porch with dusk gathering behind him a breeze wafted up played with his hair and brought deanna the scent of man and nightfall he grinned at her letting his gaze roam up from the toes of her sneakers to her tousled hair well hi are you covering tonights event so to speak hed shaved she noted and though he hadnt bothered with a tie the slategray jacket and trousers made the casual look elegant youre early by request he stepped inside and shut the door at his back i like your party dress i was just going up to change and he was blowing a hole in her schedule she caught herself playing with her earring and dropped her hand hastily why dont you come in and sit down ill tell angela youre here whats your hurry he asked as he followed her into the living room no hurry do you want a drink the bartenders in the kitchen but i can handle something simple dont bother he sat on the arm of the sofa as he glanced around speculatively deanna was no more suited to the ornate femininity of the room than he was finn decided she made him think of titania and though he couldnt say why titania made him think of wild sex on a damp forest floor nothings changed around here in the last six months i always feel as though im walking into the royal gardens deannas lips twitched she quashed the disloyal urge to laugh and agree angelas fond of flowers ill go get her let her primp finn snagged deannas hand before she could walk out shes fond of that too do you ever sit down of course i sit down i mean when youre not driving a car or writing copy she didnt bother to tug her hand free occasionally i sit down to eat thats interesting so do i maybe we could do it together sometime deanna lifted a brow tilted her head mr riley are you coming on to me he sighed but the laughter stayed in his eyes miss reynolds i thought i was being so subtle no no im not being subtle no youre not and no now she did slide her hand from his its a nice offer but im involved with someone maybe she added to herself and if i werent i dont think its wise to mix personal and professional relationships that sounds very definite are you always very definite yes but she smiled definitely angela paused in the doorway set her teeth against temper the picture of her protegee and her lover smiling intimately at each other in her living room had her gorge rising though the taste of fury was familiar even pleasant she took a deep breath fixed a smile on her lips finn darling she flew across the room a curvy golden blossom stemmed in pale blue silk even as finn rose from the sofa she threw herself into his arms and fastened her mouth possessively on his oh ive missed you she murmured sliding her fingers up into the thick tangle of his hair so much she had an impact finn thought she always did the offer of unapologetic sex was there in the press of her body the heat of her mouth his body responded even as his mind took a wary step in retreat its good to see you too he untangled himself holding her at arms length to study her you look wonderful oh so do you shame on you deanna but she didnt take her eyes off finn for not telling me the guest of honor was here im sorry deanna resisted the urge to clear the huskiness from her throat she wished now she had left the room the moment angela had entered but the greedy knowing look on the womans face as she raced to finn had rooted deanna to the spot i was just about to she was going to mix me a drink first finn looked over angelas shoulder to deanna there was still amusement there deanna noticed and if she wasnt mistaken a faint touch of embarrassment i dont know what id do without her turning angela slid one arm around finns waist cuddling her body back into the curve of his in a way only small soft women could manage easily i can depend on deanna for absolutely everything and do oh i forgot laughing she held out a hand for deanna as if to invite her into the charmed circle with all this confusion i completely forgot about the excitement last night i was nearly sick with worry when i heard about the plane she shuddered and squeezed deannas hand and i meant to tell you what a terrific job you did on the remote isnt it just like finn to hop right out of the center of a near disaster and do a report deannas eyes flicked up to finns then back to angelas there was so much sexual heat in the room she could barely breathe i wouldnt know im sure the two of you would like some time alone before the guests arrive and i really need to change oh of course were keeping you deannas a tiger for timetables angela added tilting her head up to finns run along dear her voice was a purr as she released deannas hand ill handle things from here why dont i fix that drink finn shifted away from angela when deannas quick footsteps rapped up the stairs im sure theres champagne back there angela told him as he walked behind the rosewood bar i want to toast your homecoming with the best obliging finn took a bottle from the small refrigerator built into the back of the bar he considered several different ways to handle the situation with angela as he removed the foil and twisted the wire i tried to phone you several times last night she began when i got in i let the machine pick up i was pretty wiped out the first lie but not the last he decided with a grimace as he popped the cork bubbling wine fizzed up to the lip then retreated i understand she crossed to the bar laid a hand on his and youre here now its been a long six months saying nothing he poured her wine and opened a bottle of club soda for himself arent you joining me ill stick with this for now he had a feeling hed need a clear head tonight angela you went to an awful lot of trouble it wasnt necessary nothing is too much trouble for you she sipped the wine watching him over the rim perhaps it was the cowards way to keep the bar between them but his eyes were direct steady and cool we had some good times angela but we cant go back well be moving forward she agreed she brought his hand to her lips drew the tip of his finger into her mouth we were so good together finn you remember dont you i remember and his blood pounded in response he cursed himself for being as mindless as one of pavlovs dogs its just not going to work her teeth nipped sharply into his flesh surprising and arousing him youre wrong she murmured ill show you the doorbell chimed again and she smiled later he felt like a man locked behind bars of velvet the house was crowded with people friends coworkers network brass associates all happily celebrating his return the food was fabulous and exotic the music low and bluesy he wanted to escape he didnt mind being rude but understood if he attempted to leave angela would create a scene that would reverberate from coast to coast there were too many people in the business here for an altercation to go unreported and he much preferred reporting news rather than being reported on with that in mind he opted to tough it out even with the inevitable messy showdown with her at the end of the interminable party at least the air was clear and fresh on the terrace he was a man who could appreciate the scent of spring blossoms and newly cut grass of mingling womens perfumes and spicy food perhaps he would have enjoyed being alone to absorb the night but hed learned to be flexible when there was no choice and he had the talent for listening and exchanging conversation while his mind wandered for now he let it trail to his cabin where he would sit by the fire with a book and a brandy or hunch over his bait box making new lures alone the fantasy of being alone kept him sane through discussions of ratings and programming i tell you riley if they dont beef up tuesday nights were going to face another cutback in the news division makes me sick to think about it i know what you mean nobodys forgotten the body count from two years ago he spotted deanna excuse me a minute theres something i have to do he squeezed through the crowd on the terrace and slipped his arms around her when she stiffened he shook his head this isnt a comeon its a diversion oh automatically she matched her steps to his as he danced from what from a diatribe on network politics tuesday nights schedule ah she ran her tongue around her teeth were a little weak there as im sure you know our leadin for the late news is shut up he smiled at her when she laughed and enjoyed the fact that they were eye to eye youre a long one arent you so ive been told you know of course that as the guest of honor youre required to mingle i hate rules i live for them then consider this dance mingling well even make small talk i like your dress it was true the adolfo gowns simple lines and bold red color were a welcome change from angelas overly fussy pastels and lace thank you curiously she studied his face she could almost see the pain rapping at his temples headache no thanks i have one already let me get you some aspirin its all right itll pass he drew her closer laid his cheek against hers better already where are you from topeka shed nearly sighed nearly closed her eyes before she snapped back to attention he was entirely too smooth she decided though the adjective seemed odd when she was pressed tight to a body that was tough as iron why chicago my roommate from college settled here after she got married she talked me into relocating the position with cbc made the move easy she smelled fabulous he mused the scent of her hair and skin made him think of spiced wine and quiet smoke he thought of his lake dappled in starlight and the musical call of crickets in high grass do you like to fish excuse me fish do you like to fish she drew back to look at his face i have no idea what sort of fishing he smiled it wasnt just the puzzlement in her eyes that caused his lips to curve it was the fact that she was so obviously considering his question as seriously as one on world politics you made the right move kansas curiosity like that should take you right to the top in this business god knows youve got the face for it i prefer to think ive got the brains for it if you do then you know that looks matter in television news the public likes their death destruction and dirty politics delivered by an attractive medium and why the hell not how long did it take you to get that cynical about five minutes after i landed my first ontheair job at the numberthree station in tulsa finns thoughts veered forward it would take only an inch to taste her ripe sexy and serious mouth i beat out two other candidates because i looked better on tape and your work had nothing to do with it it does now he toyed with the ends of the hair that rained over her shoulders his fingers felt entirely too good against her skin deanna realized and shifted gears where did you get the scar which one this one she moved his hand between them tilted the scar up oh bar fight in his eyes narrowed as he tried to place the incident belfast a charming little pub that caters to the ira mmm as a precaution she kept his hand in hers however intimate the gesture looked it prevented him from touching her dont you think its undignified for a wellknown television correspondent to brawl in bars im entitled to some entertainment but it was a long time ago the scarred thumb brushed gently up the side of hers down again toward the wrist where her pulse began to stutter im much more dignified now and he smiled drawing her closer every muscle in her body turned to water i dont think so try me it was a low murmured challenge she had no answer for someones looking for you shaking off the mood she glanced over her shoulder and spotted marshall when their eyes met he smiled and held up two glasses of champagne i guess thats my cue to let you go finn did then captured her hand for one last moment just how seriously involved are you she hesitated looking down at their joined hands the desire to link fingers was very strong i dont know she met his eyes squarely i havent decided let me know when you do he released her hand and watched her walk away im sorry im late marshall kissed her briefly before he offered deanna a flute of champagne its all right she sipped surprised that her throat felt so dry its a little chilly out here isnt it concerned he touched her hand youre cold come inside all right she glanced back toward finn as marshall led her away im sorry the evening was spoiled yesterday dont worry about it after a quick scan of the room marshall guided her toward a quiet corner we both face emergencies in our work i did call you after i got in yes i got the message from my service his eyes flicked down to his glass before he drank i decided to make it an early night then you didnt see the report last night no but i did catch pieces of it on the morning news wasnt that finn riley you were dancing with just now yes hes had quite a homecoming all in all i cant imagine being that concise and detached after being so close to death i suppose hes hardened to it deanna frowned id say its more a mater of instinct and training im glad your instinct and training havent made you so cold your report from the airport was very passionate very genuine she smiled weakly it was supposed to be objective and informative it was very informative he kissed her again and you looked beautiful in the rain lingering over the kiss he missed her wince of annoyance barring news bulletins he said quietly can we plan on slipping away early having some time alone twentyfour hours before she would have said yes she realized now with the murmur of conversation around them the music drifting in through the terrace doors the fizz of champagne on her tongue she hesitated marshall tipped a finger under her chin a gesture shed once found endearing problem he asked no yes she let out a breath impatient with her own wavering it was time to step back she thought and take stock im sorry marshall angelas counting on me to see this party through and to be honest things are moving a little fast for me he didnt remove his hand but she sensed him drawing in i didnt mean to push you werent you havent she curled her fingers over his wrist in a gesture that was both apologetic and affectionate i tend to be cautious maybe overcautious in relationships there are reasons and ill explain them to you when i can no need to rush he let his hand drop away from her chin you know how much i want to be with you and its not simply sexual i know that rising to her toes she laid her cheek against his and remembered very clearly the feel of her cheek resting against finns as theyd danced he was tired and he didnt tire easily years of snatching sleep on trains and planes and buses of camping out in jungles and deserts and behind enemy lines had toughened him he enjoyed the fine linens and mintbedecked pillows of luxury hotels but finn could sleep just as soundly with his head on a bedroll and the echoes of artillery fire as a lullaby tonight he pined for bed and oblivion unfortunately there was unfinished business he might have been a man to ignore rules but he never ignored problems that was the last of them angela swept back into the living room looking as fresh and lovely as she had hours earlier everyone was so glad to see you again she wrapped her arms around him nestling her head beneath his shoulder his hand lifted to stroke her hair in a habitual gesture she felt soft and somehow pink he thought it was like being tangled in a fragrant climbing vine if he didnt nip off the feelers it would certainly choke him lets sit down we need to talk i know its hard to believe but im about talked out she skimmed a hand down his shirt then back up to toy with his top button and ive been waiting all evening to be alone with you to give you your real homecoming she leaned forward for a kiss her eyes flashed like jagged cobalt when he held her off angela im sorry im not interested in picking up where we left off six months ago he kept his hands firm on her shoulders we ended it badly and i regret that but we did end it youre not going to punish me for being overly emotional for saying things in the heat of the moment finn we meant too much to each other we had an affair he corrected we had sex it was great sex and we had a kind of odd friendship we might be able to salvage the friendship if we put the rest out of the picture youre being cruel im being honest you dont want me she tossed back her head and laughed the sound like her eyes was glassy i know you do i can feel it her skin was glowing as she stepped toward him again her lips parted curved as she watched his eyes drop to them and linger you know what i can do for you finn what ill let you do to me you want as much as i want i dont take everything i want but you took me right here on this floor the first time remember with her eyes locked on his she slid her hands up his chest shivering with triumph when she felt the unsteady thud of his heart under her palm i drove you crazy you tore my clothes off of me remember what it was like her voice lowered sliding through his system like tainted honey he remembered and the memory made him sick with desire the bite of her fingernails on his back her teeth at his shoulder shed drawn blood and he hadnt given a damn i want you to take me again finn she watched his face as her hand crept downward his fingers curled at her back digging into the silk he knew what it would be like and for a moment desperately craved that moment of violent pleasure but he remembered much more than the urgent sex and the dazzling fantasies it isnt going to happen again angela he let his hands drop away from her back she was quick he should have been prepared but her vicious backhanded blow knocked him back two steps his eyes heated like suns but he lifted a hand and coolly wiped the blood from his lip more than this room hasnt changed i see its because im older than you isnt it she hurled the words at him as her fury contorted the careful beauty of her face you think you can find someone younger someone you can mold and train and teach to grovel weve played that tune before id say weve played them all he turned heading for the door he was nearly across the foyer when she threw herself at his feet dont dont leave me she clung to his legs sobbing rejection sliced at her bringing as much fear as pain as it always did as it always would im sorry and she meant it completely utterly at that moment it only made it worse im sorry please dont leave me for gods sake angela pummeled by pity and disgust he dragged her to her feet dont do this i love you i love you so much with her arms twined around his neck she wept against his shoulder the love was as true as her earlier fury as volatile and as capricious if i thought you meant that id feel sorry for both of us he jerked her back gave her a quick shake tears hed always considered them a womans most potent and most underhanded weapon turn it off damn it do you think i could have slept with you on and off for three months and not know when youre manipulating me you dont love me and you only want me because i walked away thats not true she lifted her tearravaged face there was such innocent hurt in it such wretched sincerity that he nearly faltered i do love you finn and i can make you happy furious with her as well as with his own weakness for her he pried her arms away do you think i didnt know that you put pressure on james to have me fired just because you didnt want me to take the london assignment i was desperate she covered her face with her hands and let the tears leak through her fingers i was afraid of losing you you wanted to prove you were in control and if james hadnt been so solidly behind me you could have fucked up my career he didnt listen to me she lowered her hands and her face was cold neither did you no i came here tonight because id hoped wed both had enough time to let things settle looks like i was wrong do you think you can walk out on me she spoke quietly and with utter calm as finn moved toward the door the tears were forgotten do you think its simple to just turn your back and walk away ill ruin you it may take years but i swear ill ruin you finn paused at the door she stood in the center of the foyer her face blotched and puffy with weeping her eyes swollen and hard as stone thanks for the party angela it was a hell of a show deanna would have agreed as finn strode toward his car she was yawning in the elevator as it climbed toward her apartment she was grateful she had the entire next day off it would give her time to recover and time to think through her situation with marshall but the only thing on her schedule now was a long soothing bath and a good nights sleep she had her keys out of her purse before the elevator doors opened humming to herself she unlocked both the standard lock and the dead bolt out of habit she hit the light switch beside the door as she crossed the threshold quiet she thought wonderful blessed silence with the door locked again behind her she crossed automatically to her phone machine to check messages as she played them back she slipped out of her black satin pumps and wriggled her cramped toes she was smiling at the recording of frans voice reciting possible baby names when she spotted the envelope near the door odd she mused had that been there when shed come in she crossed the room glancing through the security peephole before bending to scoop up the note there was nothing written on the sealed envelope puzzled and fighting off another yawn she tore it open unfolded the single sheet of plain white stationery there was only one sentence typed in bold red ink deanna i adore you chapter six weve got thirty seconds to air well make it deanna slipped into her chair beside roger on the news set through her earpiece she heard the frantic overlapping voices in the control room a few feet away the floor director was shouting demands for information and dancing in place one of the camera crew was smoking lazily and chatting with a grip twenty seconds jesus roger wiped his damp palms on his knees where did benny get the bright idea to add music to the tape from me deanna gave roger a brief apologetic smile it was just a tossoff idea when i was previewing it it really will make the piece perfect someone was shouting obscenities through her earpiece and her smile turned a little sickly why did she always want perfection honestly i didnt know hed grab onto it this way ten fucking seconds roger took a last glimpse in his hand mirror if we have to fill im dumping on you babe were going to be fine her jaw was set stubbornly shed make it fine by god shed make it the best damn one minuteten the station had ever aired the swearing in the control room turned to a pandemonium of cheers as the floor director began his countdown got it she glanced smugly in rogers direction then faced the camera good afternoon this is midday im roger crowell and im deanna reynolds the passenger count on flight from london last friday was two hundred and sixty four early this morning that number rose by one matthew john carlyse son of passengers alice and eugene carlyse made his first appearance at fivefifteen this morning though six weeks premature matthew weighed in at a healthy five pounds as the tape rolled to the accompaniment of the crooning baby baby deanna let out a relieved breath and grinned at the monitor her idea she reminded herself and it was perfect great pictures not bad roger agreed and was forced to smile when the monitor focused on the tiny form squirming and squawling in the incubator there was a small set of wings pinned to his blanket almost worth the ulcer the carlyses named their son after matthew kirkland the pilot who landed flight safely at ohare friday night despite engine failure mr carlyse said that neither he nor his wife were concerned about making the return flight to london at the end of the month young matthew had no comment in other news roger segued into the next segment deanna glanced down at her copy reviewing her pacing when she looked up again she spotted finn in the rear of the studio he rocked back on his heels his thumbs hooked in his front pockets but he gave her a nod of congratulations what the hell was he doing there watching evaluating the man had a full weeks free time coming to him why wasnt he at the beach the mountains somewhere even as she turned to the camera again and picked up her cue she could feel his eyes on her coolly blue and objective by the time they broke for the last commercial before deannas corner her nerves had evolved into bubbling temper deanna pushed back from the news desk descended the step and marched across the snaking cables before she could greet her guest for the day finn stepped in front of her youre better than i remember really she gave the hem of her jacket a quick tug well with a compliment like that i can die happy just an observation curious he wrapped his fingers around her arm to hold her in place i cant make up my mind about you am i still on the blacklist because i bumped you off the story the other night youre not on any list i just dont like being watched he had to grin then youre in the wrong business kansas he let her go impulsively he took one of the folding chairs out of camera range he hadnt intended to stay and knew he did so simply to irritate her hed come in that afternoon as hed come in the evening before because he enjoyed being back in the chicago studios he didnt have much in his life at the moment other than his career he preferred it that way he watched deanna ease her guests nerves with offcamera chitchat and considered would she be relieved or annoyed to know he hadnt given her a thought over the remainder of the weekend years in the business had made him an expert at compartmentalizing his life women didnt interfere with his work the sculpting of a story or his ambitions the months in london had added to his reputation and his credibility but he was happy to be back his thoughts swung back to deanna as he heard her laugh a good smoky sound he thought subtle sex it suited her looks he decided and those eyes they were warm now and filled with lively interest as her guest hyped a one woman art show scheduled for that evening at that moment finn didnt give a damn about art but he was interested very interested in deanna the way she leaned forward just a little to add a sense of intimacy to the interview not once did he catch her looking at her notes and scrambling for the next question even when they broke deanna continued to give her guest her attention as a result the artist left the studio with her ego fully pumped deanna slipped back behind the news desk with roger for the close shes good isnt she finn glanced behind him simon grimsley was standing just inside the studio doors he was a thinshouldered man with a long narrow face set in perpetual lines of worry and doubt even when he smiled as he did now there was a look in his eyes that spoke of inescapable doom he was losing his hair though finn knew him to be on the shy side of thirty he was dressed as always in a dark suit and snugly knotted tie and as always the attire accented his bony frame hows it going simon dont ask simon rolled his dark pessimistic eyes angelas in one of her moods today big time thats not exactly a breaking story simon dont i know it he lowered his voice as the red light blinked on threw a paperweight at me he whispered baccarat lucky she doesnt have much of an arm maybe she could get a job with the cubs simon gave what passed for a chuckle then guiltily stifled it shes under a lot of pressure yeah right it isnt easy staying number one simon let out a sigh of relief when the on the air sign blinked off live television kept him in a constant state of turmoil deanna he signaled to her and nearly hooked his foot in a coil of cable in his hurry to catch up nice show really nice thanks she looked from him to finn then back howd this mornings taping go it went he grimaced angela asked me to get this message to you he offered a pale pink envelope it seemed important okay she resisted the urge to bury the note in her pocket dont worry ill get back to her well id better get upstairs come by this afternoons taping if you get a chance i will finn watched the door swing shut behind simon ill never understand how anyone so nervous and depressed can deal with the characters angelas books hes organized i dont know anyone better at sorting things out than simon that wasnt a criticism finn said as he matched her stride out of the studio it was a comment you seem to be full of comments today out of habit she turned into the dressing room to redo her makeup then ive got another one your interview with the artist myra was it was solid pleasure snuck through her guard thanks it was an interesting subject it didnt have to be you kept her grounded when she started to run on about technique and symbolism you kept it light and friendly i prefer light and friendly her eyes met his in the mirror and sizzled ill leave gorbachev and hussein to you i appreciate it he shook his head as she freshened her lipstick youre touchy the observation was meant as a compliment he was right she thought she was being touchy do you know what i think finn she smoothed back her hair and turned i think theres too much energy in this room conflicting energy he had felt electricity since the moment hed scooped her against him on a rainy runway and how does all that conflicting energy make you feel crowded she smiled in direct response to the amusement in his eyes i suppose thats why it always seems youre in my way i guess id better move aside then and give you some room why dont you she picked up the pink envelope shed set on the counter but before she could open it finn took her hand question how do you justify your job as a reporter for cbc with your job with angela i dont have a job with angela i work the news in quick competent moves she ran a brush through her hair and tied it back i occasionally do favors for angela she doesnt pay me just a couple of pals helping each other out she didnt care for the edge in his voice i wouldnt say angela and i were pals we are friends and shes been very generous with me the news division doesnt have a problem with my personal association with angela or with the time i give her so i hear but then the entertainment division wouldnt step back from applying a little pressure when theyve got the clout of a toprated show he rocked back on his heels studying her it makes me wonder why angela would go to the trouble just to use you her hackles rose she isnt using me im learning from her and learning is something i find useful learning what exactly how to be the best she thought but cautiously kept that thought to herself she has incredible interviewing skills that she does but yours seem sharp enough to me he paused at least on soft news she nearly snarled delighting him i enjoy what i do and if i didnt it still wouldnt be any of your business an accurate statement he should have dropped the subject but he knew too well what angela could do with her claws once they were dug in unless he missed his guess deanna would bleed fast and copiously would you listen to a friendly warning about angela no i make up my mind about people on my own suit yourself i wonder he continued searching her face are you as tough as you think you are i can be tougher youll need to be he released her hand and walked away alone deanna let out a long steadying breath why was it every time she spent five minutes with finn she felt as though shed run a marathon exhausted and exhilarated pushing him firmly out of her mind she tore open angelas note the handwriting was a series of loops and flourishes drawn with a fountain pen deanna darling i have something vitally important to discuss with you my schedule today is maddening but i can slip away about four meet me for tea at the ritz lobby lounge believe me its urgent love angela angela hated to be kept waiting by fourfifteen shed ordered a second champagne cocktail and begun to steam she was about to offer deanna the chance of a lifetime and rather than gratitude she was greeted with rudeness as a result she snapped at the waitress when her drink was served and scowled around the sumptuous lounge the fountain behind her tinkled musically it soothed her a bit like the frothy sip of champagne it wasnt really drinking she thought pleasing herself it was like tasting success the gilt and glory of the ritz was a long way from arkansas she reminded herself and she was about to go further yet the reminder of her plans softened the frown on her face the smile bolstered the courage of a matron with blue tinted hair who approached for an autograph angela was all gracious affability when deanna hurried in at twenty after four she saw angela chatting amiably with a fan excuse me deanna took the seat across from angela im sorry im late dont give it a thought waving away the apology angela smiled so nice to have met you mrs hopkins im glad you enjoy the show i wouldnt miss it and youre even lovelier in person than you are on tv isnt that sweet angela said to deanna when they were alone she watches the show every morning now shell be able to brag to her bridge club that she met me in person lets get you a drink wed better make it tea im driving nonsense angela caught the waitresss attention tapped her glass then held up two fingers i refuse to celebrate with something as passive as tea then id better know what were celebrating deanna slipped out of her jacket one drink she estimated could easily last the entire thirty minutes shed allowed for the meeting not until you have your champagne angela smiled coyly before sipping her own i really need to thank you again for being such a trouper the other night it turned out to be a wonderful party there wasnt much to do easy for you to say youre able to keep a handle on all those little details with a flutter of her fingers angela dismissed them they just annoy me setting her drink aside again she took out a cigarette and what do you think of finn id have to say hes one of the best reporters on cbc or any of the networks powerful he has a way of cutting to the heart of an issue and letting just enough of himself sneak through to intrigue the audience no no not professionally angela blew out an impatient stream of smoke as a man i dont know him as a man impressions deanna angelas voice sharpened putting deanna on alert youre a reporter arent you youre trained to observe what are your observations boggy ground deanna decided the station had been ripe with rumors of past history and the speculation of a current affair between the two stars objectively hes very attractive charismatic and i suppose id have to use the word powerful again hes certainly well liked by the techs and by the brass especially the women angela began to jiggle her foot a sign of agitation her father had been charismatic too hadnt he she remembered bitterly and attractive and certainly powerful when he was on a winning streak and hed left her as well her and her pathetic drunken mother for another woman and the siren call of a royal flush but shed learned since then learned a lot about payback he can be very charming she continued and very devious he isnt above using people to get what he wants she drew deeply on the cigarette smiled thinly through a mist of smoke i noticed him seek you out at the party and thought id give you a friendly warning deanna lifted a brow wondering how angela would feel if she knew finn had used the same phrase just a few hours earlier no need i know that youre involved with marshall at the moment but finn can be very persuasive she tapped out her cigarette leaning closer girl to girl i know how news travels at the studio so theres no need to pretend you dont know about what was between finn and me before he went to london im afraid since i broke things off he might try to salve his ego and strike back at me by making a play for someone i care about i wouldnt want to see you hurt i wont be uncomfortable deanna shifted back angela i really am running thin on time if this is what you wanted to talk to me about no no just making small talk and here we go she beamed as their drinks were served now we have the proper tools for a toast she lifted her glass waited until deanna had lifted hers to new york the flutes clinked joyfully together new york all my life ive been working toward it after a hasty sip angela set her glass down excitement was shimmering around her in restless waves nothing not even champagne could compete with it now its reality what im telling you now is in the strictest confidence understood of course i had an offer from starmedia deanna an incredible offer her voice bubbled like the wine ill be leaving chicago and cbc in august when my contracts up the show will be moving to new york with the addition of four primetime specials a year her eyes were like blue glass her fingers running up and down the flute like excited birds searching for a place to land thats wonderful but i thought youd already agreed to renew with cbc and the delacort syndicate verbally she shrugged it off starmedia is a much more imaginative syndicate delacorts been taking me for granted im going where im most appreciated and most rewarded ill be forming my own production company and we wont just produce angelas well do specials tv movies documentaries im going to have access to the best in the business she paused always a showman thats why i want you to come with me as my executive producer you want me deanna shook her head as if to clear jumbled thoughts im not a producer and lew lew angela dismissed her longtime associate with a toss of her head i want someone young fresh imaginative no when i make this move i wont be taking lew with me the jobs yours deanna all you have to do is take it deanna took a long slow sip of champagne shed been expecting the offer of head researcher and because ambition pointed elsewhere she was prepared to decline but this this was out of nowhere and it was far more tempting im flattered she began flabbergasted she corrected i dont know what to say then ill cue you say yes with a quick laugh deanna sat back and studied the woman across from her eager impulsive and yes ruthless not bad qualities all in all there was also talent and brains and those edgy nerves angela thought no one noticed it was the combination that had pushed her to the top and was keeping her there a top spot on the top show in the market deanna calculated i wish i could jump at it angela but i need to think this through what is there to think about the wine was fizzing in angelas head deanna was just quick enough to save a flute from upending when angela reached carelessly across the table you dont get offers like this every day in this business deanna take what there is when you can do you know the kind of money im talking about the prestige the power i have some idea a quarter of a million a year to start and all the benefits it took deanna a moment to close her mouth no she said slowly apparently i didnt have any idea your own office your own staff a car and driver at your disposal opportunities to travel to socialize with the cream why pleased angela sat back because i can trust you because i can depend on you and because i see something of myself when i look at you a quick chill danced up deannas spine its a very big step small ones are a waste of time that may be but i need to think this through i dont know if im suited i think youre suited angelas impatience was simmering again why would you doubt it angela one of the reasons i imagine youre offering me this job is because im a good detail person because im thorough and obsessively organized i wouldnt be any of those things if i didnt take the time to sort this out with a nod angela took out another cigarette youre right i shouldnt be pushing but i want you with me on this how much time do you need a couple of days can i let you know by the end of the week all right she flicked on her lighter and studied the flame briefly ill just say one more thing you dont belong behind a desk on some local noon show reading the news you were made for bigger things deanna i saw it in you right from the beginning i hope youre right deanna let out a long breath i really do the little gallery off michigan avenue was crammed with people hardly larger than the average suburban garage the showroom was brightly lit to suit the bold splashy paintings arranged nearly frame to frame along the walls the moment deanna stepped inside she was glad shed followed the impulse to stop in not only did it take her mind off angelas stunning offer that afternoon but it allowed her to follow up firsthand on her own interview the air was ripe with sounds and scents cheap champagne and clashing voices and color she mused the blacks and grays of the crowd were a stark contrast to the vibrancy of the paintings she regretted she hadnt wrangled a camera crew to do a brief update quite an event marshall murmured in her ear deanna turned smiled we wont stay long i know this isnt exactly your style he glanced around at the frantic colors slashed over canvas not exactly wild stuff fran edged her way through her husband richards hand firmly gripped in hers your spot this afternoon had some impact i dont know about that well it didnt hurt tilting her head up fran sniffed the air i smell food its gotten so she can smell a hot dog boiling from three blocks away richard shifted in to drape an arm around fran he had a pretty boyish face that smiled easily his pale blond hair was conservatively cut but the tiny hole in his left earlobe had once sported a variety of earrings its heightened sensory awareness fran claimed and mine tells me there are pigsinablanket at three oclock catch you later she dragged richard away hungry bumped from behind deanna moved comfortably into marshalls protective arm not really using the advantage of height he scouted the area and led her away from the heart of the crowd youre being a good sport about this coming here its interesting she laughed and kissed him again a very good sport id just like to make a quick pass through and congratulate myra deanna looked around if i can find her take your time why dont i see if i can find us some canapes thanks deanna threaded her way through the crowd she enjoyed the press of bodies the undertones of excitement the snippets of overheard conversations shed made it halfway around the room when a bold painting stopped her sinuous lines and bold splashes against a textured background of midnight blue it turned the canvas into an explosion of emotion and energy fascinated deanna moved closer the label beneath the sleek ebony frame read awakenings perfect deanna thought absolutely perfect the colors were alive and seemed to be fighting their way free of the canvas away from the night even as she studied the work she felt her pleasure turn to desire and desire to determination with a little juggling of her budget like it she felt jolted into awareness but she didnt bother to turn around to face finn yes very much do you spend much time in galleries now and then he stepped up beside her amused at the way she stared at the painting every thought in her head was reflected in her eyes actually your spot this afternoon convinced me to drop in really she looked at him then he was dressed much as hed been when hed crossed the runway his expensive leather jacket unsnapped his jeans comfortably worn boots well broken in yes really and i owe you one kansas why is that th he nodded toward the painting i just bought it you she looked from him to the painting and back again her teeth locked together i see it really caught me he dropped a hand on her shoulder and faced the painting if he continued to look at her finn knew hed break out in a grin it was all there in her eyes the disappointment the desire the irritation and the price was right i think theyre going to find out very soon that theyre underselling her it was hers damn it shed already imagined it hanging above her desk at home she couldnt believe hed snapped it out from under her why this one because it was perfect for me with the lightest of pressure on her shoulder he turned her to face him i knew the moment i saw it and when i see something i want he trailed a finger up the side of her throat feather light while his eyes stayed on hers i do what i can to have it her pulse jumped like a rabbit surprising her annoying her they were standing toe to toe now their eyes and mouths lined up and too close just an inch too close so that she could see herself reflected in the dreamy blue of his eyes sometimes what we want is unavailable sometimes he smiled and she forgot the crowd pressing them together the coveted painting at her back the voice in her head telling her to back away a good reporter has to know when to move fast and when to be patient dont you think yes but she was having a hard time thinking at all it was his eyes she realized the way they focused as if there were nothing and no one else and she knew somehow that he would continue to look at her just that way even if the ground suddenly fell away beneath her want me to be patient deanna his finger roamed over her jawline lingered i the air backed up in her lungs and for a moment one startled moment she felt herself swaying toward him oh i see you found refreshments already marshall said she saw the wry amusement on finns face yes marshall her voice was unsteady fighting to level it she gripped his arm as though he were a rock in the stormy sea i ran into finn i dont think youve met dr marshall pike finn riley of course i know your work marshall offered a hand welcome back to chicago thanks youre a psychologist right yes i specialize in domestic counseling interesting work the statistics seem to point to the end of the traditional family yet the overall trend if you look at advertising entertainment seems to be making a move back to just that deanna looked for a barb but found nothing but genuine interest as finn drew marshall into a discussion on american family culture it was the reporter in him she imagined that made it possible for him to talk to anyone at any time on any subject at the moment she was grateful it comforted her to have her hand tucked into marshalls to feel that she could be if she chose part of a couple she preferred overwhelmingly marshalls gentle romancing to finns direct assault on the nervous system if she had to compare the two men which she assured herself she certainly didnt she would have given marshall top points for courtesy respect and stability she smiled up at him even as her eyes were drawn back to the dramatic and passionate painting when fran and richard joined them deanna made introductions a few minutes of small talk and they said their goodbyes deanna tried to pretend she didnt feel finns eyes on her as they nudged their way to the door be still my heart fran muttered in deannas ear hes even sexier in person than he is on the tube you think so honey if i was unmarried and unpregnant id do a lot more than think fran shot one last look over her shoulder yumyum chuckling deanna gave her a light shove out the door get a hold of yourself myers fantasies are harmless dee i keep telling you and if hed been looking at me the way he was looking at you id have been a puddle of hormones at his feet deanna combated the jitters in her stomach with a brisk gulp of spring air i dont melt that easily not melting easily deanna thought later was part of the problem when marshall pulled his car to the curb in front of her building she knew that he would walk her up and when he walked her up he would expect to be invited inside and then she simply wasnt ready for the and then the flaw was in her undoubtedly she could easily blame her hesitation toward intimacy on the past and it would be true enough she didnt want to admit another part of her hesitation was attributable to finn you dont need to walk me up he lifted a hand to toy with her hair its early yet i know but i have an early call in the morning i appreciate your going by the gallery with me i enjoyed it more than i anticipated good smiling she touched her lips to his when he deepened the kiss drawing her in she yielded there was warmth there passion just restrained a quiet moan of pleasure sounded in her throat as he changed the angle of the kiss the thud of his heart raced against hers deanna he took his mouth on a slow journey of her face i want to be with you i know she turned her lips to his again almost she thought dreamily she was almost sure i need a little more time marshall im sorry you know how i feel about you he cupped her face in his hand studying her but i understand it has to be right why dont we get away for a few days away from chicago we could take a weekend he tipped her face back and kissed the side of her mouth cancun st thomas maui wherever you like and the other side just the two of us it would let us see how we are together away from work all the pressures id like that her eyes drifted closed id like to think about that then think about it there was a look of dark triumph in his eyes check your schedule and leave the rest to me chapter seven deanna hadnt expected the pricks of disloyalty television was after all a business and part of the business was to get ahead to make the best deal but while the may sweeps consumed the cbc building with nightly ratings discussed and analyzed by everyone from top brass to the maintenance crews she felt like a traitor next years budgets were being forecasted off the sweeps and the forecasts were being made on faulty assumptions she knew angelas would be gone before the start of the fall season and with the deal angela had made she would compete with cbcs daytime lineup as well as with primetime specials the more celebratory the mood in the newsroom the more guilt jabbed at deannas conscience got a problem kansas deanna glanced up as finn made himself comfortable on the corner of her desk why do you ask youve been staring at that screen for the past five minutes im used to seeing you move im thinking that doesnt usually stop you leaning forward he rubbed his thumb between her eyebrows tension in defense she shifted back in her chair to break the contact were in the middle of the may sweeps who isnt tense middays holding its own its doing better than that she snapped back pride and loyalty welled together weve got a twentyeightpercent share were up three full ratings points since the last sweeps thats better id rather see you fired up than unhappy i wasnt unhappy she said between her teeth i was thinking whatever he rose then and hauled up the garment bag hed set on the floor where are you going new york in an easy practiced move finn slung the bag over his shoulder im putting in a few days as substitute host on wake up call kirk brookss allergies are acting up deanna arched a brow she knew that cbcs wake up call was performing poorly lagging well behind good morning america and today you mean the ratings are acting up finn shrugged and took one of the candycoated almonds from the bowl on her desk thats the bottom line the brass figures the viewers will think somebody whos been through a few firefights and earthquakes is glamorous disgust crossed his face as he swallowed so ill get up early for a few days and wear a tie its a little more than that its a complicated show interviews breaking stories chitchat the phrase was ripe with contempt theres nothing wrong with chitchat it involves the viewer brings them into the picture and it opens doors his lips curved into something between a smile and a sneer right the next time i interview qaddafi ill be sure to ask how he feels about madonnas new video intrigued she tilted her head back to study him she thought shed pegged him as the reckless rebel who did precisely as he chose and kept the executives groping for the maalox if you hate it so much why are you doing it i work here he said simply and helped himself to a handful of candy deanna lowered her eyes toyed with papers on her desk so did she she thought miserably so did she then its a matter of loyalty first what was going on inside that head of hers he wondered it was a pity he didnt have time to hang around and dig it out then you can expand it if wake up call goes in the sewer the revenue suffers whats the first place that feels it the news department damn right youve got the morning show scraping the bottom of the ratings barrel and the fact that a couple of fatheaded idiots cant seem to program a decent tuesday night and before you can say nielsen weve got cutbacks monday and friday are strong she murmured and weve got angelas its a little tough knowing that angela and a handful of sitcoms are saving our ass then he smiled shrugged screwy business i dont suppose youd kiss me goodbye i dont suppose i would but youll miss me there was enough laughter in his eyes to make her grin back at him youre not going off to war finn easy for you to say stay tuned he sauntered off deanna watched him walk up to another woman reporter the woman laughed then planted an exaggerated kiss on his mouth as applause erupted he turned grinned at deanna with a final salute to the newsroom he swung through the doors deanna was still chuckling when she returned to her copy the man might have his flaws she mused but at least he could make her laugh and she admitted he could make her think mentally she pulled out her list two columns neatly typed specifying her reasons to accept and decline angelas offer there was a hard copy in the top drawer of her desk at home it was a simple matter to visualize it with a sigh she added one word to the decline column loyalty miss reynolds she blinked and focused behind a porcelain pot of lush red hibiscus was a round cheerful face it took her a moment to click it in but when he shoved a pair of wirerimmed glasses up his pug nose she remembered jeff hi whats all this for you he set it on her desk then immediately shoved his hands in his pockets as an editorial assistant jeff hyatt was more comfortable with equipment than with people he gave deanna a fleeting smile then stared at the flowers nice i ran into the delivery boy and since i was on my way in thanks jeff no problem deanna had already forgotten him as she reached for the card tucked among the blooms how about hawaii smiling she reached out to stroke a blossom one more on the decline list she mused marshall miss reynolds to see you miss perkins ask her to wait with a cigarette smoldering between her fingers angela frowned over beekers report on marshall pike it was certainly interesting reading and demanded her full attention his credentials were well earned the doctorate from georgetown the year studying abroad and financially the psychologist did well for himself counseling socialites and politicians on their floundering marriages and dysfunctional families he offset his lucrative practice by donating three afternoons a week to social services overall a nice upstanding profile of a man who had studied well and worked hard and was devoted to preserving family life angela knew all about profiles and the illusions they fostered his own marriage had failed a quiet civilized divorce hadnt caused much of a ripple in chicago society and certainly hadnt harmed his practice still it was interesting interesting because beeker had discovered that the size of marshalls settlement with his exwife was a whopper as were the alimony payments much more than a brief childless marriage warranted he hadnt contested it angela mused a smile lifted the corners of her mouth as she continued to read perhaps he hadnt dared when a thirtyfiveyearold man was caught entertaining his secretarys very lovely very naked and very young daughter at two am he didnt have a lot of room for negotiations a minor however willing was still a minor and adultery particularly with a sixteenyearold carried a hefty price tag hed been clever in covering himself angela mused scanning beekers file the secretary had taken a fat lump sum and a glowing reference and moved her family to san antonio the wife had taken a great deal more but barely a whisper about the good doctor had escaped and when it had and angela admired him for his boldness rumor tied him obliquely with the secretary not her nubile daughter so the elegant dr pike continued his practice as one of chicagos most eligible bachelors the eminent family counselor with a weakness for teenagers an interesting topic for a show she decided and laughed out loud no no they would keep this one private some information was worth a great deal more than ratings angela closed the file and slipped it into a drawer she wondered how much deanna knew send her in cassie angela was all smiles when deanna walked in sorry i kept you waiting i had a little something to finish up i know youre busy deanna briefly tugged on her earring do you have a few minutes of course she rose gesturing to a chair how about some coffee no dont bother deanna sat made herself fold her hands quietly in her lap no trouble something cold instead delighted for the moment to serve angela crossed to the bar and poured them both a mineral water if i didnt have a dinner tonight id have cassie bring in some of those fudge cookies i know shes got in her desk she laughed lightly she doesnt think i know about them but then i make it a policy to know everything about my people after handing deanna a glass she dropped into a chair and stretched out her legs its been quite a day so far and im off at dawn for california california i didnt know you were going on location no im speaking at the commencement exercises at berkeley not bad angela thought for someone who waited tables to get through arkansas state ill be back for mondays tapings you know dee since you stopped by you might take a look at my speech you know how i value your input sure miserable deanna sipped at the water i cant do it until after five but no problem you can fax it back to me at home ill give you a copy all right angela the only way to handle this was straightforwardly im here to talk to you about your offer i was hoping you were relaxed satisfied angela slipped off her shoes and reached for a cigarette i cant tell you how much im looking forward to the move to new york deanna thats where the pulse of this business is you know she snapped on her lighter took a quick drag thats where the power is ive already got my agent looking for an apartment her eyes lost their calculating edge and turned dreamy inside she was still the girl from arkansas who wanted to be a princess i want something with a view lots of windows and light lots of room a place where i can feel at home where i can entertain if i find the right place we may even shoot some of the specials there the viewing audience likes to get a peek at our personal lives she smiled as she tapped her cigarette the soft look in her eyes sharpened were going places dee women have finally gained a solid foothold in broadcasting and were going right to the top you and me she reached over and gave deannas hand a quick squeeze you know your brains your creativity are only part of the reason i want you with me her voice was persuasive and ringing with sincerity i can trust you dee i can relax around you i dont have to tell you what that means to me deanna closed her eyes a moment while guilt churned in her stomach i dont think theres ever been another woman ive felt so close to angela concluded angela i want youre going to be more than my executive producer youre going to be my right hand in fact i should have my agent looking for a place for you too nearby she murmured envisioning the latenight girl talks shed never been permitted during her youth its going to be wonderful for both of us angela slow down with a half laugh deanna held up a hand i think i understand how much this deal with starmedia means to you and im thrilled for you youve been wonderful to me your help your friendship and i wish you all the success in the world leaning over deanna took angelas hand but i cant take the job the gleam in angelas eyes dimmed her mouth tightened the unexpected rejection nearly stopped her breath are you certain you understand just what im offering you oh yes i do i do she repeated squeezing angelas hand between both of hers before she got up to pace and believe me ive thought about this carefully ive had a hard time thinking of anything else she turned back gesturing with her hands and i just cant do it very slowly angela straightened in her chair she crossed her legs the simple gesture eradicated all the softness why a lot of reasons first i have a contract with a sound caught between disgust and amusement angela waved it aside youve been around long enough to know how easily thats dealt with that may be but when i signed i gave my word taking another contemplative drag angela narrowed her eyes are you that naive deanna understood it was meant as an insult but she merely lifted a shoulder there are other factors even knowing you dont plan to take lew id feel guilty stepping into his shoes particularly since i dont have his experience im not a producer angela and though its awfully tempting to forget that and jump at the offer the money the position the power christ new york she blew out a breath that fluttered her bangs she hadnt fully understood how much she wanted all those things until they had been within reach and shed had to let them go and the chance to work with you really work with you that isnt easy for me to turn my back on but you are angelas tone was cool thats precisely what youre doing its just not for me other factors just got in the way no matter how hard i tried to reposition them my ambitions run in front of the camera and im happy in chicago my job my home friends are here angela tapped out the cigarette in quick short bursts like machinegun fire and marshall did he factor into this decision deanna thought of the pot of red hibiscus on her desk somewhat i do have feelings for him id like to give them a chance i have to tell you youre making a mistake youre letting details and personal feelings cloud your professional judgment i dont think so deanna crossed the room to sit again leaned forward it was a tricky business she thought turning down an offer without seeming ungrateful particularly when the offer had taken on all the connotations of a favor to a friend ive looked at this from every angle thats what i do occasionally what i overdo your offer wasnt easy to turn down and i dont do it lightly ill always be grateful and incredibly flattered that you had enough faith in me to ask so youre going to sit back and read copy now it was angela who rose fury was bubbling so hot within her she could feel it searing under her skin shed offered the girl a feast and she was settling for crumbs where was the gratitude where was the fucking loyalty your choice she said coolly as she sat behind her desk why dont you take a few more days the weekend while im away in case you have any second thoughts she shook her head to cut off any comment from deanna well talk again monday angela said in dismissal between tapings pencil it in for oh her mind was working frantically as she flipped through her appointment book elevenfifteen her smile was warm friendly again when she glanced up if youre of the same mind then i wont give you an argument fair enough all right it seemed more gracious and certainly easier to agree ill see you monday then have a nice trip i will deliberately she waited until deanna was at the door oh dee she smiled and held up a manila envelope my speech right deanna crossed the room again to take the package try to get it back to me before nine i need my beauty sleep angela waited until the door closed before she folded her hands on the desk her fingers turned bonewhite with the pressure she took a long moment staring at the closed door breathing shallowly it wouldnt do to rage she told herself no not this time for deanna she had to be cool and calm and concise to review the facts shed offered deanna a position of power her own unqualified friendship her trust and she preferred to read the news at noon because she had a contract a lease on an apartment and a man could she actually be that artless angela wondered that guileless that stupid she relaxed her hands forced herself to lean back in her chair and even her breathing whatever the answer deanna would learn that no one ever turned angela down calmer now angela opened a drawer and took out marshalls file the look on her face wasnt hard nor was it glittery with anger her lips trembled into a pout a childs expression on being denied deanna wasnt going to go with her to new york she mused and she was going to be very very sorry deanna had taken one step into the outer office when her guilty mood vanished into a flood of surprised pleasure kate kate lowell the leggy doeeyed woman turned brushing her glorious mane of flaming hair aside her face the ivory complexion the delicate bones the melting eyes and generous mouth was as stunning as it was famous the quick flashing smile was automatic she was first and last an actress hello those braces sure as hell did the job now deanna laughed kate its dee deanna reynolds deanna the furious nervous tension beneath the smile dissolved oh god deanna the infectious giggle that turned men to putty rang out i cant believe it imagine how i feel it has to be fourteen fifteen years for kate for one beautiful moment it felt like yesterday she could remember all the long talks the innocence of girlish confidences under cassies fascinated eye the two women crossed the room and embraced they hung on to each other a moment tight you look wonderful they said simultaneously then laughed its true kate drew back but kept deannas hand in hers we do its a long way from topeka longer for you whats hollywoods newest star doing in chicago a little business kates smile dimmed a little hype what about you i work here here the remnants of the warm smile vanished for angela no downstairs in the newsroom midday with roger crowell and deanna reynolds dont tell me two of my favorite people know each other angela stepped out the gracious hostess kate dear im sorry you had to wait cassie didnt tell me you were here i just got in the hand still gripping deannas stiffened then relaxed my plane was delayed this morning so ive been running behind all day awful isnt it even a woman with your talents is subject to the whims of technology now tell me she strolled over to lay a proprietary hand on deannas shoulder how do you know our dee my aunt lived across the street from deannas family i spent a couple of summers in kansas as a child and you were playmates angelas laugh was delighted thats charming and deannas been keeping her brush with fame all to herself shame on you in a subtle move no less potent for its polish kate shifted the gesture eased angela out of the circle hows your family theyre fine baffled by the tension snapping in the air deanna tried to find the source of it in kates eyes all she could see was allowed to see was the soft tawny gold they never miss one of your movies neither do i i remember how youd put on plays in your aunts backyard and youd write them now youre reporting the news and youre making it you were incredible in deception kate i cried buckets theres oscar talk smoothly angela moved forward to drape an arm around kates shoulders how could there not be when kate so effectively played the heroic young mother fighting to keep her child a look passed between them sharp as a razor i attended the premiere there wasnt a dry eye in the house oh i imagine there was one kates smile was brilliant and curiously feline or two id love to give you girls time to catch up angela pressed her fingers warningly on kates shoulder but were running late ill let you go tucking angelas speech under her arm deanna stepped back how long will you be in chicago im leaving tomorrow kate stepped back as well it was good to see you and you oddly hurt deanna turned and walked away isnt that sweet angela gestured kate into her office shut the door you running into a childhood friend who just happens to be my protegee right in my office tell me kate have you kept in touch with dee shared all your secrets with her only a fool shares secrets willingly angela now lets not waste time on small talk lets get down to business satisfied angela sat behind her desk yes lets to finn riley new york was like a woman a longlegged slickskinned siren who knew her way around the block she was sexy she was by turns tacky and chic and god knew she was dangerous perhaps that was why he preferred chicago finn loved women and had a weakness for the longlegged dangerous type but chicago was a big burly man with sweat on his shirt and a cold brew in his fist chicago was a brawler finn trusted an honest fight more than he ever would a seduction he knew his way around manhattan hed lived there briefly with his mother during one of his parents trial separations hed lost track of how many trial separations there had been before the inevitable divorce he remembered how reasonable they both had been how bloodless and civilized and he remembered being shuffled off to housekeepers secretaries prep schools to spare him supposedly from that wellchoreographed discord in reality he knew neither of his parents had been comfortable with a young boy who had asked direct questions and hadnt been satisfied with logical gutless answers so he had lived in manhattan and on long island and in connecticut and vermont hed summered in bar harbor and on marthas vineyard hed done time in the hallowed halls of three of new englands top prep schools perhaps that was why he still had such restless feet the minute roots started to dig in he felt honorbound to rip them out and move on now he was back in new york temporarily where he knew the underbelly as well as he knew his mothers elegant penthouse on central park west he couldnt even say if he preferred one to the other any more than he could say that he minded putting in a few days on wake up call at the moment finn put new york out of his mind and concentrated on the ball whizzing toward his nose it wasnt selfdefense nearly as much as it was the spirit of competition and god knew the exertion of the court was a welcome change from the hours hed spent sitting on a sofa on the set the last four days he sliced out with his racket letting out a grunt of effort that was lost as the ball caromed off the wall the power sang up his arm the echo of the smash reverberated in his head adrenaline raced through him as his opponent cracked the ball back he met it with a solid backhand the sweat dribbled satisfactorily down his back dampening his ragged cbc tshirt for the next five minutes there was only the smash and echo of the ball the smell of sweat and the sound of labored breathing son of a bitch barlow james sagged against the wall as finn blew one by him youre killing me shit finn didnt bother with the wall he slid straight down to the floor of the vertical club every muscle in his body was weeping next time ill bring a gun itll be easier on both of us he groped for a towel mopped his soaking face when the hell are you going to get old barlows laugh barked off the walls of the racquetball court he was a brawny sixfootfour flat of stomach broad of chest with shoulders like concrete blocks at sixtythree he was showing no signs of slowing down as he crossed toward finn he pulled an orange neon sweatband away from his silver mane of hair finn had always thought barlow had a face that belonged on mount rushmore craggy huge and powerful getting soft kid barlow pulled a bottle of evian out of his gym bag and tossed it underhand to finn the second one he kept himself drinking in deep greedy gulps almost took you that time ive been playing with brits since he nearly had his breath back finn grinned up at him theyre not as mean as you well welcome back to the states barlow offered a hand hauling finn to his feet it was like being gripped by a friendly grizzly you know most people would have considered the post in london a promotion even a coup its a nice town barlow let out a sigh lets hit the showers twenty minutes later they were stretched out on massage tables being pummeled damn good show this morning barlow commented youve got a good crew solid writers give it a little time and youll be competitive time is shorter than it used to be in this business i used to hate the goddamn bean counters he bared his teeth in a grimace now im a goddamn bean counter at least youre a bean counter with imagination barlow said nothing finn held his silence knowing there was a purpose to this informal meeting give me an opinion on the chicago bureau its tight finn said cautiously hell barlow you were bureau chief there for more than ten years you know what were working with youve got a solid combination of experience and fresh blood its a good place to work ratings for the local evening news are weak what we need is a stronger leadin id like to see them shift angelas to four pull her audience along finn shrugged he didnt ignore ratings but he did detest their importance shes been at nine in chicago and most of the midwest for years you might have a tough time pulling it off tougher than you think barlow murmured you and angela ah theres nothing going on there anymore finn opened his eyes cocked a brow are we going to have a fatherson chat pop wiseass barlow chuckled but his eyes were keen finn knew the look i wondered if you two had picked up where you left off where we left off was in the toilet finn said dryly and no hmmm so are relations friendly or strained publicly friendly realistically she hates my guts barlow grunted again it was good news he thought because he was fond of the boy it was bad news because it meant he might not be able to use him making up his mind he shifted on the table wrapping the sheet around him and dismissing both masseuses ive got a problem finn a nasty little rumor that came buzzing in my ear a couple of days ago finn pushed himself up at any other time he would have made a crack about two grown men having an intense conversation while they were half naked and smelling of ginseng you want it to buzz in my ear and stop there all right word is angela perkins is pulling up stakes in chicago and with cbc and delacort i havent caught wind of that considering finn pushed the hair away from his face like any reporter he hated getting news secondhand even if the news was only a rumor look its contract time right she probably started the hum herself to get the brass to offer another truckload of money no fact is shes keeping it quiet real quiet what i hear is that her agents making negotiating noises but they dont ring true the leak came from starmedia if she leaves finn itll be a big hole thats the entertainment divisions problem their problems our problem you know that fuck well said i only mention it because i thought if you and angela were still were not finn frowned ill see what i can find out when i get back appreciate it now lets get some lunch well talk about news magazines im not doing a news magazine it was an old argument one they continued with perfect amiability as they trailed sheets into the locker room hawaii sounds perfect deanna said into the phone im glad you think so how about the second week in june pleased with the idea deanna poured a mug of coffee she carried it and her portable phone to the table where shed set up her laptop ill put in for it i havent taken any time since i started at the station so i dont think itll be a problem why dont i stop by we can talk about it look at some brochures she closed her eyes knowing she couldnt ignore the insistent blip on her computer screen i wish we could ive got work i had something come in at the last minute that held me up she didnt mention the hour shed spent punching up angelas speech pulling the anchor desk this weekends really tied me up how about brunch on sunday say about ten i could meet you at the drake we can look over the brochures and decide on what suits us perfect ill be looking forward to it so will i im sorry about tonight dont be ive got some work myself good night deanna good night marshall hung up mozart was playing on the stereo a quiet fire was burning in the hearth and the scent of lemon oil and fragrant smoke hung in the air after polishing off his brandy he walked up the stairs to his bedroom there with the sound of violins lilting through the recessed speakers he stripped out of his tailored suit beneath he wore silk it was a small affectation he liked soft expensive things he liked admittedly and without shame women his wife had often joked about it he remembered had even appreciated his admiration for the opposite sex until of course shed found him intimately admiring young annie gilby he winced at the memory of his wife arriving home a full day early from a business trip the look on her face when shed walked into the bedroom and discovered him making loud boisterous love to annie it had been a horrible mistake a tragic one his argument perfectly justified that his wifes preoccupation with her career and her lack of occupation in their bedroom had made him easy game had fallen on deaf ears it hadnt mattered to her that the girl had utterly and deliberately seduced him had played on his weaknesses his frustrations there had been other women yes but they had been momentary diversions discreet sexual releases when his wife was away or involved with her own decorating business and not worth mentioning he would never have hurt patricia marshall assured himself now as he chose dark slacks and a shirt he had loved her completely and he missed her miserably he was a man who needed to be married who needed a woman to talk to to share his life and home with a bright intelligent woman like patricia true he needed the stimulation of beauty that wasnt a flaw patricia had been beautiful and ambitious she had a sense of style and taste that was faultless in short shed been perfect for him except for her inability to understand a few very human flaws when she had discovered them shed been unforgiving as stone and he had lost her though he still missed her he understood life continued now he had found someone else deanna was beautiful ambitious intelligent she was as perfect a companion as he could want and he wanted her had wanted her since he had first seen her face on the television screen now she was more than an image she was reality he was going to be very careful with her sexually she was a bit repressed but he could be patient the idea of taking her away from chicago away from the pressures and distractions had been brilliant once she was relaxed secure she would belong to him until that time he would harness his needs his frustrations but he hoped it wouldnt be much longer chapter eight maui fran said over a mouthful of cheeseburger for the weekend thats so undeanna is it deanna paused over her own meal and considered maybe it is and im going to enjoy every minute of it were getting a suite in a hotel right on the beach where the brochure says you can see whales binoculars she said suddenly and dug in her purse for a pad i need a good pair fran craned her neck and read the neat list deanna had started now thats our deanna are you going to eat all those fries no help yourself already engrossed in her list deanna pushed her plate toward fran a weekend in hawaii sounds pretty serious fran doused the fries with ketchup is it it could be she glanced up again and the bloom in her cheeks spoke volumes i really think it could be i feel comfortable with marshall fran grimaced sweet pea you feel comfortable with an old pair of bunny slippers not that kind of comfortable i can relax around him i know hes not going to pressure me so that i can just let things happen when it feels right i can talk to him about anything the words came quickly too quickly fran mused if she knew deanna and she did shed have bet a months pay her best friend was going out of her way to convince herself he has this incredible sense of fairness deanna continued were interested in so many of the same things and hes romantic i didnt realize how wonderful it would be to have someone send me flowers and arrange candlelight dinners thats because you were always looking for the trapdoor yeah deanna let out a little breath closed her notebook im going to tell him about jamie thomas in an automatic gesture of support fran reached out and covered deannas hand with hers good that means you trust him i do her eyes darkened with determination and i want a normal healthy relationship with a man by god im going to have one i wont be able to do that until i tell him what happened to me hes coming over for dinner tomorrow fran abandoned the fries to fold her arms on the table between them if you need any moral support you only have to call ill be fine ive got to get back she said after a glance at her watch ive got to do a news break at eightthirty youve got the ten oclock tonight too dont you fran stuffed a last fry in her mouth richard and ill watch you while were all snuggled up in bed ill make sure hes naked thanks deanna counted out bills for the tab thatll give me a nice visual while im reading the news it was nearly midnight when deanna climbed into bed as always she checked her alarm then made certain there was a pencil and pad on the nightstand beside the phone the phone rang just as she was reaching for the light instinctively she picked up the receiver with one hand the pencil with the other reynolds you were wonderful tonight the flutter of pleasure made her smile as she eased back against the pillows marshall thanks i just wanted you to know i was watching its the next best thing to being with you its nice to know it felt glorious snuggling back in bed pleasantly sleepy with the voice of the man she thought she might love in her ear ive been thinking about hawaii all day so have i and about you he had her taped image freezeframed on his set quietly arousing himself with her image and her voice im very indebted to angela perkins for bringing us together me too sleep well marshall i will good night deanna warm and content deanna replaced the receiver hugging herself she laughed and indulged in a dreamy fantasy she and marshall walking along the beach while the sun dripped color into the water soft breezes soft words the gentle tug low in her stomach pleased her normal she told herself certainly that proved she was a normal woman with normal needs she was ready to take the next step toward fulfilling them she was eager to only seconds after she switched off the lamp and snuggled down the phone rang again chuckling to herself she lifted the receiver in the dark hi she murmured did you forget something there was only echoing silence in response marshall her sleepy voice shifted into puzzlement hello whos there then into unease as the dull silence continued hello is anyone there the quiet click brought on a quick shudder wrong number deanna assured herself as she hung up but she was cold and it was a long time before she warmed again and slept someone else lay awake in the dark the ghostly light from the television screen was the only relief deanna smiled there looking out into the room looking directly into the eyes of her audience of one her voice so smooth so sweet so seductive played over and over on the recorder as it was rewound im deanna reynolds good night im deanna reynolds good night im deanna reynolds good night good night the answering whisper was soft no more than a purr of pleasure angela had planned every detail meticulously standing in the center of her office she turned a slow circle everything was ready there was a faint fragrance of jasmine in the air from the vase of flowers on the table by the love seat the television set for once was blank the quiet strains of chopin eased through the speakers of the stereo beeker had been very thorough in his report marshall pike preferred classical music romantic settings and a woman with style she wore the same trim designer suit shed worn for that mornings taping but shed removed the blouse the jacket fit with a snug v and there was a cunning hint of black lace teasing the cleavage at precisely eleven oclock she answered the buzzer on her desk yes cassie dr pike is here miss perkins ah good a feline smile crossed her face as she walked toward the office door she liked a man to be prompt marshall she held out both hands to grip his easing forward and tilting her head to offer her cheek and to give him an interesting glimpse of black lace i really appreciate your making time for me today you said it was important oh and it is cassie would you mind taking those letters right to the post office then you can go ahead and take your lunch i wont need you back here until one turning angela led marshall into her office being certain to leave the door open a few inches what can i get you marshall something cold she trailed a fingertip down her jacket something hot im fine well then lets sit down she took his hand again steered him toward the love seat its awfully good to see you again its good to see you too puzzled he watched her settle back her skirt riding up on her thigh as she crossed her legs you know how pleased i am with the help youve given me on the show but i asked you here today to discuss something more personal oh youve been seeing a lot of deanna he relaxed and struggled to keep his eyes from roaming down from her face yes i have in fact ive been meaning to call you and thank you for indirectly bringing us together im very fond of her as im sure you are she added laying a hand lightly on his thigh all that energy that youthful enthusiasm a beautiful girl yes she is and so sweet wholesome really angelas fingers stroked lightly along his leg not your usual type i dont know what you mean youre a man whos attracted to experience to a certain sophistication except in one illuminating case he stiffened drew back i dont know what youre talking about yes you do her voice remained pleasant easy but her eyes had sharpened like two blue blades you see i know all about you marshall i know about your foolish slip with one annie gilby age sixteen and all about your previous i should say predeanna arrangement with a certain woman who lives on lake shore in fact i made it my business to know everything there is to know about you youve had me followed he struggled for outrage but panic had already outdistanced everything else she could ruin him with one careless announcement on her show what right do you have to pry into my personal life none at all thats what makes it so exciting and it is exciting she toyed with the top button of her jacket when his eyes flicked down to the movement she glanced at the antique clock behind him eleventen she thought coolheaded coldblooded perfect if you think you can use some sort of blackmail to ruin my relationship with deanna it isnt going to happen his palms were wet from fear and from a terrible arousal he would resist it he had to resist it shes not a child shell understand she may or she may not but i do with her eyes on his angela flicked open the first button on her jacket i understand i sent my secretary away marshall her voice lowered thickened so i could be alone with you why do you think i went to all the trouble to find out about you she released the second button toyed with the third and last he wasnt sure he could speak when he forced the words out they were like grains of sand in his throat what kind of game is this angela any kind you want she shot forward quick as a snake and caught his bottom lip between her teeth i want you she whispered ive wanted you for a long time straddling him she pressed his face against the breasts that strained against the hint of black lace you want me dont you she felt his mouth open grope blindly for flesh there was a flash razoredged and hot that was power shed won dont you she demanded gripping his head in both hands yes he was already dragging her skirt up to her waist deanna waited impatiently for the elevator to climb to sixteen she really didnt have time to keep the appointment with angela but she was obligated by that invincible combination of manners and affection she glanced at her watch again as people shuffled on and off on seven angela was going to be upset she mused and there was no preventing it deanna hoped the dozen roses shed brought along would soften the refusal she owed angela much more than a few flowers she thought so many people didnt see what a generous and giving person angela perkins was or how vulnerable all they saw was the power the ambition the need for perfection if angela had been a man those traits would have been celebrated but because she was a woman they were considered flaws as she stepped off the elevator on sixteen deanna promised herself that she would follow angelas example and the hell with the critics hi simon dee he moved past her double time then stopped short and rushed back its not her birthday tell me its not her birthday what oh seeing the horror on his face as he stared at the armload of flowers she laughed no these are a thankyou gift he let out a sigh pressing his fingers to his eyes thank god shed have killed me if id forgotten she was already chewing off heads this morning because her flight was delayed getting in last night deannas friendly smile faded im sure she was just tired simon rolled his eyes right right and who wouldnt be i get jetlagged on the el to show his complete sympathy with his bosss mood swings he sniffed deeply at the flowers well those should brighten her mood i hope so deanna continued down the corridor wondering if angela was taking simon to new york if she wasnt taking lew just how much of her staff would be laid off simon the perennial bachelor and fussbudget might be a bit twitchy but he was loyal the twinge of guilt at knowing when he didnt that his career was on the line made her wince she found the outer office deserted puzzled she looked at her watch again cassie must have had an early errand with a shrug she approached angelas door she heard the music first quiet lovely the fact that the door was open several inches was rare deanna knew that angela was obsessive about keeping it firmly shut whether she was in or out shrugging she crossed over knocked lightly she heard other sounds now not as quiet not as lovely as the music she knocked again easing the door open wider angela the name stuck in her throat as she saw the two forms wrestling on the love seat she would have stepped back immediately with embarrassment flaming in her cheeks but she recognized the man and the heat drained away into cold shock marshalls hands were on angelas breasts his face buried in the valley between them even as she watched those hands ones shed admired for their elegance slid down to tug at the stylish linen skirt and as he did angela turned her head slowly even while her body arched forward her eyes met deannas even in her haze of shock deanna saw the quick smile the cagey delight before the distress clicked in oh my god angela shoved against marshalls shoulder deanna her voice held the horror she couldnt quite bring to her eyes he turned his head his eyes dark and glassy fixed on deannas all movement froze hideously as if a switch had freezeframed them deanna broke the tableau with a strangled cry she turned and ran trampling the roses shed dropped at her feet her breath was heaving by the time she reached the elevator there was pain a terrible pain radiating out from her chest she stabbed the down button again and again driven she whirled away and ran for the stairs she couldnt stand still couldnt think she stumbled down saving herself from a fall by instinct rather than design knowing only that she had to get away she plunged down floor after floor her sobbing breaths echoing behind her at street level she rammed blindly against the door she battered against it weeping until she found the control to depress the handle shoving through she ran straight into finn hey amusement came and went in a heartbeat the moment he saw her face his laughter fled she was pale as a sheet her eyes wild and wet are you hurt he gripped her by the shoulders drawing her out into the sunlight what happened let me go she twisted shoving against him goddamn it leave me alone i dont think so instinctively he wrapped his arms around her okay baby ill just hold on and you can cut loose he rocked stroking her hair while she wept against his shoulder she didnt hold back but let all the shock and hurt pour out with the tears the surging pressure in her chest eased with them like a swelling soothed with cool water when he sensed her calming finn shifted his hold with his arm around her shoulders he led her across the lot to a low stone wall lets sit he dragged a handkerchief out of his pocket and pressed it into her hands though he hated a womans tears escaping deannas would brand him as the worst sort of coward you can pull yourself together and tell uncle finn all about it go to hell she muttered and blew her nose thats a good start gently he brushed the hair away from her damp cheeks what happened deanna she looked away from him there was too much concern too much willingness to understand in his eyes i just found out im an idiot that i have no sense of judgment and that no one can be trusted sounds like a resume for a television news anchor when she didnt smile he took her hand i havent got any whiskey on me and i gave up smoking last year the best i can offer you is a shoulder i seem to have used that already i have another one instead of leaning on it she sat up straighter squeezed her eyes tight a moment maybe she was an idiot but she still had pride i just walked in on a woman i considered a friend and a man i was considering as a lover thats a big one and he didnt have any clever words to smooth it over the psychologist marshall yes her lips trembled with an effort she firmed them the tears shed shed didnt shame her but they were over she meant to keep it that way and angela in her office muttering an oath he glanced up to the windows on the sixteenth floor i dont suppose you could have mistaken the situation her laugh was as dry as dust im a trained observer when i see two people one half naked pawing each other i know what theyre up to i dont need corroboration to make the report i guess not he was silent a moment the breeze whispered through the plot of grass behind them and waved through the bank of tulips that spelled out cbc in sunny yellow i could round up a crew finn considered go up to sixteen with a camera lights and a mike and make his life a living hell this time her laugh was less strained interview him at the scene of the crime its a nice offer no really id enjoy it the more he thought about it the more he believed it was the perfect solution dr pike as a respected family counselor how do you explain being caught with your pants down in a place of business before noon was this a professional call a new form of therapy youd like to share with the public they werent down yet she said with a sigh i interrupted them and while your offers tempting id just as soon handle the situation myself she pushed the used handkerchief back in his hand goddamn it they made a fool out of me springing off the wall deanna wrapped her arms tightly around her body she planned it i dont know why i dont even know how but she planned it i saw it in her eyes this news didnt surprise him nothing about angela did have you pissed her off lately no she lifted her hand to push back her hair and then stopped new york she thought and nearly laughed again maybe i did she said softly and this is some twisted form of payback for what she sees as ingratitude furious now deanna turned back toward him she knew how i felt about him and she used it and what timing less than an hour before i have to go on she looked at her watch then covered her face with her hands oh god ive only got twenty minutes take it easy ill go down and tell benny youre sick theyll get a sub for one indulgent moment she considered his offer then she remembered angelas crafty satisfied smile no shed enjoy that too much i can do my job finn studied her her face was tracked with tears and her eyes were puffy and redrimmed but she was determined they grow them tough in kansas he said with approval her chin rose another notch damn right they do lets get you into makeup she said nothing until theyd crossed the lot walked through the door thanks youre welcome got any visine she grimaced as they started up the steps that bad oh its worse he kept their conversation light as he steered her into makeup he brought her ice for her eyes water for her throat then stayed to chat while she concealed the worst of the damage with cosmetics but he was thinking and his thoughts were anything but light anything but kind thats not half bad he commented try a little more blusher he was right deanna stroked the brush over her cheek and saw marshalls reflection in the mirror her hand trembled once before she set the brush aside deanna ive been looking for you oh she felt finn coil beside her like a big mean cat about to spring and laid a hand on his arm with a jolt she realized the slightest signal from her would have him tearing in it wasnt as unattractive an image as she wanted to think ive been right here she said coolly i have a show to do i know i his eyes clung to hers soft and brown and pleading ill wait theres no need for that odd she thought she felt powerful invincible there seemed to be no relation between the woman she was at this moment and the one who had run sobbing from angelas office i have a couple minutes to spare calmly she leaned back against the counter and smiled at finn there was blood in her eye that had nothing to do with tears would you mind leaving us alone sure he reached over and tipped her chin up another inch with his fingertip thats a good look for you kansas with a last iceedged stare at marshall he strolled out was it necessary to bring him into our private business deanna cut him off with a look can you really have the gall to criticize me at a time like this no marshalls shoulders drooped no of course not youre right its just that i find this difficult and embarrassing enough without the gossip spreading through the newsroom finn has more interesting things to discuss than your sex life marshall i promise you now if you have something to say youd better say it i only have a few minutes deanna he stepped forward and would have reached for her but the flash in her eyes warned him i have no excuse for what happened or nearly happened but i want you to know theres nothing between me and angela it was an impulse he continued speaking quickly when deanna remained silent purely physical and meaningless it had nothing to do with what i feel for you im sure it didnt she said after a moment and i believe you i believe it was impulsive meaningless sex relief flooded through him he hadnt lost her his eyes brightened as he reached out to her i knew youd understand i knew the minute i saw you that you were a woman generous enough to accept me to understand me thats why i knew we were meant to be together rigid as stone she stared up at him take your hands off me she said quietly right now deanna when he only tightened his hold she fought back a bubble of panic a quick ugly sensory memory and shoved i said now free she stepped back and took a deep steadying breath i said i believed you marshall and i do what you did with angela had nothing to do with your feelings for me however it had everything to do with mine for you i trusted you and you betrayed that trust that makes it impossible for us to part friends so well just part youre hurt now a muscle twitched in his cheek so youre not being reasonable it was like patricia he thought so much like patricia yes im hurt she agreed but im being very reasonable a ghost of a smile flitted around her mouth as insulting as a slap i make a habit out of being reasonable im not calling you any of the names that occur to me you see this as my fault as a weakness confident in his skills as a mediator he shifted gears what you havent yet been able to see is your part in it your responsibility im sure youll agree that no successful relationship is the result of one persons efforts all the weeks weve been together ive been patient waiting for you to allow our relationship to move to the natural and very human phase of physical pleasure she didnt think he could shock her again but shed been wrong youre saying because i wouldnt go to bed with you i forced you to turn to angela youre not seeing the grays deanna he said patiently i respected your wishes your need to progress slowly at the same time its necessary for me to satisfy my own needs angela was certainly a mistake she nodded slowly i see im glad we straightened this out marshall before it went any further now im going to very reasonably tell you to go to hell she started out her eyes going to smoke when he blocked the doorway we havent finished deanna ive finished and thats all that counts we both made a mistake marshall a big one now get out of my way and stay out of it before i make another one and embarrass us both by tearing the skin off your face stiffly he stepped aside ill be ready to discuss this when youve calmed down oh im calm she muttered as she headed for the studio im dead calm you bastard she shoved through the studio doors strode across the floor and took her place behind the anchor desk finn watched her through the first break once he was satisfied she was under control he slipped out and walked to the elevator over a celebratory glass of champagne angela watched the noon report in her office she didnt give a damn about the words or images but she was interested even fascinated by deanna the girl looked as cool and sweet as an icecream soda angela thought except for the eyes angela would have been bitterly disappointed if she hadnt seen the banked fury in deannas gaze direct hit she murmured delighted i win she thought again but couldnt prevent a twinge of admiration curled in the leather chair behind her desk she sipped and smiled and finally raised her glass in silent toast to deanna shes got style doesnt she finn said from the doorway to her credit angela didnt jolt she continued to sip and study the screen absolutely she could go a long way in the business with the right teacher is that the role youve carved out for yourself here finn crossed the room skirted the desk to stand behind angelas chair going to teach her your way angela my way works dee would be the first to tell you how generous ive been with her she scares you doesnt she finn lowered his hands to angelas shoulders holding her firm so that they both faced deannas image why should she because shes got more than style youve got plenty of that yourself shes got brains but you have those too and guts and drive but then she tops you angela because shes got class bredinthebone class his fingers dug in when she started to shift he couldnt know just how deeply hed hit the mark thats something youll never have you can wear your pearls and your thousanddollar suits it doesnt mean a damn because you cant wear class you cant buy it and you cant fake it he spun her chair around leaning over her so they were face to face and youll never have it so she scares the hell out of you and you had to find a way to show her who was on top did she come running to you finn she was shaken much more than she cared to admit but she lifted her glass and sipped delicately even though the drink now seemed a little more like a crutch was she shocked and devastated and crying out for comfort youre such a bitch angela you always liked that about me her eyes laughed over the rim of her glass then she shrugged the truth is im sorry she was hurt that way theres no denying that marshall wasnt right for her but i know she cared for him the simple fact was he was attracted to me and i to him because she wanted to believe her excuse she did her voice rang with sincerity things got out of hand and i blame myself entirely it was thoughtless the hell it was you dont take a breath without thinking it through she smiled again looking up under her lashes dont be jealous finn youre pathetic did you think this stunt was going to break her if she had loved him it would have pursing her lips she examined her nails so perhaps i did her a favor he laughed maybe you did at that you sure as hell did me one he turned back to her and grinned i want her and you just cleared the path he didnt have to dodge the glass she hurled it struck the window a full six inches from his head the crystal shattered delighted finn stuck his hands in his pockets your aim still stinks there was no laughter now nor any of the regret shed convinced herself she felt there was only rage do you think shell want you after she hears what i can tell her do you think shell listen to anything you say after this stunt there was reckless humor in his eyes you overshot your mark this time shes not going to come whimpering to you shes going to tough it out and shes going to get better and youre going to start looking over your shoulder do you think im worried about some fluffy little news reader she demanded all i have to do is make a phone call and shed be gone like that she snapped her fingers who do you thinks been keeping this station out of the basement for the last two years and where do you think itll go when i pull up stakes so you are leaving he nodded rocked back on his heels well congratulations and bon voyage thats right when the new season opens ill be in new york and angelas will be produced by my own company cbcs affiliates will come crawling to pay my price to air my show within two years ill be the most powerful woman in television you might pull it off he agreed for a while ill still be on top when youre scrounging around for a twominute spot on the late news she was trembling now her temper pricked and pecked by needles of insecurity people want me they admire me they respect me i certainly did both finn and angela turned to the doorway where deanna stood pale under her camera makeup she noted with no surprise that angela had salvaged most of the rose blooms and had set them prominently on her desk deanna tears swimming in her eyes angela started across the room i dont know how i can ever apologize please dont i think since its only the three of us here we can be honest i know you planned the whole episode that you arranged to have me walk in just when i did how could you say such a thing i saw your face her voice hitched but she steadied herself she would not lose control i saw your face she repeated im not sure whether it was because you wanted to prove that i was wrong about marshall or if it was because i couldnt accept your offer maybe it was a combination of both hurt every bit as genuine as the pearls at her throat shuddered through angelas voice you should know me better yes i should have known you better but i wanted to believe in you i wanted to be flattered that you befriended me that you saw something in me so i didnt look past the surface s blinking at tears angela turned away youre going to toss our friendship aside because of a man no im tossing it aside because of me i wanted you to know that i gave you my time my help my affection whirling angela pounced no one turns me down then i guess im the first good luck in new york good copy deanna told herself as she walked out damn good copy dont forget to look over your shoulder finn said as he closed the door quietly behind him chapter nine angela trades windy city for big apple talk show queen to reign in new york multimilliondollar deal for chicagos favorite blonde the headlines gloated over the news even staunch vehicles like the chicago tribune the new york times the washington post carried the banner for one sunny day in june stories of angelas recordbreaking deal overshadowed the troubled economy and unrest in the middle east she was in her element with the graciousness of royalty she granted interviews welcomed a team from people into her home chatted with liz smith over the phone she had a quote for variety and agreed to a layout in mccalls finally through hard work blind ambition and sheer guts she had attained what shed always craved undivided attention she was canny enough to have nothing but the highest praise for cbc for delacort and for chicago she even worked up a few tears on entertainment tonight and her clipping service captured every word every inch of print that revolved around her then amidst the uproar she delivered the coup de grace she would be taking the last six weeks on her contract as vacation she knows how to turn the screws doesnt she fran rolled a pair of mismatched socks into a ball and tossed them into a laundry basket thats not the worst of it deanna paced the tiny living room of frans downtown apartment half her staff got pinkslipped the others have the choice of pulling up stakes and moving to new york or looking for a new job she hissed through her teeth there arent any damn jobs obviously you dont read the papers the administration says were not in a recession its all in our minds unamused deanna picked up a book of baby names and slapped it against her palm as she roamed the room i saw lew mcationeils face when he left the building yesterday god fran hes been with her almost six years and she cuts him loose without a thought fran chose another pair of socks one navy one black close enough she decided and bundled them together the heat made her purple tank top stick to her skin im sorry dee for all of them everybody in television knows the game usually stinks but im more concerned about you is marshall still calling he stopped leaving messages on my machine she shrugged i think he finally figured out i wasnt going to call back he still sends flowers with a bitter laugh she tossed the baby book back onto the coffee table can you believe it he really thinks if he blankets me in enough posies ill forget everything want to have a menarescum session richards playing golf so he cant be offended no thanks for the first time she focused on her friend fran you just rolled up a gray sock with a blue one i know it adds a little excitement to the mornings i gotta tell you dee richards getting staid you know saturday golf dates threepiece suits the house in the burbs were buying jesus we used to be rebels now were she shuddered lowered her voice mainstream laughing deanna sat crosslegged on the floor ill believe that when you buy a volvo and an espresso machine i almost bought one of those baby on board signs the other day i came to my senses just in time then youre okay i havent even asked how youre feeling fabulous really fran jabbed a loose pin back into her messy topknot all these women at work whove had kids look at me with scorn and envy they have all these horror stories about pregnancy morning sickness fainting water retention and i feel like rocky she lifted an arm flexed her muscle and managed to make a couple of freckles ripple like i could go the distance without breaking a sweat lips pursed she held up a checked argyle and a white sweat sock what do you think why be subtle for the next few minutes they worked silently folding laundry fran ive been thinking i wondered when youd get around to it i could practically see the idea hopping around in your brain it could be impractical deanna mused hell it could be impossible after i run it by you i want you to be completely honest all right fran shoved the laundry basket away with one bare foot shoot delacort angelas old syndicate is going to have a big hole in their lineup and in their revenue im sure they can fill it adequately enough but did you know delacorts ceo was angelas second husband sure loren bach aside from the occasional grisly mystery frans favorite reading was gossip rags and she wasnt ashamed of it if you wanted to know what celebrity was doing what with whom and where she was your girl they hooked up right after she ditched her first one the real estate tycoon anyway loren bach put a lot of money and muscle behind our girl made her a star and though there were a few rumors and some items in gossip columns to the contrary they supposedly parted amicably that much deanna had read knowing angela the way i do now i really doubt that frans eyebrows wiggled not only did she love gossip she loved dirty gossip best word was she cost him a cool two million in the settlement plus the house and furnishings so id make it four mil i wouldnt think bach would have too much residual affection for our heroine exactly and bach has a longstanding relationship with barlow james the president of cbcs news division deanna rubbed her nervous hands on her knees and mr james likes my work fran cocked her head her eyes bright as a birds so so ive got some money saved ive got some connections the idea had her heart jittering so that she pressed the heel of her hand against it as if to slow its pace she wanted this very much maybe too much enough she realized to skip several steps of her carefully calculated career plan i want to rent a studio put together a tape i want to pitch it to loren bach jesus fran leaned back against the cushions of the couch and goggled is this you talking i know how it sounds but ive thought it through bach moved angela from a small local show to a national hit he could do it again im hoping he wants to do it again not only for his company but personally i can put together a series of clips from deannas corner and my news reports i think i can get barlow james to back me and if i had a pilot something simple and slick i might have a shot she rose again too excited to sit the timings perfect the syndicates still reeling from angelas defection and they havent groomed a successor if i could convince them to give me a chance locally a handful of markets in the midwest i know i could make it work fran blew out a breath tapped her fingers on her flat belly its off the wall all right and i love it letting her head fall back she laughed at the ceiling its just screwy enough to fly ill make it fly deanna came back to crouch in front of fran and grip her hands especially if i have an experienced producer you can count on me but the cost of the studio the techs even a trimmeddown production staff its a lot to risk im willing to risk it richard and i have some put away no touched grateful deanna shook her head absolutely not not with my godchild on the way ill take your brain your back and your time but not your money after patting frans belly she stood again believe me the first three are more important okay so whats your format whats your topic wheres your audience i want something simple comfortable nothing issueoriented i want to do what i do best fran talk to people get them to talk to me we get a couple of deep cozy chairs god knows i need new furniture anyway keep it chummy intimate fun fran said if youre not going for the tears and angst go for the fun something the audience can get involved in deanna pulled at her earlobe i thought i might draw on some of the guests ive had on deannas corner sort of a womaninthearts thing its not bad but its tame and its lofty i dont think you want talking heads for a demo especially arty ones fran thought over the possibilities we did this makeover thing on woman talk last year went over big you mean a beforeandafter sort of thing yeah makeup hair its fun its satisfying but you know what id like she curled her legs up leaned forward a fashion show sort of thing whats new for summer whats hot whats now you get say marshall fields involved they get to show off some of the summer styles career stuff evening stuff casual wear eyes half closed deanna tried to visualize it right down to shoes and accessories with a fashion coordinator then we choose women out of the audience exactly real women no perfect bodies warming to the idea deanna reached for her purse and took out a notebook well have to have chosen them earlier so the fashion coordinator has time to find the right look the right outfit then they get say a hundreddollar gift certificate from the department store how to look like a million for a hundred dollars or less oh i like it fran rocked back i really like it ive got to get home deanna scrambled up make some calls weve got to move fast sweet pea ive never known you to move any other way it required eighteenhour days the bulk of deannas savings and a surplus of frustration because she was able to wrangle only a week off from her duties at cbc she did without sleep fueled on coffee and ambition she pushed the project forward meetings with the promotion people at marshall fields phone calls to union reps hours of searching for the right set accessories the first deannas hour might need to be produced on a shoestring but she didnt intend for it to look that way deanna oversaw every step and stage a loss or a victory she was determined that it carry her mark she bargained a set of chairs for onscreen credit she promised a few hours labor for a fulltime position if the pilot was picked up she begged and she borrowed fifty folding chairs from a local womens group floral arrangements equipment bodies on the morning of the taping the small studio she had rented was in chaos lighting technicians shouted orders and suggestions as they made lastminute adjustments the models were crammed into a bread boxsize dressing room jockeying for enough space to dress deannas mike shorted out and the florist delivered a funeral wreath instead of the baskets of summer blossoms in loving memory of milo deanna read the card and let loose with a quick hysterical laugh oh christ what else well fix it firmly and perhaps frantically in control fran gave her a brisk shove ive already sent richards nephew vinnie out for baskets well just pull the flowers out and toss them in itll look great she said desperately natural you bet weve got less than an hour she winced at the sound of a crashing folding chair if anyone actually shows up for the audience were going to look like idiots theyre going to show up fran attacked the gladiolas her hair stood out in corkscrew spikes like an electric halo and well be fine between the two of us we contacted every womens organization in cook county every one of the fifty tickets is spoken for we could have managed twice that if wed had a bigger studio dont worry youre worried thats a producers job go change do your hair pretend youre a star oh miss reynolds deanna the fashion consultant a petite perky woman with a permanent smile waved from offstage i want to kill her deanna said under her breath i want it bad stand in line fran suggested if shes changed her mind about the running order again i get first shot oh deanna yes karyn deanna fixed a smile on her face and turned what can i do for you i just have a teeny little problem the walking shorts in pumpkin yes deanna gritted her teeth why did the woman have to make a question out of every statement they just dont suit monica i dont know what i was thinking of do you think we could have someone dash over to the store and pick up the same outfit in eggplant before deanna could open her mouth fran eased forward ill tell you what karyn why dont you call the store have someone dash over here with the outfit oh karyn blinked i suppose i could couldnt i goodness id better hurry its almost show time whose idea was it to do a fashion show fran went back to dismantling the funeral wreath it must have been yours i would never have thought up something this complicated go put yourself together you wont make much of a fashion statement in sweats and with curlers in your hair right if im going to bomb i might as well look my best doing it deannas dressing room was the size of a closet but it boasted a sink a john and a mirror she grinned when she saw the big gold star fran had taped to the door maybe it was just a symbol she mused as she ran a fingertip over the foil but it was her symbol now she was going to have to earn it even if everything fell apart shed have three weeks worth of incredible memories the rush and thrill of putting the show together the fascination and strain of handling all the details and the knowledge the absolute certainty that this was exactly what she wanted to do with her life added to that astoundingly was the fact that so many people believed she could there had been tips from the floor director at cbc advice from benny and several others on the production end joe had agreed to head up the camera crew and had persuaded a few of his pals to help with the sound and lighting end jeff hyatt had arranged for editing and graphics now she would either earn their faith in her or blow it she was fastening on an earring and giving herself a final pep talk when the knock sounded on the door dont tell me she called out the eggplant wont do either and we have to dash back for tomato sorry finn pushed open the door i didnt bring any food oh she dropped the back of her earring and swore i thought you were in moscow i was he leaned against the jamb as she retrieved the little gold clasp and look what happens when i go away for a couple of weeks youre the top story in the newsroom gossip pool great her stomach sank as she fought the earring into place i must have been out of my mind to start this i imagine you were thinking clearly she looked fabulous he realized nervous but revved and ready you saw an open door and decided you could walk through first it feels like an open window on the top floor just land on your feet so whats your topic its a fashion show with audience participation his grin broke out dimples winking a fashion show that kind of fluff with your news background this isnt news she elbowed past him its entertainment i hope dont you have a war to cover or something not at the moment i figured id stick around awhile then i could head back to the newsroom with the scoop tell me he put a hand on her shoulder to slow her down are you doing this for yourself or to irritate angela both she pressed a fist to her stomach to try to quiet it but for me first okay he could feel the energy and the nerves vibrating against his palm he wondered what it would be like to tap it when they were alone and whats the next step she sent him a sidelong look hesitated off the record off the record he agreed a meeting with barlow james and if i manage to get his endorsement im going to bach so you dont intend to pitch in the minors not for long she let out a long breath a minute ago i was sure i was going to be sick she tossed her hair back now i feel great really great dee holding her headset in place fran rushed down the narrow corridor weve got a full house she snatched deannas hand and squeezed every seat the three women we picked out from the cook county historical society are psyched they cant wait to start then lets not okay fran looked sick okay she said again we can go whenever youre ready she left the warmup to fran standing just off set and listening to the laughter and applause the nerves were gone in their place was a burst of energy so huge she could barely hold still pushed by it she made her entrance settled into her chair under the lights in front of the camera the theme music compliments of vinnie richards nephew and an aspiring musician danced out off camera fran signaled for applause the red light shone steadily good morning im deanna reynolds she knew there was chaos off set the scrambling wardrobe changes the barking of orders the inevitable glitches but she felt completely in control chatting amiably with the perky detestable karyn then roaming the audience for comments as the models strutted their stuff she could almost forget it was a career move instead of a lark as she giggled with an audience member over a pair of polkadot micro shorts she looked like a woman entertaining friends finn mused as he loitered at the back of the studio it was an interesting angle because it wasnt an angle at all as a hard newsman with a natural disdain for fluff he couldnt say he was particularly interested in the topic but his tastes aside the audience was enchanted they cheered and applauded let out the occasional ooh and aah then balanced it with cheerful groans over an outfit that didnt hit the mark most of all they related to deanna and she to them in the way she slipped an arm around an audience member made eye contact or stepped back to let her guests take the spotlight shed walked through the door he decided and smiled to himself he slipped out thinking it wouldnt hurt to put in a call to barlow james and hold that door open a little wider angela swept through the lofty living room of her new penthouse apartment her heels clicked over parquet floors muffled on carpet clicked over tile as she stalked from airy window seat to gleaming breakfront as she paced she smoked in quick ragged jerks struggling with temper fighting for control all right lew calmer she stopped beside a pedestal table stabbing out the cigarette in a crystal ashtray and tainting the scent of roses with smoke tell me why you think id be interested in some little homemade tape of a secondrate newsreader lew shifted uncomfortably on the velvet settee i thought youd want to know he heard the whine in his own voice and lowered his eyes he detested what he was doing crawling bellyrolling for scraps but he had two kids in college a highdollar mortgage and the threat of unemployment urging him on she rented a studio hired techs called in favors she got some time off from the newsroom and put together a fiftyminute show plus an audition tape of some of her old stuff lew tried to ignore the ulcer burning in his gut i hear its pretty good pretty good angelas sneer was as sharp as a scalpel why would i have any interest in pretty good why would anyone amateurs try to push their way into the market all the time they dont worry me i know i mean theres talk around the job how the two of you had words oh she smiled frostily did you fly all the way from chicago to feed me the latest cbc gossip lew not that i dont appreciate it but it seems a little extreme i figured he took a steadying breath ran a hand through his thinning hair i know you offered deanna my job angela really did she tell you that no whatever pride he had left surfaced he met her eyes squarely but it leaked just like it leaked that she turned you down he saw the familiar flash in her eyes and i know he hurried on after working with you for so many years i know you wouldnt like to see her benefit from your generosity how could she by turning it into a matter of loyalty to the station by soliciting barlow james he had her interest now to conceal it she turned flipping open an enamel box and taking out a cigarette her eyes flicked over toward the bar where champagne was always chilling frightened by the depth of longing for one small swallow she moistened her lips and looked away again why should barlow get involved he likes her work hes made a point of calling the station a few times to say so and when he came to visit the chicago bureau last week he made time for a meeting with her angela snapped on her lighter word is he took a look at the tape he liked it so he wants to flatter one of his young female reporters angela tossed her head back but her throat tightened against the smoke just one swallow she thought one cool frothy sip she sent the tape to loren bach very slowly angela lowered the cigarette and left it to smolder in the ashtray why that little bitch she said softly does she really think she can begin to compete with me i dont know if shes aiming that high yet he let that idea simmer i do know that some of the midwest affiliates are concerned about the cost of your new show they might be willing to plug into something cheaper and closer to home then let them ill bury whatever they put up against me giving a bark of a laugh she strode over to survey her view of new york she had everything shed wanted needed at last at long last she was the queen overlooking her subjects from her high impregnable tower no one could touch her now certainly not deanna im on top here lew and im damn well going to stay there whatever it takes i can use my connections find out what loren bach decides thats fine lew she murmured staring over the tops of the trees of central park you do that but i want my job back his voice quavered with emotion with selfdisgust im fiftyfour years old angela at my age and the way things are out there right now i cant afford to be sending out resumes i want a firm twoyear contract by that time both my kidsll be out of college i can sell the house in chicago barbara and i can buy a smaller one out here we dont need the room now i just need a couple of years to make sure i have something to fall back on thats not too much to ask youve certainly thought this through angela sat on the window seat lifting her arms and laying them atop the flowered cushion her throat had opened again all on its own that pleased her she didnt need a drink when she had the taste of power ive done good work for you he reminded her i can still do good work plus i have plenty of contacts back in chicago people wholl pass on inside information if theres a need for it i cant see that there will be but she smiled to herself considering i dont like to ignore possibilities and i always reward loyalty she studied him a drone she decided one who would work tirelessly and one who was afraid enough to bury ethics under necessity ill tell you what lew i cant offer you executive producer that slots already filled she watched him pale assistant producer i know that technically its a demotion but we dont have to look at it that way her smile was bolstering as easily as a child she forgot her earlier disgust with him and her careless betrayal now once again they were teammates ive always depended on you and im glad i can continue to do so its a negligible cut in salary and it is new york that makes up for a lot doesnt it she beamed at him pleased with her own generosity and to show you how much i value you ill want you on board for the first special well have legal draw up a contract make it official in the meantime she rose crossed to him to take his hand between both of hers in the warm affectionate gesture of old friends you go back and tidy up your affairs in chicago ill have my real estate agent look for a cozy little place for you and barbara maybe brooklyn heights she rose on her toes to kiss his cheek and you keep your ears open wont you dear sure angela he said dully whatever you say chapter ten loren bachs office capped the lofty silver tower that was home for delacorts chicago base its glass walls offered a view that stretched beyond the monopoly board of downtown on a clear day he could see into misted plains of michigan loren liked to say he could stand guard over hundreds of the stations that carried delacorts programming and thousands of homes that watched the suite of offices reflected his personality its main area was a streamlined masculine room designed for serious work the deep green walls and dark walnut trim were pleasant to the eye an uncluttered backdrop for the sleek modern furnishings and recessed television screens he knew that it was sometimes necessary to entertain in an office as well as do business as a concession and a convenience there was a semicircular sofa in burgundy leather a pair of padded chrome chairs and a wide smokedglass table the contents of a fully stocked refrigerator catered to his addiction to classic coke one of his walls was lined with photographs of himself with celebrities stars whose sitcoms and dramas had moved into syndication politicians running for office network bigwigs the one telling omission was angela perkins adjoining the office was a washroom in dramatic black and white complete with a whirlpool and sauna beyond that was a smaller room that held a hollywood bed a bigscreen tv and a closet loren had never broken the habit of his lean years and continued to work long hours often catching a few hours sleep and a change of clothing right in the workplace but his sanctuary was an area that had been converted from office space it was cluttered with colorful arcade games where he could save worlds or video damsels in distress electronic pinball machines that whirled with light and sound a talking coke machine every morning he allowed an hour to indulge himself with the bells and whistles and often challenged network executives to beat his top scores no one did loren bach was a video wizard and the love affair had begun in childhood in the bowling alleys his father had owned loren had never had any interest in tenpins but hed had an interest in business and in the flash of the silver ball in his twenties with his degree from mit still hot hed expanded the family business into arcades then hed begun to dabble in the king of video television thirty years later his work was his play and his play was his work though he had allowed a few decorative touches in the office area a zorach sculpture a gris collage the core of the room was the desk so it was more of a console than a traditional desk loren had designed it himself he enjoyed the fantasy of sitting in a cockpit controlling destinies simple and functional its base was fitted with dozens of cubbyholes rather than drawers its work surface was wide and curved so that when loren sat behind it he was surrounded by phones computer keyboards monitors an adept hacker loren could summon up any desired information skillfully and swiftly from advertising rates for any of delacorts or its competitors programs to the current exchange rate of dollar to yen as a hobby he designed and programmed computer games for a subsidiary of his syndicates at fiftytwo he had the quiet aesthetic looks of a monk with a long bony face and a thin build his mind was as sharp as a scalpel seated behind his desk he tapped a button on his remote one of the four television screens blinked on eyes mild and thoughtful he sipped from a sixteenounce bottle of coke and watched deanna reynolds he would have viewed the tape without the call from barlow james loren took at least a cursory study of anything that crossed his desk but it was doubtful that he would have slotted time for it so quickly without the endorsement attractive he said into his minirecorder in a voice as soft and cool as morning snow good throat excellent camera presence energy and enthusiasm sexy but nonthreatening relates well to audience scripted questions dont appear scripted who does her writing lets find out production values need improvement particularly the lighting he watched the full fifty minutes reversing the tape occasionally freezeframing all the while making his brief comments into the recorder he took another long sip from the bottle and he was smiling hed lifted angela from minor local celebrity into a national phenomenon and he could do it again with one hand he froze deannas face on the screen with the other he punched his intercom shelly contact deanna reynolds at cbc chicago news division set up an appointment id like to have her come in as soon as possible deanna was used to worrying about her appearance working in front of the camera meant that part of the job dealt with looking good she would often discard a perfectly lovely suit that appealed to her because the cut or the color wasnt quite right for tv but she couldnt remember agonizing over the image she projected more than she did when preparing to meet loren bach she continued to secondguess herself as she sat in the reception area outside his office the navy suit shed chosen was too severe leaving her hair down was too frivolous she should have worn bolder jewelry or worn none at all it helped somehow to focus on clothes and hairstyles twinkie habits she knew but it meant she didnt obsess about what this meeting could mean to her future everything she thought as her stomach clutched or nothing mr bach will see you now deanna only nodded her throat tightened up like a vise she was afraid any word that fought its way free would come out as a squeak she stepped through the doors the receptionist opened and into loren bachs office he was behind his desk a slopedshouldered skinny man with a face that reminded deanna of an apostle shed seen photographs and television clips and had thought hed be bigger somehow stupid she thought she of all people knew how different a media image could be from reality ms reynolds he rose extending a hand over the curved lucite its nice to meet you thank you his grip was firm friendly and brief i appreciate your taking the time times my business want a coke i he was already up and striding across the room to a fullsized builtin refrigerator sure thanks your tape was interesting with his back to her loren popped the caps on two bottles a little rough on some of the production values but interesting interesting what did that mean smiling stiffly deanna accepted the bottle he handed her im glad you think so we didnt have a great deal of time to put it together you didnt think it necessary to take the time no i didnt think i had the time i see loren sat behind his desk again took a long swig from the bottle his hands were white and spidery the long thin fingers rarely still why not deanna followed his lead and drank because there are plenty of others whod like to slip into angelas slot at least locally i felt it was important to get out of the gate quickly he was more interested in how shed do coming down the stretch just what is it youd like to do with deannas hour entertain and inform too glib she thought immediately slow down dee she warned herself honestys fine but put a little thought into it mr bach ive wanted to work in television since i was a child since im not an actress i concentrated on journalism im a good reporter but in the last couple of years ive realized that doing the news doesnt really satisfy my ambitions i like to talk to people i like to listen to them and im good at both it takes more than conversational skills to carry an hour show it takes a knowledge of how television works how it communicates how intimate and how powerful it can be and making the subject forget while the lights on that he or she is talking to anyone but me thats my strong point she shifted her body edging forward i did some summerinterning at a local station in topeka while i was in high school and i interned for four years at a station in new haven during college i worked as a news writer in kansas city before my first onair job technically ive been working in television for ten years im aware of that he was aware of every detail of her professional life but he preferred getting his own impressions face to face he appreciated the fact that she kept her eyes and her voice level he remembered his first meeting with angela all those sexual spikes that manic energy that overpowering femininity deanna reynolds was a different matter altogether not weaker he mused certainly not less potent simply different tell me other than fashion shows what sort of topics did you plan to do id like to concentrate on personal issues rather than frontpage ones and id like to avoid shock television no redheaded lesbians and the men who love them she relaxed enough to smile no ill leave those to someone else my idea is to balance shows like the demo with more serious ones but to keep it very personal involving the audiencestudio and the home audience topics like stepfamilies sexual harassment in the workplace how men and women cope with middleage dating issues that target in on what the average viewer might be experiencing and you see yourself as a spokesperson for the average viewer she smiled again here at least she could be confident i am the average viewer im certainly going to watch a special on pbs that interests me but im more than happy to pull up a bar stool with the gang at cheers i share my first cup of coffee in the morning with the chicago tribune and kirk brooks on wake up call and unless i have an early call i go to bed with the tonight show unless arsenio looks better that night now she grinned and sipped again and im not ashamed of it loren laughed then drained his coke shed very nearly described his own viewing habits im told you moonlighted for angela not moonlighting exactly it wasnt as structured or formal as that and i was never on her payroll it was more of an apprenticeship deanna screened the emotion from her voice i learned quite a bit i imagine you did after a moment loren steepled his hands its no secret that delacort is unhappy about losing angelas and anyone involved in the business would know that we dont wish her well his eyes were dark as onyx against his byronically pale skin yes an apostle deanna thought again but not one who would have gone cheerfully to the roman lions however he continued given her track record she should continue to dominate the market were not ready to go head to head with her nationally with another talkshow format youll counterprogram deanna said making loren stop raise a brow go against her with game shows high rated reruns soaps depending on the demographics that would be the idea i had considered spottesting a talkshow format in a handful of cbc affiliates i only need a handful she said evenly but gripped the softdrink bottle with both hands to hold it steady sink or swim she decided to start perhaps it was personal loren mused but what of it if he could use deanna reynolds to take a small slice out of angela he could afford the cost if the project failed he would write it off as experience but if he could make it work if he could make deanna work the satisfaction would be worth more much more than advertising revenue do you have an agent ms reynolds no get one his dark mild eyes sharpened id like to welcome you to delacort tell me again fran insisted a sixmonth contract no matter how many times she said it aloud the words still echoed gleefully in deannas ears well tape right here at cbc one show a day five days a week still dazed even after two weeks of negotiations she wandered angelas office all that was left were the pastel walls and carpet and the steely view of chicago ill be able to use this office and two others in accordance with cbcs end of the deal during the probationary period well be carried by ten affiliates in the midwest live in chicago dayton and indianapolis we have six weeks to put it together before we premiere in august youre really doing it with a half laugh deanna turned back she wasnt smiling like fran but her eyes were glowing im really doing it she took a deep breath grateful that none of angelas signature scent remained in the air my agent said the money theyre paying me is a slap in the face now she grinned i told him to turn the other cheek an agent fran shook her head and sent her cowbell earrings dancing youve got an agent deanna turned toward the window and grinned out at chicago shed chosen a small local firm one that could focus on her needs her goals ive got an agent she agreed and a syndicate at least for six months i hope ive got a producer sweet pea you know before you say anything let me finish deanna turned back behind her the spears and towers of the city shot up into the dull gray sky its a risk fran a big one if things dont work out we could be out on our butts in a few months youve got a solid job at woman talk and a baby on the way i dont want you to jeopardize that for friendship okay i wont fran shrugged and because there was no place to sit settled on the floor grateful for the give of elastic over her expanding waist ill do it for ego fran myers executive producer has a nice ring she circled her knees with her arms when do we start yesterday laughing deanna sat beside her slung an arm over her shoulders we need staff i might be able to lure in some of angelas who got pinkslipped or didnt want to relocate we need story ideas and people to research them the budget i have to work with is slim so well have to keep it simple she stared at the bare pastel walls next contract itll be a hell of a lot bigger the first thing you need is a couple of chairs a desk and a phone as producer ill see what i can beg borrow or steal she scrambled to her feet but first i have to go tender my resignation deanna caught her hand youre sure damn right i already discussed the possibility with richard we looked at it this way if things go bellyup in six months id be ready for maternity leave anyway she patted her stomach and grinned ill call you she paused at the doorway oh one more thing lets paint these damn walls alone deanna pulled her knees up to her chest and lowered her head it was all happening so fast all the meetings the negotiations the paperwork she didnt mind the long hours she thrived on them and the realization of an ambition brought with it a burst of energy that was all but manic but beneath the excitement was a small very cold ball of terror it was all going in the right direction once she adjusted to the new pace shed get her bearings and if she failed she would simply go back a few steps and start again but she wouldnt regret ms reynolds thoughts scattering deanna looked up and saw angelas secretary in the doorway cassie with a rueful smile she glanced around things look a little different these days yeah cassies own smile came and went i was just getting some things out of the outer office i thought i should let you know thats all right it wont be my territory officially until next week she rose and smoothed down her skirt i heard youd decided not to make the move to new york my familys here and i guess im midwest through and through its rough deanna studied her the short tidy curls the sad eyes do you have something else not yet ive got some interviews lined up though miss perkins made the announcement and a week later shes gone i havent gotten used to it im sure youre not alone there ill get out of your way i just had some plants to take home good luck with your new show thanks cassie deanna stepped forward hesitated could i ask you something sure you worked for angela for about four years right it would have been four years in september i started as a secretarial assistant straight out of business college even down in the newsroom wed hear occasional grumbling from her staff some complaints some gossip i dont recall ever hearing anything from your direction i wondered why that was i worked for her cassie said simply i dont gossip about people i work for deanna lifted a brow kept her eyes steady you dont work for her anymore no cassies voice cooled ms reynolds i know that the two of you had a disagreement before she left and i understand that youd feel some hostility but id rather you didnt draw me into a discussion about miss perkins personally or professionally loyalty or discretion id like to think its both cassie said stiffly good you know im going to be doing a similar type of program you may not repeat gossip but you certainly cant help but hear it around here so youd know that my contract is of short term i may not get beyond the initial six months or ten affiliates cassie thawed a bit ive got some friends downstairs the newsroom pools running in your favor about three to one thats nice to know but i imagine thats a matter of loyalty as well i need a secretary cassie id like to hire someone who understands that kind of loyalty one who knows how to be discreet as well as efficient cassies expression altered from polite interest to surprise are you offering me a job im sure i wont be able to pay you what angela did unless no damn it until we can make this thing fly and youll probably have to put in some very long tedious hours initially but the jobs yours if you want it i hope youll think about it ms reynolds you dont know if i was in on what she did to you if i helped set it up no i dont deanna said calmly i dont need to know and i think whether we work together or not you should call me deanna i dont intend to run a less efficient organization than angela did but i hope to run a more personal one i dont have to think about it ill take the job good deanna held out a hand well start monday morning i hope i can get you a desk by then your first assignments going to be to get me a list of who angela laid off and who on it we can use simon grimsley would be on top of it and margaret wilson from research and denny sprite the assistant production manager ive got simons number deanna muttered dragging out her address book to note down the other names i can give you the others when deanna saw cassie take out a thick book and flip it open she laughed were going to be fine cassie were going to be just fine it was difficult for deanna to believe that she was leaving the newsroom behind particularly since she was huddled in editing reviewing a tape how long is it now she asked jeff hyatt in the editors chair glanced at the digital clock on the console minute fiftyfive hell were still long we need to slice another ten seconds run it back jeff she leaned forward in her swivel chair like a runner off the mark and waited for him to cue it up the report of a missing teenager reunited with her parents had to fit into its allotted time intellectually deanna knew it emotionally she didnt want to cut a second here jeff tapped the monitor with one blunt competent finger this bit of them walking around the backyard you could lose it but it shows the emotion of the reunion the way her parents have her between them their arms linked its not news he shoved up his glasses and smiled apologetically its nice though nice she muttered under her breath anyway youve got that togetheragain business in the interview portion when theyre all sitting on the couch its good film deanna muttered all you needs a rainbow arching around them deanna turned at finns voice and scowled i didnt have one handy despite her obvious annoyance he stepped over dropped his hands on her shoulders and finished watching the tape it has more impact without it deanna you soften the interview and the emotion youre after by having them take a stroll together besides its news not a movieoftheweek he was right but it only made it harder to swallow take it out jeff while he ran tape editing and marking time she sat with her arms folded it was going to be one of the last pieces she did for cbc news it was a matter of ego as well as pride that made her want it perfect i need to do the voiceover she said with a telling look at finn pretend im not here he suggested when jeff was set she took a moment to study the script holding a stopwatch in one hand she nodded then began to read a parents worst nightmare was resolved early this morning when sixteenyearold ruthanne thompson missing for eight days returned home to her family in dayton for the next several minutes she forgot finn as she and jeff worked on perfecting the segment at last satisfied she murmured a thanks to the editor and rose good piece finn commented as he walked out of editing with her spare solid and touching touching she stopped to angle a look at him i didnt think that counted with you it does if its news i heard youre moving upstairs next week you heard right she turned into the newsroom congratulations thanks but you might want to hold off on that until after the first show ive got a feeling youll pull it off funny so do i up here she tapped her head its my stomach that doubts maybe youre just hungry casually he twined a lock of her hair around his finger how about dinner dinner youre off the schedule at six i looked im clear until eight am when i have to catch a plane for kuwait kuwait whats up there rumblings he gave her hair a little tug always rumblings so how about a date kansas some spaghetti some red wine a little conversation ive sort of given up dating for a while are you going to let that shrink control your life it has nothing to do with marshall she said coolly but of course it did and because it did she executed a quick aboutface listen i like to eat and i like italian why dont we just call it dinner i wont argue over semantics why dont i pick you up at seven thatll give you time to go home and change the place i have in mind is casual she was glad shed taken him at his word shed been tempted to fuss at least a little then had settled on a roomy blouse and slacks that suited the midsummer mugginess comfort seemed to be the tone of the evening the place hed chosen was a small smoky cafe that smelled of garlic and toasting bread there were cigarette burns in the checkered tablecloths and hacks in the wooden booth that would have played hell with panty hose a stubby candle stuck out of the mouth of the obligatory chianti bottle finn shoved it to the side as they slid into a booth trust me its better than it looks it looks fine the place looked comforting a woman didnt have to be on her guard in a restaurant that looked like someones family kitchen he could see her relaxing degree by degree perhaps that was why hed brought her here he thought to a place where there was no hovering maitre do no leatherbound wine list lambrusco okay with you he asked as a tshirtclad waitress approached their booth thats fine bring us a bottle janey and some antipasto sure thing finn amused deanna rested her chin on her cupped hand come here often about once a week when im in town their lasagnas almost as good as mine you cook when you get tired of eating in restaurants you learn to cook his lips curved just a little as he reached across the table to play with her fingers i thought about cooking for you tonight but i didnt think youd go for it oh why she moved her hands out of reach because cooking for a woman if you do it right is a surefire seduction and its clear you like to take things one cautious careful step at a time he tilted his head when the waitress returned with the bottle filled their glasses am i right i suppose you are he leaned forward lifting his glass so heres to the first step im not sure what im drinking to watching her his eyes dark and focused he reached out rubbed his thumb over her cheekbone yes you do her heart stuttered annoyed at herself she exhaled slowly finn i should make it clear that im not interested in getting involved with anyone i have to put all my energies all my emotions into making the show work you look like a woman with enough emotion to go around to me he sipped studying her over the rim why dont we just see what develops the waitress slid the platter of antipasto on the table ready to order im ready finn smiled again how about you flustered deanna picked up the plasticcoated menu odd she thought she couldnt seem to comprehend a thing written there it might as well have been in greek ill go for the spaghetti make it two gotcha the waitress winked at finn white sox are up by two in the third white sox deanna arched a brow as the waitress toddled off youre a white sox fan yeah you into baseball i played first base in little league batted three thirtynine my best season no shit impressed and pleased he tapped a thumb to his chest shortstop went allstate in high school three fifty my top season with deliberate care she chose an olive and you like the sox too bad why seeing as were in the same profession ill overlook it but if we go out again im wearing my cubs hat cubs he shut his eyes and groaned and i was nearly in love deanna i thought you were a practical woman their days coming yeah right in the next millennium tell you what when i get back in town well take in a game her eyes narrowed at comiskey or wrigley well flip for it youre on she nibbled on a pepperoncini enjoying the bite im still ticked about them putting lights in at wrigley they should have done it years ago it was tradition it was sentiment he corrected and you put sentiment up against ticket sales sales win every time cynic her smile froze suddenly maybe i could get baseball wives on the show cubs and sox youd have viewer interest right off people taking sides god knows all you have to do is mention sports or politics in this town to get people going and we could talk about being married to someone whos on the road weeks at a time during the season how they deal with slumps injuries baseball annies hey finn snapped his fingers in front of her face and made her blink oh sorry no problem its an education to watch you think it was also to his surprise arousing it made a man wonder hope that she would concentrate as fiercely on sex and its a good idea her smile spread inch by inch until her face glowed with it itd be a hell of a kickoff wouldnt it yeah but youre mixing your sports metaphors im going to love this with her wine in one hand she settled back against the booth im really going to love this the whole process is so fascinating and news wasnt it was but this is more i dont know personal and exciting its an adventure is that how you feel about flying off to one country after another most of the time different place different people different stories its hard to get into a rut i cant imagine you worrying about that it happens you get cozy lose the edge cozy in war zones disaster areas international summits she didnt see how is that why you didnt stay in london part of it when i stop feeling like a foreigner i know its time to come home have you ever been to london no whats it like it was easy to tell her easy for her to listen they talked over pasta and red wine over cappuccino and cannoli until the candle in the bottle beside them began to gutter and the juke fell silent it was the lack of noise that made deanna glance around the restaurant was almost empty its late she said surprised when she glanced at her watch you have a plane to catch in less than eight hours ill manage but he slid out of the booth as she did you were right about the food it was fabulous but her smile faded when he reached out and cupped the nape of her neck in his hand he held her there his eyes on hers as he closed the distance between them the kiss was slow deliberate and devastating shed expected more of a onetwo punch from a man whose eyes could bore a hole in the brain perhaps that was why the soft lazy romance of the kiss disarmed her so completely she lifted a hand to his shoulder but rather than easing him away as she had intended her fingers dug in held on her heart took a long seamless somersault before it thudded against her ribs when her mouth yielded under his he deepened the kiss slowly still teasing a response from her until her hand slid from his shoulder to cling at his waist dozens of thoughts struggled to form in her head then skittered away for here was heat and pleasure and the undeniable promise or threat of much more more was what he wanted much more desperately than he had anticipated however simple hed intended the kiss to be he was almost undone by it he eased her away the small baffled sound she made as her eyes blinked open had him gritting his teeth against a quick vicious ache it was important to keep steady though at the moment she couldnt have said why instinct alone had her stepping back an inch what was that for other than obvious reasons he should be amused by the question i figured if we got that done here you wouldnt project what could should or might happen when i took you home i see she realized her purse had dropped to the floor and bent to retrieve it i dont plan every aspect of my life out like a feature story sure you do he ran a finger down her cheek it was hot and flushed and made him long for another taste but thats okay with me just consider that your lead well pick up the rest of the copy when i get back chapter eleven by the end of july deanna had what could loosely be called a staff in addition to fran and simon she had a single researcher and a booker overseen by cassie they were still in dire need of bodies and brains and a budget to pay for them the technical end was solid at one of the endless meetings deanna attended it was agreed that studio b would be fully staffed and carefully lit production values would be topnotch all she had to do was give them something to produce shed temporarily moved two desks into angelas old office one for herself one for fran they divided the work and brainstormed ideas weve got the first eight shows booked fran paced the office a clipboard in one hand cassies handling travel and lodging shes doing a good job dee but shes ridiculously overworked i know deanna rubbed her gritty eyes and struggled to clear her brain we need an assistant producer and another researcher and a general dogsbody if we can get the first dozen shows under our belt we might be able to swing it meantime youre not getting enough sleep even if i had the time i couldnt she reached out for the ringing phone my stomachs in a constant state of turmoil and my mind just wont shut off reynolds she said into the receiver no i havent forgotten she glanced at her watch i have an hour she blew out a breath as she listened all right tell them to send the wardrobe up ill pick what suits and be down for makeup in thirty minutes thanks photo shoot fran remembered and the promos i cant accuse delacort of chintzing on the advertising but damn i dont have time we need a staff meeting and we still have to go through those responses to the eighthundred number and the writein ill schedule it for four fran grinned wait until you read some of the stuff from the writein margarets idea on why exhusbands should be shot down like a dog is a hoot deannas smile was strained we did tone that down didnt we yeah it went out why your exhusband is your ex tame enough but the responses werent weve got everything from serious abuse cases to guys who cleaned engine parts in the kitchen sink well need an expert i thought a lawyer instead of a counselor divorce lawyers have terrific stories and richard has plenty of contacts okay but she broke off as a clothes rack wheeled through the doorway come on fran help me play closet a head peeked around the suits and dresses oh hi jeff theyve got you making deliveries i wanted a chance to come up and see the operation with a shy smile he glanced around were rooting for you downstairs thanks hows everybody in the newsroom i havent had a chance to stop down for days pretty good the heat brings out the loonies you know lots of hot stories breaking he rocked the rack loitering as deanna began to go through the wardrobe deanna i was kind of wondering if you you know get an opening up here for somebody to pick up loose ends answer the phone you know deanna stopped with her hand on a crimson blazer are you kidding i know youve got people whove worked this end of things before but i always wanted to do this kind of television i just thought you know when can you start he looked startled i i mean it were desperate we need someone who can do a little of everything i know you can from your work downstairs and your editing skills would be invaluable the pays lousy and the hours are miserable but if you want a shot as an assistant producer with onscreen credit and all the coffee you can drink youre hired ill give my notice jeff said through a grin that all but split his face i may have to work another week or two but i can give you all my extra time god fran weve found a hero deanna took him by the shoulders and kissed his cheek welcome to bedlam jeff tell cassie to fit you for a straitjacket okay flushing laughing he backed out of the room okay great fran pulled out a plumcolored suit and held it up in front of deanna general dogsbody one of the best jeff can mow down a mountain of paperwork like a beaver taking out a tree he carries all this stuff in his head ask him what won for best picture in and he knows what was the lead story on the ten oclock on tuesday of last week he knows i like the red for the promos fran agreed not the stills what does he do downstairs editorial assistant he also does some writing she pulled out a sunny yellow dress with turquoise sleeves and round fuchsia buttons hes good dependable as a sunrise as long as he works long and cheap thats going to change her eyes darkened as she held frans next selection up in front of her i know how much everyones putting into this not just timewise im going to make it work to give their chances a boost deanna granted interviews print radio television she appeared on a segment of midday and was interviewed by roger she took two days and visited all the affiliates within driving distance and put in personal phone calls to the rest she personally oversaw every detail of her set design pored over press clippings for program ideas and spent hours reviewing responses to the ads for topic guests it left little time for a social life and it certainly provided a good excuse to avoid finn shed meant what shed said when shed told him she didnt want to get involved she couldnt afford to shed decided emotionally or professionally how could she trust her own judgment when shed been so willing to believe in marshall but finn riley wasnt easily avoided he dropped into her office stopped by her apartment often he carried take out pizza or white cartons filled with chinese food it was hard to argue with his casual comment that she had to eat sometime in a weak moment she agreed to go out to the movies with him and found herself just as charmed and just as uneasy as before loren bach on one cassie told her it was still shy of nine oclock but deanna was already at her desk good morning loren countdown five days he said cheerfully how are you holding up by my knuckles the publicitys generated a lot of local interest i dont think well have any problem filling the studio youre getting some interest on the east coast as well theres a nice juicy article in the national enquirer about the all about eve of talk shows guess whos playing margo channing oh hell how bad is it ill fax you the article they spelled your name right eve ah deanna he chuckled tickled with his own humor from one who knows our heroine well i can tell you she leaked this little tidbit makes it sound as though she all but picked you up out of the street played big sister and mentor then was stabbed in the back for her generosity at least they didnt claim id been dropped from a spaceship into her front yard maybe next time in the meantime you got some national press and whether she knows it or not linked your name with hers in such a way thatll make people curious i think we can get some play out of this a tag in entertainment weekly maybe another squib in variety great i guess deanna you can buck the tabloids when youve built the muscle for now just consider it free press courtesy of angela word is shes negotiating a contract to write her autobiography you might be worth a chapter now im excited her chair squeaked as she leaned back reminding her shed forgotten to oil the springs that made her lean forward again and add the chore to her growing list on the corner of her desk i hope you dont mind if i just concentrate on pulling off the first show ill worry about repaying angela for her generosity later deanna you make the show work thatll be payment enough now lets talk business twenty minutes later with a headache just beginning to brew behind her eyes she hung up what had ever made her think she was good with details deanna wondered what had ever made her think she wanted the responsibility of helming a talk show deanna cassie entered with a tray i thought youd like some coffee you read my mind deanna set aside papers to make room for the pot do you have time for any we might want to tank up before the rest of the days schedule hits i brought two cups she poured both before she took a chair do you want to go over your agenda for today i dont think so the first sip of hot black coffee punched its caffeinelaced fist straight into her bloodstream its engraved on my forehead have we set up a lunch for the baseball wives after the show simon and fran will play host reservations are confirmed and jeff thought it might be nice to have roses in the green room when they arrive i wanted to run it by you good old jeff very classy idea lets put cards on each bunch with a personal thankyou from the staff after another sip she pressed a hand to her jittery stomach christ cassie im scared to death setting the cup aside she took a deep calming breath and leaned forward i want to ask you something and i really want you to be brutally honest okay no sparing feelings no false pep talk all right cassie laid her steno pad on her lap shoot you worked for angela a long time you probably know as much about the ins and outs of this sort of a show as any producer or director i imagine you have an opinion of why angelas works and i want to know candidly if you believe we have a shot at this you want to know if we can make deannas hour competitive not even that deanna said shaking her head if we can get through the first half a dozen shows without being laughed out of the business thats easy after next week people are going to do a lot of talking about deannas hour and more people are going to tune in to see what the deal is theyre going to like it because theyre going to like you she chuckled at deannas expression thats not sucking up the thing is the average viewer wont see or appreciate the work thats gone into making it all look good and run smoothly they wont know about the long hours or the sweat but you know so youll work harder the harder you work the harder everyone else will because you do something angela didnt something i guess she just couldnt you make us feel important that makes all the difference maybe it wont put you on top of the ratings heap right away but it puts you on top with us that counts it counts a lot deanna said after a moment thanks in a couple of months when the shows cruising and the budget opens up im going to come back in here thats when im going to suck up she grinned and hit you for a raise if the damn budget ever opens up everyones getting a raise deanna blew at her bangs in the meantime i need to see the tapes on the promos for the affiliates you need a promotion manager and a unit manager and a publicity director a permanent director and a few production assistants until that happy day im wearing those hats too have the newspapers come in yet i passed them on to margaret shes going to screen them for ideas and make clippings fine try to get me the clippings before lunch were going to want something really hot for the second week in september bach just told me well be going up against a new game show in three cities during fall premiere week will do oh and your three oclock with captain queeg is rescheduled for threethirty captain oh ryce not bothering to hide the smile deanna noted it down on her calendar i know hes a little eccentric cassie and overbearing and overbearing deanna agreed but hes a good director were lucky to have him for the few opening weeks if you say so she started out then hesitated and turned back deanna i didnt know if i should mention it then i figured it wouldnt be right to start censoring your calls what dr pike he called when you were on with mr bach thoughtfully deanna set aside her pen if he calls back put him through ill take care of it okay oops she grinned and stepped back to avoid running into finn morning mr riley hey cassie i need a minute with the boss shes all yours cassie closed the door behind her finn im sorry im swamped but she wasnt quite quick enough to avoid the kiss when he skirted the desk she wasnt sure she wanted to i know ive only got a minute myself what is it she could see the excitement in his eyes feel it in the air sparking around him its big im on my way to the airport iraq just invaded kuwait what her reporters adrenaline made her spring up oh jesus blitzkrieg style an armored thrust helicoptersupported i have a couple of contacts at green ramp in north carolina a couple of guys i got to know during the fighting at tocumen airfield in panama a few months ago odds are well go with diplomatic and economic pressure first but theres a damn good chance well deploy troops if my instincts are worth anything its going to be big there are blowups over there all the time weakly she sat on the arm of her chair its land kansas and its oil and its honor he lifted her to her feet caught her hair in his hand to draw it away from her face he wanted needed he admitted a long look at her a good long look i may be gone for a while especially if we send troops she was pale struggling to be calm they think he has nuclear capabilities dont they and certainly access to chemical weapons dimples flashed recklessly worried about me i was just wondering if you were taking a gas mask as well as a camera crew feeling foolish she stepped back ill watch for your reports do that im sorry ill miss your premiere thats okay she managed a smile ill send you a tape you know he toyed with a strand of her hair technically im going off to war the old im shipping out babe and who knows what tomorrow might bring he smiled into her dark serious eyes i dont suppose i could convince you to lock that door over there and give me a memorable sendoff she was afraid he could i dont fall for tired old lines besides everyone knows finn riley always brings back the story alive it was worth a shot but he slipped his arms around her waist at least give me something to take into the desert with me i hear it gets pretty cold at night there was a part of her that feared and a part that yearned listening to both she wrapped her arms around his neck all right riley remember this for the first time she pressed her lips to his without hesitation there was more than the quick familiar thrill when her mouth opened to his more than the slow grinding ache shed tried so hard to deny there was need yes to taste to absorb and curiously to comfort when the kiss deepened she let herself forget everything else and just feel she could smell him soap and light clean sweat his hair was soft and full and seemed to beckon her fingers to comb through and hold on when his mouth became less patient when she heard his quiet groan of pleasure she responded heedlessly mating her tongue with his nipping at his lip to add the dark excitement of pain to the pleasure she thought he trembled but could no longer find the will to soothe deanna desperately he took his mouth over her face along her throat where her pulse beat like wings again his lips crushed down on hers again absorbing the flavor the warmth shaken he drew back just enough to rest his brow against hers to hold her another moment where he felt so oddly centered so curiously right goddamn he whispered im going to miss you this wasnt supposed to happen too late he lifted his head brushed his lips over her forehead ill call when i can as soon as hed said it finn realized hed never made that promise before it was the kind of unstated commitment that had him stepping back tucking his hands safely in his pockets good luck next week thanks she took a step back herself so that they took each others measure like two boxers after a bloodpumping round in the ring i know its a useless thing to say but be careful ill be good his grin was quick and reckless thats more important he walked to the door then stopped his hand on the knob listen deanna if that asshole shrink does happen to call back you were eavesdropping of course i was im a reporter anyway if he does call back brush him off will you i dont want to have to kill him she smiled but the smile faded quickly something in finns eyes told her he was serious thats a ridiculous thing to say it happens that im not interested in marshall but lucky for him he touched a finger to his brow in salute stay tuned kansas ill be back arrogant idiot deanna muttered when her eyes began to sting she turned to stare out at chicago there might be a war on the other side of the world she thought as the first tear spilled over and a show to produce right here so what in the hell was she doing falling in love okay dee were nearly ready for you fran scooted back into the dressing room the studio audience is all in great deanna continued to stare blindly at the mirror as marcie put the finishing touches on her hair just great theyre wearing cubs hats and white sox tshirts some people even brought banners and theyre waving them around im telling you theyre revved great just great smiling to herself fran glanced down at her clipboard all six of the wives are in the green room theyre really chummy simons in there now going over the setup with them i went in to introduce myself to them earlier her voice was a monotone she could feel the nausea building like a tidal wave oh god fran i really think im going to be sick no youre not you dont have time marcie her hair looks fabulous maybe you can give me some tips on mine later come on champ fran gave deanna a tug that brought her out of the chair you need to go out and give the audience a pep talk get them on your side i should have worn the navy suit deanna said as fran dragged her along the orange and kiwi is too much its gorgeous and its bright and young just the right combo you look hip but not trendy friendly but not homespun now look making a little island of intimacy in the midst of backstage chaos fran took deanna by the shoulders this is what weve all been slaving for over the last couple of months what youve been aiming toward for years now go out there and make them love you i keep thinking about all this stuff what if a fight breaks out you know how rabid sox and cubs fans can be what if i run out of questions or cant control the crowd what if someone asks why the hell im doing a silly show about baseball when were sending troops to the middle east number one nobodys going to fight because theyre going to be having too much fun number two you never run out of questions and you can control any crowd and finally youre doing this show on baseball because people need to be entertained especially during times like these now pull it together reynolds and go do your job right she took a deep breath youre sure i look okay g im going deanna she turned surprised then infuriated to see marshall standing an arms length behind her frans snarl had her stepping forward what are you doing here his smile was easy though his eyes held regret i wanted to wish you luck in person he held out a bouquet of candy pink roses im very proud of you she didnt reach for the flowers but she kept her eyes level with his ill accept the wish for luck your pride is your business now im afraid only staff is allowed back here very slowly he lowered the flowers i didnt know you had it in you to be cruel it seems we were misled i have a show to do marshall but ill take a moment to tell you once again that i have no desire to resume any sort of relationship with you simon she called out without taking her eyes from marshalls show dr pike out will you he seems to have made a wrong turn i know the way he said between clenched teeth he let the roses fall to the floor reminding her how she had dropped a similar bouquet the scent of them turned her stomach i wont always be turned away so easily he stalked off with simon nervously dogging his heels deanna allowed herself one long calming breath creep fran muttered lifting a hand automatically to soothe the tension in deannas shoulders bastard to come here like this right before a live show are you going to be all right im going to be fine she shook off the fury there was too much riding on the next hour for her to indulge herself i am fine she headed out taking the hand mike from jeff as she passed jeff smiled broadly as he watched her break a leg deanna she straightened her shoulders hell im going to break two she stepped onto the set smiled at the sea of faces hi everyone thanks for coming im deanna in about five minutes were going to get this show rolling i hope youre going to help me out its my first day on the job put in the damn tape in her towering new york office angela stubbed out one cigarette and immediately lit another i went out on a limb to get a copy of this lew told her as he slipped the tape into the vcr you told me you told me and she was sick of hearing it sick too with fear of what she might see on the monitor in the next few minutes cue it up damn it he hit the play button and stepped back eyes narrowed angela listened to the intro music too close to rock she decided with a smirk the average viewer wouldnt like it the pan of the audience people in baseball caps applauding and waving banners middleclass she decided and leaned back comfortably it was going to be all right after all she assured herself welcome to deannas hour the camera did a closeup of deannas face the slow warm smile the hint of nerves in the eyes our guests today here in chicago are six women who know all there is to know about baseball and not just about squeeze plays and texas leaguers shes jittery angela thought pleased shed be lucky to make it through to commercial anticipating the humiliation angela allowed herself to feel sorry for deanna after all she thought with a soft sympathetic sigh who knew better than she what it was like to face that merciless glass eye shed taken on too much too soon angela realized it would be a hard lesson but a good one and when she failed as she certainly would and came knocking on the door looking for help angela decided she would be gracious enough forgiving enough to give her a second chance but deanna made it to commercial segueing into the break over applause after the first fifteen minutes the pleasant flavor of gloating sympathy had turned bitter in her throat she watched the show through to the closing credits saying nothing turn it off she snapped then rose to go to the wet bar rather than her usual mineral water she reached for a split of champagne spilling it into a flute its nothing she said half to herself a mediocre show with minimal demographic appeal the response from the affiliates was solid with his back to her lew ejected the tape a handful of stations in the dust bowl of the midwest she drank quickly her lips tightening on the gulp do you think that worries me do you think she could play that in new york its what works here that matters do you know what my share was last week yes lew set the tape aside and played the game youve got nothing to worry about angela youre the best and everyone knows it damn right im the best and when my first primetime special hits during the november sweeps ill start getting the respect i deserve grimacing she drained the champagne it no longer tasted celebratory but it thawed all the little ice pockets of fear ive already got the money she turned around steadier she could afford to be generous couldnt she well let deanna have her moment and why not she wont last leave the tape lew angela went back to her desk settled down and smiled and ask my secretary to come in i have a job for her alone angela swiveled in her chair to study the view of her new home new york was going to do more than make her a star she mused it was going to make her an empire yes miss perkins cassie damn it lorraine spinning around she glared at her new secretary she hated breaking in new employees being expected to remember their names their faces everyone always expected too much from her get me beeker on the phone if he cant be reached leave a message with his service i want a callback asap yes maam thats all angela glanced toward the champagne then shook her head oh no she wasnt going to fall into that trap she wasnt her mother she didnt need liquor to get through the day never had what she needed was action once she lit a fire under beeker and had him digging deeper and harder for dirt on deanna reynolds shed have all the action she could handle part two all fame is dangerous thomas fuller chapter twelve cooked beneath a blazing sun an enemy of rainfall of plant life of human beings are the shifting sands of the saudi desert finn did his best not to squint into the camera as that merciless sun beat down on him he wore an olivedrab tshirt khakis and a faded bush hat sandstorms unrelenting heat and mirages are common in this hostile environment into this world the forces of the united states have come to draw their line in the sand it has been three months since the first men and women of the armed forces were deployed under desert shield with the efficiency and ingenuity of the yankee these soldiers are adjusting to their new environment or in some cases adjusting their environment to suit them a wooden box a liner of styrofoam and an airconditioner blower finn rested his hand on a wooden crate and a few industrious gis have created a makeshift refrigerator to help combat the onehundredandtwentydegree heat and with boredom as canny an enemy as the climate offduty soldiers spend their time reading mail from home trading the precious few newspapers that get through the censors and setting up lizard races but the mails are slow and the days are long while parades and picnics back home celebrate veterans day the men and women of desert shield work and wait for cbc this is finn riley in saudi arabia when the red light blinked off finn unhooked his sunglasses from his belt loop and slipped them on behind him was an fcan eagle and men and women in desert fatigues i could go for some potato salad and a brass band curt how about you his cameraman whose ebony skin gleamed like polished marble with his coat of sweat and sun block rolled his eyes to heaven my mamas homemade lemonade a gallon of it cold beer peach ice cream and a long slow kiss from whitney houston stop youre killing me finn took a deep drink of bottled water it tasted metallic and overwarm but it washed the grit out of his throat lets see what theyll let us take pictures of and well try for some interviews they aint going to give us much curt grumbled well take what we can hours later in the relative comfort of a saudi hotel finn stripped to the skin the shower washed away the layers of sand and sweat and grit of two days and nights in the desert he felt a sweet almost romantic longing for the yeasty tang of an american brew he settled for orange juice and stretched out on the bed cooly naked quietly exhausted eyes closed he groped for the phone to begin the complicated and often frustrating process of calling the states the phone woke deanna out of a dead sleep her first jumbled thought was that it was a wrong number again probably the same idiot who had dragged her out of a soothing bath earlier only to hang up without apology already cranky she jiggled the phone off the hook reynolds must be what fivethirty in the morning there finn kept his eyes closed and smiled at the husky sound of her voice sorry finn shaking off sleep deanna pushed herself up in bed and reached for the light where are you enjoying the hospitality of our saudi hosts did you have any watermelon today excuse me watermelon the suns a bitch here especially about ten in the morning thats when i started to have this fantasy about watermelon curt got me going then the crew started torturing themselves snow cones mint juleps cold fried chicken finn deanna said slowly are you all right just tired he rubbed a hand over his face to pull himself back we spent a couple of days out in the desert the food sucks the heats worse and the fucking flies i dont want to think about the flies ive been up for about thirty hours kansas im a little punchy you should get some sleep talk to me ive seen some of your reports she began the one on the hostages husseins calling guests was gripping and the one from the air base in saudi no tell me what youve been doing we did a show today on obsessive shoppers one guest stays up every night watching one of the shopping channels and ordering everything on the screen his wife finally cut the cable when he bought a dozen electronic flea collars they dont have a dog it made finn laugh as shed hoped it would i got the tape you sent it bounced around a little first so it took a while the crew and i watched it you looked good i felt good were getting picked up by another couple of stations in indiana late afternoon well be going up against a monster soap but who knows now tell me you miss me she didnt answer right away and caught herself wrapping the phone cord around and around her hand i suppose i do now and then how about now yes when i get home i want you to come with me up to my cabin finn i want to teach you how to fish oh a smile tugged at her mouth really i dont think i should get serious about a woman who doesnt know one end of a rod from the other keep it in mind ill be in touch all right finn hmmm she could tell he was nearly asleep ill ah send you another tape kay see you he managed to get the phone back on the hook before he started to snore the reports continued to come the escalation of hostilities the negotiations for the release of the hostages many feared would be used as human shields the paris summit and the presidents thanksgiving visit to us troops by the end of november the un had voted on resolution the use of force to expel iraq from kuwait was approved with a deadline for saddam of january fifteenth on the homefront there were yellow ribbons flying from the tips of car antennae and porch banisters they were mixed with holly and ivy as america prepared for christmas and for war this toy piece will show not only whats hot for kids for christmas but whats safe deanna looked up from her notes and narrowed her eyes at fran are you okay sure with a grimace fran shifted her nowconsiderable bulk for someone whos got what feels like a small pickup truck sitting on her bladder im dandy you should go home put your feet up youre due in less than two months id go crazy at home besides youre the one who should be exhausted schmoozing half the night at the charity dinnerdance its part of the job deanna said absently and as loren pointed out i made a number of contacts and got some press mmm and about five hours sleep fran fiddled with a toy rabbit that wiggled its ears and squeaked when she pressed its belly do you think big ed would like this brow lifted deanna studied frans belly where big ed as the baby was called seemed to be growing by leaps and bounds you already have two dozen stuffed animals in the nursery you started it with that twofoot teddy bear setting the bunny aside fran reached among the toys scattered on the office floor and chose a combatfatigued gi joe why the hell do they always want to play soldier thats one of the questions well ask our expert have you heard from dave fran tried not to worry about her stepbrother a national guard officer who was in the gulf yeah he got the box we sent over the comic books were a big hit wow with a sound between a gasp and a laugh she pressed a hand to her stomach big ed just kicked one through the posts is richard really going to buy the baby a bears helmet already has which reminds me i want to make sure we get gender molding into this segment how society and parents continue stereotypes by buying this kind of thing for boys she waved the gi joe and this sort of thing for girls she nudged a fisherprice oven with her foot ballet shoes for girls football cleats for boys which leads to girls shaking pompoms on the sidelines while boys make touchdowns which deanna continued leads to men making corporate decisions and women serving coffee god am i going to screw this kid up fran levered herself out of the chair the fact that she waddled made her nervous pacing both comic and sweet i shouldnt have done this we should have practiced on a puppy first im going to be responsible for another human being and i havent even started a college fund over the past few weeks deanna had become used to frans outbursts she sat back and smiled hormones bouncing again you bet im going to go find simon and check on last weeks ratings and pretend im a normal sane human being then go home deanna insisted eat a bag of cookies and watch an old movie on cable okay ill send jeff in to pick up the toys and move them down to the set alone deanna sat back and closed her eyes it wasnt only fran who was on edge these days the entire staff was running on nerves in six weeks deannas hour would either be resigned with delacort or they would all be out of a job the ratings had been inching up but was it enough she knew she was putting everything she had into the show itself and everything she could squeeze out into the public relations and press events loren insisted on but was that enough the trial run was almost over and if delacort decided to dump them restless she rose and turned to face the window she wondered if angela had ever stood there and worried agonized over something as basic as a single ratings point had she felt the responsibility weigh so heavily on her shoulders for the show for the staff for the advertisers is that why shed become so hard deanna rolled her tensed shoulders it wouldnt simply be her career crumbling if the show was axed she thought there were six other people who had their time and energy and yes their egos invested six other people who had families mortgages car payments dentist bills deanna yes jeff we need to get these toys down to the she trailed off as she turned and spotted a sevenfoot plastic spruce where in the world did you get that i ah liberated it from a storeroom jeff stepped out from behind the tree his cheeks were flushed from both nerves and exertion his glasses slid slowly down the bridge of his nose his boyishness was endearing i thought you might like it laughing she examined the tree it was pretty pathetic with its bent plastic boughs and virulent green color no one would mistake for natural she looked at jeffs grinning face and laughed again its exactly what i need lets put it in front of the window it looked kind of lonely down there jeff centered it carefully in front of the wide pane i figured with some decorations liberated he shrugged theres stuff in this building nobodys used or seen for years some lights some balls itll look fine and plenty of yellow ribbons she said thinking of finn thanks jeff everythings going to be okay deanna he put a hand on her shoulder gave it a quick shy squeeze dont worry so much youre right she pressed her hand on top of his absolutely right lets get the rest of the crew in here and decorate this baby deanna worked throughout the holidays with the plastic tree glowing behind her by juggling appointments and putting in three eighteenhour days she made time for a frantic twentyfourhour trip home over christmas she returned to chicagos bitter cold on the last plane on boxing day loaded down with luggage gifts and tins of cookies from topeka she unlocked her apartment the first thing she saw was the plain white envelope on the rug just inside uneasy she set her bags aside it didnt surprise her to find a single sheet in the envelope or to see the bold red type merry christmas deanna i love watching you every day i love watching you i love you weird she mused but harmless considering some of the bizarre mail that had come her way since august she stuffed the note in her pocket and shed barely flipped the lock back in place when a knock sounded on the other side of the door she tugged off her wool cap with one hand opened the door with the other marshall his burberry coat was neatly folded over his arm deanna hasnt this gone on long enough you havent answered any of my calls theres nothing going on at all marshall i just this minute got back into town im tired im hungry and im not in the mood for a civilized discussion if i can swallow my pride enough to come here the least you can do is ask me in your pride she felt her temper rise a bad sign she knew when only a few words had been exchanged fine come in he glanced at her bags as he stepped through the door you went home for christmas then thats right he laid his coat over the back of a chair and your familys well hale and hearty marshall and im not in the mood for small talk if you have something to say say it i dont believe this is something we can resolve until we sit down and talk it through he gestured to the sofa please she shrugged out of her coat and took a chair instead she linked her hands firmly in her lap and waited the fact that youre still angry with me proves that theres an emotional investment between us he sat resting his hands on his knees i realized that trying to resolve things right after the incident was a mistake the incident is that what were calling it because he continued calmly emotions on both sides were running too close to the surface making it difficult to compromise and vent constructively i rarely vent constructively she smiled then but her eyes were hot i dont suppose we got to know each other well enough for you to realize that under certain circumstances i have a nasty temper i understand he was pleased very pleased that they were communicating again you see deanna i believe part of our difficulties stemmed from the fact that we didnt know each other as well as we should have we share the blame there but its a very human very natural inclination to show only your best sides when developing a relationship she had to take a deep breath had to school herself to remain seated when the urge to spring up and strike out was churning inside her you want to share the blame for that fine particularly since i have no intention of ever moving beyond that stage with you deanna if youll be honest youll admit that we were creating something special between us as a good therapist he kept his eyes steady on hers his voice mild and soothing a meeting of intellects of tastes oh i think our meeting of intellects and tastes took a sharp division when i walked in and found you and angela groping each other tell me marshall did you have the brochures for our proposed hawaiian tryst in your jacket pocket at the time his color rose i have apologized repeatedly for that lapse now its a lapse before it was an incident let me give you my term for it marshall i call it a betrayal a betrayal by two people i admired and cared for deliberate on angelas side and pathetic on yours the muscle in his jaw began to twitch you and i had not fully committed to each other sexually or emotionally youre saying that if id gone to bed with you it wouldnt have happened im not buying it she sprang to her feet im not sharing the blame for this one pal youre the one who thought with your glands so take my advice doctor and get the hell out of my house i want you to stay away from me i dont want you knocking at my door i dont want to hear your voice on the phone and i dont want any more calls in the middle of the damn night where you cant even drum up the guts to speak he stood standing stiffly i dont know what youre talking about dont you her cheeks were flaming i only know that i want to make things right my eyes have been opened during these months since you cut me out of your life deanna i know youre the only woman who can make me happy then youre in for a sad life im not available and im not interested theres someone else he stepped forward gripping her forearms before she could jerk away you can speak of betrayal when you so casually so easily move from me to someone else yes theres someone else marshall theres me now take your hands off me let me remind you what we had he murmured pulling her against him let me show you the way it could be the old fear returned making her tremble as she fought free of his grip struggling for air she braced herself against the chair cornered she was cruel you know what would make an interesting topic for my show marshall try this on respected family counselors who harass women theyve dated as well as seducing underage girls she wrapped her arms tight around her body as his color drained yes i know all about it a child marshall can you imagine how that revolts me the woman you were seeing while you were supposedly developing our relationship is small change compared to that angela sent me a little package before she left for new york cold sweat pearled on his brow you have no right to publicize my private life and no intention of doing so unless you continue to harass me and if you do she trailed off i expected better than threats from you deanna well looks like you were wrong again she strode to the door yanked it open now get out shaken he picked up his coat you owe me the courtesy of giving me the information you have i owe you nothing and if youre not out this door in five seconds im going to let out a scream thatll raise the roof on this building and bring the neighbors running youre making a mistake he said as he walked to the door a very big mistake happy holidays she told him then slammed the door and turned the bolt great show deanna marcie wiped at her eyes as deanna walked back into the dressing room it was great to have all those families of soldiers over in the gulf on together and those tapes from over there thanks marcie deanna walked over to the lighted makeup mirror and removed her earrings you know marcie its new years eve ive heard rumors its that time for out with the old in with the new pushing a hand through her hair deanna turned in front of the mirror critically studying left profile right full face and marcie my friend im feeling reckless oh yeah marcie stopped arranging her makeup case in preparation for bobby marks what kind of reckless like goingoutandpicking upstrangemenatcheapbars reckless i didnt say i was insane i said i was reckless how much time do you have free before bobby comes in about twenty minutes okay that should do it deanna boosted herself into the swivel chair then spun it away from the mirror change me marcie nearly gave in to the urge to rub her hands together youre serious deadly i had a nasty scene with a former relationship a few days ago i dont know if im going to have a job much less a career this time next month i may just be falling in love with a man who spends more time out of the country than in and in two weeks we could be at war tonight new years eve i will not be with the man i think i may be falling in love with but at a crowded party socializing with strangers because socializing with strangers is now part of my job so im feeling reckless marcie reckless enough to do something drastic marcie clipped the kneelength bib around deannas neck maybe youd better define drastic before i get started nope deanna inhaled deeply exhaled slowly i dont want to know surprise me you got it marcie picked up her spray bottle and dampened deannas hair you know ive been wanting to do this for weeks nows your chance make me a new woman little tangles of nerves formed in deannas stomach as marcie snipped and snipped she watched with a faltering heart as tresses of ebony hair hit the tiled floor at her feet you know what youre doing right trust me marcie told her as she snipped some more youre going to look fabulous distinctive ah distinctive wary deanna tried to turn toward the mirror no peeking marcie laid a firm hand on her shoulder its like going into a cold pool she explained if you try to ease it a little at a time its a hard miserable experience and sometimes you chicken out and back off before you get under if you do it all at once you have that one nifty shock then you love it she pursed her lips as she wielded the scissors you know maybe its more like losing your virginity holy shit marcie glanced up and grinned at cbcs resident television chef hiya bobby almost done here holy shit he said again and stepped inside to stare at deanna whatd you do dee i wanted a change her voice was weak as she started to lift a hand to her hair marcie pushed it away a cold pool she said darkly its a change all right bobby stepped back and shook his head hey can i have some of this hair stooping he picked up a handful i can have a toupee made hell i could have half a dozen oh god what have i done deanna squeezed her eyes tight dee whats keeping you we need to oh jesus fran stopped in the doorway one hand covering her gaping mouth the other pressed to her belly fran desperate deanna reached out fran fran i think i had a nervous breakdown its new years eve she babbled bobbys making toupees i think my life is flashing in front of my eyes you cut it fran managed after a moment you really cut it but itll grow back right deanna snatched a lock of hair from her bib right in five or ten years bobby predicted cheerfully and arranged some of deannas shorn locks atop his bald dome not quite soon enough to honor the clause i imagine you have in your contract restricting appearance changes oh god deannas already pale cheek went dead white i forgot i just didnt think i went a little crazy be sure to have your lawyer use that one with delacort bobby suggested theyll love it marcie said grimly shell see for herself in a minute marcie fluffed and combed unsatisfied she added a dab of gel working it in then styling with the concentration of a woman cutting diamonds now you just take a deep breath and hold it marcie advised unhooking the bib and dont say anything until you take a really good look no one spoke as marcie turned deanna slowly toward the mirror deanna stared at the reflection her lips parted in shock her eyes huge the long mane of hair was gone replaced by a short sleek cap with a saucy fringe of bangs in a daze she watched the woman in the mirror lift a hand touch the nape of her neck where the hair stopped it follows the shape of your face marcie said nervously when deanna only continued to stare and it shows off your eyes and eyebrows youve got these great dark eyebrows with this terrific natural arch your eyes are a little almondshaped and dramatic but they kind of got lost with all that hair i deanna let out a breath took another i love it you do as her knees buckled in relief marcie dropped into the chair beside her really deanna watched her own smile bloom i love it do you realize how many hours a week i had to devote to my hair why didnt i think of this before she grabbed a hand mirror to view the back this is going to save me almost eight hours a week an entire workday she picked up the earrings shed discarded and put them back on what do you think she asked fran not to diminish your timesaving priorities you look incredible the hip girlnextdoor bobby its sexy a cross between an amazon and a pixie and im sure delacort wont mind reshooting all the promos oh my god as the idea took root deanna turned to fran oh my god dont worry youll dazzle loren with it tonight then well work it into the next show postholiday blues sure sure thinking frantically fran gnawed on her lip ah something as simple and frivolous as a new hairstyle can give you that quick lift after the partys over ill buy it bobby decided now if you ladies dont mind i need to get into makeup i have a trout to saute early in the first light of the new year with a video of deannas hour playing on the tv a single lonely figure wandered a small dark room on the table where framed pictures of deanna beamed into the shadowy light a new treasure was laid a thick tress of ebony hair wrapped in gold cord it was soft to the touch soft as silk after a last caress the fingers wandered away toward the phone they dialed slowly so that the joy could be drawn out moments later deannas voice drifted through the receiver sleepy a bit uneasy bringing with it a silver spear of pleasure that lasted long after the receiver was replaced again chapter thirteen it was after two am in baghdad when finn reviewed his notes for the scheduled live broadcast on cbcs evening news he sat on the single chair that wasnt heaped with tapes or cable dragging on a fresh shirt while his mind honed ideas and observations into a report he tuned out his surroundings the noise of preparation the smell of cold food and the chatter his crew was spread around the suite checking equipment and tossing jokes a sense of humor particularly if it was dark helped cut the tension for the past two days they had hoarded food and bottled water it was january sixteenth maybe we should tie some sheets together curt suggested hang them outside the window like a big white flag no well send up my bears cap the engineer flicked a finger at its brim what redblooded american boys going to bomb a football fan i heard the pentagon told them to hit the hotels first finn glanced up from his notes and grinned you know how fed up cheney is with the press finn picked up the phone that connected him with chicago and caught the byplay at the news desk between commercials hey martin howd the bulls do last night as he spoke he moved in front of the window so that curt could get a video test of him against the night sky yeah its quiet here nerves are pretty high sos the antiamerican sentiment when the director cut in finn nodded got it theyre picking up the feed he told curt as he moved out onto the balcony well go on in the next segment in four minutes bring up the lights curt demanded i got a bad shadow here before anyone could move there was a rattling boom in the distance what the hell was that the engineer went pale and swallowed his gum thunder was that thunder oh jesus finn turned in time to see the searing glow of tracer rounds split the night sky martin you still there haversham he called to the director even as curt shifted the camera to the sky weve got explosions here the air raids started yes im sure get me on the air for gods sake get me on the goddamn air he heard the curses and cheers from the chicago control room then nothing but a statical hiss lost it fuck coolly he eyed the violent light show he didnt give a thought at the moment to one of those deadly lights striking the building every thought in his head was focused on transmitting the story keep running that tape you dont have to tell me twice curt was all but hanging over the railing look at that he shouted in a voice that was tight with nerves and excitement airraid sirens screamed over the crash of exploding shells we got ourselves a frontrow seat in frustration finn held his microphone out to record the sounds of battle get chicago back im trying the engineer worked controls with trembling hands im trying goddamn it eyes narrowed finn stalked to the balcony rail then turned to the camera if they couldnt go live at least theyd have tape baghdads night sky erupted at approximately two thirtyfive this morning there are flashes and the answering spears from antiaircraft flames shoot up from the horizon sporadically when he turned he saw with both awe and dull disbelief the searing comet trail of a tracer flash by at eye level its deadly eerie beauty made his blood pump what a visual oh christ did you get that did you get it he heard his engineer swear thinly as the building shook finn shoved his blowing hair out of his face and shouted into his mike the city is being rattled by the air raid the waiting is over its started he turned back to the engineer any luck no though his color was still gone he managed a wobbly grin i think our friendly hosts are going to be coming along pretty soon to evict us now finn grinned a quick reckless flash as deadly as rifle fire they have to find us first while finn taped his war report deanna sat numbed with boredom through another interminable dinner strains of monotonous piano music wafted through the ballroom of the hotel in indianapolis in addition to afterdinner speeches mediocre wine and rubber chicken all she had to look forward to was the long trip back to chicago at least she thought selfishly she wasnt suffering alone shed dragged jeff hyatt with her its not too bad he murmured as he swallowed a bite if you put enough salt on it she sent him a look that was nearly as bland as the meal thats what i love about you jeff always the optimist lets just see if you can smile about the fact that after we finish not eating this the station manager the head of sales and two of our advertisers are going to give speeches he thought about it a moment opted for water rather than wine well it could be worse im waiting we could be snowed in she shuddered please dont even joke about that i like these trips really head ducked he glanced at her then back to his plate going through the station meeting everyone watching them roll out the red carpet for you i like that part myself spending time at one of the affiliates and seeing all that enthusiasm for the show and most of the people are terrific she sighed and toyed with the lump of rice next to her chicken she was just tired she thought all of her life shed had a surplus of energy and now it seemed she was running on empty all those demands on time on her brain on her body celebrity shed discovered was not all glamour and limos for every perk there was a price for every richand famous elbow she rubbed there were half a dozen corporate dinners or latenight meetings for every magazine cover there were canceled social plans helming a daily show didnt simply mean having camera presence and good interviewing skills it meant being on call twentyfour hours a day you got what you asked for dee she reminded herself now stop whining and get to work with a determined smile she turned to the man beside her fred banks she remembered station owner golf enthusiast and hometown boy i cant tell you how much i enjoyed seeing your operation today she began you have a wonderful team he puffed up with pride i like to think so were number two now but we intend to be number one within the year your shows going to help us accomplish that i hope so she ignored the little ball of tension in her stomach her six months was almost up im told you were born right here in indianapolis thats right born and bred while he expounded on the delights of his hometown deanna made appropriate comments while her eyes scanned the room every table was circled by people who were in some way depending on her to make it and doing a good show wasnt enough shed done so that morning she thought nearly ten hours before if you didnt count time for makeup hair wardrobe and preproduction then thered been an interview a staff meeting phone calls to return mail to screen mail that had included another odd letter from what she was coming to think of as her most persistent fan you look like a sexy angel with your hair short i love the way you look i love you shed tucked the note away and had answered three dozen others all that before shed hopped a plane with jeff for indianapolis and the tour of the affiliate the meetings and handshakes with the local staff the business lunch the spot on the news and now this neverending banquet no a good show wasnt enough she had to be diplomat ambassador boss business partner and celebrity and she had to wear each and every hat correctly while pretending she wasnt lonely or worried about finn or missing those quiet hours when she could curl up with a book for pleasure rather than because shed be interviewing the author this was what she wanted deanna told herself and beamed at the waiter as he served the peach melba you can sleep on the plane going home jeff whispered in her ear it shows just a little she excused herself and pushed back from the table if she couldnt fix the fatigue at least she could fix its signs she was nearly at the doors when she heard someone tap on the podium mike automatically she looked back and saw fred banks standing under the lights if i can have your attention ive just received word that baghdad is under attack by un forces there was a buzzing in deannas ears dimly she heard the noise level rise in the ballroom like a sea at high tide from somewhere nearby a waiter raised a triumphant fist i hope they kick that bastards sorry butt slowly all fatigue washing away she walked back to the table she had a job to finish finn sat on the floor of a hotel bedroom his laptop on his knees he hammered out copy as fast as it could pass from his mind to his fingers it was nearly dawn now and though his eyes were gritty he felt no sense of fatigue outside the firefight continued inside a game of cat and mouse was under way during the past three hours they had moved twice hauling equipment and provisions while iraqi soldiers swept the building moving guests and international news crews to the basement of the hotel finn and his crew had slipped from room to room the successful intrigue had his blood pumping while he took his round at sentry duty his two companions sprawled on the bed and snatched sleep satisfied with the copy hed finished thus far finn turned off the computer he rose working out the kinks in his back in his neck and thinking wi lly of breakfast blueberry pancakes and gallons of hot coffee he made do with a handful of curts trail mix then hefted the camera at the window he recorded the final images of the first day of war the lightning flashes of cruise missiles and smart bombs the streaks of tracers he speculated on how much devastation they would see when dawn broke and how much they would get on tape im gonna have to report you to the union pal finn lowered the camera and glanced back at curt the cameraman was standing beside the bed rubbing his tired eyes youre just pissed because i can handle this baby as well as you shit challenged curt walked over to take the camera you cant do nothing but look pretty on tape then get ready to prove it ive got some copy to read youre the boss he rolled tape in silence as bombs exploded are we going to work on a way to get out of here ive got some contacts in baghdad finn watched the fires leaping from the horizon maybe the moment the last afterdinner speech was finished the last hand shaken the last cheek kissed deanna headed for a phone while deanna called fran and richard jeff used the phone beside her to contact the chicago newsroom what richard answered with a snarl what is it richard richard its deanna im on my way to the airport in indianapolis i heard about the air strike and yeah right we heard but weve got our own little crisis right here frans in labor were just about to head out to the hospital now because it felt like her circuits were about to overload deanna pressed her fingers hard against her temple i thought we had another ten days tell that to big ed breathe fran dont forget to breathe look i wont hold you up just tell me if shes okay she just finished half a pizza thats why she didnt tell me she was in labor she already contacted bach looks like youre going to be preempted tomorrow no damn it youre not going to talk to her fran youre going to breathe ill be there as soon as i can tell her oh jesus just tell her ill be there im counting on it hey were going to have a baby see you with the line buzzing in her ear deanna rested her brow against the wall what a day finn riley reported the air strike what alert again she spun around to jeff finn hes all right then he was on the line with the studio when it hit he got about five seconds of pictures across before they lost the feed so we dont know she said slowly hey hes been through stuff like this before right he put a hesitant arm around her shoulders as he led her out to their waiting car yes of course of course he has and look at it this way were getting out of here at least an hour early because everybody wanted to get home and turn on the tube she nearly laughed youre good for me jeff he beamed back at her same goes it was six am when deanna finally unlocked the door to her apartment and staggered inside shed been up for a full twentyfour hours and was long past fatigue but she reminded herself shed fulfilled her professional obligations and shed seen her goddaughter born aubrey deanna myers she mused and smiled blearily as she walked to the bedroom an eightpound miracle with red hair after watching that incredibly beautiful life slide into the world it was hard to believe there was a war raging on the other side of the world but as she tugged off her clothes unspeakably grateful that her show was preempted that morning she switched on the television and brought that war into her home what time was it in baghdad she wondered but her mind simply wouldnt cope with the math wearily she sat on the edge of the bed in her underwear and tried to concentrate on the images and reports be careful damn you it was her last thought as she slid down over the bedspread and tumbled into sleep late during the second night of the gulf war finn set up at a saudi base he was tired and hungry and longed for a bath he could hear the roar of jets taking off from the airfield to make their way to iraq other news teams he knew would be broadcasting reports his mood was foul as a result of the pentagons restrictions on the press he would have to wait his turn in the pool before he could travel to the front and then he could go only where military officials instructed for the first time since world war ii all reports would be subject to censorship it was one of the few words finn considered an obscenity dont you want to take time to shave that pretty face cram it curt were on in ten he listened to the countdown in his earpiece in the predawn hours of day two of desert storm he began on her couch in chicago deanna leaned forward and studied finns image onscreen tired she thought he looked terribly tired but tough and ready and alive she toasted him with her diet soda as she ate the peanut butter sandwich shed fixed for dinner she wondered what he was thinking what he was feeling as he spoke of sorties and statistics or answered the scripted questions of the news anchor the arabian sky spread at his back and occasionally he had to raise his voice over the sound of jet engines were glad that youre safely out of baghdad finn and well stay tuned for further reports thanks martin for cbc this is finn riley in saudi arabia good seeing you finn deanna murmured then sighed and rose to take her dishes into the kitchen it wasnt until she passed her answering machine that she noticed the rapid blink of the message light oh hell how could i have forgotten setting the dishes aside she pushed rewind shed slept a blissful six hours then had rushed out again a stop by the hospital a few hours at the office where chaos had reigned that chaos and the war talk had driven her out again with a thick file of clippings and a bag of mail shed worked the rest of the evening ignoring the phone without checking her messages having a baby and a war was certainly distracting she thought as she hit play there was a call from her mother one from simon dutifully she scribbled the messages on a pad there were two hangups each with a long pause before the click of the receiver kansas deanna dropped her pencil as finns voice filled the room where the hell are you it must be five am there ive only got this line for a minute were out of baghdad christ the place is a mess i dont know when ill be able to get through again so catch me on the news ill be thinking about you deanna god its hard to think about anything else buy yourself a couple of flannel shirts will you and some wading boots it can get cold at the cabin write okay send a tape a smoke signal and let me know why the hell youre not answering your phone later and he was gone deanna was reaching down to press rewind and listen to the message again when loren bachs voice flowed out jesus h christ youre a hard woman to get in touch with i called your office and your secretary said you were at the hospital scared the life out of me until she explained it was fran having her baby heard its a girl dont know why the hell youre not home yet but heres the deal delacort would like to renew your contract for two years our people will be contacting your agent but i wanted to be the first to tell you congratulations deanna she couldnt have said why but she sat down on the floor covered her face with her hands and wept things moved quickly over the next five weeks at home and away with the new contract with delacort signed and sealed deanna found both her budget and her hopes expanding she was able to add to her staff and furnish a separate office for fran when she returned from maternity leave best of all the ratings began a slow steady climb during the first weeks of the new year she had ten cities now and though she still fell behind angelas whenever the shows were scheduled head to head the margin had slimmed to celebrate the success she bought a softly patterned aubusson carpet to replace the fleamarket rug in her living room it went she thought perfectly with the desk she had a cover on womans day scheduled for april a feature in people and for old times sake agreed to appear on a segment of woman talk the chicago tribune did a sunday spread calling her a star on the rise she turned down with a combination of amusement and horror an offer to pose for playboy when the red light blinked on deanna was seated on set she smiled slipping easily comfortably into thousands of homes do you remember your first love that first kiss that made your heart beat faster the long talks the secret glances she sighed and had the audience sighing with her today were going to reunite three couples who remember very well janet hornesby was sweet sixteen when she had her first romance that was fifty years ago but she hasnt forgotten the young boy who stole her heart that spring the camera began to pan the panel focusing on giddy nervous smiles as deanna continued to speak robert seinfield was just eighteen when he left his high school sweetheart and moved two thousand miles away with his family though a decade has passed he still thinks of rose the girl who wrote him his first love letter and twentythree years ago college plans and family pressures separated theresa jamison from the man shed thought shed marry i think our guests today are wondering what if i know i am well find out after this god great show fran aubrey snug in a baby saque at her torso marched out on the set i think mrs hornesby and her fellow might have a second chance what are you doing here i wanted aubrey to see where her mother works nestling the baby she looked longingly around the set ive missed this place fran youve just had a baby yeah i heard about that you know dee you should think about a followup show people love the sentimental stuff if any of those three couples get together you could do a kind of anniversary thing ive already thought of that deanna stepped back hands on hips well she said after a minute you look good really i feel good really but as much as i love being a mom i hate being a homebody i need work or im liable to do something drastic like take up needlepoint we couldnt let that happen lets go up and talk about it i want to say hi to the crew first ill be up in the office when youre finished smiling smugly deanna headed to the elevator shed won her fiftydollar bet with richard hed been positive shed last two full months on the ride up to the sixteenth floor she glanced at her watch and calculated time cassie she began the minute she stepped into the outer office see if you can reschedule my lunch meeting for onethirty no problem great show by the way word is the phones were going crazy we aim to please with her schedule in mind she dropped down behind her desk to study the mail cassie had stacked for her fran stopped by downstairs shell be up in a few minutes with the baby she brought the baby oh i cant wait to see her she stopped disturbed by the expression on deannas face is something wrong wrong baffled deanna shook her head i dont know cassie do you know how this got here she held up a plain white envelope that carried only her name it was already on your desk when i brought the other mail in why its just weird ive been getting these notes on and off since last spring she turned the paper around so cassie could read it deanna youre so beautiful your eyes look into my soul ill love you forever cassie pursed her lips i guess its flattering and pretty tame compared to some of the letters you get are you worried about it not worried maybe a little uneasy it doesnt seem quite healthy for someone to keep this up for so long are you sure theyve all been from the same person same type of envelope same type of message in the same type of red print distress curled loosely in her stomach maybe its someone who works in the building someone she saw every day spoke with worked with anyone been asking you out or coming on to you what no with an effort deanna shook off the eerie mood then shrugged its stupid harmless she said as if to convince herself then deliberately tore the page in two and tossed it in the trash lets see what business we can clear up before noon cassie okay did you happen to catch angelas special last night of course deanna grinned you didnt think id miss my toughest competitions first primetime program did you she did a nice job not all the reviewers thought so cassie tapped the clippings on deannas desk the one from the times was a killer automatically deanna reached into the stack and read the first clipped review pompous and shallow she winced by turns simpering and sniping the ratings werent what they expected either cassie told her they werent embarrassing but they were hardly stellar the post called her selfaggrandizing thats just her style it was a little much doing that tour of her penthouse for the camera and cooing about new york and there were more shots of her than her guests cassie shrugged grinned i counted i imagine this will be tough for her to take deanna set the reviews aside again but shell bounce back she shot cassie a warning look ive had my problems with her but i dont wish hatchet reviews on anyone i wouldnt either i just dont want you to be hurt by her bullets bounce off me deanna said dryly now lets forget about angela im sure im the last thing on her mind this morning angelas initial tantrum over the reviews had resulted in a snowstorm of shredded newspaper it littered the floor of her office she ground newsprint into the pink pile as she paced those bastards arent getting away with taking a slice at me dan gardner the new executive producer of angelas wisely waited until the worst of the storm had passed he was thirty built like a middleweight with a compact muscular body his conservatively styled brown hair suited his boyish face accented by dark blue eyes and subtly clefted chin he had a shrewd mind and a simple goal to ride to the top on whatever vehicle could get him there the fastest angela everyone knows reviews are crap he poured her a soothing cup of tea it was a pity he thought that their strategy of allowing no previews of the first show had failed those jerks always take cheap shots at whoevers on top and thats just where you are he handed her the delicate china cup on top damn right i am tea slopped over into the saucer as she whirled away fury was better than tears she knew no one absolutely no one would have the satisfaction of seeing how hurt she was shed been so proud showing off her new home sharing her life with her audience they had called it simpering and the ratings would have proved it she snapped back if it hadnt been for this damn war the goddamn viewers just cant get enough of the fucking thing day and night night and day were bombarded why dont we just blow the damn country off the map and be done with it tears were close perilously close she battled them back and sipped the tea like medicine she wanted a drink its not hurting us your leadin to the six oclock news has come up in five markets and the viewers loved your remote at andrews air force base last week well im sick of it she hurled the teacup at the wall sending shards flying and drops splattering over the silk wallpaper and im sick of that little bitch in chicago trying to undermine my ratings shes a flash in the pan he hadnt even jolted at the explosion hed been expecting it now that it was done he knew she could begin to calm and when shed calmed shed be needy hed been seeing to angelas needs for several months in a year shell be old news and youll still be number one she sat behind her desk leaning back eyes shut she was slipping nothing seemed to be going the way shed planned when shed formed her production company she was in charge yes but there was so much to do so many demands so many many ways to fail but she couldnt fail could never face that she calmed herself by taking long slow breaths just as she did during bouts of stage fright it was much more productive she reminded herself to focus on someone elses failure youre right once deanna bottoms out shell be lucky to get a gig on public access and she had something that might hurry that fine day along as the smile curved angelas lips dan walked behind the chair to massage the tension from her shoulders you just relax let me do all the worrying she liked the feel of his hands on her gentle competent sure they made her feel protected safe she so desperately needed that now they love me dont they dan of course they do his hands trailed up to her neck then brushed down over her breasts they were soft and heavy and never failed to arouse him his voice thickened as he felt her nipples harden between the light pinch of his thumb and forefinger everybody loves angela and theyll keep watching she sighed relaxing as his hands molded her every day coast to coast every day she murmured and her smile widened go lock the door dan tell lorraine to hold my calls id love to chapter fourteen during the frigid nights in the desert it was hard to remember the blazing heat of day just as after the first bombs exploded it was difficult to remember the deadly tedium of the long weeks of desert shield finn had been through other wars though hed never been so hamstrung by military regulations there were ways however for the enterprising reporter to stretch them he would never have denied that certain sensitive intelligence data couldnt be broadcast without endangering troops but he wasnt a fool nor was he blindly ambitious he saw his job and his duty as finding out what was happening not just what the official reports claimed was happening twice he and curt climbed into his rented truck with a portable satellite dish bracketed in the bed and headed out over the poorly marked roads and the shifting sand they managed to link up with us troops finn listened to complaints and to hopes and returned to base to report both he watched scuds fly and patriots intercept them he slept in snatches and lived with the possibility of a chemical assault when the ground war began he was ready eager to follow it into kuwait city it would be called the mother of battles the hundred hours of fierce fighting to liberate kuwait while allied troops took up positions along the euphrates river along the highways linking kuwait to other cities iraqis fled hustling as one trooper told finn to get out of dodge there were massive traffic jams trapped tanks abandoned possessions from a dusty truck heading toward the city finn observed the wreckage mile after mile of shattered vehicles lined the road cars stripped for parts tilted on crates personal possessions littered the roadway mattresses blankets frying pans and ammo clips incredibly a chandelier its crystals gleaming in the sun lay on the sand like scattered jewels and worse much worse was the occasional corpse lets get some tape of this finn stepped out of the truck his boots crunching down on one of the cassette tapes that were blowing across the highway looks like the garage sale from hell curt commented crazy bastards must have been looting on their way out it always comes down to getting your own doesnt it finn pointed toward a swatch of hot pink flapping from beneath an overturned truck the evening gown shimmered with sequins where the hell did she expect to wear that finn prepared for a standup as curt set up his equipment he hadnt thought anything else could surprise him not after seeing the pathetically gaunt iraqi soldiers wearily surrendering to allied troops seeing the fear and fatigue and the relief on their faces as they emerged from their foxholes in the desert he hadnt thought anything else about war could affect him not the torn bodies the atrocities of scavengers or the stink of death cooking under the merciless sun but that flap of pink silk rustling seductively in the desert wind turned his stomach it was worse inside the city the raw nerves the anger the devastation all coated in a layer of oily soot from the fires that depleted kuwaits lifeblood of oil when the wind blew toward the city the sky would darken with smoke midday would become midnight the seaside was dotted with mines and explosions rocked the city several times a day gunfire continued not only in celebratory bursts but in savage driveby attacks on kuwaiti soldiers survivors searched the cemetery for the remains of loved ones many of whom had suffered torture and worse through all he observed through all he reported finn continued to think of a sequined evening gown billowing out of the sand like the rest of the world deanna watched the end of the war on television she listened to the reports on the liberation of kuwait the official ceasefire the statistics of victory it became a habit to drop into the newsroom before she left the cbc building hoping for a few scraps of information that hadnt yet been aired but the reality of daytoday responsibilities kept her grounded whenever she had a free night she watched the late news then slipped in a tape of that mornings show in the privacy of her apartment she could watch herself critically searching for ways to improve her onair skills or to tighten the overall format she sat crosslegged on the floor comfortable in sweatshirt and jeans a notepad open across her knees the earrings were wrong she noted every time she moved her head they swung a distraction for the viewer she thought and wrote no more dangling earrings and the hand gestures were too broad if she didnt watch it shed end up being parodied on saturday night live she should be so lucky she thought with a grin and scribbled on her pad did she touch people too much nibbling her lips deanna watched she always seemed to be laying a hand on a guests arm or circling an audience members shoulder maybe she should the knock on the door had her swearing her schedule didnt allow for unexpected visitors after ten grudgingly she switched off the vcr she glimpsed through the peephole then she was tugging at locks dragging at the chain finn i didnt know you were back she didnt know who moved first in a heartbeat they were wrapped together his mouth hard on hers her hands fisted in his hair the explosion of need rattled them both the swell of heat the blast of power the bomb detonated inside her leaving emotions shattered needs raw then he was kicking the door closed as they tumbled to the floor she didnt think couldnt think not with his mouth burning on hers and his hands already urgently possessing like tussling children they rolled over the rug the only sounds incoherent murmurs and strained breathing it wasnt dreamlike but stark reality the only reality that mattered his hands were rough streaking under the fleece of her shirt to take digging into her hips to press her fiercely against him she seemed to be erupting beneath him with short static bursts of energy her skin was hot smooth unbearably soft he wanted to taste it to devour it to consume the flavor of her flesh and blood and bone her mouth wasnt enough her throat her shoulder where he dragged the shirt down he felt like an animal rabid and starving and wanted to glory in it yet he knew he could hurt her would hurt her if he didnt harness the worst of the need deanna he wished he could find some spark of tenderness within the furnace that roared inside him let me he lifted his head struggling to clear his vision hed barely looked at her he realized the moment shed opened the door and said his name his control had snapped now she was vibrating like a plucked string beneath him her eyes huge and dark her mouth swollen and her skin he brought his fingertips to her cheek stroking over the flushed damp flesh tears hed always considered them a womans greatest weapon shaken he brushed them away and cleared his throat did i knock you down i dont know she felt like a jumble of nerve ends and sparks i dont care slowly beautifully her smile bloomed she framed his face in her hands welcome home she let their slow quiet kiss soothe them both ive been told i have considerable finesse with women taking her hand he closed it into a loose fist and pressed it to his lips though it might be hard for you to believe at the moment id rather not ask for corroboration his grin flashed look why dont we he trailed off as he stroked a hand over her hair confused he pulled back eyes narrowed and studied her what in the hell did you do to your hair in automatic defense she combed her fingers through it i cut it new years eve her smile wavered the viewers like it three to one we did a poll its shorter than mine with a half laugh he moved back to squat on his haunches come here let me get a good look without waiting for assent he hauled her to a sitting position she sat pouting a little her eyes daring him and the lamplight glowing over the glistening cap i was tired of dealing with it she muttered when he only continued his silent study this saves me hours a week and it suits the shape of my face it looks good on camera umhmm fascinated he reached out to toy with her earlobe then skimmed his finger down the side of her throat either several months of celibacy is playing hell with my libido or youre the sexiest woman alive delighted flustered she hugged her knees you look pretty good yourself you know theyre calling you the desert hunk he winced after the ribbing hed taken from his associates he was hardpressed to find the humor in it itll pass i dont know theres already a fan club here in chicago seeing that he could be embarrassed only amused her you did look pretty hunky with scuds flying in the sky behind you or with tanks rolling across the sand at your back especially since you didnt shave for a couple of days once the ground war started water was at a premium her amusement faded was it bad bad enough he took her hand gently now remembering to appreciate the elegance that was what he needed the warm reality of her maybe in a day or two the things hed seen the things hed heard would fade a little do you want to talk about it no you look tired she could see now how drawn he was beneath the desert tan when did you get back about an hour ago i came straight here even as her heart picked up rhythm she responded to the weariness in his eyes why dont i fix you something to eat you can get your bearings he kept her hand in his wishing he could explain to her to himself how much steadier he felt being here being close i wouldnt turn down a sandwich especially if it came with a beer i can probably handle that she got to her feet gave his hand a tug come on stretch out on the couch relax with carson while youre eating ill fill you in on all the news and gossip from cbc he rose waiting until shed punched the remote are you going to let me stay tonight deanna she looked back at him her eyes huge but steady yes turning quickly she walked into the kitchen her hands were trembling she realized and it was wonderful her whole body was quivering in response to that long last look hed given her before shed rushed away she didnt know what it would be like but she knew that shed never wanted anyone more the months of separation hadnt stunted the emotions that had begun growing inside her and that first greedy kiss as theyd tumbled heedless to the floor had been more stunning more erotic than any fantasy shed woven while shed waited for him to come back hed come to her she pressed a hand to her stomach nerves were jittering she thought but they were good nerves hot and strong not cold cowardly ones tonight she would take the step she would reclaim herself because she wanted deanna thought because she chose putting a sandwich of cold ham and cheese on a platter she added a pilsner of beer she lifted the tray and smiled to herself desire was as basic and human as hunger once they had satisfied the latter she would take him to her bed into her body i could put together something hot she said as she carried the tray back into the living room theres a can of soup in the deanna broke off and stared carnac the magnificent was on a roll ed was hooting in response and finn riley the desert hunk was sleeping like a baby hed pried off his battered hightops but hadnt bothered to remove his jacket unrelenting work travel and jet lag had finally taken their toll he lay flat on his stomach his face smashed into one of deannas satin pillows his arm dangling limply over the edge of the couch finn deanna set the tray aside and put a hand on his shoulder when she shook him he didnt stir a hundred and sixty pounds of exhausted male resigned she went for a spare blanket and tucked it around him she locked the front door secured the chain switching the lamp to low she sat down on the floor in front of him our timing she said quietly and kissed his cheek continues to suck with a sigh she picked up the sandwich and tried to fill the void of sexual frustration with food and television finn pulled out of the dream chilled with sweat the fading vision behind his eyes was horrid the body riddled with bullets at his feet blood and gore staining the pink silk and sequins of the tattered evening gown in the quiet light of morning he struggled to sit up rubbing his hands over his face disoriented he tried to get his bearings hotel room what city what country a plane a taxi deanna remembering finn let his head fall back against the cushions and moaned first hed tossed her to the floor then hed passed out a rousing segment in the frustrating journal of their romance he was surprised she hadnt dragged him out of the apartment by the feet and left him snoring in the hall fighting free of the blanket he staggered up he swayed a moment his body still floating with fatigue hed have killed for coffee he supposed that was why he thought he smelled some brewing after months in the desert he knew that mirages werent only the result of heat but of desperate human desires he rolled his stiff shoulders and swore christ he didnt want to think about desires but maybe it wasnt too late a quick injection of instant coffee and he could slip into bed with deanna and make up for his neglect the night before blearyeyed he stumbled toward the kitchen she was no mirage standing there in a beam of sunlight looking fresh and lovely in slacks and a sweater pouring gloriously scented coffee into a red ceramic mug deanna oh she jolted nearly upending the mug you startled me i was concentrating on some mental notes for the show she set the pot down brushed suddenly damp hands down her hips howd you sleep like a rock i dont know whether to be embarrassed or apologetic but if you share that coffee ill be anything you want theres nothing to be embarrassed or apologetic about but she couldnt meet his eyes as she reached for the mug you were exhausted he lightly stroked a hand over her hair how angry are you im not but her gaze cut away from his when she pushed the mug into his hand do you want cream or sugar no if not angry what its hard to explain there wasnt enough room in the kitchen she realized and he was blocking the way out ive really got to go finn my driver will be here in a few minutes he stood his ground try to explain this isnt easy for me unnerved she snapped out the words and turned away im not experienced in morningafter conversation nothing happened thats not the point not really i wasnt thinking last night i couldnt when i saw you i was overwhelmed by what was happening what i was feeling no ones ever wanted me the way you did last night and i blew it no longer interested in coffee he set the mug carefully on the counter im sorry maybe i shouldnt have stopped that first mad rush but i was afraid id hurt you she turned slowly her eyes reflecting her confusion you werent hurting me i would have christ deanna i could have eaten you alive and tearing into you on the floor it was he thought bitterly of angela it was too careless thats my point not on your side finn on mine i was careless and thats not like me there seemed to be nothing she could do with her hands she lifted them let them fall as he continued to stand and study her the feelings youve stirred up arent like me and the way things turned out she tugged at her earlobe it gave me time to think great he snatched up the mug again and took a long drink terrific i havent changed my mind she said as she watched his eyes darken but we need to talk before this goes any further once i explain once you understand i hope we can keep going there was a plea in her eyes something she needed from him he didnt have to know what it was to respond crossing to her he cupped her chin in his hands and kissed her lightly okay well talk tonight nerves vanished in relief yes tonight fate must be looking out for me its the first free weekend ive had in two months come to my place as her body softened beautifully against his he kissed her again lingering persuasive theres something i very much want to do he nipped at her lip until her eyes fluttered closed yes i very mmm very much he traced her lips with his tongue dipped slowly inside to savor want to cook for you so whats he going to cook i didnt ask briskly deanna checked over her wardrobe list noting the dates that certain skirts blazers blouses and accessories had been worn she had a production assistant who dated and tagged each piece listing not only when it had been worn but in combination with what other items its pretty serious when a man cooks for you especially on a friday night fran kept one eye on aubrey who was taking a peaceful nap in the portacrib very highpowered wooing maybe deanna smiled at the idea meticulously she began to arrange her choices for the following weeks line up of shows i plan on enjoying it my instincts tell me hes good for you id like a little more time to check him out personally but the look on your face when you came in this morning was almost enough what kind of look happiness strictly feminine happiness different from the gleam in your eye when delacort renewed us or when we got picked up by six new stations how about when we moved into first place in columbus even different from that this is allimportant the show what youre able to do with it the way youve shifted things around so i can bring aubrey to work i want her here too deanna reminded her nobody on staff is going to have to make the choice between parenthood and career which brings up a topic idea i had fran picked up her clipboard shoot finding ways to incorporate day care into the workplace right in office buildings and factories i read an article about this restaurant familyrun they have what amounts to a preschool right off the kitchen ive already given margaret the clipping ill check it out good now let me tell you my idea about jeff jeff what about him hes doing a good job wouldnt you say id say hes doing a great one fran glanced over as aubrey sighed in her sleep hes totally devoted to you and the show and hes a wizard at cutting through the fat he wants to direct pleased that shed been able to surprise fran deanna sat back he hasnt said anything to me to anyone he wouldnt but ive watched him you can see it by the way he hangs around the studio talking to the cameramen the techs every time we get a new director jeff all but interrogates him hes an editor i was a reporter deanna pointed out i want to give him a shot god knows we need a permanent director somebody who can slide into the groove who understands my rhythm i think hell fit the bill what as executive producer do you think ill talk to him fran said after a moment if hes interested weve got a show scheduled for next week on video dating its light we could test him out on it good deanna cassie stood in the doorway a newspaper rolled tight in her hand dont tell me ive only got twenty minutes before shooting the new promo and after that ive got to get across town and charm the chicago chapter of now i swear warden i wasnt trying to make a break for it deanna cassie repeated there was no humor in her eyes only distress i think you should see this what is it oh not the tabloids again prepared to be mildly irked she took the paper from cassie unfolded it and glanced at the screaming headline oh my god her knees went to jelly as she groped behind her for a chair oh fran take it easy honey let me see fran eased deanna down into a chair and took the paper secret life of americas girl next door midwests darling a party hardy college girl deannas former lover tells all there was a big red exclusive bannering the corner and a sidebar hinting at wild nights drunken orgies sex on the fiftyyard line beneath a recent photo of deanna beside her was a grainy photograph of a man shed tried to forget that son of a bitch fran exploded that lying bastard why the hell did he go to the tabs with this hes dripping with money who knows why anyone does anything sickened deanna stared at the bold headlines the frightened broken girl she had been resurfaced he got his picture in the paper didnt he honey fran quickly turned the paper over nobodys going to believe that trash of course they are fran her eyes were bright and hard theyll believe it because it makes titillating copy and most people wont get past the headlines anyway theyll scan them when theyre checking out in the supermarket maybe theyll read the copy on the front page even flip through to the inside then theyll go home and chat about the story with their neighbors its crap exploitive crap and anybody with a working brain knows it i just thought you should know cassie handed deanna a cup of water i didnt want you finding out from someone else you were right cassie pressed her lips together youve gotten some calls on it including one which she would not pass on from marshall pike ill handle them later let me see fran im going to fucking burn this rag let me see deanna repeated i cant deal with it if i dont know what it says fran reluctantly handed the paper to her as with the worst of tabloid press there was just enough truth mixed in with the lies to have impact she had indeed gone to yale and she had dated jamie thomas a star tackle yes she had attended a postgame party with him in the autumn of her junior year shed danced shed flirted shed consumed more alcohol than might have been wise she certainly had taken a walk to the playing field with him on that cool clear night and she had laughed as hed rushed over the grass tackling invisible opponents shed even laughed when hed tackled her but the story didnt say that shed stopped laughing very quickly there was no mention of fear of outrage of sobbing in jamies recollection she hadnt fought she hadnt screamed in his version he hadnt left her alone her clothes torn her body bruised he didnt say how shed wept on that chilly grass her spirit shattered and her innocence violently stolen well deanna brushed a tear from her cheek he hasnt changed his story over the years maybe hes embellished it a little more but thats to be expected i think we should contact legal it took all of frans control to speak calmly you should sue jamie thomas and the paper for libel dee youre not going to let him get away with it i let him get away with a lot worse didnt i very neatly very deliberately she folded the paper then tucked it into her purse cassie please clear my schedule after the now meeting i know it may cause some problems no problem cassie said instantly ill take care of it cancel everything fran told her no i can do what i have to do deanna picked up her sweater however steady her voice her movements her eyes were devastated then ill go with you youre not going home alone im not going home at all theres someone i need to talk to ill be fine she squeezed frans arm really ill see you monday damn it dee let me help you always have i really have to do this one thing alone ill call you she didnt expect the explanation to be easy but she hadnt known she would find herself sitting in the driveway beside finns beautiful old house fighting for the courage to walk up and knock on the door she sat watching the bare limbs of the spreading maples tremble in the high march wind she wanted to watch the strong white sunlight flash and gleam off the tall graceful windows and glint off the tiny flecks of mica in the weathered stone such a sturdy old house she thought with its curving gables and arrowstraight chimneys it looked like a dependable place a haven against storms and wind she wondered if hed chosen to give himself some personal calm away from the chaos of his work she wondered if it would offer her any bracing herself she stepped from the car walked along the walkway of stones and stepped up onto the covered porch hed had painted a deep glossy blue there was a brass knocker in the shape of an irish harp she stared at it a long time before she knocked deanna he smiled holding out a hand in welcome its a little early for dinner but i can fix you a late lunch i need to talk to you so you said he let his hand drop when she didnt take it then closed the door you look pale hell he thought she looked as fragile as glass why dont you sit down id like to sit she followed him into the first room off the hallway her first distracted glimpse of the room simply registered man no frills no flounces just sturdy dignified old pieces that murmured of easy wealth and masculine taste she chose a highbacked chair in front of the fire that burned low the warmth was comforting without asking he walked to a curved cabinet and chose a decanter of brandy whatever was preying on her mind went deep enough to make her withdraw drink this first then tell me whats on your mind she sipped then started to speak finish it he interrupted impatiently ive seen wounded soldiers with more color than you have right now she sipped again more deeply and felt the heat fight with the ice shivering in her stomach theres something i want to show you she opened her bag took out the paper you should read this first he glanced down ive already seen it in a gesture of disdain he tossed it aside youve got more sense than to let that kind of tripe get to you did you read it i stopped reading poorly written fiction when i was ten read it now deanna insisted please he studied her another minute concerned and confused all right she couldnt sit after all while he read deanna got up to wander around the room her hands reaching nervously for mementos and knickknacks she heard the paper rattle in his hands heard him swear quietly viciously under his breath but she didnt look back you know finn said at length at least they could hire people who can write a decent sentence a glance at her rigid back made him sigh he tossed the paper aside again he rose crossing to lay his hands on her shoulders deanna dont she stepped away quickly shaking her head for christs sake youve got too much sense to let some sloppy journalism turn you inside out he couldnt stem the impatience or the vague disappointment in her reaction youre in the spotlight you chose to be toughen up kansas or go back and stick with the noon news did you believe it she whirled around her arms folded tight across her chest for the life of him he couldnt figure out how to handle her he tried for mild amusement that you were some sort of nubile nymphomaniac if you were how could you have resisted me for so long he was hoping for a laugh and would have settled for an angry retort he got nothing but frozen silence its not all a lie she said at length you mean you actually went to a couple of parties in college you popped the top on a few beers and had a fling with a jock he shook his head well im shocked and disillusioned im glad i found this out before i asked you to marry me and have my children again his joke didnt make her laugh her eyes went from blank to devastated and she burst into terrible tears oh christ dont baby come on deanna dont do this nothing could have unmanned him more awkward cursing himself he gathered her close determined to hold her tight even when she resisted im sorry for what he couldnt say im sorry baby he raped me she shouted jerking away when his arms went limp he raped me she repeated covering her face with her hands as the tears fell hot and burning and i didnt do anything about it i wont do anything now because it hurts her voice broke on a sob as she rocked back and forth it never never stops hurting he couldnt have been more shocked more horrified for a moment everything in him froze and he could only stand and stare as she wept uncontrollably into her hands with the sun at her back and the fire crackling cheerfully beside her then the ice inside him broke exploded with a burst of fury so ripe so raw that his vision hazed his hands curled into fists as if there were something tangible he could pummel but there was nothing but deanna weeping his arms dropped to his sides again leaving him feeling helpless and miserable relying on instinct he scooped her up carried her to the couch where he could sit cradled her in his lap until the worst of the tears were spent i was going to tell you she managed i spent last night thinking about it i wanted you to know before we tried to be together he had to get past the anger somehow but his jaw was clenched and his words sharp did you think it would change anything i feel for you i dont know but i know it scars you and no matter how many ways youre able to go on with your life its always in there since it happened she took the handkerchief he offered and mopped at her face i havent been able to put it aside far enough or deep enough to feel able to make love with a man the hand that was stroking her hair faltered only a moment he remembered vividly the way he had plunged in the night before and the way he would have initiated the physical end of their relationship if something hadnt restrained him im not cold she said in a tight bitter voice im not deanna he eased her head back so that she would meet his eyes youre the warmest woman i know last night there was nothing there but you i had no time to think this morning it didnt seem fair for you not to know first because if things didnt work physically it would be my fault not yours i think thats the first really stupid thing ive ever heard you say but well put it aside for now if you want to talk this through ill listen i do but she shifted away so that she could sit on her own everyone on campus knew jamie thomas he was a year ahead of me and like most of the other women in college i had a crush on him so when he made a move in my direction at the beginning of my junior year i was flattered and dazzled he was a football star and a track star and he had a threepointoh average i admired that and his plans to go into the family firm he had brains and ambition a good sense of humor everybody liked him so did i she took a steadying breath let herself remember we saw a lot of each other during the first couple months of that semester we studied together and went for long walks and had all those deep philosophical discussions college students can be so smug about i sat in the stands at football games and cheered him on she paused we went to a party after the biggest game of the season hed had a terrific game everybody was celebrating and we got a little drunk we went back to the field just he and i and he started to run through all these football moves clowning around then he stopped clowning and he was on top of me it seemed all right at first but he got really rough and he frightened me i told him to stop but he wouldnt stop cut the act dee you know you want it youve been begging for it all night she shuddered gripping her hands tight and i started crying begging him and he was so strong and i couldnt get away he was tearing my clothes he was hurting me goddamn tease i called for help but there was no one i screamed he put his hand over my mouth when i screamed he had big hands and i could only see his face youre going to love it babe his eyes were glazed like glass and he was inside me it hurt so much i thought he would kill me but he didnt stop he didnt stop until hed finished after a while it seemed like such a long time he rolled off me and he laughed come on dee you know you had fun ask around nobody makes the women happy like good old jamie then he stopped laughing and he got angry because i was crying i couldnt stop crying dont pull that shit with me we both wanted it you say anything different and half the football team will say you made it with them right here right on the fucking fiftyyard line he yanked me up stuck his face in mine and he warned me that if i tried to pretend i hadnt been willing no one would believe me because he was jamie thomas and everyone liked jamie so he left me there and i didnt do anything because i was ashamed the grainy newspaper photo swam into finns mind and he struggled against the violence that rose in him but he kept his tone even didnt you have anyone to go to i told fran her nails were biting into her palm and slowly deliberately she relaxed her hand after a couple of weeks i couldnt hide it from her she wanted to go to the dean but i wouldnt she stared down at her own hands and felt the hot shame wash over her again she finally bullied me into counseling after a while i got over the worst of it i dont want it to control my life finn she looked at him then eyes swollen and full of grief i dont want it to spoil what we may be able to have he was afraid any words he tried might be the wrong ones deanna i cant tell you it doesnt matter because it does when she dropped her gaze he touched her cheek urging her eyes back up to his because i cant stand the thought of you being hurt that way and because you may not be able to trust me it isnt that she said quickly its me then let me do something for you gently he kissed her forehead come to the cabin with me now today just a weekend alone where we can relax finn i dont know if i can give you what you want i dont care about what you can give me im more interested in what we can give each other chapter fifteen she supposed he called the place a cabin because it was built of wood far from the primitive box shed imagined the trim twostory structure had upper and lower covered decks joined by open stairs outside the cedar shingles had silvered with weather and time and were accented by deep blue shutters tall spreading yews tucked the house into its own private reserve instead of a lawn rocks low evergreens flowering bushes herbs and hardy perennials covered the ground a few brave crocuses were already peeking through you garden how did you learn i read a lot of books finn hauled their suitcases from the trunk while deanna stood at the head of the gravel drive and looked around i never know how long ill be away so grass wasnt practical i didnt like the idea of hiring a lawn service its mine faintly embarrassed by the statement he shrugged so i spent a few weeks putting in stuff that wouldnt need a lot of attention its beautiful hed wanted her to think so he realized itll look better in another month or two lets go inside ill start a fire then show you around she followed him up to the porch ran her hand along the arm of a rocking chair its hard to picture you sitting here looking out over a rockery and doing nothing itll get easier he promised and led her inside the cabin opened up into a large room topped by a loft and a quartet of skylights one wall was dominated by a fireplace fashioned of river rock another was crowded with books on builtin shelves the paneling was the color of honey as was the flooring over which hed scattered rugs orientals french english indian and incredibly the lush black sheen of a bear rug complete with snarling head and claws catching her eye finn grinned it was a gift some of the guys from the station is it real afraid so he crossed to the hearth where the bear spread like a wide black pool i call him bruno since im not the one who shot him we get along pretty well i guess hes good company and he doesnt eat much he sensed her nerves shivering along the chilled air and he understood them hed rushed her out of chicago before shed been able to think things through now she was alone with him colder in here than it is outside yes she rubbed her hands as she wandered to one of the windows to study his view there was no other house to disturb the panorama only those lush yews and trees not yet greening it doesnt seem that we could be only an hour or so out of the city i wanted somewhere i could get away he built a fire competently quickly and where i could get back quickly if a story broke theres a tv radio and fax machine in the other room oh i see you can take the boy out of the newsroom thats nice she said and walked over to where the wood was beginning to crackle and spark theres another fireplace upstairs he took her bag and gestured toward the steps that led to the loft the second floor held one large bedroom that echoed the simple furnishings of the main room a sitting area in front of a window contained a love seat in deep hunter green another rocker a low pine table and a threefooted stool the gleaming brass bed was covered with burgundy corduroy and faced a small stone fireplace there was a pine dresser and a roomy armoire baths through there finn indicated the door with a nod of his head as he crouched to set the fire curious deanna nudged the door open staring she stood on the threshold unsure whether to laugh or applaud although the rest of the cabin might have reflected rustic elegance in the bathroom finn had gone for dramatic the ebony oversized tub was fitted with jets and surrounded by a ledge that snugged against a wide window the separate shower was constructed of glass block and white tile the wall over the sink was mirrored and hugged by a long counter of blackandwhite tiles as neat as a chessboard a portable television sat on it facing the tub some bathroom if youre going to relax finn commented as he rose you might as well relax no tv in the bedroom finn opened one door of the armoire there atop a trio of drawers was the blank eye of a television screen theres a shortwave in the drawer of the nightstand when she laughed he held out a hand come down and keep me company while i cook dinner you ah didnt bring your bags up she said as they started down theres another bedroom downstairs oh she felt the tension dissolve even as she was pricked by regret he stopped at the base of the steps turned put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her lightly okay she rested her brow against his a moment yes she said okay and it was sitting at the breakfast bar putting a salad together while finn sliced potatoes into thin strips for frying listening to the high march wind blow through the evergreens and tap at the windows it was easy relaxing in the country kitchen while potatoes fried and chicken grilled and laughing at his stories of adventures in the marketplaces in casablanca all the while the kitchen tv murmured keeping the world in the background and somehow making the atmosphere they shared more intimate the room was warm and cozy with dark curtaining the windows and candles flickering on the kitchen table its wonderful she told him after another bite of chicken youre as good as bobby marks and im cuter well youve got more hair i suppose i should offer to cook tomorrow that depends he curled his fingers around hers grazed his teeth over her knuckles how are you at broiling fresh fish is that whats on the menu if our luck holds we should be able to pull a couple out of the lake in the morning in the morning she blinked were going fishing in the morning sure what do you think i brought you up here for when she laughed he shook his head kansas you dont understand the master plan after weve dropped line together for a couple of hours pulled in trout together cleaned them cleaned them sure after all that you wont be able to resist me the excitement the passion the elemental sexuality of fishing will have overwhelmed you or will have bored me senseless have a little faith theres nothing like man or woman against nature to stir up the juices thats quite a plan she tipped back in her chair amazingly relaxed have you had much success with it he only grinned and topped off their wine want to look at my lures i dont think so you can surprise me tomorrow ill wake you up at five the glass froze an inch from her lips at five am dress warm he warned her deanna had been certain shed be restless had been sure her nerves would resurface the moment the house was quiet around her but the instant shed snuggled under the blankets shed dropped into a deep dreamless sleep a sleep that was rudely disturbed by a hand shaking her shoulder she opened her eyes blinked into the dark and closed them again come on kansas rise and shine is there a war she mumbled into the pillow theres a fish with your name on it finn told her coffeell be ready in ten minutes she sat up blinked again and was able to make out his silhouette beside the bed and she could smell him soap and damp skin how come you have to catch fish at dawn some traditions are sacred he leaned down unerringly finding her warm sleepy mouth with his her sigh of response had his muscles tightening and his mind skidding toward an entirely different morning activity youll want that long underwear i told you to pack he cleared his throat forced himself to step back before he gave up and crawled under the blankets with her itll be cold out on the lake he left her huddled in bed he hadnt slept well big surprise finn thought wryly she needed time he reminded himself and care and patience what she didnt need was for him to unstrap the desire that was clawing inside of him it would frighten her he was sure if she understood just how much he wanted it very nearly frightened him there was fog on the lake light fingers of it tore like cotton in the breeze and muffled the sound of the boats motor in the east the sky was struggling to light and the silver sun glanced off the mist hinting at rainbows she could smell water and pine and the soap from finns shower deanna sat at the bow of the small boat her hands resting on her knees the collar of her jacket turned up against the chill its beautiful her breath puffed out in smoke like were the only ones around for miles the senachwine gets plenty of campers and hikers he cut the engine and let the boat drift on water as calm as glass weve probably got company on the lake already its so quiet but she did hear in the distance the putt of another engine the call of a bird and the faint lap of water against the hull thats the best thing about fishing after dropping anchor he handed her a rod you cant rush it you cant crowd it all you have to do is sit in one spot and let your mind rest let your mind rest she repeated what were doing here is float fishing he began it takes more finesse than bait fishing right no sarcasm please its an art art really the art finn continued is to lay the float gently on the surface so that it entices the fish as you skillfully reel it back deanna glanced up from her study of the pretty lures and looked out over the water i dont see any fish you will trust me now youre going to cast the line out its all in the wrist thats what my father always says about horseshoes this is every bit as serious he moved surefootedly to her end of the boat horseshoes are serious christ deanna dont you know anything when a man needs to relax to unwind it doesnt mean he doesnt want competition she grinned when he shifted her hands on the rod my father would like you sounds like a sensible man now keep your hands firm wrists supple he steadied her casting the line out so that it landed with a quiet plop in the still waters ripples ringed magically around the lure spreading delighting her i did it beaming she looked over her shoulder at finn okay you did it but i helped not bad you have potential he took up his own rod chose a lure he cast off soundlessly with barely a ripple on the lake through deannas pleasure came the hot spirit of competition i want to do it again youre supposed to do it again but you have to reel it in first her brow arched i knew that slow he said with a hint of a smile as he demonstrated smooth patience is as much an art as casting so we just sit here and keep tossing the line out and bringing it back in thats the idea i get to sit here and look at you which is a pretty good way to spend the morning now if you were a man wed liven things up by telling lies about fish and women her brow was knitted in concentration as she cast off again her lure did not land soundlessly but she enjoyed its celebratory plop in that order i imagine generally you mix it up barlow james and i once spent six hours out here i dont think we told each other a single truth i can lie nope not with those eyes ill make it easy for you tell me about your family ive got three brothers she stared at the lure looking for action two older and one younger the older two are married and the youngest is still in college should i like move this around or anything no just relax are they all still in kansas yeah my father owns a hardware business and my oldest brother went in with him my mother keeps the books what are you doing playing this one out he said calmly as he reeled in hes hooked youve got one she leaned forward in the boat jerking her line already did you grow up in the city or the suburbs the burbs she said impatiently how come youve got one already oh look she stared fascinated as he drew the fish out of the lake it wriggled the strengthening sun flashing off its fins the fascination remained as he netted it and plopped it onto the bottom of the boat you must have used a better lure than mine she said as finn removed it and laid the fish on ice want to trade the stubborn line creased her brow no she studied him as he cast off again determined she reeled in shifted positions then cast off the opposite side of the boat with more enthusiasm than style when finn only grinned at her she put her nose in the air what about your family i dont have any to speak of my parents divorced when i was fifteen i was the only child theyre both lawyers he braced his rod so that he could uncap the thermos of coffee and pour for both of them they buried each other under a very civilized mountain of papers and agreed to split everything fiftyfifty including me im sorry what for it wasnt a bitter question but a simple one family ties dont run strong in the rileys we each have our own life and prefer it that way i dont mean to criticize but that sounds awfully cold it is cold he sipped coffee and absorbed the quiet pleasure of the chilly morning with the sun breaking over the water its also practical we dont have anything in common but blood why pretend otherwise she didnt know how to respond she was far away from her family but the connection was there always there they must be proud of you im sure theyre pleased that the money they spent on my education wasnt wasted dont look like that he reached out and patted her ankle i wasnt traumatized or scarred the fact is its been a plus careerwise if you dont have roots you dont have to keep ripping them out every time you get an assignment perhaps there was no need to feel sympathy for the man but she couldnt prevent it spreading in her for the boy hed been roots dont have to hold you back she said quietly not if you know how to transplant them kansas yes youve got a bite ive got oh her line tugged again if finn hadnt reached out and held her still she would have leaped up and capsized them what do i do i forgot wait wait she said before he could reply i want to do it myself brow puckered in concentration she turned the reel feeling the resistance as the fish fought back there was a moment when she felt an urge to release it then the line went taut and the spirit of competition overwhelmed everything else when she finally dropped the catch awkwardly in the bottom of the boat she shouted with laughter hes bigger than yours maybe she slapped finns hand aside before he could remove the lure ill do it with the sun rising higher in the east they grinned at each other over a fivepound trout they carried four fish back to the cabin with them two apiece deanna had argued hotly for a tie breaker but finn had started the motor you didnt catch more than you could eat hed told her as he cleaned them that was great still revved deanna spun around the kitchen really great i feel like a pioneer are we going to have fish for lunch sure well fry some up let me beef up the fire in the living room first i really thought it would be boring she said following him in i mean that in a good way laughing she combed a hand through her hair but it was exciting too i dont know satisfying she laughed again youve got a knack for it finn added another log sat back on his heels we can go out for a couple hours tomorrow morning before we head back id like that she watched the firelight dance over his forearm as he prodded the quiet flames into a roar his profile was to her relaxed his eyes dark as they stared into the fire his hair fell over his brow curled above the collar of his shirt im glad you brought me here he looked over his shoulder smiled so am i not just for the fishing lesson his smile faded but his eyes stayed on hers i know you brought me here to get me away from the papers and the talk and the ugliness she looked past him into the fire where the flames were rising you havent asked me any more questions he laid down the poker and turned to face her did you want me to i dont know she tried for a smile what question would you ask he asked the one that had kept him restless through the night are you afraid of me she hesitated a little she heard herself say more afraid of what you can make me feel he glanced back at the fire i wont pressure you deanna nothing happens between us that you dont want he looked back at her now his eyes dark intense i promise rather than relaxing the tension coiled in her stomach his words and her certainty that he would keep them balled it tighter its not that kind of fear finn its seductive the look in his eyes made her body yearn she turned away quickly so that she could say it all say it quickly because of what happened ive never been able to get back what i lost until you she turned back slowly the nerves were vicious she could feel her heart pounding strong and hard in her breast i think until you and im afraid of that and afraid that i might spoil it though he stood he didnt approach her whatever happens between us happens to and because of both of us itll wait until youre ready she looked down at her hands linked tight in front of her id like to ask you a question all right are you afraid of me she stood there lashes concealing her eyes slim and fragilelooking in the oversized shirt a log shifted lazily behind him and sent out a short small burst of sparks deanna ive never been so afraid of anything in my life as i am of you and what you can make me feel her lashes lifted then and she was no longer so fragile not with her eyes huge and smoky her lips softly curved the first step toward him was the hardest then it was easy to walk to him to slip her arms around him to rest her head on his shoulder i couldnt have asked for a better answer finn i dont want to lose what im feeling right now when he didnt move she looked up lifted her hands to his chest i dont think i will if you make love with me of all the emotions hed expected to feel alarm was the last yet it was alarm that came first swiftly overpoweringly as she looked up at him with trust and doubt warring in her eyes theres no pressure here deanna there is not from you in me was that his heart racing under her palm she wondered how could it be beating so fast when he was watching her so calmly when his hands were so light on her shoulders i need you it wasnt merely desire that stabbed through him at the words there was something sharper and hotter fused with it his hands slid from her shoulders to her face cupping it as he lowered his mouth to hers i wont hurt you i know she said but trembled nonetheless im not afraid of that yes you are and he regretted that bitterly but you wont be he promised that fiercely you only have to tell me to stop i wont there was determination in her eyes again he swore to himself he would change it to pleasure her mouth went dry when he unbuttoned her shirt slowly his eyes on hers he peeled away the first layer cast it aside then smiled this is going to take a while her laugh bubbled out nervous and shaky ive got plenty of time her eyes closed her mouth lifted to his it was right so simply so easily right to press her body to his to lift her arms and take him to her she shivered again when he tugged the turtleneck away but it wasnt from cold nor was it from fear still her breath caught when he lifted her into his arms and laid her on the thick pelt of the hearthrug i dont want you to think of anything but me he kissed her again lingered over it before sitting back to tug off her boots no one but me no im not i cant sun and firelight danced over her closed lids she listened to it hiss and spark heard the rustle as he removed his own shirt pried off his boots then he was beside her gently stroking her face until she opened her eyes and looked at him i wanted you from the first moment i saw you she smiled willing herself to relax to beat back those little frissons of doubt almost a year ago longer his lips toyed with hers warmed them waited for hers to respond you came running into the newsroom you headed straight for your desk then you pulled back your hair with this red ribbon and started beating out copy it was a few days before i left for london he skimmed a hand over the insulating silk covering her torso barely touching her hinting only of what could be i watched you for a while it was like someone had hit me with a hammer all those months later i saw you standing on the tarmac in the rain and you kissed me id saved it up for six months then you stole my story yeah he grinned then lowered his mouth to her curved lips and now ive got you she stiffened instinctively when his hand slipped under the silk but he didnt grope didnt rush in moments the easy caress of his fingers on her skin had her muscles loosening when they slid up to circle her breast her body curved to welcome them like warm rain this pleasure was soft and quiet and soothing she accepted it absorbed it then ached for it as he slowly undressed her the heat from the fire radiated out but she felt only his hands molding gently exploring arousing his touch lingered then moved on lighting flames in which those tiny raindrops of pleasure began to sizzle when she trembled now she trembled from the heat and her breath strangled in her throat he no longer felt the beast clawing at him there was a sweetness here and a power he knew as his lips roamed from hers down to the swell of her breasts that she was his as completely as absolutely as if they had been lovers for years her body was like water in his hands rising and falling with the tide of pleasure they brought to each other he heard the wind scraping at the windows the spit of the fire in the hearth and the sound of his name whispering from her lips he knew he could make her float as she was floating now her eyes like smoke and her muscles like warmed wax and he knew he had only to inch her higher just a bit higher to watch her break through those clouds into the storm she felt his teeth scrape over her hip and the hand she was stroking through his hair went taut heat coiled hot in her belly as his tongue streaked over her she shook her head to refuse it to will away the sudden uncontrollable quivering then the furnace of pressure built so quickly she writhed struggling toward it struggling away she tried to call out to tell him to wait to give her a moment to prepare but the pleasure geysered through her spurting molten through her system he watched the instant of frantic denial the stunned panic the mindless pleasure everything she felt echoed inside him as breathless as she he levered himself over her raining kisses over her glowing face until she was wrapped around him until her movements grew frantic and his own churning need demanded release look at me he fought the words out of his burning throat look at me and when she did when their eyes met held he slipped inside her slowly his hands fisted in the rug as if he could grip control there he lowered to her felt her rise to meet him until they moved together silkily when her lips curved he pressed his face to her throat and took them both over the edge chapter sixteen still dreaming she turned to him and he was there arms moving to enfold her body ready to possess her as the warm light of dawn slid lazily into the room they joined again rhythm fluid flesh warm passions met it was so easy so effortless to glide together without hurry without thought while the air throbbed as steady as a pulse the ebb and flow of their bodies the movement of sex as simple as breathing had her lips curving before they met his in a long deep dusky kiss when their needs peaked as gentle as the morning she sighed out his name and drifted from dream to reality to find him still pulsing inside her a second heartbeat finn she spoke again smiling into the quiet morning light the cross he wore pressed against her skin just below her heart hmmm this is an even better way to start the day than fishing he chuckled nuzzling at her neck yesterday morning all i could think about was crawling into this bed with you her smile spread well youre here now it seems i am he lifted his head studying her as he toyed with the hair at her temple her eyes were big and sleepy her skin glowing with that translucent polish that was the afflush of good sex we overslept no delighted with how easy it was she ran her hands down his back to the taut skin of his buttocks we slept perfect absolutely perfect you know he cupped her breast rubbing his thumb over the nipple and watching her lips part on an unsteady breath i was going to teach you how to flyfish this morning at his gentle tug fresh arousal settled in her belly were you a dry flyfisherman is the aristocrat of angling it takes a masters touch she turned her head when he lowered his mouth to her throat i could learn i think you could he scraped his teeth over the pulse that fluttered like bird wings there was nothing he decided more erotic than feeling a woman open herself to pleasure i believe you have unlimited potential she sighed tightening in response as he hardened inside her i always want to be the best its probably a flaw i dont think so he murmured she arched to meet him already shuddering over the first peak its definitely a virtue deanna why would a sharp woman like you continue this sentimental attachment to a loser its not sentimental deanna sniffed as she unlocked the door to her apartment its a very practical very logical loyalty the cubs are going to surprise everyone this year yeah right after indulging in a snort finn followed her inside it would be a surprise if they managed to crawl out of the basement whens the last time the cubs came close that stung thats not the point her voice despite her best intentions was very prim they have heart too bad they dont have bats she stuck her nose in the air and turned to her answering machine excuse me i have to check my messages no problem grinning he dropped down on the couch we can finish this later i probably didnt mention that i was captain of the debate team in college and this is one i cant lose to show her disdain she stabbed the play button deanna cassie sorry to bother you at home even if youre not there weve got a couple of changes in mondays schedule ill just fax them to you if you have any questions you know where to reach me and oh hell weve had a lot of calls on the tabloid article ive screened a lot of them out but if you want to respond i have a list of reporters you may want to agree to speak with ill be in most of the weekend call if you want me to set something up she never asked any questions deanna murmured no one at the office asked any questions at all they know you she nodded switching off the machine for a moment you know finn as hard as the job can be as much energy as it demands i wake up some mornings with the feeling that ive fallen into clover if you ask me making a living out of chatting for an hour a day smells more like gravy that made her smile a little you handle the earthquakes ill handle the heartaches he tugged off his jacket its a shame to waste all those brains im not wasting them she began hotly im but she caught the glint in his eye and stopped he was only trying to draw her in again no thanks captain im not going to debate you she turned back to the answering machine stopped again do you ever worry that someones going to take it all away from you tell you one day that its over that therell be no more cameras no his confidence the easy arrogance of it made her smile widen and neither should you he tipped her chin up kissed her youre terrific at fluff shut up finn she stabbed the play button again then scribbled down the brief message from simon on a potential hitch on tomorrows show another from fran telling her the hitch had been diverted she waited through the blank tape on a delayed hangup then gritted her teeth over three calls from reporters whod managed to wangle her unlisted number you all right finn came up behind her to rub the tension from her shoulders yes she indulged herself a moment by leaning back against him im fine i have to decide whether to refuse to comment or to draft a statement i guess i dont want to think about it yet then dont playing ostrich wont make it go away she straightened stepped aside to stand on her own i want to make the right decision i hate making mistakes then youve got two choices you react emotionally or you react like a reporter her brow creased as she thought it through or i combine the two she said softly ive been thinking about doing a show on date rape i kept pulling back because i thought i was too close but maybe im just close enough why would you put yourself through that deanna because ive been through it because men like jamie walk away from it and because she let out a long breath that threatened to catch in her throat im tired of being ashamed that i didnt do anything about it ive got a chance to make up for that now itll hurt you not the way it once did she reached for him then not anymore his grip on her tightened damn it he needed to protect her and she needed to stand on her own the one thing he could do was track down jamie thomas and have a nice long chat if you decide to do the show let me know i want to be there if i can okay she tilted her head back to kiss him before drawing away why dont i open some wine lets forget about all this for a while she needed to he could see the tension creeping back like a thief into her eyes as long as youre going to let me stay and this time i wont fall asleep on the couch i wont give you the chance she told him and walked into the kitchen out of habit he moved to the television first switching it on just as the late news began he turned toward the couch intending to take his boots off and put his feet up he spotted the envelope lying on the rug just inside the door ive got some chips deanna carried out a tray and set it on the coffee table the drive gave me an appetite her smile froze when she spotted the envelope in his hand where did you get that it was inside the door hed started to hold it out to her but drew it back now shed gone pale whats the problem its nothing annoyed with herself she shook off the vague niggling fear its silly thats all trying to convince them both she was unconcerned she took the envelope and split it open deanna nothing they say would ever change my feelings i know its all a lie ill always believe you ill always love you a shy fan she said with a shrug that came off as more of a defensive jerk who needs to get a life finn took the sheet from her scanned it response to the tabloids id say looks like but the anonymous faith didnt cheer her i take it youve gotten one of these before id have a whole collection if id kept them she picked up her glass of wine theyve been coming on and off for a year a year he looked at her his eyes intense like this here at the newsroom at my office she moved her shoulders again restless always the same format and same type of message have you reported it to whom the police whatever unease shed felt vanished in a laugh why what could i tell them officer ive been receiving anonymous love letters call out the dogs a year makes it more than harmless love letters it makes it obsession obsessions are not healthy i dont think a dozen or so sappy notes over a year constitutes an obsession its just someone who watches me on tv finn or who works in the building someone whos attracted to the image but too shy to approach me in person for an autograph she thought about the calls those silent messages in the middle of the night and that he had been able to slip a note under her door its a little spooky but its not threatening i dont like it she took his hand to draw him down on the couch with her its just your reporters instinct working on overdrive because his mouth was much more intoxicating she set the wine aside of course if you want to be a little jealous her eyes were laughing at him finn smiled back letting her set the mood but he thought about the single sheet of paper lying open on the coffee table its message of devotion as red as blood not one statement angela chuckled to herself and stretched on her stomach over the pink satin sheets of her big bed the television was on and newspapers and magazines littered the floor around her it was a beautiful room majestic and museumlike with its curved and gilded antiques and fussy feminine flounces one of the maids had griped to a friend that she was surprised there wasnt a velvet rope across the door and a charge for admission there were mirrors on every wall oval and square and oblong reflecting both the taste shed purchased and her own image the only colors other than the gold and wood tones were pink and white a candy cane she could savor in long greedy licks there were banks of roses dewy fresh so that she never had to breathe without drawing in the rich satisfying scent she equated with success at the head of the giltwood bed was a mountain of pillows all slick silks and frothy lace she tapped her pinktipped toes against them and gloated near the bed was a fauteuil where she had carelessly tossed one of her many negligees once long ago she had envied others their beautiful possessions she had as a child as a young woman stared through shop windows and wished now she owned or could own whatever she desired whomever naked his subtle muscles gleaming dan gardner straddled her hips and rubbed fragrant oil into her back and shoulders its been over a week she reminded him and she hasnt made a peep do you want me to contact jamie thomas hmmm angela stretched luxuriously under his hands she was feeling pampered and victorious and calm beautifully calm go ahead and tell him to keep talking to reporters maybe expand on the story a bit remind him that if he doesnt make enough trouble for our little dee well have to leak the story about his love affair with china white that should do it dan admired the body under his as much or nearly as much as he admired angelas mind if it comes out hes earmarking business funds for cocaine his career will bottom out even if it is in daddys firm remind him of that if he balks rich boys going to pay she murmured she would have hated him for being born into wealth and privilege and squandering it all on a weakness like drugs but the pathetic way hed folded after her first threat made her despise him oh and send a case of dom perignon to beeker angela examined her nails scowling at a minute flaw in the candypink polish he did a good job but keep him on the case if we find enough of the dirt our little dees brushed under the rug we can bury her in it i love your mind angela and aroused by it he bit her sharply on the shoulder its so beautifully twisted i dont give a damn what you think of my mind with a low chuckle she levered herself so that he could slip his oilslicked hands over her breasts and in this case its focused straight and true however it happened shes sneaking up in the ratings im not going to allow that dan not after she betrayed my friendship so you just keep she scrambled suddenly to her knees letting out a howl of protest as a clip of deanna and finn rolled over the screen in other entertainment news the announcer continued talkshow star deanna reynolds accompanied cbc foreign correspondent finn riley to a national press club banquet in chicago where riley was honored for his work during the gulf war the inside word is that riley americas desert hunk is considering an offer to head a weekly news magazine for cbc riley had no comment about the project or his personal relationship with chicagos darling deanna no angela exploded from the bed a compact golden missile detonating i took her in i offered her opportunities gave her my affection and she moves in on me she stalked naked to an open bottle of champagne and poured lavishly there were tears as genuine and as painful as her bitterness stinging her eyes and that son of a bitch turned on me too in one violent gesture she tossed the sparkling wine back its heat burst into her stomach like love he turned on me and he turned to her to her because shes younger enraged and suddenly frightened when she saw the glass was empty she hurled it toward the television it slapped the corner of the cabinet and sliced delicately in two shes nothing less than nothing a pretty face and a tight body anybody can have those she wont keep finn hell shake her off and so will the viewers she dashed the tears aside with a vicious hand but her mouth continued to tremble theyll want me they always want me she cant come close to you angela dan approached her slowly making sure his eyes were filled with understanding and desire youre the best there is in public gently he turned her so that they faced the fulllength mirror in private he murmured watching her watching his hands caress youre so beautiful shes built like a boy but you youre a woman desperate for reassurance she clasped her hands over his tightening her grip until he squeezed her breasts painfully i need to be wanted dan i need to know people want me i cant survive without that they do i do he was used to her outbursts accustomed to her neediness and he knew how to use both to his advantage when i see you on the set so cool so controlled you dazzle me he slipped his hand between her thighs patiently stroking until she was damp until she quivered until he did and i can hardly wait until i can get you alone like this her breath grew shallow but her vision was clear focused hard on the glass as his busy hands worked over her the flavor of champagne was still on her tongue making her yearn for more crave more she swallowed it and concentrated on what she saw in the glass youd do anything for me anything and to me he laughed he knew where the power was the more she needed the more she plotted the more she placed in his hands and the truth was sex with angela was like a dark violent ride into an irresistible hell what do you want me to do angela take me here right here so i can watch he laughed again she was quivering like a bitch in heat her eyes riveted on her own body her vanity the pathetic insecurity of it was one more hold he had on her but when he started to shift she shoved him back no she could barely breathe now her full white breasts still carried the angry red marks from his hands she wanted them there wanted them as proof that she was desired from behind like an animal his mouth watered at the image his erection ached like a wound desperate to take he shoved her roughly to her knees eyes feral teeth bared she watched him crouch over her he jerked her head back by the hair hissing when she growled low in her throat i wont stop even if you beg fuck me her smile glinted like a sword already bloodied and when youre done were going to find a new way to make her pay watch he held her head still with one hand i want you to watch he drove himself into her viciously the blood all but bursting in his veins when she cried out in pain and shock and greedy pleasure his fingers dug hard into her hips while he rammed inside her again and again until the sweat ran off both of them like rain and his vision dimmed but hers stayed clear she saw the blood on her lip where her teeth had dug in the sheen of sweat and tears on her face and as the horrible loveless orgasm slammed through the agony and need dans face dissolved into finns and she smiled as he cried out her name and shuddered shuddered shuddered she was wanted she was desired she was the best deanna are you sure you want to do this fran nibbled on her thumbnail a habit shed broken years before as she stood beside deannas desk absolutely sure she continued to sign the outgoing mail her signature was quick and neat and automatic its a show i want to do how many carts did we get back fran frowned down at the forms in her hand the carts they passed to the audience after each program these had been typed simply do you know of anyone who has experienced date rape is this a topic you would be willing to discuss on deannas hour there was room for comments for names and phone numbers out of the two hundred carts fran had surveyed she had chosen only two these are the ones i thought you should see reluctantly fran laid them on the desk its going to be painful for you deanna i can handle it she skimmed the first cart then went back and read each word again he said i asked for it i didnt he said it was my own fault im not sure id like to try to talk about it but i dont know if i can setting the cart aside she reached for the second it was my first date after my divorce it was three years ago and i havent been with a man since im still afraid but i trust you two women deanna murmured yes it was painful there was a tight angry fist lodged in her chest right out of the studio audience how many more fran how many more are out there wondering if it was their fault how many more are afraid i cant stand to see you hurt this way you know if you do this youre going to have to bring up jamie thomas i know that ive already run it by legal and if he sues deanna sighed barely refrained from rubbing her eyes and smearing makeup she hadnt slept well and with finn in moscow shed slept alone but it hadnt been doubt keeping her wakeful it had been anticipation then he sues to encapsulate what i got from legal hes already gone public with his version since its a matter of his word against mine im going public with my version i could have done so in a dozen interviews since the tabloids hit two dozen she corrected with a grim smile i prefer to do it this way my way on my own show you know the press will jump all over it i know she was calm now dead calm thats why were going to schedule it during the may sweeps jesus dee im going public with this fran and i hope to god even one woman who watches is helped by what im doing she used the heels of her hands to rub the dampness from her cheek and by christ im going to kill the competition in the ratings while im at it deannas nerves were steady as stone before the show in her precise manner she had gone over her scripted question cards while marcie put the finishing touches on her makeup prepared even eager she swiveled in her chair toward loren bach now are you here to observe loren or to offer advice some of both he folded his long white fingers together as you know i dont make it a habit to interfere with the content of the show i do know that and i appreciate it but i do make a habit out of protecting my people he sat silently a moment gathering his thoughts while he studied the orderly room filled with stacks of newspapers magazines all current a shelf of neatly marked videos that could be slipped into the vcr for viewing the room smelled lightly of cosmetics and lotions feminine yes he mused but also tools of the trade the dressing room was as much a work space as her office its possible for you to do this show and do an excellent job without bringing your personal experience into it possible yes she rose then to close the door marcie had left open are you asking me to do that loren no im reminding you of it then ill remind you that im part of the show not just a host an intimate part thats what makes it work for me and i think for the viewing audience he smiled and his eyes remained keen she looked polished and poised he mused i wouldnt argue with that but deanna if you have any doubts about what youre doing there is no need to go ahead i dont have doubts loren i have fears i think at least i hope that facing them is the answer you may have concerns that jamie thomas will try some sort of legal retribution but loren waved that away i have lawyers to deal with that in any case it seems the brunt of the publicity backfired on him he is at the moment on an extended vacation in europe oh i see she took a deep breath well then you dont mind if i stay to watch the show he rose as she did id appreciate it on impulse she leaned forward and kissed his cheek when he blinked in surprise she smiled that wasnt for my business associate it was for your support when she opened the door she found herself instantly scooped up into finns arms youre supposed to be in moscow im back hed pulled every string he could grab to arrive in chicago in time for the show you look good kansas how do you feel shaky she pressed a hand to her stomach ready youll be fine he kept an arm around her shoulders and nodded to loren good to see you and you you can keep me company while deanna goes to work fine finn walked deanna toward the set working tonight i have a network dinner at seven but i think i can get out by ten want to come by my place yes she gripped his hand hard the closer she got to the set the more her stomach twisted she shot one look at fran braced herself like diving into a cold pool what she forced a smile as she glanced up at finn just some advice i got once see you in an hour huh ill be here deanna took her place with the three women already fidgeting onstage she spoke quietly to each one of them then miked waited for her cue music applause the objective red eye of the camera welcome to deannas hour our show today deals with a painful subject rape in any form is tragic and horrible it takes on a different dimension when the victim knows and trusts her attacker every woman on this stage has been a victim of what is called date or acquaintance rape and we all have a story to tell when it happened to me nearly ten years ago i did nothing i hope im doing something now chapter seventeen to celebrate deannas first year on the air loren bach threw a party in his penthouse overlooking lake michigan over the low music and chink of glasses voices buzzed faintly from the adjoining game room came the beeps and bells of video games in addition to the staff of the show and cbc and delacort executives he had invited a handful of carefully selected columnists and reporters the publicity on deanna since the may sweeps showed no sign of abating loren had no intention of allowing it to while the ratings climbed so did the advertising revenue as chicagos darling rapidly became americas darling deannas growing celebrity opened the doors to booking stellar names who breezed on the show to hype their hot summer movies and concert tours she continued to mix the famous with segments on dealing with jealous spouses choosing the right swimwear and computer dating the result was a carefully crafted show with an appealing casual homey look deanna was at the core as awestruck as her audience by the appearance of a glamorous movie star as amused as they by the notion of choosing a mate with a machine as wary and unnerved as any woman of stripping down to a bikini on a public beach the girlnextdoor image drew the audience the sharp practical mind behind it structured the vision looks like you made it kid deanna smiled at roger as she kissed his cheek through the first year anyway hey in this business thats a minor miracle he chose a baby carrot from his buffet plate and bit in with a sigh hed put on a few pounds over the past months the camera gleefully advertised every ounce too bad finn couldnt be here the soviets would pick my anniversary to stage a coup she tried not to worry about finn back in moscow have you heard from him not for a couple of days i saw him on the news speaking of which i caught your new promo very sharp our news team is your news team roger said in his announcers voice keeping chicago informed you and your new partner have a nice rhythm shes all right he switched to celery found it just as bland good voice good face but she doesnt get my jokes rog nobody gets your jokes you did no she patted his cheek i pretended i did because i love you there was a quick pinch around his heart we still miss you around the newsroom i miss you too roger im sorry about you and debbie he shrugged but the wounds of his recent divorce were still tender you know what they say dee shit happens maybe ill be looking into that computer dating she gave a snort of laughter and squeezed his hand i have one word of advice on that dont well since finns busy hopping all over the globe maybe youd be interested in a stable slightly older man she would have laughed again but she wasnt entirely sure he was joking there happens to be this stable slightly older man whose friendship means a lot to me hi dee jeff i saw you didnt have a glass and thought you might like some champagne thanks you never miss a detail i pulled a coup of my own when i stole jeff away from the news department she told roger wed never get deannas hour on the air without him he beamed with pleasure i just pick up the loose ends and tie them up in a bow excuse me barlow james slipped behind deanna and circled her waist with his arm i need to steal the star for a moment gentlemen youre looking fit roger thanks mr james with a wan smile roger held up another carrot im working on it i wont keep her long barlow promised and led deanna toward the open terrace doors you look more than fit he commented you look luminous she laughed im working on it i believe i have something that might add to the glow finn contacted me this morning relief came one heartbeat before pleasure how is he in his element yes she looked out at the lake where pale fingers of moonlight nudged past clouds to brush the water the silhouettes of boats rocked gently in the current i suppose he is you know between the two of us we might be able to apply enough pressure to convince him to do that news magazine and keep his butt in chicago i cant though she wished she could he has to do what suits him best dont we all barlow said with a sigh now ive dulled some of that glow this should bring it back he took a long slim box from his inside jacket pocket finn asked me to pick this up for you something he had made before he was called away im to tell you hes sorry he cant give it to you himself she said nothing as she stared at its contents the bracelet was delicately fashioned of oval gold links cut to catch the light and joined together by the rainbow hue of multicolored gems emerald sapphire ruby tourmaline fired and flashed in the moonlight at the center a filigreed d and r flanked a brilliant array of sizzling diamonds that shaped a star the stars selfexplanatory i believe barlow told her its to commemorate your first year were confident therell be many more its beautiful like the woman it was made for barlow said slipping it from the box to clasp it around her wrist the boy certainly has taste you know deanna we need a strong hour on tuesday nights you may not feel comfortable using your influence to persuade him to fill it but i do he winked and patting her shoulder left her alone youre too damn far away she said quietly rubbing a fingertip over the bracelet she had so much that she wanted she reminded herself so much that shed worked toward so why was she still so unsettled very much like the boats on the water below she mused anchored yes but still shifting still tugging against the tide her show was rapidly becoming national but she had yet to select a new apartment she was enjoying national exposure in the media most of it flattering and she was standing alone at a party thrown in her honor feeling lost and discontented for the first time in her life her professional goals and personal ones seemed out of balance she knew exactly what she wanted for her career and could see the steps toward achieving it so clearly she felt capable and confident when she thought of pushing deannas hour to the top of the market and whenever she stood in front of the audience the camera on and focused she felt incredibly alive completely in control with just enough giddy pleasure thrown in to make it all a continual thrill she wasnt taking success for granted for she knew too well the caprices of television but she knew that if the show was canceled tomorrow she would pick up go on and start over her personal needs werent so clearcut nor was the route she wanted to take did she want the traditional home and marriage and family if it was possible to mix that kind of ideal with a highpowered and demanding career she would find a way or did she want what she had now a place of her own a satisfying yet strangely independent relationship with a fascinating man a man she was madly in love with she admitted and who though the words hadnt been said she was certain loved her as deeply if they changed what they had she might lose this breathless stirring excitement or she might discover something more soothing and equally thrilling to replace it and because she couldnt see the answer because the confusion in her heart blinded her vision she struggled all the harder to separate intellect from emotion there you are loren bach strode out on the balcony a bottle of champagne in one hand a glass in the other the guest of honor shouldnt be hiding in the shadows he topped off her glass before setting the bottle aside on the glass table beside him particularly when the media is in attendance i was just admiring your view she countered and giving that media a chance to miss me youre a sharp woman deanna he clicked his glass against hers im taking this evening to feel very smug about going with my instincts and signing you im feeling pretty smug about that myself as long as you dont let it show that wideeyed enthusiasm is what sells dee thats what the audience relates to she grimaced i am wideeyed and enthusiastic loren its not an act i know he couldnt have been happier thats why its so perfect what did i read about you recently he tapped a finger against his temple as if to shake the memory loose midwest sensibilities an ivyleague brain a face that makes a man yearn for his high school sweetheart all coated with a quiet sheen of class you left out my quick sexy laugh she said dryly complaining deanna no she leaned comfortably against the railing to face him the scent of hibiscus from the bold red blooms in the patio pots mixed exotically with the fragrance of champagne and lake water not for a minute i love every bit of it the spread in premiere the cover on mccalls the peoples choice nomination you should have won that he muttered ill beat angela next time she smiled at him her bangs fluttering in the light breeze the diamonds at her wrist glinting in the starlight i wanted that chicago emmy and ive got it i intend to win a national one when the time comes im not in a hurry loren because im enjoying the ride a lot you make it look easy dee and fun he winked thats the way i sell computer games and thats the way you slip right through the television screen into the viewers living room thats the way you up the ratings his smile hardened glinted in the shadowy light and thats the way youre going to knock angela out of first place because the gleam in lorens eye made her uneasy deanna chose her response carefully thats not my primary goal as naive as it may sound loren all i want is to do a good job and provide a good show you keep doing that and ill handle the rest it was odd he thought that he hadnt realized just how much revenge against angela burned in him until deanna im not going to claim that i made angela number one because its more complex than that but i speeded the process along my mistake was to be deluded enough by the screen image and marry someone who didnt exist off camera loren you dont have to tell me this no no one has to tell you anything but they do thats part of your charm deanna i can tell you that angela shed me as carelessly as a snake sheds its skin when shed decided shed outgrown me its going to give me a lot of satisfaction to help you gun her down deanna he drank again with relish a great deal of deep satisfaction loren i dont want to go to war with angela thats all right he touched his glass to hers again i do lew mcationeil was as obsessed with angelas success as loren bach was with her failure his future depended on it he had hopes to retire in another decade with his nest egg securely in place he had no hopes of remaining with angelas for that long his best chance was to work out his contract while the show remained a numberone hit then slide gently into another producing slot he had some reason to worry while angelas was still in command of the top rung and the show had added another emmy to its collection its star was fraying at the edges in chicago she had managed to command her staff using her iron will and her penchant for perfection and leavening them with doses of considerable charm since the move to new york a great deal of the charm had been shaken by stress and the stress was doused with french champagne he knew had made it his business to know that she had poured a great deal of her own money into the fledgling ap productions the veteran show kept the company out of the red but angelas dabbling in television movies had been disastrous thus far her last special had received lukewarm reviews but the ratings had put the show into the top ten of the week that was fortunate but her daily ratings had plummeted in august when she had insisted on running repeats while she took an extended vacation in the caribbean no one could deny that she deserved the break just as no one could deny that the timing had been poor with deannas hour steadily closing the distance in points there were other mistakes other errors in judgment the largest being dan gardner as the power shifted gradually from angelas hands to those of her lover and executive producer the tone of the show altered subtly more complaints lew its not a complaint angela he wondered how many hours of his life hed spent standing beside her chair in her dressing room i only wanted to say again that i think its a mistake to have a homeless family on the program with a man like trent walker hes a shark angela really she took a slow drag on her cigarette i found him quite charming sure hes charming he was real charming when he bought that shelter then turned the building into highpriced condos its called urban renewal lew in any case it should be fascinating to see him debate with a family of four who are currently living in their station wagon not only topical she crushed out the cigarette but excellent tv i hope he wears the gold cuff links if it goes the wrong way it may look as though youre unsympathetic to the plight of the homeless and what if i am her voice cracked like a whip there are jobs out there too many of these people would rather take a handout than earn an honest living she thought of the way shed waited tables and cleaned up slop to pay for her education the humiliation of it not all of us were born to the good life lew when my book comes out next month you can read along with everyone else how i overcame my modest beginnings and worked my way to the top with a sigh she dismissed the hairdresser thats fine dear run along lew let me say first that i dont appreciate your secondguessing me in front of members of my staff angela i wasnt and second she interrupted still frigidly pleasant theres no need for concern i have no intention of letting anything go wrong or of giving the softhearted public an unflattering opinion on my stand dans already seeing to it that it leaks that i personally will sponsor the family were highlighting on the show i will at first modestly decline to comment then reluctantly will agree that i have found employment for both parents along with six months rent and a stipend for food and clothing now she gave her hair one last fluff as she rose id like to look them over before we go on the air theyre in the green room lew murmured i decided to put walker elsewhere for the time being fine she swept by him and into the corridor all graciousness and warm support she greeted the family of four who sat nervously huddled together on the sofa in front of the television waving away their thanks she pressed food and drink on them patted the little boy on the head and tickled the toddler under the chin her smile snapped off like a light when she started back to her dressing room they dont look like theyve been living on the street for six weeks to me why are their clothes so neat why are they so clean i they knew they were going on national tv angela they put themselves together as best they could theyve got pride well dirty them up she snapped she had a headache coming on like a freight train and wanted her pills i want them to look destitute for christs sake not like some middleclass family down on their luck but thats what they are lew began she stopped turned freezing him with eyes as cold as a dolls i dont care if the four of them have fucking mbas from harvard do you understand me television is a visual medium perhaps youve forgotten that i want them to look like they just got swept off the street put some dirt on those kids i want to see holes in their clothes angela we cant do that its staging it crosses the line dont tell me what you cant do she jabbed one frosty pink nail into his chest im telling you whats going to be done its my show remember mine youve got ten minutes now get out of here and do something to earn your salary she shoved him out slamming the door behind him the panic attack had nearly overtaken her in the hall chills raced over her skin she leaned back against the door shuddering she would have to go out there soon go out and face the audience they would be waiting for her to make the wrong move to say the wrong words if she did if she made one mistake they would leap at her like wild dogs and she would lose everything everything on wobbly legs she lunged across the room her hands shook as she poured the champagne it would help she knew shed discovered after years of denial that just one small glass before a show could chase away those cold clammy chills two could ease all those gnawing fears she swallowed greedily draining the glass then poured the second with a steadier hand a third glass wouldnt hurt she assured herself just smoothing out the rough edges where had she heard that before she wondered as she brought the crystal to her lips her mother good god her mother just smoothing out the rough edges angie a couple sips of gin smooths them all right out horrified she dropped the full glass spilling bubbling wine over the rug she watched it spread like blood and turned away shivering she didnt need it she wasnt like her mother she was angela perkins and she was the best there would be no mistakes she promised herself that as she turned to the mirror so that her image glossy and elegant could calm her she would go out and do what she did best and she would keep those wild dogs at bay yet again she would tame them and make them love her satisfied lew still riding on the echoes of applause angela dropped into the chair behind her desk i told you it would work you were great angela he said it because it was expected no she was fabulous dan sat on the edge of her desk and leaned over to kiss her having that kid sit on your lap was inspired i like kids she lied and that one seemed to have some brains well see to it that he gets in school now she sat back letting the family slip from her mind as casually as she slipped out of her shoes lets get down to business who is she looking to book next month resigned lew passed angela a list he didnt have to be told they were discussing deanna the names with the asterisks have already booked shes going after some heavy hitters isnt she angela mused movies fashion still steering clear of politics fluff over substance dan said knowing that comment would please her fluff or not we wouldnt want her to get lucky shes already snagged too much press that damn jamie thomas affair her mouth tightened into a thin line of disgust as she thought of him hiding out in rome we still have the data on him dan reminded her easy enough to leak his drug problem to the press leaking that gains us nothing and would only drum up more sympathetic press for deanna let it go she scanned the sheet of paper lets see who we know well enough on here to persuade to give deanna a pass she glanced up and gave lew a bland smile you can go i wont need you when lew closed the door quietly behind him dan lighted angelas cigarette that hangdog face of his gets old fast he commented but he has his uses pleased she tapped the list with one lacquered nail its very satisfying to know what our little dee is planning almost before she does angela checked two names on the list i can take care of both of these with a casual phone call its so gratifying to have important people owe you ah now look here kate lowell very hot dan rose to pour them both a perrier one of those rarities that makes the term actressmodel a compliment yes shes very beautiful very talented and very hot right now with her new movie burning up the box office angelas smile was slow and surprisingly sweet it so happens deanna knows kate they summered in topeka together and it so happens i know an interesting little secret of kates a little secret that will make certain she wont be chatting to her old pal on the air in fact i think well just book her ourselves ill take care of this one personally i just dont understand it finn deanna snuggled down on the couch beside him resting her head against his chest one minute we were making the travel arrangements the next we get a line from her publicist about unexpected scheduling conflicts it happens he was more interested in nibbling on her fingers than talking shop not like this we tried to reschedule gave them an open date and got the same response i really wanted her on in november but i didnt contact her personally because i didnt want it to seem like calling in a favor from a friend she shook her head remembering how warm then how distant kate had been when theyd seen each other in angelas office damn it we used to be friends friendships are often one of the first casualties of this business dont let it get you down kansas im trying not to i know well get someone else i guess i feel snubbed personally and professionally she made an effort to push it out of her mind their time was too precious to waste this is nice what is just sitting here doing nothing with you i like it myself kind of habitforming he stroked a finger over the bracelet she wore since his return from moscow he hadnt seen her without it barlow james is in town mmm i heard do you want something to eat no good she sighed lustily neither do i i dont want to move all day all wonderful sunday an absolutely free sunday for both of them she mused and she didnt want to spoil it by mentioning the latest note shed found mixed with her viewer mail i know you dont really love him deanna finn riley cant mean as much to you as i will i can wait for you ill wait forever of course that note had been nothing compared to the one from the alabamian truck driver who wanted her to see the country from the bed in his sixteenwheeler or the selfordained minister who claimed to have had a vision of her naked a sign from god that she and her checkbook were meant to join him in his work so it was nothing to worry about really nothing at all i had a meeting with him yesterday she blinked who barlow james because he could see she was clicking into her think mode finn tugged at her ear keep up will you sorry wheres he sending you now i have to leave for paris in a few days i thought you might like to fly out there next weekend fly out to paris she turned to look at him for the weekend you take the concorde we eat french food see french sights and make love in a french hotel i might even be able to fly back with you the idea made her sit upright i cant imagine flying off to paris for a weekend youre a celebrity he reminded her youre supposed to do things like that dont you ever read fan magazines her eyes were alight with the possibilities ive never been to europe youve got a passport dont you sure i even renewed it recently a habit from my reporting days when i nursed the vague hope of copping some exciting foreign assignment so ill be your exciting foreign assignment if i could clear my schedule i will clear my schedule she twisted around to throw her arms around him where are you going he demanded tightening his grip when she started to wriggle away i have to make a list i have to get a berlitz tape and a guidebook and later he laughed his way into the kiss god youre predictable kansas whatever i toss at you you make a list im organized she thumped a fist against his chest that doesnt mean im predictable you can write up six lists later i havent told you about my meeting with barlow but she wasnt listening shed need one of those mini video recorders she decided like cassie had and a phrase book what she blinked when finn tugged on her hair the meeting with barlow she said tucking her mental list aside you just said he was sending you to paris thats not what the meeting was about it was a continuation of discussions weve been having on and off for about a year the news magazine she grinned he wont give up will he im going to do it i think its youre what she jerked upright again youre going to do it hed expected her to be surprised now he was hoping shed be pleased its taken us a while to agree on terms and format but i didnt think you were interested at all you like being able to plug into any story that comes along toss your garment bag over your shoulder pick up your laptop and go the paladin of newscasters he toyed with her earring id still do that to an extent when something breaks id go but id be covering it for the show wed do remotes whenever they were called for but wed base here in chicago that had been a sticking point since barlow had wanted him in new york id be able to take a story and explore all the angles instead of fitting it into a threeminute piece on the news and id spend more time here with you i dont want you to do this for me she got to her feet quickly i wont deny that its hard for me to say goodbye so often but youve never said so it wouldnt have been fair god finn she dragged both hands through her hair what could i have said dont go i know there are worldaltering events taking place but id rather you stay home with me he rose as well brushed a knuckle down her cheek it wouldnt have hurt my ego to hear it his quiet words shivered through her it wouldnt have been fair to either of us and you changing the thrust of your career because of me wont be fair either im not just doing this for you im doing it for myself too you said you didnt want to put down roots she was distressed because she realized she was near tears she wouldnt have been able to explain them to him or to herself i remember that finn were professionals and we both understand the demands of the career i dont want to make you feel pressured you dont get it do you his impatience was back theres nothing i wouldnt do for you deanna things have changed for me in this past year its not as easy for me to pick up and go its not a snap for me to fall asleep in some hotel halfway around the world i miss you i miss you too she said does that make you happy damn straight it does he eased her forward kissed her softly gently until her mouth grew greedy and hot under his i want you to miss me i want it to kill you every time i go away and i want you to feel as baffled and uncomfortable and as frustrated as i am with this whole mess weve gotten ourselves into well i do so thats just fine for both of us fine and dandy he released her if she wanted to fight with reason hed give her plenty of it objective words were after all his stockintrade ill still have to go ill have more control over where and when but ill have to go and i want you to suffer whenever i do you she said precisely can go to hell not without you he caught her face in his hand holding tight when she would have jerked away goddamn it deanna i love you when his hand went limp she stepped back on shaky legs her eyes were huge and fixed on his face it took her a moment before she could breathe again another moment before she could form coherent words youve never said that before her reaction wasnt precisely what hed hoped for then again he had to admit that his declaration hadnt been exactly polished im saying it now you have a problem with it do you i asked you first she only shook her head i dont suppose i do it makes it kind of handy because i love you too she let out a quick catchy sigh i didnt realize how much i needed the words youre not the only one who has to take things in stages he reached out touched her cheek pretty scary huh yeah she took his wrist held tight while the first flood of pleasure poured through her i dont mind being scared in fact i like it so if youd like to tell me again its okay i love you he scooped her up making her laugh as they tumbled onto the couch youd better hold on to me he warned her and tugged her sweater over her head im about to scare you to death chapter eighteen in depth with finn riley premiered in january a midseason replacement for a disastrous hospital drama the network had high hopes that a weekly news magazine featuring a recognizable face could drag the time slot out of the ratings basement finn had experience and credibility and most important he was wildly popular with women particularly in the coveted eighteentoforty category cbc ushered the show onto the air with plenty of hype promos were run ads were designed theme music was composed by the time the set with its threedimensional world map and sleek glass counter was constructed finn and the three reporters on his team were already hard at work his vision of the project was much simpler than jazzy promotion spots or expensive props he was as he told deanna doing something hed always fantasized about he was coming in as relief pitcher after the seventhinning stretch all he had to do was throw strikes with his first program he managed to strike out the competition with a thirtypercent share around water coolers the next morning americans chatted about the us chances for olympic gold and finn rileys cagey interview with boris yeltsin in the spirit of friendly competition deanna scheduled a program featuring rob winters a veteran film actor whose directorial debut was winning critical and popular acclaim charming handsome and cozily at home in front of the camera rob kept both the studio and viewing audiences entertained his final anecdote involving the filming of a steamy love scene and an unexpected invasion of sea gulls closed the show with a roar of laughter i cant thank you enough for doing the show deanna clasped his hand warmly after hed finished signing autographs for lingering members of the audience i nearly didnt while security ushered the last of the audience from the studio he studied deanna carefully to be frank the only reason i agreed to come on was because i was pressured not to he flashed his famous grin thats why i have a reputation for being difficult im not sure i understand your agent advised you against doing this among others deanna studied him confused got a minute he asked of course would you like to go upstairs to my office fine i could use a drink his quick smile was back youd last about twenty minutes in hollywood with eyes like that he put a friendly hand on her arm as they walked on set toward the elevator if you let enough people see what youre thinking youll be gobbled up and swallowed whole deanna stepped inside the elevator pushed the button for the sixteenth floor and what am i thinking that its barely ten oclock in the morning and im going to start knocking back doubles his grin was as fast and potent as a jigger of whiskey youre thinking i should have stayed at betty ford a little longer you did tell me during the show that you didnt drink any longer i dont alcohol my newest addiction is diet pepsi with a twist of lime a little embarrassing but im man enough to handle it deanna cassie turned from her workstation when she saw the man beside deanna her eyes popped wide open did you need me for something cassie what she blinked flushed but didnt take her eyes off robs face no no its nothing rob this is cassie my secretary and sergeant at arms nice to meet you rob took her limp hand in both of his i enjoy your work mr winters were all thrilled you could do the show today my pleasure cassie hold my calls please ill fix you that drink she told rob as she led him into her office the room had changed considerably from the early days the walls were painted a bold teal and the carpet had been replaced by oak flooring and geometric rugs the furniture was streamlined and built for comfort gesturing rob to a chair she opened a compact refrigerator i havent been up here in four or five years i guess he stretched out his long legs and glanced around its an improvement he looked back at deanna but then pastel pinks probably arent your style i suppose not she sliced lime and added it to two iced soft drinks im curious why your agent advised you against doing the show curious wasnt the word but she kept her voice mild we do our best to make our guests comfortable it probably had something to do with a call from new york he accepted the glass waited until deanna took a seat from angela perkins angela baffled she shook her head angela called your agent about your coming on my show the day after your people contacted him rob took a long sip she said a little bird had told her that i was considering a stop in chicago sounds like her deanna muttered but i dont know how she could have found out so quickly she didnt say watching deannas face he rattled the ice in his glass and she didnt bring it up when she spoke to me either two days later with my agent she used charm reminding him that shed booked me on angelas when my career was floundering and that if i agreed to go on with you she wouldnt be able to welcome me to new york as shed hoped to she wanted me for her next special and guaranteed that she would use her influence to add weight to my oscar nomination which meant talking the film up in public and in private and contributing to the ad campaign some notsosubtle bribery her voice tightened with anger held under strict control but youre here i might not have been if shed stayed with bribery i want that award deanna a lot of people including me thought i was washed up when i went into rehab i had to beg for money to make this film i made deals and promises told lies whatever it took halfway through production the press was saying that the public was going to stay away in droves because nobody gave a shit about an epic love story i want that award he paused drank again id just about made up my mind to take my agents advice and give you a pass then angela called me she didnt use charm she threatened me and that was her mistake deanna rose to refill his glass she threatened not to support the film if you came on my show she did better than that he took out a cigarette shrugged do you mind i havent kicked this vice yet go ahead i came here because i was pissed he struck a match blew out smoke my little way of telling angela to get fucked i wasnt going to bring any of it up but theres something about the way you handle yourself he narrowed his eyes youve just got to trust that face of yours so im told she managed a smile though bitterness was bubbling in her throat whatever the reason you came on im glad you did youre not going to ask me what else she threatened me with her smile fluttered again more easily im trying not to he gave a short laugh and set the pepsi aside she told me you were a manipulative scheming monster whod use any means necessary to stay in the spotlight that youd abused her friendship and trust and that the only reason you were on the air was that you were screwing loren bach deanna merely lifted a brow im sure loren would be surprised to hear it it sounded more like a selfportrait to me he took another drag tapped his cigarette restlessly in the ashtray i know what it is to have enemies deanna and since it seems we now have a mutual one im going to tell you what angela held over my head ill need you to keep it to yourself for twentyfour hours until i get back to the coast and arrange a press conference something cold skittered up her spine all right about six months ago i went in for a routine exam i was worn out but then id been working pretty much around the clock for more than a year doing the film overseeing the editing gearing up for promotion id been a pretty regular customer of the medical profession during my drinking days and my doctor is very discreet discretion aside angela managed to get wind of the test results he took one last drag on the cigarette crushed it out im hivpositive oh im sorry instantly she reached out and gripped his hand hard in hers im so sorry i always figured the booze would get me never figured it would be sex he lifted the glass the ice rattled musically when his hand shook then again i spent enough time drunk that i didnt know how many women there were much less who they were were finding out more every day she cut herself off it was so trite she thought so pathetically useless youre entitled to your privacy rob an odd statement from an exreporter even if angela leaks this you dont have to confirm he sat back again looking amused now youre pissed of course i am she used me to get to you its just television for gods sake its television were talking about ratings points here not worldaltering events what kind of business is this that someone would use your tragedy to shake down the competition in a lighter mood he sipped at his drink its show business babe nothings closer to life and death than life and death he smiled wryly i ought to know im sorry she closed her eyes and fought for control a temper tantrum isnt going to help you what can i do got any friends who are voting members of the academy she smiled back maybe a couple you might give them a call use that sexy persuasive voice to influence their vote and after that you can go back in front of the camera and beat the pants off angelas her eyes kindled youre damn right i will she called a staff meeting that afternoon in her own office and sat behind her desk to project the image of authority the anger was still with her simmering deep as a result her voice was clipped cool and formal we have a problem a serious one that just recently came to my attention she scanned the room as she spoke noting the puzzled faces staff meetings were often tiresome sometimes heated but always informal and essentially goodnatured margaret she continued you contacted kate lowells people didnt you thats right unnerved by the chill in the air margaret nibbled on the earpiece of her reading glasses they were very interested in having her come on we had the hook that shed lived in chicago for a few years when she was a teenager then they switched off scheduling conflicts how many other times has that happened in the last six months margaret blinked its hard to say right off a lot of the topic ideas dont pan out i mean specifically celebrityoriented shows oh well margaret shifted in her seat we dont do a lot of those because the format generally runs to civilian guests the everyday people you do so well but id guess that five or six times in the last six months weve had somebody wiggle off the hook and how do we handle the projected guest list simon he flushed same as always dee we toss around ideas brainstorm when we come up with some workable topics and guests we do the research and make some calls and the guest list is confidential until its confirmed sure it is he nervously slicked a hand over his hair standard operating procedure we dont want any of the competitors to horn in on our work deanna picked up a pencil from the glass surface of her counter tapped it idly i learned today that angela perkins knew we were interested in booking rob winters within hours of our contacting his agent there was a general murmuring among the staff and i suspect deanna continued from what i learned that she was also aware of several others kate lowell appeared on angelas two weeks after her people claimed a scheduling conflict she wasnt the only one i have a list here of people we tried to book who guested on angelas within two weeks of our initial contact weve got a leak the muscles in frans jaw twitched son of a bitch come on fran jeff cast worried glances around the room he shoved at his glasses most of us have been here from the first day were like family he tugged at the collar of his tshirt cutting his eyes back to deanna man dee you cant believe any of us would do anything to hurt you or the show no i cant she pushed a hand through her hair so i need ideas suggestions jesus jesus christ simon mumbled under his breath as he pressed his fingers to his eyes its my fault dropping his hands he gave deanna a shattered look lew mcationeil weve kept in touch all along hell weve been friends for ten years i never thought im sick he said i swear to god it makes me sick what are you talking about deanna asked quietly but she thought she knew we talk once twice a month he shoved back from the table crossing the room to pour a glass of water usual stuff shop talk taking out a bottle he shook two pills into his hand hed bitch about angela he knew he could to me that it wouldnt go any further hed tell me some of the wilder ideas her team had come up withfor segments maybe hed ask who we were lining up and id tell him he swallowed the pills audibly id tell him because we were just two old friends talking shop i never put it together until this minute dee i swear to christ all right simon so we know how we know why what are we going to do about it hire somebody to go to new york and break all of lew mcationeils fingers fran suggested as she rose to go stand beside the clearly distressed simon ill give that some thought in the meantime the new policy is not to discuss any guests any topic ideas or any of the developmental stages of the show outside of the office agreed there was a general murmuring no one made eye contact and we have a new goal one were all going to concentrate on she paused waiting until she could skim her gaze over each face were going to knock angelas out of the numberone spot within a year she held up a hand to stop the spontaneous applause i want everyone to start thinking about ideas for remotes we need to start taking this show on the road i want sexy locations funny locations i want the exotic and i want main street usa disney world fran suggested new orleans for mardi gras cassie put in and lifted her shoulders i always wanted to go check it out deanna ordered i want six doable locations i want all the topic ideas we have cooking on my desk by the end of the day cassie make a list of all the personal appearance requests ive got and accept them how many all of them fit them into my schedule and put in a call to loren bach she sat back and rested her palms on the surface of the desk lets get to work deanna simon stepped forward as the others filed out can i have a minute just she said and smiled i want to get started on this campaign he stood stiffly in front of her desk i know it might take you a little time to replace me and that youd like a smooth transition ill hand in my resignation whenever you want deanna was already drawing a list on a legal pad in front of her i dont want your resignation simon i want you to use that wily brain of yours to put me on top i screwed up dee big time you trusted a friend a competitor he corrected god knows how many shows i sabotaged by opening my big mouth shit dee i was bragging playing my jobs bigger than your job i wanted to needle him because it was the only way i could stick it to angela im giving you another way she leaned forward eyes keen she felt the power in her now and she would use it she knew to finish what angela had begun help me knock her out of the top slot simon you cant do that if you resign i cant figure why youd trust me i had a pretty good idea where the leak had come from simon i spent enough time around here to know you and lew were tight she spread her fingers if you hadnt told me you wouldnt have had to offer to resign id have fired you he rubbed a hand over his face so i admit to being a jerk and i keep my job that about sums it up and i expect because youre feeling like one youll work even harder to put me on top more than a little dazed he shook his head you picked up a few things from angela after all i got what i needed she said shortly she snatched up her phone when it buzzed yes cassie loren bach on one deanna thanks she let her finger hover over the button as she glanced back at simon are we straight on this as an arrow she waited until the door shut behind simon then drew in a deep breath loren she said when she made the connection im ready to go to war in the cold gloomy hours of a february morning lew kissed his wife goodbye she stirred sleepily and gave his cheek a pat before snuggling under the down quilt for another thirtyminute nap chicken stew tonight she mumbled ill be home by three to put it on since their children had grown each had fallen into a comfortable morning routine lew left his wife sleeping and went downstairs alone to eat breakfast with the early news he winced over the weather report though a glance out the window had already told him it wasnt promising the drive from brooklyn heights to the studio in manhattan was going to be a study in frustration he bundled into a coat pulled on gloves put on the russianstyle fur hat his youngest son had given him for christmas the wind was up tossing the nasty wet snow into his face letting it sneak under the collar of his coat it was still shy of seven dreary enough that the streetlights still glowed the snow muffled sound and seemed to smother the air he saw no one out in the tidy neighborhood but an unhappy cat scratching pitifully on his owners front door too used to chicago winters to complain about a february storm lew trudged to his car and began to clean the windshield he paid no attention to the fairytale world forming behind him the low evergreens with their frosting of white the pristine carpet that coated winter grass and pavement the dancing flakes that swirled in the dull glow of the streetlamps he thought only of the drudgery of scraping his windshield clean of the discomfort of snow on his collar of the nip of the wind at his ears of the traffic he had yet to face he heard his name called softly and turned to peer through the driving snow for a moment he saw nothing but white and the snowsmothered beam of light from the streetlamp and then he saw for just an instant he saw the shotgun blast struck him full in the face cartwheeling his body over the hood of his car from down the block a dog began to bark in high excited yips the cat streaked away to hide in a snowcoated juniper the echo of the shot died quickly almost as quickly as lew mcationeil that was for deanna the killer whispered and drove slowly away when deanna heard the news a few hours later the shock of it overshadowed the envelope shed found on her desk it said simply deanna ill always be there for you chapter nineteen deanna lounged in finns big tub with steaming water whirling and pulsing around her her eyes half closed and a frothy mimosa in her hand it was the middle of a saturday morning and she had more than an hour before tim omalley her driver would be by to pick her up for an appearance in merrillville indiana she felt as lazy and smug as a cat curled in a sunbeam what are we celebrating youre in town im in town and not counting your afternoon across the state line today it looks like it could stay that way for a week from the opposite end of the tub finn watched her tension ease degree by degree shed been wound tight as a spring for weeks longer he thought sipping the icy drink even before lew mcationeils random and senseless murder shed been a bundle of nerves in the weeks following lews death her feelings had shifted from remorse to anger to guilt to frustration over a man who had done his best to sabotage her show for his own ends or angelas ends finn theorized but now she smiled and her eyes were heavy with pleasure things have been a little chaotic lately you flying off to florida me chasing presidential candidates from state to state both of us trying to put together a show with press and paparazzi dogging our heels he shrugged rubbing his foot up and down her slick slippery leg it hadnt been easy for anyone on her staff or his to work with the continued and pesky attention the media had focused on their relationship for reasons neither of them could fathom they had become the couple of the year just that morning deanna had read about her wedding plans in a tabloid some helpful soul had tucked under the front doormat all in all it made her uneasy unsure and far too distracted do you call that chaotic finn asked and drew her attention back youre right just another day in the simple life her sigh was long and sumptuous and at least were getting things done i really liked your show on chicagos decaying infrastructure even if it did make me start to worry that the streets are going to crumble under my car everything was there panic comedy halfcrazed city officials still it wasnt as gripping as your interview with mickey and minnie mouse one eye opened watch it pal no really his grin was wicked youve got america talking what kind of relationship do they have and what part does goofy play in it these burning questions need to be answered and who knows it might help take some of the heat off us we were dealing with american traditions she shot back on the need for entertainment and fantasy and the enormous industry that fuels it which is every bit as relevant as watching politicians sling insults at each other more she said gesturing with her glass people need some mode of escape particularly during a recession you do your shows on global warming and the socioeconomic troubles in the former soviet union riley ill stick with the everyday issues that affect the average person he was still grinning at her deanna took a sip of her mimosa and scowled at him youre riding me on purpose i like the way your eyes get dark and edgy he set his glass aside so that he could slide forward and lay his body over hers water sloshed lazily over the lip of the tub and you get this line right here he rubbed his thumb between her brows that i get to smooth away his free hand was busy smoothing something else some might say youre a sneaky bastard finn some have he nipped at her lips others will and speaking of mickey and minnie his hands cruised over her hot soft skin were we i was wondering if we can compare our relationship to theirs undefined and longterm while the jets of water frothed around them and between them she stroked a hand through his damp hair it felt so good to be here to know that at any moment the comforting heat could erupt into explosive heat i can define it were two people who love each other who enjoy each other who want to be with each other we could be with each other more if youd move in with me it was a subject theyd discussed before and one they had been unable to resolve deanna pressed her lips to his shoulder its easier for me to have my own place when youre away im here more than im gone these days i know her lips slid up his throat as she tried to distract him give me some time to work it out in my head sometimes youve got to trust your impulses deanna your instincts his mouth met hers tasting of frustration and desire he knew if he pushed shed agree but his instinct warned him not to rush her i can wait just dont make me wait too long we can give it a trial run her blood was pulsing as frantically as the bubbling water ill move some things in stay here through next week ill make it hard for you to leave again i bet you will she smiled pushing his hair back framing his face im so in love with you finn you can believe that and i swear the rumors about me and goofy are all lies were just friends he tipped her head back so that her body slipped farther into the water i dont trust the longeared son of a bitch i just used him to make you jealous though he does have a certain guileless charm i find strangely appealing you want charm why dont i damn finn tossed his wet hair back and reached for the tubside phone hold that thought he told her yeah riley deanna was considering several interesting ways to distract him when she saw the change in his face the water shifted and slopped over as he climbed from the tub to reach for a towel get curt he said dripping as he slung the towel around his waist and contact barlow james i want a full crew a mobile unit on the spot five minutes ago ill be at the site in twenty minutes he swore not so lightly under his breath you can if i tell you that you can what is it deanna turned off the tub and rose water streamed from her as she shook out a towel she already knew he was leaving theres a hostage situation over in greektown with a quick flick of the wrist he turned on the television even as he headed into the bedroom to drag on clothes its bad three people are already dead she shivered once then as quick as brisk as he she reached for her robe she wanted to tell him shed go with him but of course she couldnt there were several hundred people waiting for her in the ballroom of an indiana hotel why was she so cold she wondered as she bundled hurriedly into her robe he was already tucking a shirt into his slacks as calmly as a man going to his office to work on tax forms hed survived air raids and earthquakes surely a skirmish in greektown was nothing to worry about youll be careful he grabbed a tie a jacket ill be good as she reached into the closet for the suit shed chosen for her afternoon appearance he spun her around for a kiss ill probably be back before you the worst kind of war was one with no front lines or battle plans it was fueled on anger and fear and the blind need to destroy the oncetidy restaurant with its pretty striped awning and sidewalk tables was destroyed shards from the broken window sparkled like scattered gems over the sidewalk the flap of the awning in the raw spring wind was smothered by the staticfilled drone of police radios reporters held back by barricades swarmed like hungry wolves there was another volley of gunshots from inside and a long terrified scream jesus sweat popped out on curts brow as he held the camera steady hes killing them get a shot of that cop there finn ordered the one with the bullhorn youre the boss curt focused in on a cop in a neon orange trench coat with a hangdog face and graying hair amid the screams and shouts the weeping the bitter threats and curses from inside the restaurant the steelyeyed cop continued to talk in a soothing monotone pretty cool customer curt observed then at a signal from finn shifted crouched to get a shot of the swat team taking position cool enough finn agreed if he keeps at it they might not need the sharpshooters keep rolling im going to see if i can work my way over and find out who he is the ballroom was filled to capacity from where deanna sat on the raised dais she could see all three hundred and fifty people who had come to hear her talk about women in broadcasting she was going to give them their moneys worth shed gone over her notes thoroughly once again on the drive from chicago letting her concentration lapse only when she caught a glimpse of finn on the limos television he was as barlow james would say in his element and it seemed she was in hers she waited through the flattering introduction through the applause that followed it then rose and walked to the podium she scanned the room smiled good afternoon one of the first things we learn in broadcasting is that we work weekends since we are i hope to make the next hour as entertaining as it is informative that to me is television and ive found it a very satisfying way to make a living it occurred to me that as you are professionals you wouldnt have much opportunity to watch daytime tv so im hoping to convince you to set your vcrs monday morning were on at nine here in merrillville that earned deanna her first chuckle and set the tone for the next twenty minutes until her speech segued into a questionandanswer period one of the first questioners asked if finn riley had accompanied her im afraid not as we all know one of the boons and the curses of this business is the breaking story finns reporting on one right now but you can catch him on in depth tuesday nights i always do miss reynolds how do you feel about the fact that looks have become as much a part of the criteria for onair jobs as credentials i would certainly agree with network executives that television is a visual medium to a point i can tell you this if in thirty years finn riley is still reporting and considered a statesman id not only expect but demand as a woman to be given the same respect finn wasnt thinking about the future he was too involved in the present using wile guile and arrogance hed managed to gain a position beside the hostage negotiator lieutenant arnold jenner jenner still held the bullhorn but had taken a short break in his appeal to his quarry to release the hostages lieutenant the word ive gotten here is that johnson thats his name isnt it elmer johnson its the one he answers to jenner said mildly he has a history of depression his va records you wouldnt have access to his medical records mr riley not directly but he had contacts and hed used them my take on this is that johnson served in the military and has been troubled since his discharge in march of last year last week he lost his wife and his job youre well informed i get paid to be he went into this restaurant at just past ten this morning thats about three hours ago armed with a fortyfour magnum a bushmaster a gas mask and a carbine he shot and killed two waiters and a bystander then took five hostages including two women and a twelveyearold girl the owners daughter ten jenner said wearily the kids ten mr riley you do good work and usually i enjoy it but my job right now is to get those people out of there alive finn glanced over noting the position of the sharpshooters they wouldnt wait much longer what are his demands can you tell me that it hardly mattered jenner decided there had been only one and he hadnt been able to meet it he wants his wife mr riley she left chicago four days ago were trying to locate her but we havent had any luck i can get it on the air if she catches a bulletin she may make contact let me talk to him i might be able to get him to bargain if i tell him ill put all my people on it you that desperate for a story insults were too common in his line of work for finn to take offense im always ready to bargain for a story lieutenant his eyes narrowed as he measured the man beside him look the kids ten let me try jenner believed in instinct and he also knew without a doubt that he couldnt hold the situation from flash point much longer after a moment he handed finn the bullhorn dont promise what you cant deliver mr johnson elmer this is finn riley im a reporter i know who you are the voice came out a highpitched shriek through the broken glass do you think im stupid you were in the gulf right i was too shit you figure that makes us buddies i figure anybody who did time over theres already been to hell the awning flapped reminding him of the road to kuwait and the sparkle of pink sequins i thought maybe we could make a deal there aint no deal my wife gets here i let them go she doesnt were all going to hell for real the cops have been trying to reach her but i thought we could put a new spin on it ive got a lot of contacts i can get your story national put your wifes picture on television screens from coast to coast even if she isnt watching someone who knows her is bound to be well put a number on a special number where she can call in you can talk to her elmer that was good jenner decided even as he braced to rip the bullhorn from finns hands if the need arose using his first name offering him not only hope but a few minutes of fame his superiors might not approve but jenner thought it could work then do it johnson shouted out just fucking do it ill be glad to but i cant unless you give something back just let the little girl come out elmer and ill plug your story across the country within ten minutes i can even fix it so you can get a message to your wife in your own words im not letting anybody out except in a body bag shes just a kid elmer your wife probably likes kids christ he hoped so if you let her go shell hear about it and shell want to talk to you its a trick ive got a camera right here he glanced toward curt is there a tv in the bar in there he called out what if there is you can watch everything i do everything i say ill have them put me on live then do it do it in five minutes fucking five minutes or youre going to have another body in here call the desk finn shouted patch me in set up for live now then he turned back to jenner youd make a pretty good cop for a reporter thanks he handed jenner the bullhorn tell him to send her out while im on the air or i go to black in precisely five minutes finn faced the camera whatever his inner turmoil his delivery was calm and well paced his eyes cool behind him was the shattered exterior of the restaurant this morning in chicagos greektown this familyrun restaurant erupted with violence three people are known dead in the standoff between police and elmer johnson a former mechanic who chose this spot to take his stand johnsons only demand is contact with his estranged wife arlene though he sensed activity behind him finns eyes stayed fixed on the cameras light johnson well armed is holding five hostages in his appeal to there was a scream from behind him finn shifted instantly to give curt room to tape it happened quickly as if all the waiting hours had been focused on this one moment the child trembling and weeping stepped outside even as the shadow of the awning fell over her face a wildeyed man sprinted out screaming as he hurtled toward escape the rash of gunfire from the restaurant propelled the man forward off his feet it was jenner finn saw who scooped the child aside even as johnson stumbled to the door the snipers bullet plowed through johnsons forehead oh man curt kept repeating the words over and over under his breath as he held the camera steady man oh man oh man finn only shook his head the burning in his left arm made him glance down curiously brows knit he touched the hole in his sleeve his fingers came away sticky with blood well hell he murmured i got this coat in milan shit riley curts eyes bulged shit youre hit yeah he didnt feel any pain yet only dull annoyance you just cant patch leather either on monday as soon as the morning show was taped deanna stood in the center of her office her eyes glued to the tv screen it seemed unbelievable that she could hear finns voice supplying the details over the special report she saw the scene as he had the shattered glass the bloodied body the camera bobbled and swung as the sniper fired her heart jerked as she heard the pop and ping of bullets through it all finns voice remained calm cool with an underpinning of fury she doubted any of his viewers were aware of she stood a fist pressed to her heart as the camera zoomed in on the child weeping in the arms of a rumpled man with graying hair deanna jeff hesitated in the doorway then crossed the room to stand beside her its horrible she murmured unbelievable if that man hadnt panicked and run out that way if he hadnt done that it might have turned out differently that little girl she could have been caught in the cross fire and finn hes okay hey hes right downstairs back on the job back on the job deanna he said again and laid a hand on her shoulder i know it must be tough for you not only knowing it happened but actually watching it he walked over and switched off the set but hes okay he was shot she whirled away from the blank screen and struggled for composure and i was in indiana you cant imagine how horrible it was to have tim come into the ballroom and tell me hed seen it on the limos set and to be helpless not to be there when they took him to the hospital if it upsets you this much and you asked him he could get a desk job for the first time all morning she gave him a genuine smile things dont work that way i wouldnt want them to wed better get back to work she gave his hand a quick squeeze before rounding her desk thanks for listening hey thats what im here for everybody stays late tonight angela announced at an emergency staff meeting nobody leaves until we lock in this show i want a panel and i want it hardline three from this white supremacist group three from the naacp i want radicals she sat behind her desk her fingers drumming on the surface make sure each side gets at least a dozen tickets so they can seed the audience i want to blow the roof off she stabbed a finger at her head researcher weve got some statistics here in new york get me some of the relatives some of them might not be easy to persuade then pay them she snapped money always turns the tide and i want some tape as graphic as possible from rallies some witnesses to racially motivated crimes perpetrators would be better promise that well protect their identities promise them anything just get them when she fell into silence dan gave a nod that signaled the end of the meeting he waited until the door was closed again you know angela you could be walking on thin ice here her head snapped up you sound like lew im not advising you against doing it im just suggesting that you watch out for the cross fire i know what im doing shed seen finns report as had nearly every other american with a television set now she was going to outdo him as well as deanna we need something hot and the timing couldnt be better the countrys in an uproar about race and the citys a mess youre not worried about deanna reynolds he smiled knowing he had to defuse the tantrum he saw building in her eyes shes climbing up my back isnt she shell slip off he took her rigid hands in his what you need now is a boost in publicity something that will focus the publics attention on you he lifted her hand admiring the way the sun dashed off the diamonds in her watch and ive got an idea how to do it it better be good its more than good its inspired he kissed her hand watching her over her knuckles the american public loves one thing more than they love hearing about graft and sex and violence weddings he said as he drew her gently to her feet big splashy weddings private weddings dotted with celebrities marry me angela his eyes were soft ill not only make you happy ill see to it that your pictures on every major newspaper and magazine in the country the flutter of her heart was quick and what would you get out of it dan y reading her clearly he lowered his head to kiss her all i want is you on the second saturday in june angela donned a vera wang shellpink gown of silk encrusted with tiny pearls its sweetheart neckline framed a flattering hint of her rounded breasts its full elaborate skirt accented her tiny waist she wore a widebrimmed hat with a fingertip veil and carried a bouquet of white orchids the ceremony took place in the country home shed purchased in connecticut and was attended by a stellar guest list some were pleased to be there drawn either by sentiment or the notion of having their name and photo included in the press releases others came because it was easier to accept than to face angelas fury later elaborate gifts crowded the large parlor and under uniformed guard were on display for the select members of the press no one seeing all this angela thought would doubt how much she was loved the reception spilled out into the rose garden where a champagne fountain bubbled and white doves cooed when the event was buzzed incessantly by helicopters crammed with paparazzi she knew it was a success like any new bride she glowed the sun glinted off the fivecarat diamond gracing her left hand as she posed with dan for photos she told the reporters regretfully that her mother her only living relative was too ill to attend in reality she was tucked in a private clinic drying out kate lowell looking young and fresh in a billowing sundress kissed angelas cheek for the benefit of the cameras her long redgold hair flowed down her bare back melted copper over sunkissed peaches she had a face the camera worshiped iceedged cheekbones full lips huge gold eyes the image was completed by a sinuous body killer legs and a rich infectious giggle kate lowell could have become a star on the sole basis of her glorious physical attributes she certainly had done her share of commercial endorsements but she had something more talent and charm that burned every bit as hot as her boxoffice appeal and ambition that seared through both she enchanted the photographer by shooting him a dazzling smile then turned the other cheek for angela i hate your guts she said softly i know darling beaming angela slipped her arm around kates waist fingers digging ruthlessly into flesh as she turned her best side to the camera smile pretty now show why youre the numberone female boxoffice draw kate did with a smile that could have melted steel at five paces i wish you were dead you and so many others she hooked her arm through kates and strolled off two bosom friends stealing a private moment now is it true that you and rob winters are considering scripts for a tv movie no comment now now darling angelas voice was a purr deadly feline didnt we agree to scratch each others backs id like to scratch your eyes but she knew she couldnt there was much too much at stake for her to indulge herself quite that blatantly still there were other weapons tilting her head kate studied angelas face thats an excellent tuck by the way barely noticeable her smile was quick and sincere when angela bristled dont worry darling itll be our secret after all a girls got to do everything necessary to maintain the illusion of youth especially when shes married to a younger man behind the flirty little veil angelas eyes were as hard as marbles it was her day by god hers and nothing and no one would spoil it a scripts come my way katie dear i think youll find it fascinating and i think youll be able to pique robs interest as well the two of you have been pals for years and it would be a friendly boost if you persuaded him to do it after all he doesnt have a great deal of time left to pick and choose does he you bitch angela gave a trilling laugh nothing could have pleased her more than seeing kates smug smile fade the trouble with actors is they need someone to write that clever dialogue youll have the script by monday darling i really would consider it a favor if youd read it quickly im getting tired of your favors angela other people might call it blackmail im not other people its simply a matter of my having certain information that im more than happy to keep to myself a favor to you dear in return you do one for me thats called cooperation one day youre going to cooperate yourself right into hell its just business with a sigh angela patted kates flushed cheeks youve been around long enough to know better than to take everything so personally well discuss terms when i get back from my honeymoon now youll have to excuse me i cant ignore my guests although kates imagination didnt run to dialogue she had no trouble with visuals as angela glided away kate saw the frothy silk splattered with blood one day she whispered yanking a rose from a bush and crushing it in her hand one day someones finally going to get the guts and do it she looks wonderful lolling on the couch in the cabin deanna studied the front cover of p radiant finn drummed up the energy to glance over they had finally been able to synchronize a full three days off together if the phone didnt ring the fax didnt shrill and the world didnt collapse within the next twentyfour hours they would have made it through she looks like one of those prop wedding cakes all fancy fake icing over the inedible your visions skewed by malice yours should be too she only sighed and flipped through to the cover story i dont have to like her to admit shes lovely and she looks happy really happy maybe marriage will mellow her he only snorted since this is her third time at bat thats doubtful not if this is the right one i dont wish her bad luck personally or professionally she peered over the top of the magazine i want to whip her butt on merit you are whipping her butt in chicago and a few other markets but this weddings bound to shift the tide at least for a time he stretched his arms over his head muscles rippling deanna could see the faint scar where the bullet had sliced through why do you think she did it oh come on finn give her some credit a woman doesnt get married so that she can get her picture on a few covers kansas amazed that she could still be so naive he took the magazine from her when youre slipping down the ladder you grab hold of any handy rope i think thats a mixed metaphor you think this is for love laughing he sent the magazine sailing angela the happy bride landed facedown shes had six weeks of free publicity since the day her secret engagement mysteriously leaked it could have leaked she gave him a friendly shove with her stockinged foot and even if she planted it it doesnt change the bottom line shes a beautiful vibrant woman who fell for a gorgeous magnetic man gorgeous finn snagged her foot by the ankle you think hes gorgeous yes hes she shrieked twisting as he tickled her foot stop that and magnetic sexy giggling helplessly she reared up to try to free herself sinfully attractive she tried biting when he wrestled her down you fight like a girl she blew her hair out of her eyes and tried to buck him off so what i like it and im now honorbound to erase dan whatshisname from your mind dan gardner she said primly and i dont know if you can i mean hes so elegant so polished so she gave a mock shiver so romantic well shoot for a contrast with one swipe he dragged his hand down her breezy cotton blouse and sent buttons flying finn caught between shock and amusement she started to shove him back the laughing protest ended on a strangled gasp as he fastened his mouth to her breast instant heat instant need it burst through her like light blindingly bright the hands that had playfully pressed against his shoulders tightened like vises short neat nails digging crescents into his flesh her heart stuttered beneath his greedy mouth losing its pace then racing ahead in a wild sprint his hands were already tugging aside the remains of her blouse then streaking over bared skin to arouse and demand the strong summer sun streamed through the windows fell over her in hot white light her skin was moist from it from his rough impatient touch with his mouth still feasting on her he slid his hand under the baggy leg of her shorts and drove her ruthlessly to a fast violent climax again driven himself he fixed his mouth on hers swallowing her cry as he pushed her higher he wanted her like this so often he was content to let them take each other slowly savoring each touch each taste on the long lazy journey toward fulfillment he loved the way her body grew sinuous and soft the way his own pleasures built layer by layer but now he wanted only the fast molten ride the mindlessness of hurried urgent sex he wanted to possess her to brand her to feel her body rock fitfully under his until he was sunk deep he tore at her clothes even as she tugged and yanked at his her breath was hot on his flesh her mouth streaking hungrily over him sounds of desperate excitement humming in her throat he shifted gripping her hips and lifting her up so that the muscles in his arms quivered then he was sheathed in her their twin cries of triumph shivered on the sultry air with her head thrown back her long slim body glistening with sweat she took him deeper drove him as he had driven her ruthlessly relentlessly she gripped his hands guiding them over her damp body urging him to claim more while her heart galloped in a mad race of its own the orgasm struck a sweaty fist that pummeled and pummeled and left her body a mass of indescribably exquisite aches the air was clogged and burning in her lungs she sobbed to release it sobbed to gulp it back in she felt his body lunge vaulting her over that final keen edge like wax melted in the sun she slid down to him and lay limp his own mind cleared gradually the static from the storm dying to a steady quiet that was her breathing the dark haze that had covered his vision lifted so that he closed his eyes against the hard sunlight i guess i protected my honor he murmured she gave a strangled laugh i didnt know god i cant breathe she tried again i didnt know tweaking your ego would be so rewarding relaxed she sighed v happy completely then this is probably a good time to ask you to think about something hmmm i dont think i can think just now put this in the back of your mind his hand gently massaged her back let it stew there for a while what am i supposed to stew about marrying me she jerked back marrying you is looking shocked another way to tweak my ego no staggered she pressed a hand to her cheek god finn you know how to toss one in from left field well talk baseball later since the cubs are in the basement goddamn nerves he thought while his stomach clenched it was ridiculous for him to feel these tugs of panic but all he could imagine was her saying no absolutely not for the first time in his life he wanted something and someone he wasnt sure he could have he levered himself up so that they sat naked facing each other both still achy and sated with sex the plan was he reminded himself to keep it light natural it shouldnt be such a surprise deanna weve been lovers for more than a year yes but we havent even resolved living together yet one of my points my strategy in getting you to live with me then easing you into marriage just isnt panning out your strategy he didnt mind the edge in her voice it matched the one in his own kansas the only way to handle you is like a chess game a man has to think a half dozen moves ahead and outflank you i dont think i care for that analogy its an accurate one he pinched her chin lightly between his fingers you spend so much time thinking things through trying to avoid making the wrong move i have to give you a shove is that what this proposal is she batted his hand away a shove well call it more of a nudge since im willing to let you think it over thats generous of you she said between her clenched teeth actually he continued im giving us both time i cant say im completely sold on the idea myself she blinked excuse me it was inspired he realized absolutely inspired two could play tweaktheego were coming from opposite fields here on this subject you from a big happy family all those traditional trappings where till death do us part means something for me marriage has always meant till divorce do us part incensed she snatched up her blouse swore then tossed it aside for someone so cynical im surprised youd consider it his mouth quivered as she dragged on his tshirt im not cynical im realistic marriage has become like newspapers you toss them out when youre through and not a hell of a lot of people bother to recycle then whats the point she yanked on her shorts im in love with you he said it quietly simply and stopped her from storming out of the room id like to think about the idea of starting a life with you having children giving some of those traditional trappings a shot his words deflated her anger damn you finn she said helplessly he grinned up at her then youll think about it chapter twenty dan gardner didnt marry angela for her money not entirely some people were unkind enough to think he had even to say he had during the first few weeks of their marriage there was considerable speculation in the tabloid press about the matter as well as the disparity in their ages ten years almost to the day a firm believer in publicity dan had planted the articles himself but there were other reasons he had married her he admired her skills he understood her flaws and most important to him how to exploit them it was he recognizing her insecurities and her suspicions who had insisted on signing a prenuptial agreement divorce would not benefit him but dan wasnt planning on divorce unless it benefited him it was he knowing her weakness for romance and her need to be the center of love who arranged for candlelit dinners for two quiet weekends in the country when she needed attention beyond what he could provide he arranged for that as well as angela became more and more obsessed with eroding ratings he picked up the threads of several a p production projects and deftly increased the profits he might not have married her for her money but he intended to enjoy it look at this angela heaved a copy of tv guide across the room it landed with deannas picture faceup just look daytimes new princess my ass her silk robe billowed out like a sail as she paced the snowy carpet of her penthouse warm and accessible sexy and sharp they fawned over her dan goddamn it they gave her the cover and two full pages dont let it spook you because they were staying in for the evening dan poured her a full flute of champagne she was easier to handle when she was drunk and weepy and when she was needy the sex was simply stupendous shes just got a longer way to fall now thats all thats not all angela snatched the glass away from him she didnt want to need a drink but she did and she was in no mood to fight the longing you saw the ratings shes had a twentypercent share for the last three weeks and you ended up the year as number one he reminded her its a new year she snapped back yesterday doesnt count she drank deeply then planted the dainty heel of her feathered mule in deannas left eye not so pretty now are you fueled on envy she kicked the magazine aside no matter what i do she keeps moving up now shes getting my press after draining the glass she thrust it back at dan angelas isnt your only interest dutifully he refilled the glass for her you have the specials the projects a p productions is involved with your interests and your impact are more diverse than hers he watched her eyes consider as she drank shes got one note angela she plays it well but its just one note the description steadied her quaking heart she was always limited with her little timetables and note cards but as her fury drained despair crept into the void i dont want her cutting me out dan her eyes filled swimming with hot tears as she gulped down champagne i dont think i could stand it not from her of all people youre making it too personal sympathetically he filled her glass again knowing that after the third drink shed be as pliant as a baby with a full tummy it is personal the tears spilled over but she let dan lead her to the couch she cuddled there on his lap with tangled threads of contentment and unease working through her it had been the same cuddling on her fathers lap on the rare occasions when he had been home and sober she wants to hurt me dan she and that bastard loren bach theyd do anything to hurt me no ones going to hurt you he tipped the glass to her lips the way a mother might urge medicine on a whiny child they know im the best of course they do her neediness aroused him as long as her neuroses bloomed he was in charge setting her glass aside he parted her robe to nuzzle her breasts just leave everything to me he murmured ill take care of it do arguments with your mate end up as war zones with flying accusations and flying dishes how to fight fair tomorrow on deannas hour okay dee we need some bumpers for the affiliates she rolled her eyes at the assistant director but dutifully scanned the cue cards view the best on tulsas best kjabtv channel nine okay lets run through them for the next hour she taped promos for affiliates across the country a tedious chore at best but one she always agreed to when it was done fran walked on set with a chilled sixteenounce bottle of pepsi she waddled a little heavily pregnant with her second child the price of fame she said i can pay it grateful deanna took a long cool drink didnt i tell you to go home early didnt i tell you im fine ive got three weeks yet three more weeks and you wont fit through the doorway what was that nothing deanna drank again before heading off set she paused by the large mirror hooking an arm through frans so that they stood side by side dont you think youre a bit bigger than you were when you were carrying aubrey fran snuck an mandmore into her mouth water weight deanna caught the whiff of candy and lifted a brow sure it couldnt have anything to do with all those chocolate doughnuts youve been scarfing down the kid has a yen for them what am i supposed to do the cravings have to be filtered through me first tilting her head fran studied her reflection the new chinlength hair bob might have been flattering she thought if her face hadnt looked like an inflated balloon jeez why did i buy this brown suit i look like a woolly mammoth you said it i didnt deanna turned toward the elevators eyeing fran owlishly as she pressed the button no cracks about weight restrictions pal with what dignity she could muster fran waddled in and stabbed sixteen i cant wait until its your turn if youd just give in and marry finn you could start a family you too could experience the joys of motherhood swollen feet indigestion stretch marks and the everpopular weak bladder youre making it so appealing the trouble and the reason i am once again approaching the size of a small planet is that it is appealing she pressed a hand to her side as the baby once again dubbed big ed tried out a onetwo punch theres nothing quite like it she murmured the doors opened so are you going to marry the guy or what im thinking about it youve been thinking about it for weeks fran braced a hand on her spine as they walked to deannas office hes thinking too she knew it sounded defensive annoyed she sailed through the empty outer office into her own and things are complicated right now things are always complicated people who wait for the perfect moment usually die first thats comforting i wouldnt want to push you wouldnt you deanna smiled again nudge sweetie pie not push whats this fran picked up the single white rose that lay across deannas desk classy she said giving it a sniff romantic sweet she glanced at the plain white envelope still resting on the blotter finn no deanna thought her skin chilled not finn she struggled for casualness and picked up a pile of correspondence cassie had typed could be arent you going to open the note later i want to make sure cassie gets these letters out before the end of the day god youre a tough sell dee if a guy sent me a single rose id be putty im busy frans head jerked up at the change in her tone i can see that ill get out of your way im sorry instantly contrite deanna reached out really fran i didnt mean to bite your head off i guess im a little wired the daytime emmy business is coming up that stupid tabloid story about my secret affair with loren bach hit last week oh honey youre not letting that get to you come on i think loren got a kick out of it he can afford to it didnt make him sound as though he was sleeping his way to a thirtypercent share nobody believes those things she huffed at deannas expression well nobody with an iq in the triple digits as far as the emmys go youve got nothing to worry about there either youre going to win thats what they keep telling susan lucci but she laughed and waved fran away get out of here and go home this time its nearly five anyway talked me into it fran laid the rose back on the desk not noticing deannas instinctive recoil see you tomorrow yeah alone deanna reached cautiously for the envelope she took the ebonyhandled letter opener from her desk set and slit it cleanly open deanna id do anything for y if only youd look at me really look id give you anything everything ive been waiting so long she was beginning to believe the writer meant every word she slipped the note neatly back into the envelope opened her bottom desk drawer to place it on the mounting stack of similar messages determined to handle the matter practically she picked up the rose studying its pale fragile petals as if they held a clue to the identity of the sender obsession a frightening word she thought yet surely some forms of obsession were harmless enough still the flower was a change in habit thered been no tokens before only the messages in deep red surely a rose was a sign of affection esteem fragrant and sweet yet the thorns marching up the slender stem could draw blood now she was being foolish she told herself rising she filled a water glass and stuck the rose inside she couldnt stand to see a beautiful flower wither and die still she set it on a table across the room before she went back to her desk for the next twenty minutes she signed correspondence she still had the pen in her hand when her intercom buzzed yes cassie its finn riley on two thanks ive finished these letters can you mail them on your way home sure thing finn are you downstairs im sorry we had a couple of glitches here and im running behind

ill let you know ill be here bye deanna replaced the receiver then swiveled in her chair to face the window the sun was already setting dimming the sky making the skyline gloomy she could see lights blinking on pinpoints against the encroaching dusk she imagined buildings emptying out the freeway filling at home people would be switching on the evening news and thinking about dinner if she married finn they would go home to their home not his not hers if she married finn deanna toyed with the bracelet she always wore as much a talisman to her as the cross finn wore was to him she would be making a promise of forever if she married him she believed in keeping promises they would begin to plan a family she believed deeply in family and she would have to find ways good solid clever ways to make it all work to make all the elements balance that was what stopped her no matter how often she tried to stop and reason everything out or how often she struggled to list her priorities and plan of attack she skittered back like a spooked doe she wasnt sure she could make it work there wasnt any hurry she reminded herself and right now her priority had to be managing that next rung on the ladder she glanced at her watch calculating the time she needed against the time she had long enough she thought to let herself relax briefly before getting back to work trying one of the stressreduction techniques shed learned from a guest on her show she shut her eyes drawing long easy breaths she was supposed to imagine a door closed and blank when she was ready she was to open that door and step into a scene she found relaxing peaceful pleasant as always she opened the door quickly too quickly impatient to see what was on the other side the porch of finns cabin spring butterflies flitted around the blooming herbs and flowering ground cover of his rock garden she could hear the sleepy droning of bees hovering around the salmoncolored azalea she had helped him plant the sky was a clear dazzling blue so perfect for dreams she sighed beautifully content there was music all strings a flood of weeping violins flowing through the open windows behind her then she was lying on that soft blooming lawn lifting her arms to finn the sun haloed around his hair casting shadows over his face deepening his eyes until they were so blue she might have drowned in them wanted to and he was in her arms his body warm and hard his mouth sure and clever she could feel her body tighten with need her skin hum with it they were moving together slowly fluidly as graceful as dancers with the blue bowl of the sky above them and the drone of bees throbbing like a pulse she heard her name a whisper twining through the music of the dream and she smiled and opened her eyes to look at him but it wasnt finn clouds had crept over the sun darkening the sky to ink so that she couldnt see his face but it wasnt finn even as her body recoiled he said her name again im thinking of you always she jerked awake skin clammy heart thumping in automatic defense she wrapped her arms tight around herself to ward off a sudden violent chill the hell with meditation she thought struggling to shake off the last vestige of the dream shed take workrelated stress any day she tried to laugh at herself but the sound came out more like a sob just groggy she thought a little groggy from an unscheduled catnap but her eyes widened as she stared at her watch shed been asleep for nearly an hour a ridiculous waste of time she told herself and rose from the chair to work out kinks work she told herself firmly and started to shrug out of her suit jacket as she turned back to her desk and there were roses two perfectly matched blooms speared up from the water glass in the center of her desk in instant denial she stepped forward her eyes cutting across the room to where she had set the single flower earlier it was no longer there no longer there she thought dully because it was now on her desk joined by its mate she rubbed the heel of her hand against her breastbone as she stared at the roses cassie might have done it she thought or simon or jeff or margaret anyone whod been working late one of them had found the second rose somewhere and had brought it in slipped it in with the first and seeing her sleeping had simply left them on her desk seeing her sleeping a shudder ran through her weakening her legs shed been asleep alone defenseless as she sagged against the arm of the chair she saw the tape resting on her blotter she could tell from the manufacturers label it wasnt the type they used on the show no note this time perhaps a note wasnt necessary she thought about running rushing pellmell out of the office there would be people in the newsroom plenty of people working the swing between the evening and the late news she wasnt alone a telephone call would summon security an elevator ride would take her into the bustle of activity a few floors below no she wasnt alone and there was no reason to be afraid there was every reason to play the tape she wiped her damp palms on her hips before taking the tape from its sleeve and sliding it into the vcr slot the first few seconds after she hit play were a blank blue screen when deanna watched the picture flicker on her forehead creased in concentration she recognized her building heard the whoosh of traffic through the audio a few people breezed by on the sidewalk in shirtsleeves indicating warm weather she watched herself come through the outside door her hair flowing around her shoulders dazed she lifted a hand combing her fingers through the short cap she watched herself check her watch the camera zoomed in on her face her eyes smoky with impatience she could hear hideously the sound of the camera operators unsteady breathing a cbc van streaked up to the curb the picture faded out and faded in she was strolling along michigan with fran her arms were loaded with shopping bags she wore a thick sweater and a suede jacket as she turned her head to laugh at fran the picture froze holding steady on her laughing face until dissolve there were more than a dozen clips snippets of her life a trip to the market her arrival at a charity function a stroll through water tower place playing with aubrey in the park signing autographs at a mall her hair short now her wardrobe indicating the change of seasons through it all the moodsetting soundtrack of quiet breathing the last clip was of her sleeping curled in her office chair she continued to stare after the screen sizzled with snow fear had crept back chilling her blood so that she stood shivering in the slanted light of the desk lamp for years hed been watching her she thought stalking her invading small personal moments of her life and making them his and shed never noticed now he wanted her to know he wanted her to understand how close he was how much closer he could be leaping forward she fumbled with the eject button finally pounded it with her fist she grabbed her bag stuffing the tape inside as she dashed from the office the corridor was dark shadowy from the backwash of light from her office a pulse beat in the base of her neck as she dashed to the elevator her breath was sobbing when she pushed the button she whirled around and pressed her back to the wall scanning the shadows wildly for movement hurry hurry she pressed a hand to her mouth as her voice echoed mockingly down the empty corridor the rumble of the elevator made her jump nearly crying out in relief she spun toward the doors then fell back when she saw a form move away from the corner of the car and step toward her hey dee did i give you a jolt roger stepped closer as the doors slithered closed at his back hey kid youre white as a sheet dont she cringed back her eyes flashed toward the fire door leading to the stairs she would have to get past him she would get past him hey whats going on the concern in rogers voice had her gaze sliding cautiously back to him youre shaking maybe youd better sit down im fine im leaving now youd better catch your breath first come on lets she jerked back avoiding his hand what do you want cassie stopped downstairs on her way out he spoke slowly letting his hand fall back to his side she said you were working late so i thought id come up and see if you wanted to catch some dinner finns coming she moistened her lips hell be here any minute it was just a thought dee is everything okay your folks all right a new fear gripped her throat digging in like talons why why do you ask that youre rattled i thought youd gotten some bad news no giddy with panic she edged away ive got a lot on my mind she barely muffled a scream as the elevator rumbled again jesus dee take it easy in reflex he grabbed her arm as she started to race by him toward the stairs she swung back to fight and the elevator doors opened what the hells going on oh god tearing free from roger deanna fell into finns arms thank god youre here his grip tightened protectively as his eyes bored into rogers i said what the hells going on you tell me shaken roger dragged a hand through his hair i came up a minute ago and she was ready to jump out of her skin i was trying to find out what happened did he hurt you finn demanded of deanna and earned a curse of outrage from roger no she kept her face buried against his shoulder the shaking the horrible shaking wouldnt stop she thought she could hear her own bones rattling together i was so scared i cant think just take me home finn managed to pry a disjointed explanation from her on the drive home then pushing a brandy on her had watched the tape himself she offered no protest when he strode to the phone and called the police she was calmer when she related the story again she understood the value of details of timetables of clearcut facts the detective who interviewed her in finns living room sat patiently jotting in his notepad she recognized the grayhaired man from the tape from greektown he had snatched the little girl out of the line of fire arnold jenner was a quiet meticulous cop his square face was offset by a nose that had been broken not on the job but by a line drive during a precinct softball game he wore a dark brown suit that strained only slightly over the beginnings of a paunch his hair was caught somewhere between brown and gray and trimmed ruthlessly short there were lines around his mouth and eyes that indicated he either laughed or frowned easily his eyes a pale sleepy green should have been as nondescript as the rest of him but as deanna stared into them she was comforted by a sense of trust id like to have the letters i didnt save all of them she told him and felt ashamed by the tired acceptance in his eyes the first few well it seemed harmless onair reporters get a lot of mail some of it on the odd side whatever you have then i have some at the office some at my apartment you dont live here no she shot a look at finn not exactly mmmhmmm jenner made another note miss reynolds you said that last portion of tape would have been taken this evening between fivethirty and sixtwenty yes i told you id fallen asleep i was tense so i thought id try this routine a guest on the show had suggested an imagery meditation thing she shrugged feeling foolish i guess its not my style im either awake or im asleep when i woke up i saw the second rose on the desk and the tape he made noises in his throat like a doctor deanna thought who would have access to your offices at that hour all manner of people my own staff anyone working downstairs so the building would be closed to all but cbc personnel not necessarily the rear door wouldnt be locked at that hour youd have people going off shift others coming on people picking them up or dropping them off sometimes even tours busy place yes his eyes lifted to hers again and she realized why they werent nondescript he wasnt simply looking at her he was looking in finn had that ability that same quick scalpel gaze that cut right through into your thoughts perhaps that was why she found him reassuring is there anyone you can think of someone youve rebuffed someone whos shown a more than casual or friendly interest in you no really theres no one i know who would keep doing something like this im sure its a stranger a viewer probably otherwise id probably have noticed them taping me well the way your shows been going that doesnt narrow the possible suspects in an old habit he doodled on his pad the doodle became deannas face the frightened eyes and the mouth that struggled to curve up you do a lot of public appearances have you noticed any particular face that keeps showing up no i thought of that ill take the tape with me he rose then tucking his notebook neatly in his pocket someone will come by for the notes theres nothing else is there she rose as well theres really nothing else you never know what we might pick up from the tape sophistication of equipment or some small identifying sound in the meantime try not to worry this kind of thing happens more often than you think and because she kept trying to smile he wanted to reassure her you hear about the big ones like that woman who keeps breaking into lettermans house but the truth is its not just celebrities who have to deal with obsessions not too long ago we had this woman focused on this stockbroker nicelooking guy but no adonis anyhow she called him at work at home sent telegrams left love notes under the windshield wiper of his car she even had pictures of herself in a wedding dress that she had doctored with one of him in a tux showed it to his neighbors to prove they were married what happened he took out a peace bond on her and she broke it by camping on his doorstep she went in for a psychiatric evaluation when she got out she decided she wasnt in love with the stockbroker anymore claims she divorced him so the moral is sometimes these things run their course could be thing is some people dont have as firm a grip on reality as they might youd probably feel better if you tightened up your security a little ill do that thank you detective jenner ill be in touch a real pleasure meeting you miss reynolds and you mr riley ive spent a lot of time with the two of you in my living room so thats that she said as she closed the door behind jenner not by a long shot finn took her firmly by the shoulders he hadnt interrupted her interview with jenner but now it was his turn youre not working late alone anymore really finn thats not negotiable so dont give me grief on this do you know what went through me when i saw you standing in the hall terrified fighting off crowell he was trying to help she began then closed her eyes and sighed yes yes i think i do know im sorry ill bring work home when i have to until this thing is resolved you need twentyfourhour protection a bodyguard she would have laughed if she wasnt afraid hed take a chunk out of her finn i wont work late in the building ill even make sure i have a buddy when i go on any remotes or appearances but im not hiring some thug named reno to lurk over me its not unusual for a woman in your position to hire private security whatever my position im still deanna reynolds from topeka and i refuse to have some bigshouldered hulk frighten off the people im trying to reach i couldnt stand it finn thats just too hollywood for me im not taking this lightly she continued believe me im going to take very serious care of myself but i havent been threatened youve been spied on followed taped harassed by anonymous notes and phone calls and it frightens me i admit it you were right about the police i should have called them before now that you have i feel like the whole situation has been put in the right compartment lets give them a chance to do what we pay them for frustrated he stalked down the hall and back a compromise he said at length christ im always digging up compromises for you judging the storm was blowing over she moved in to wrap her arms around him thats why our relationship is so healthy whats the compromise a bodyguard named sheila you move in here im not budging on this deanna keep your place i dont care but you live here with me funny in a subtle peace treaty she pressed a kiss to his cheek i was going to suggest the same solution he tipped her face up to his he wanted to ask badly if she was agreeing because she was frightened or because she needed him but he didnt ask what about when im out of town ive been thinking about asking you how you felt about dogs her lips curved against his we could go by the pound this weekend with so many abandoned animals it seems the right route chapter twentyone awards were not important quality work and the satisfaction of a job well done were their own reward statues and speeches were nothing more than industry hype deanna didnt believe any of it for a girl from kansas whose first ontheair job had been reporting on a dog show alighting from a limo in los angeles as an emmy nominee was a thrill and she didnt mind admitting it the day was perfect there was bound to be smog but she didnt see it the sky was the deep dreamy blue of a watercolor painting dazzled by the brilliant white sun a balmy breeze teased the elegant gowns and carefully coiffed hair of the attendees and wafted the scents of perfume and flowers over the enthusiastic crowd i cant believe im here it took all of her willpower not to bounce on the seat of the limo like a kid at the circus then she gave up and bounced anyway youve earned it charmed by her finn took her hand and brought it to his lips i know that up here she tapped her temple but in here she laid her hand on her heart im afraid someones going to pinch me and ill wake up and realize its only a dream ouch see youre awake he grinned as she rubbed her forearm and youre still here however giddy she felt she slid gracefully from the limo tossing her head up as she straightened and scanned the crowd the sun glinted off her short beaded gown and scattered light finn thought shed chosen well the strapless column of glittery scarlet made her look young and fresh and every inch the star several people in the crowd recognized her instantly and shouted her name their reaction obviously surprised her he realized with a hint of a smile she looked dazed then dazzled then delighted she waved back not with the careless insouciance of a seasoned veteran but with genuine pleasure and enthusiasm i feel like im walking into a movie she chuckled as she linked hands with finn no like im walking out of the last reel and ive got the hero he pleased her and the crowd by kissing her not just a friendly peck but a deep lingering embrace that gave the paparazzi plenty of fuel they stood a moment in the flashing sun a pictureperfect couple in evening dress that was because youre beautiful he kissed her again to the eruption of cheers and thats for luck thanks on both counts they started toward the building where fans and onlookers had been parted like the red sea by police barricades celebrities and press were mingling creating quick bites that would be shown on the evening news segments she knew some of these people deanna thought some had come on her show had sat beside her and chatted like old friends others she had met during the benefits and events that became part of the job she exchanged greetings and good wishes cheek busses and handclasps as they wandered toward the lobby mikes slashed out at them cameras wheeled in their direction impeding progress deanna how does it feel to be here tonight who designed your dress finn whats it like to have a hit show when so many news magazines have failed any marriage plans christ its like an obstacle course finn muttered as they worked their way through the gaggle of reporters im loving every minute of it she eased closer eyes dancing dont you know when they ask about your dress designer youve made it they didnt ask me she turned fussing with his tie and you look so nice too very gq he grimaced please i cant believe i got talked into doing that photo layout it was smashing im a newscaster not a model but you have such cute dimples they didnt flash they didnt so much as wink as he cornered her with one steelyeyed glare keep that up and ill leak the news that you changed your underwear three times before getting into that dress tonight okay theyre not cute no matter what mary hart said last week on et she said never mind no way was he going to get pulled into that one lets get a drink before we go in considering the occasion itll have to be champagne just one she added pressing a hand to her middle i dont think my system can handle any more wait here ill fight the horde i told you you were my hero she turned and would have scooted off into a corner where she could stand and observe but she found herself face to face with kate lowell hello dee hello kate deanna offered a hand and they shook like strangers its good to see you it doesnt feel as though you mean it she said as she straightened her shoulders you look terrific ready to win i hope so id like to wish you luck really excellent luck considering your competition thanks dont its purely selfish on my part by the way rob winters said to send his best if i ran into you deannas stiff smile softened how is he dying kate said shortly then let out a breath between her teeth sorry weve been friends for a long time and its hard to watch you dont have to apologize i understand about friendships and loyalties kate dropped her gaze direct hit dee cheap shot she corrected instinctively she took kates hand again there was none of the mannered politeness this time just support basic and unstudied i cant even imagine what it must be like for you kate studied their joined hands remembered how easy it had once been dee why didnt you announce robs condition when he told you about it because he asked me not to kate shook her head that was always enough for you id wondered if youd changed i have but that hasnt i really hope you win tonight i hope you cut her off at the knees with this she turned and walked away as deanna watched the other woman walk through the crowd she thought she understood the tears shed seen in kates eyes but not the venom in her voice well we have come up in the world angela glided into deannas line of vision a frothy dream of candypink silk and icy diamonds smile for the camera dear she whispered as she leaned forward to airkiss both of deannas cheeks surely you havent forgotten everything i taught you i havent forgotten a thing deanna let her lips curve up she hated the fact that her stomach jittered with nerves hated more the fact that they were bound to show its been a long time it certainly has i dont believe youve met my husband dan this is deanna reynolds a pleasure as polished as a fine gem dan took deannas hand in his youre every bit as charming as angela told me im sure she told you nothing of the kind but thanks i saw your preemmy special last night angela i enjoyed it did you angela held up a cigarette for dan to light i have so little time to watch television myself these days thats interesting id think that would insulate you from your audience i love to watch i suppose im really the average viewer average isnt something id settle for angelas gaze shifted over deannas shoulder smoldered hello finn isnt it interesting that wed all have to come to los angeles to have a reunion angela smoothly he passed deanna her glass of champagne then slipped an arm around her waist youre looking well he used to be much more clever with his compliments angela told dan she made the rest of the introductions and spotting a camera out of the corner of her eye angled herself into a prominent position i really must powder my nose before we go in deanna come along with me no woman goes to the ladies room alone though finn tightened his grip deanna eased away sure better to face whatever unpleasantness angela had in mind now she decided than wait for it to be played out in public finn ill meet you inside in a minute to offer the camera a friendly tableau angela hooked her arm through deannas we havent had one of our private talks for ages have we it would be a little tough since we havent seen each other in two years always so literal with a light laugh angela swung into the ladies lounge it was nearly empty as shed hoped later it would be full but now people were eager to be seated she walked to the mirrored counter pulled out a chair and did exactly what shed said she would do she powdered her nose youve chewed off most of your lipstick she said dryly nervous excited deanna remained standing but set her glass aside to dig a lipstick out of her evening bag i imagine thats a natural reaction to being nominated it becomes routine after a while i have several awards you know interesting that youve been nominated for that show on date rape id considered that more of a selfconfessional hour not a mix of views angela patted her hair searching for any outofplace strands as she turned her face side to side i imagine finn will cop one of the primetime statues himself when they come out hes well liked in the industry and hes been able to create a show that appeals to the news buffs as well as the viewer looking for entertainment i thought you didnt watch television angelas eyes sharpened it surprised deanna that their reflection didnt leave slices on the glass i glance at something now and then if i think it might interest me of course finn has always interested me slowly with relish she glided her tongue over her lips tell me do his eyes still go that wicked cobalt shade when hes aroused she dabbed perfume at her wrists you do manage to arouse him occasionally dont you why dont you ask him i may do that if i get him alone then again if i get him alone he might forget all about you smiling she twirled up a spiral of hot pink lipstick so what would be the point deanna wasnt nervous any longer she was simply irked the point might be that youre married and that finn stopped being interested in you a long time ago do you really believe that angelas laugh was as brisk and chilly as a puff of december air darling if i decided to have an affair with finn and dans a very understanding man so my marriage is no obstacle hed not only be willing hed be grateful moving beyond irked deanna felt little knots of tension twine in her stomach but her smile came easily angela there was a laugh in her voice trying to make me jealous is a waste of time you had sex with finn i know that and im not naive enough to imagine he didnt find you tremendously attractive and alluring but what i have with him now is on an entirely different level youre only embarrassing yourself by trying to convince me hes like some trained mutt wholl come running if you snap your fingers angela slapped the lid on the lipstick youre very cool arent you no not really im just happy she sat then hoping they could bury at least the sharpest edge of the hatchet angela we were friends once or at least friendly im grateful for the opportunity you gave me to learn and observe maybe the times passed where we can be friendly but i dont see why we have to snipe at each other were competitors but theres more than enough room for both of us do you think you can compete with me angela began to shake from her shoulders down to her spine do you really think you can come close to what ive achieved to what i have to what im going to have yes deanna said and rose yes i do and i dont have to resort to planting lies in the tabloids or lowlevel espionage to do it youve been in the business long enough to tolerate a little heat angela you cocky bitch ill bury you no you wont her pulse was drumming now a primitive tomtom rhythm that pumped through her blood in anticipation of a fight youre going to have a hell of a time keeping up with me on a cry of outrage angela snatched the champagne flute and tossed the contents in deannas face two women who entered the room froze like statues as angela followed up with a vicious slap youre nothing angela shrieked her face as pink as the silk she wore less than nothing im the best the fucking best she lunged fingers curled and extended like claws with a haze of fury misting her vision deanna struck out her open palm cracking angelas flushed cheek in an instant all movement froze for once at least they were both on equal terms horrified the two women in the doorway gasped in unison and stared ladies excuse us kate lowell stepped out from the stalls to the lounge and motioned to the women they flew out again obviously in a hurry to bear tidings well well and i thought all the competition was going to be out there dazed deanna stared down at her hand which was still burning from the blow it had delivered she blinked against the champagne stinging her eyes oh hell kate nodded to the outside door still swinging from the exit of the other women its going to make an interesting sidebar in tomorrows daytime emmy coverage she smiled suddenly a brilliant flash of perfect teeth would you like me to referee stay out of this teeth clenched angela took a step toward deanna shed been humiliated now publicly that above all was intolerable and you stay out of my way youve crossed the line i didnt turn the other cheek deanna returned and i dont intend to so why dont we try to stay out of each others way you wont win tonight with a hand that continued to tremble angela picked up her bag or ever lousy exit line kate mused as the door swung shut behind angela i dont know it had potential deanna closed her stinging eyes what now clean yourself up kate moved forward briskly to run cold water on a snowy washcloth put yourself back together and get out there i lost my temper she began then caught sight of herself in the mirror oh jesus her cheeks were suffused with heat dripping with wine her eyes were smoldering and smudged with mascara put the image back on kate advised handing her the damp cloth and when you walk out walk out with a smile i think i should braced for the worst she spun toward the door as it swung open her already hot cheeks fired further as finn strolled in i beg your pardon ladies but as a reporter its my duty to ask what the hells going on in here somebody said he broke off taking in the scene with one pithy glance christ kansas i cant leave you alone for a minute he sighed picked up one of the dry fluffy hand towels on the counter and offered it i didnt think that was a maidenly blush i noticed on angelas cheek which one of you slugged her the pleasure was deannas he leaned over to kiss her damp cheek nice going champ he touched his tongue to her lip youre supposed to drink the champagne baby not wear it deanna set her shoulders and turned back to the mirror to deal with the damage she would not be cowed she promised herself she simply would not be just keep everyone out for five minutes will you your categorys coming up he said casually as he headed for the door ill be there she was makeup freshened hair fluffed nerves raw she sat beside finn her hand clenched spasmodically over his out of camera range she hoped her mind was as keen as a sword as she watched the presenters breeze or fumble their way through scripted jokes and into lists of nominees she applauded politely or occasionally with enthusiasm as winners were announced and made their way to the stage she filed every instant every gesture every word in her memory because it mattered now horribly shed lost a good deal of the sweet excitement shed felt when theyd rolled up in the limo no she thought she wasnt just the kid from kansas now dazzled by the lights and the luminaries she was deanna reynolds and she belonged it wasnt simply an award any longer a pat on the back for a job well done now it was a symbol the culmination of what had started so long ago it was a symbol of triumph over the deceit the manipulations the ugly intrigue that had flashed into pathetic spite in a ladies washroom the camera was on her she could feel that cool objective eye focus in she could only hope that for once her emotions werent so clearly mirrored on her face she heard angelas name announced then her own she couldnt catch her breath then finn lifted their joined hands to his lips and the sharpest edge of tension smoothed and the emmy goes to god how could it take so long to open one envelope deanna reynolds for deannas hour when you know him oh all the breath that had backed up in her lungs came out in that one long sound before she could take another finns mouth was over hers i never had a doubt me neither she lied and was laughing as she rose out of the chair to walk through the applause to the stage the award was cool and smooth in her hands and solid as stone she was afraid if she looked at it shed weep instead she looked out into the lights i want to thank my team every one of them theyre the best and i want to thank the women who appeared on the show who battled back their fears to bring a painful subject out of the dark i cant think of any show ive done or will do that could be as difficult or as rewarding for me thank you for giving me something to remind me now im going backstage to stare at this beautiful lady after the speeches the applause the interviews and the parties deanna lay propped up in bed resting in the curve of finns shoulder casually she crossed her feet at the ankles i think mines prettier than your national press award she said mines more professional she pursed her lips studying the gold statue standing on the bureau mines shinier deanna he turned his head to kiss her temple youre gloating yep and im going to keep right on gloating youve won all sorts of awards overseas press club the george polk you can afford to be jaded who says im jaded and when i win my emmy itll be every bit as shiny as your emmy with a delighted laugh she rolled over to lie on top of him i won i didnt want to admit how badly i wanted that statue after that scene with angela i felt i had to win for me yes but also for everybody who works with me when they called my name i was flying really flying it was great an interesting evening all around he ran a hand down her spine enjoying the way her body curved to his touch tell me again how you demolished her deannas lashes fluttered down i did not demolish her it was a particularly effective but ladylike slap like hell grinning he tipped her face up then laughed out loud at the unholy glee in her eyes i shouldnt be proud of it she chuckled and sat up to straddle him her body pale and naked but for just an instant before i was horrified i felt wonderful then i was numb then i was furious all over again she linked her fingers lifting her arms up high besides she started it and you finished it you can count on her coming after you with both barrels now let her i feel invulnerable impervious she stretched high incredible it just cant get any better than this yes it can to prove it he reared up running a line of kisses up her torso her soft sigh glided through him her hands fluttered down to cradle his head you might be right the sky was pearling with dawn chasing the shadows from the room her body arched back already fluid and ready for his they had loved once in delirious haste and now moved together slowly letting the needs smolder and the air spark gliding fingertips whispering sighs quiet urgings for more torso to torso they pressed together tangled sheets pooled around them and morning sliding softly into the room a touch a taste a subtle shift in rhythm they lowered together to roll lazily over the bed length to length no rush no hurry quiet explosions shuddered through her blood then streamed away like silk until others built her mouth sought his sighs merging tongues dancing even when he slipped into her filling her the flash of heat was as comforting as a sunbeam across town there was another hotel room bed that hadnt been slept in or loved in angela sat on the edge of it her robe held protectively over her breasts the dress she had worn was a tattered heap of silk on the floor a victim of her temper most of that temper was spent now and she huddled like a child on the big bed fighting back tears it doesnt mean anything honey dan urged champagne on her the equivalent to a kiss where it hurt everybody knows the fucking awards are a sham people watch she stared straight ahead sipping the wine shed ordered chilled for celebration and now served as commiseration thousands of people dan they saw her walk up there when it should have been me they saw her pick up my award my award goddamn her and theyll forget about it tomorrow he stifled both impatience and disgust the only way to handle angela and to keep them both riding high was to cajole flatter and lie nobody remembers who got what when the glitter fades i remember she tossed up her head and her face was icy again eerily controlled i remember shes not getting away with it with any of it im going to do whatever it takes to make her pay for the slap for the award everything well talk about it later hed already gotten word on the incident in the lounge too many people people who couldnt be easily bought off had heard that angela struck first now youve got to relax you have to look your best when we fly home later today relax she spat at him relax deanna reynolds is getting my press my ratings now my awards and there was finn oh no she wouldnt forget finn how the hell can you tell me to relax because you cant win if you look like a resentful hasbeen he watched her eyes flare with fury then chill to an icy gleam how dare you speak to me that way and tonight of all nights im telling you this for your own good he continued assured he had the upper hand when her lips trembled you need to project dignity maturity confidence shes ruining my life its just like when i was a kid someone was always taking what i wanted youre not a kid anymore angela and therell be other awards she wanted this award but she held the words back hed only become more remote and disgusted she needed him beside her supporting her believing in her youre right absolutely right tomorrow in public i will be gracious humble and dignified and believe me deanna reynolds is not going to win another award that should be mine forcing a smile she reached out a hand and drew him down beside her im just so disappointed dan for both of us you worked just as hard as i did for that emmy well work harder for the next one relieved he kissed the top of her head sometimes it takes more than work god knows ive had plenty of experience there she sighed and drank again shed drink all she wanted tonight she promised herself at least she deserved that much when i was a kid i did all the chores around the house otherwise we would have lived in a pigsty ive always liked things to look right to look pretty to look the best they can i started doing cleaning for other people did i ever tell you that no surprised that she had now he rose to fetch the bottle he topped off her glass you dont like to talk about your childhood i understand that im in the mood for it she sipped again gesturing toward her cigarettes obligingly dan picked them up lighted one for her i earned extra money that way so i could buy things my own things but i earned more than money you know she took a contemplative drag its amazing what people leave lying around their homes tucked into drawers closed in boxes i was always curious about people thats why i ended up in this business i suppose and i found out a lot about the people i worked for things they preferred to be kept private i might mention to a certain married woman the name of a man not her husband then i might admire some earrings or a bracelet or a dress through the haze of smoke she smiled at the memory it was magical how quickly what i admired became mine just for doing the small favor of keeping information to myself you started young dan observed her voice was only a little slurred so he added more wine to her glass i had to nobody was going to fight for me nobody was going to lift me out of that hellhole i lived in but me mama drunk daddy off gambling or whoring it was tough on you it made me tough she corrected i watched the way people lived and i saw what i wanted i found ways to get what i wanted i improved myself and i broke my back to be the best no ones going to take me off the top of the heap dan certainly not deanna reynolds he tipped her face back for a kiss thats the angela i know and love she smiled her head felt light dizzy her body free why she wondered had she been so afraid of relaxing with a bottle or two prove it she invited and slipped the robe off her shoulders chapter twentytwo the snow outside the cabin was fairytale white rocks and shrubs caused the white covering to heave into mounds and bumps so that it resembled a blanket under which dozens of elves might burrow waiting for spring no cloud marred the eerie icy blue of the sky and the sun glinted off the glossy bark of trees from the window deanna watched finn and richard help aubrey build a snowman in her bright blue snowsuit the toddler looked like a little exotic bird whod lost her way going south curling tendrils of hair as red as a cardinals wing escaped from her cap beside her the men were giants bulky in their heavy coats and boots she watched as richard showed aubrey how to pat and mold a snowball he pointed at finn andwitha giggle that carried through the glass aubrey bounced it lightly off finns knee but he crumpled convincingly to the ground as if hit by a boulder the dog the mophaired mongrel finn and deanna had dubbed cronkite sent up a din of barks and a shower of snow in his desperation to join the game sounds like quite a snowman fran shifted her infant daughter from her right to her left breast kelsey latched on suckling happily theyve started a small war deanna reported casualties are light but it looks to be an extended battle you can go out and spend some of that nervous energy you dont have to stay in here with me no i like watching im so glad all of you could come up for the weekend since its the first free one youve had in six weeks im amazed youd share it getting away with friends is one of those luxuries ive had to do without too much she sighed a little there was no use thinking about all the weekends the holidays the quiet evenings at home shed missed she had what shed asked for ive discovered i need things like this to keep me centered glad to help richard found the idea of fishing in this weather just primitive and macho enough to pique his interest as for me she stroked her daughters cheek as she rocked gently in the chair finn had hauled in from the porch and scrubbed down for just that purpose i was ready to go anywhere when we get snow this early in november its going to be a long winter and not a particularly pleasant one fran was right about the nervous energy deanna realized she could feel it swirling inside white water in the bloodstream deanna turned away from the window to sit on the hearth where the fire crackled hot and brightly behind her i feel like ive been under siege fran all this this tabloid crap about angela and me brawling in the ladies lounge at the emmys honey most of thats died down and everyone knew it was crap to begin with most everyone restless she rose again prowling all those sly allegations in the press about her bearing up stoically after i supposedly refused her offer of friendship friendship my butt she shoved her hands in her pockets dragged them out again to gesture and that nasty undertone of glee in some of the stories talk show divas in cat fight claws bared in ladies room and it was just close enough to the truth to make us both look like idiots of course loren couldnt be happier the ratings have skyrocketed since the emmys and theres no sign of a downswing people who couldnt care less about the content of the show are tuning in to see if i lose it and punch out a guest fran snickered then caught deannas quick glare sorry i wish i could think it was funny grabbing the poker she stabbed viciously at the flaming logs i did think it was funny until i started getting letters oh dee the majority of the mail has been supportive even flattering so im perverse her shoulders jerked oh she hated the fact that she was being a fool hated more that she couldnt seem to stop thinking about the whole ugly incident i keep remembering the ones that werent the ones that ranged from you should be ashamed of yourself to you should be horsewhipped for your lack of gratitude to a fragile little flower like angela perkins her narrowed eyes were as hot as the flames belladonna probably looks like a fragile little flower i wouldnt know fran shifted the baby to her shoulder most of thats blown over why dont you tell me whats really eating at you deanna gave the fire one last poke im scared she said it quietly as a fresh frisson of ice skated up her spine i got another note oh god when friday right after i spoke to the literacy group at the drake cassie was with you yes deanna rubbed at the dull ache at the back of her neck i dont seem to go anywhere alone anymore always an entourage cassies hardly an entourage but fran recognized the twist of topic as avoidance tell me about the note dee we ran a little long with the photo session afterward cassie left she had a few things she wanted to finish up at the office before the weekend she flashed back to it the scene as clear in her mind as a film loop another handshake another snick of the camera shutter people crowding around for a word for a look just one more picture deanna please you and the mayors wife just one more cassie spoke up her smile amiable her voice firm miss reynolds is already running late for her next appointment deanna remembered feeling amusement her next appointment thankfully was throwing a few sweaters into her suitcase and heading out of the city she posed again with the mayors wife and the plaque for her work for literacy then eased her way along with cassie running interference good job dee here let me take that cassie slipped the plaque into her briefcase while deanna bundled into her coat it didnt feel like a job they were great they were you were cassie cast a leery eye over her shoulder the elegant lobby of the drake was still crowded with people but take my word on this just keep walking and dont look back or you wont get out of here until midnight to hurry her along cassie took her arm and led deanna out of the lobby and onto the sidewalk listen im going to take a cab back to the office dont be silly tim can drop you off then youll think of something you just have to do while youre there go home cassie ordered pack leave dont show your face in this town until sunday night it sounded too good to argue yes maam laughing cassie kissed her cheek have a great weekend you too they parted there heading in opposite directions through the snapping wind and swirling snow sorry im late tim no problem miss reynolds with his long black coat flapping around his knees tim opened the door of the limo howd it go fine really fine thanks still glowing with the energy of a job well done she slipped inside the cushy warmth and there it was just that plain envelope a square of white against the burgundy leather seat i asked tim if someone had come up to the car deanna continued but he hadnt seen anyone it was cold and hed gone inside the building for a while he said the car was locked and i know how conscientious tim is so im sure it was too many notes fran thought as her stomach muscles jiggled and they were coming too often in the last couple of months did you call the police i called lieutenant jenner from the car phone i dont have any control over this her voice rose as much in frustration as fear and it helped she realized to have something anything other than fear coursing through her i cant analyze it and put it in a slot i cant tidy it up or toss it away determined to calm herself she rubbed her hands over her face as if she could massage away the panic i cant even discuss this rationally every time i remind myself that i havent been threatened i havent been hurt i feel this little bubble of hysteria building up he finds me everywhere i want to beg him to leave me alone to just leave me alone fran she said helplessly im a mess fran got up to lay kelsey in the playpen she crossed to take deannas hands in hers there was more than comfort in the contact anger simmered just beneath why havent you told me this before why havent you let me know how much this is upsetting you youve got enough to handle aubrey the new baby so you took pity on the new mother and pretended that you were shrugging this whole business off as a by product of fame suddenly furious fran slapped both hands on her hips thats crap dee insulting crap i didnt see the point in worrying you deanna shot back theres so much stuff going on right now the show the backlash from angela margarets teenager wrecked the car simons mother died despising the need to defend herself she turned back to the window finns going off to haiti next week outside the dog leaped at flying snowballs deanna wanted to weep resting her head on the cool glass she waited until her system leveled i thought i could handle myself i wanted to handle it myself what about finn fran walked over to rub her hand over deannas stiff back does he have a clue whats going on inside you right now he has a lot on his mind fran didnt bother to repress a disgusted snort which means youve been playing the same game with him did you tell him about this last note it seemed best to wait until he got back from this next trip its selfish selfish her voice cracked in surprised hurt how can you say that i dont want him worried about me when hes thousands of miles away he wants to worry about you jesus dee how can anyone so sensitive so compassionate be so obstinate youve got a man out there who loves you who wants to share everything with you good and bad he deserves to know what youre feeling if you love him half as much as he loves you youve got no right to keep things from him that wasnt what i meant to do its what you are doing its unfair to him dee just like she cut herself off swearing im sorry but her voice was stiff and cool its none of my business how you and finn deal with your relationship no dont stop now deanna said equally cool finish it just like what all right then fran took a deep breath their friendship had lasted more than ten years she hoped it would weather one more storm its unfair for you to ask him to put his own needs on hold i dont know what you mean for gods sake look at him dee look at him with aubrey she clamped her hand on deannas arm and pushed her back to the window take a good look she did watching finn spin aubrey around and around snow spewing up at his feet the childs delighted shrieks echoed like a song that man wants a family he wants you youre denying him both because you havent got everything neatly stacked in place thats not just selfish dee its not just unfair its sad when deanna said nothing she turned away ive got to change the baby gathering kelsey up she left the room deanna stood where she was for a long time she could see finn wrestling with the dog as aubrey leaped into her fathers arms to slide a ragged cap onto the top of the bigbellied snowman but she could see more finn crossing the tarmac in a torrent of rain a cocky grin on his face and a swagger in his step finn exhausted and asleep on her couch or laughing as she reeled in her first fat fish gentle and sweet as he took her to bed grittyeyed and grim as he returned from observing some fresh disaster he was always there she realized always she went through the motions that evening serving up big bowls of beef stew laughing at richards jokes if someone had peeked in the kitchen window they would have seen a jolly group of friends sharing a meal attractive people comfortable with one other it would have been difficult to spot any tension any discord but finn was a trained observer even had that not been the case he could judge deannas moods by the flick of an eyelash he hadnt questioned her about the tension he sensed hoping she would tell him on her own as the evening wore on he accepted impatiently that he would have to push perhaps he would always have to push he watched her settle down in the living room a smile on her face unhappiness in her eyes god the woman frustrated him fascinated him for almost two years they had been lovers as physically intimate as it was possible to be yet no matter how open she was how honest she managed to tuck away little pieces closing them off from him locking them tight and hoarding them she was doing it now he realized her hand might reach for his holding it with comfortable familiarity but her mind was elsewhere methodically working through a problem she refused to share her problem she would say in that reasonable tone that by turns infuriated and amused him nothing she couldnt handle on her own nothing she needed him to deal with hurt finn set his glass aside and slipped upstairs he built up the fire in the bedroom brooding over it he wondered how long he could wait for deanna to take the next step forever he thought with an oath she was as much a part of him as his muscle and bone the need that had been growing in him for family for a steady rooted life was nothing compared with his need for her what was much worse as well as totally unexpected was that he wanted quite desperately for her to need him a new one for riley he mused and wished he could see the humor in this realization the need to be needed to be tied down to be settled he realized wasnt a particularly comfortable sensation and after several months he understood it wasnt going to go away and he was beginning to hate the status quo she found him crouched at the hearth staring into the flames after closing the door quietly at her back she crossed over brushed a hand through his hair what the hell is going on deanna he continued to stare into the fire youve been edgy since we got here last night and pretending not to be when i came in before dinner youd been crying and you and fran are circling each other like a couple of boxers in the tenth round frans angry with me she sat on the hassock and folded her hands in her lap she could feel his tension in the air i guess you will be too lowering her eyes she told him about the note answering his terse questions and waiting for his reaction she didnt wait long he stood where he was with the fire snapping at his back his gaze never left her face and was calm entirely too calm why didnt you tell me right away i thought it was best to wait until id sorted through it a bit you thought he nodded slipped his hands into his pockets you thought it was none of my concern no of course not she hated the fact that his cool interviewing skills always put her on the defensive i just didnt want to spoil the weekend theres nothing you can do anyway his eyes darkened at that the wicked cobalt angela had described it was a sure sign of passion yet his voice when he responded didnt alter so much as a degree in tone that was control goddamn you deanna you sit there and make me treat this like a hostile interview where i have to drag the facts out of you fear and fury burned through him im not tolerating this im fed up with your tucking things away and filing them under for deanna only he stepped forward then and with a speed that had her blinking pulled her to her feet shed expected him to be angry but she hadnt expected the rage she saw on his face finn she said carefully youre hurting me what do you think youre doing to me he released her so quickly she staggered back a step he spun away shoving fisted hands in his pockets you dont have a clue dont you know how badly i want to get my hands on this creep that i want to break him in half for causing you one minute of fear how useless i feel when you get one of those goddamn notes and the color drains out of your face and how much worse it is how much harder it is because after all this time you dont trust me it isnt a matter of trust the violence in his eyes had her heart jumping into her throat in all the time theyd been together shed never seen him so close to the edge its not finn its pride i didnt want to admit that i couldnt handle it alone he was silent for a long time the only sound the spit of flames eating steadily at dry logs damn your pride deanna he said quietly im tired of beating my head against it panic welled up inside her like a geyser his words were a closing statement a segment ender with an involuntary cry of alarm she grabbed his arm before he could stalk out finn please im going for a walk he stepped back holding palms up afraid he might cause them both irreparable damage if he touched her there are ways of working off this kind of mad the most constructive one is to walk it off i didnt mean to hurt you i love you thats handy because i love you too and at the moment his love felt as though it were killing him it just doesnt seem to be enough i dont care if youre mad she reached out again and clung you should be mad you should shout and rage gently while he could still manage it he loosened her grip youre the shouter deanna its in the genes id say and i come from a long line of negotiators it just so happens im out of compromises im not asking you to compromise i only want you to listen to what else i have to say fine but he moved away from her to the window seat in the shadows talks your forte after all go ahead deanna be reasonable objective sympathetic ill be the audience rather than rise to the bait she sat again i had no idea you were this angry with me its not just about me not telling you about this last note is it what do you think shed interviewed dozens of hostile guests over the years she doubted if any would be tougher than finn riley with his irish up ive taken you for granted and ive been unfair and youve let me thats good he said dryly start out with a selfdeprecating statement then circle around its no wonder youre on top dont she threw her head back the firelight glinting in her eyes let me finish at least let me finish before you tell me its over there was silence again though she couldnt see his face when he spoke she heard the weariness in his voice do you think i could i dont know a tear spilled over glimmering in the shifting light i havent let myself think about it until recently christ dont cry she heard him shift but he didnt move toward her i wont she brushed the tear away swallowed the others that threatened she knew she could weaken him with tears and that she would despise herself for it ive always thought that i could make everything come out in order if i just worked at it diligently enough if i planned it all carefully enough so i wrote lists adhered to timetables ive cheated us both by treating our relationship as if it were a task a wonderful task but a task to be handled she was talking too fast but couldnt stop the words tumbling over each other in their hurry to be said and i suppose i was feeling pretty smug about the job i was doing we fit so well together and i loved being your lover and then today i watched you outside and i realized for the first time how badly ive botched it all god she wished she could see his face his eyes you know how i hate to make mistakes yes i do he had to take a moment it wasnt only her pride on the line it sounds as though youre the one doing the ending deanna no she sprang up no im trying to ask you to marry me a log collapsed in the grate shooting sparks and hissing fire when it settled again the only sound she heard was her own unsteady breathing he rose crossed from shadow into light his eyes were as guarded and enigmatic as an ace gambler calling a bluff are you afraid ill walk if you dont do this i imagine the hole there would be in my life if you did and im terrified and because im terrified i wonder why ive waited so long maybe im wrong and you dont want marriage anymore if thats the way you feel ill wait she thought if he continued to stare at her with that mild curiosity shed scream say something damn it yes no go to hell something why why now deanna dont make this an interview why he repeated when he grabbed her arms she realized there was nothing mild about his mood because everythings so complicated now her voice rose trembled broke because life doesnt fit into any of my neat scheduling plans and i dont want being married to you to be neat and orderly because with the november sweeps raging and all this crazy publicity with angela and you going off to haiti its probably the worst possible time to think about getting married so that makes it the best time despite his tangled emotions he laughed for once your logic totally eludes me i dont need life to be perfect finn for once i dont need that it just has to be right and were so absolutely right she blinked back more tears then gave up and let them fall will you marry me he tipped her head back so that he could study her face and he smiled slowly as all those tangled emotions smoothed out into one silky sheet well you know kansas this is awfully sudden news of the engagement spread quickly within twentyfour hours of the official announcement deannas office was deluged with calls requests for interviews offers from designers caterers chefs congratulatory calls from friends curiosity calls from other reporters cassie fielded them batting the few back to deanna that required the personal touch oddly there had been no calls no notes no contact at all from the one person who had been hounding her for years no matter how often deanna told herself she should be relieved at the respite it frightened her more than seeing one of those neat white envelopes on her desk or tucked under her door but none came because none were written in the shadowy little room where pictures of deanna beamed contentedly from walls and tabletops there was little sound but weeping hot bitter tears fell on the newspaper print that announced the engagement of two of televisions most popular stars alone alone for so long waiting waiting so patiently so sure that finn would never settle down that deanna could still be had now the hope that fueled patience was smashed a delicate cup of fragile glass tossed aside and discovered to have been empty all along there was no sweet wine of triumph to be shared and no deanna to fill those empty hours but even as the tears dried the planning began she merely had to be shown surely that was all that no one could love her more completely she needed to be shown to be shocked into awareness and she needed to be punished just a little there was a way to arrange it all deanna had voted for a small simple wedding a private ceremony she told finn as hed finished up the last of his packing for haiti just family and close friends and it had been he whod tossed her the curve nope were shooting the works on this one kansas hed zipped up his garment bag and slung it over his shoulder a church wedding organ music acres of flowers and several weeping relatives neither one of us remembers followed by a reception of mammoth proportions where some of those same relatives will drink too much and embarrass their respective spouses she chased down the steps after him do you know how long it would take to plan something like that yeah youve got five months he dragged her close for a hard deep kiss youve got an april deadline deanna well look over your list when i get back but finn she was forced to scoot down and grab the dog by the collar before he joyfully rushed out of the door finn opened this time i want it perfect ill call as soon as i can he started down to where his driver waited swinging around and walking backward with a grin teasing his dimples stay tuned so she was now planning a fullscale wedding which of course prompted the topic idea of wedding preparations and related stress we could book couples whod broken up because the fighting and spats during the wedding plans undermined their relationship from her seat at the head of the conference table deanna eyed simon owlishly thanks i needed that no really he turned his chuckle into a cough i have this niece margaret groaned and pushed her purpleframed glasses up her pug nose hes always got a niece or a nephew or a cousin can i help it if ive got a big family children children hoping to restore order fran shook kelseys rattle lets try to pretend were a dignified organized group with a numberone show were number one jeff chanted grinning as others picked up the rhythm were number one and we want to stay there laughing deanna held up both hands okay though it doesnt do anything for my peace of mind simons got a good idea how many couples do you figure break up sometime between the will you and the i do plenty simon said with relish take my niece he ignored the paper airplane margaret sailed in his direction really theyd booked the church the hall found the caterer all this time according to my sister they fought like tigers the big blowup came over the bridesmaids dresses they couldnt agree on the color they called off the wedding because of the bridesmaids dresses deanna narrowed her eyes youre making this up swear to god to prove it simon placed a hand on his heart she wanted seafoam he wanted lavender of course the flowers were a contributing cause if you cant agree on that how can you agree on where to send your kids to college hey he brightened maybe we can get them well keep it in mind deanna jotted down notes among them was a warning to be flexible over colors i think the point here is that wedding preparations are stressful and there are ways of lessening the tension well want an expert not a psychologist she said quickly thinking of marshall a wedding coordinator jeff suggested watching deannas face for signs of approval or dismissal somebody who orchestrates the whole business professionally it is like a business he said glancing around for confirmation marriage you betcha fran tapped the rattle against the table a coordinators good we could talk about staying within your means and expectations how not to let your fantasies about perfection cloud the real issue cheap shot deanna tossed back we could use the mother and father of the bride traditionally theyre in charge of the checkbook what kind of strain is it personally and financially and how do we decide reasonably and happily on invitations the reception the music the flowers the photographer do we have a buffet or a sitdown meal what about centerpieces the wedding party decorations the guest list the faintest hint of desperation crept into her voice where the hell do you put outoftown guests and how is anyone supposed to put all this together in five months she lowered her head on her arms i think she said slowly we should elope hey thats good simon piped up alternatives to wedding stress i had this cousin this time margarets airplane hit him right between the eyes within weeks deannas organized desk was jumbled with sketches of bridal gowns from the elaborately traditional to the funkily futuristic behind her the same homely plastic tree jeff had hauled into her office that first christmas leaned precariously to starboard overweighted by balls and garlands someone cassie she assumed had spritzed some pinescented air freshener around the cheery aroma made the fading dyed plastic boughs even more pathetic and deanna loved it it was a tradition now a superstition she wouldnt have replaced the ugly tree with the richest blue spruce in the city i cant quite see saying i do in something like this she held up a sketch for frans perusal the short skinny dress was topped with a headpiece that resembled helicopter blades well after finn could give you a spin and the two of you could glide down the aisle now this ones hot she held up a drawing the elongated model was spreadlegged in a baremidriff mini with spikeheeled boots only if i carry a whip instead of a bouquet youd get great press she tossed it aside you dont have a lot of time to decide before april comes busting out all over dont remind me she shuffled another sketch on top her twindiamond engagement ring flashing a diamond for each year it had taken him to wear her down hed told her as hed slipped it on her finger this ones nice fran peeked over her shoulder that ones gorgeous she oohed a bit over the billowing skirts and full sleeves the bodice was snug trimmed in pearls and lace with the design repeating on the flowing train the headpiece was a simple circlet from which the frothy veil flowed its really stunning almost medieval a real onceinalifetime dress you think so recognizing her interest fran narrowed her eyes youve already decided on it i want a completely unbiased opinion and yes she admitted with a laugh i knew the minute i saw it she tidied the pile laying her choice on top i wish the rest of it were so simple the photographer im in charge of that the caterer cassies department music napkins flowers invitations she said before fran could interrupt her again let me at least pretend this is driving me crazy tough when youve never looked happier in your life i really have you to thank for it you gave me the kick in the butt i needed glad to oblige now were going to get out of here while youve got a free evening and go down to michigan avenue for some trousseau shopping with finn on a shoot across town this is the only chance ive got theres not a minute to waste im ready she grabbed her purse as the phone rang almost because cassie was already gone for the day deanna answered herself reynolds she said out of habit and her brilliant smile withered angela she glanced up and caught the interest in frans eye thats very nice of you im sure finn and i will be very happy of course you are angela cooed into the receiver as she continued to slice through a cover photo of finn and deanna with a letter opener you always were the confident one deanna to keep herself calm deanna shifted to study the teetering christmas tree is there something i can do for you no not at all theres something i want to do for you dear lets call it an engagement gift a little tidbit of information you might be interested in about your fiance theres nothing you can tell me about finn id be interested in angela i appreciate your best wishes and now im afraid im just on my way out dont be in such a rush i recall your having a healthy sense of curiosity i doubt youve changed so much it really would be very wise for you and for finn if you listened to what i have to say all right setting her teeth deanna sat down again im listening oh no dear not over the phone it so happens im in chicago a little business a little pleasure yes your luncheon with the league of women voters tomorrow i read about it theres that and another little matter but ill be free for a chat say at midnight the witching hour angela thats so obvious even for you watch your tone or i wont give you the opportunity of hearing what i have to say before i go to the press you can consider my generosity a combination engagement and christmas gift darling midnight she repeated at the studio my old studio i dont damn it echoing angelas response deanna slammed down the phone whats she up to im not sure with her celebratory mood in tatters deanna stared into space she wants to meet with me claims she has some information i need to hear she only wants to cause trouble dee the worry was in frans voice in her eyes shes in trouble in the past six months her shows gone dramatically downhill with rumors about her drinking about her staging shows bribing guests its hardly a surprise that shed want to fly out on her broomstick and hand you a poisoned apple im not worried about it deanna shook off the mood and rose again im not its time the two of us had it out once and for all in private theres nothing she can say or do that can hurt me part three all power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity samuel johnson chapter twentythree but someone had hurt angela someone had killed her deanna continued to scream high piercing cries that burned her throat like acid even when her vision grayed deanna couldnt take her eyes off the horror beside her and she could smell the blood hot and coppery and thick she had to escape before angela reached out with that delicate dead hand and squeezed it around her throat with little mewling sounds of panic she crawled out of the chair afraid to move too fast afraid to take her eyes off of what had been angela perkins every move every sound was echoed by the monitor while the camera objectively recorded its round dark eye staring something tugged her back on a soundless gasping scream deanna lifted her hands to fight what she couldnt see and tangled her fingers in the wires of a lapel mike oh god oh god she tore herself free hurling the mike aside and fleeing the set in a blind panic she stumbled caught a horrified glimpse of herself in the wide wall mirror a hot laugh bubbled in her throat she looked insane she thought wildly and she bit down on her hysteria afraid it would slide from her throat in a mad chuckle she nearly fell tripping over her own feet as she ran down the dark corridor someone was breathing down her neck she could feel it she knew it hot greedy breath whispering behind her sobbing she hurtled into her dressing room slammed the door threw the lock then stood in the dark with her heart pounding like a rabbits she fumbled for the light then screamed again when her own reflection jumped at her a glittery gold garland ringed the mirror like a noose she thought like a spangled noose boneless with terror she slid down against the door everything was spinning spinning and her stomach heaved in response clammy with nausea she crawled to the phone the sound of her own whimpering iced her skin as she punched the number for emergency please please help dizzy and sick she lay on the floor cradling the receiver her face is gone i need help the cbc building studio b please hurry she said and let the darkness swallow her it was just past one am when finn arrived home his first thoughts were for a hot shower and a warm brandy he expected deanna home within the hour after whatever emergency meeting she had shed been vague about the details when shed caught him between shoots and he hadnt had the time or the inclination to press theyd both been in the business too long to question midnight meetings he sent his driver off and started up the walk both amused and embarrassed that the dog was setting up a din that would wake the neighbors for blocks okay okay cronkite try for a little dignity he reached for his keys as he climbed onto the porch wondering why deanna had forgotten to leave on the porch light little details like that never escaped her wedding plans were rattling her brain he thought pleased at the idea something crunched under his foot he glanced down and saw the faint glitter of broken glass his initial puzzlement turned to fury when he saw the jagged shards of the beveled glass panels beside the door then his mouth went dry what if her meeting had been canceled what if shed come home he burst through the door in thoughtless fear shouting her name something crashed at the back of the house and the dogs frantic barking turned into a desperate howl thinking only of deanna finn hit the lights before he sprinted toward the source of the crash he found nothing but destruction a mindless and brutal attack on their possessions lamps and tables were overturned glassware shattered when he reached the kitchen his mind was cold as ice he thought he saw a form running across the lawn even as he tore aside the shattered door to give chase the dog howled again scratching pitifully against the locked utility room door he wanted to give chase it burned in him to hunt down whoever had done this and throttle him but the possibility that deanna was somewhere in the house hurt stopped him okay cronkite he unlocked the door and staggered back as the dog leaped joyously at him his thick body was shivering scared you did he me too lets find deanna he searched every room growing colder with every moment the devastation was as total as tornado damage both the priceless and the trivial capriciously destroyed but the worst the most terrifying was the message scrawled in deannas lipstick on the wall above the bed they shared i loved you i killed for you i hate you thank god she wasnt here thank god grimly he picked up the phone and called the police take it easy lieutenant jenner helped deanna steady a glass of water im all right now but her teeth chattered on the rim of the glass im sorry i know i was incoherent before understandable hed had a good long look at angela perkinss body and found deannas condition understandable indeed he didnt blame her for huddling inside the locked room needing to be gently persuaded to open the door to admit him youre going to want to have a doctor take a look at you im fine really shock he imagined it was natures way of closing down the system and offering the illusion of comfort but her eyes were still glassy and even though hed thrown his overcoat over her shoulders she was shivering can you tell me what happened i found her i came in and found her what were you doing at the studio after midnight she asked me to meet her she called she she sipped again she called so you arranged to meet her here she wanted to to talk to me she said she had information about defenses clicked in about something i needed to know i wasnt going to come then i thought it might be best if we had it out what time did you get here it was midnight i looked at my watch in the parking lot the colored lights in the distance the haze of christmas cheer it was midnight i thought maybe she hadnt arrived yet but she could have had her driver drop her off so i let myself into the studio and it was dark so i thought she wasnt here and that was good i wanted to be first then when i started to turn on the lights something hit me when i woke up i was on the set and i couldnt think the camera was on oh god the camera was on and i saw in the monitor i saw her she pressed a hand to her mouth to hold back the whimpers take a minute jenner leaned back i dont know anything else i ran in here and locked the door i called the police and i passed out did you see anybody on your way to the studio no no one the cleaning crews would have gone by now there would be a few people in the newsroom manning the desk overnight but after the last broadcast the building clears out you need a card to get into the building dont you yes they put in a new security system about a year ago is this your purse miss reynolds he held out a generous shoulder bag in smooth black leather yes thats mine i must have dropped it when i when i came in and this card he held up a clear plastic bag inside was a slim laminated card with her initials in the corner yes thats mine he set the bag aside and continued to take notes what time did miss perkins contact you about this meeting about five she called my office your secretary took the call no shed already gone home i took it myself something trembled through the shield of shock you think i killed her you think i did that to her why she lurched to her feet swaying like a drunk as the overcoat slid to the floor how could i why would i do you think i lured her here and murdered her then taped it all so i could show it to all my loyal viewers in the morning calm down miss reynolds jenner got cautiously to his feet she looked as though she might dissolve if he touched her no ones accusing you of anything im just trying to get the facts ill give the facts someone killed her someone blew her face away and propped her up on the set oh god she pressed a hand to her head this cant be real sit down and catch your breath jenner took her by the arm there was a commotion in the corridor behind him and he turned to the door goddamn it i want to see her finn shoved his way clear of the cop trying to detain him and burst through the doorway deanna he sprinted forward as she swayed toward him youre all right he vised his arms around her burying his face in her hair youre all right finn she pressed against him desperate for the feel of his flesh his warmth his comfort someone killed angela i found her finn i found her but he was already drawing her away appalled by the swelling and matted blood on the back of her head relief twisted into a dark keen thirst for revenge who hurt you i dont know she burrowed back into his arms i didnt see they think i did it finn they think i killed her over her trembling shoulder he stared stonily at jenner are you out of your mind miss reynolds is mistaken we have no intention of charging her at this time nor in my opinion in the future then shes free to go jenner rubbed his chin yes well need her to sign a statement but we can do it tomorrow miss reynolds i know youve had a shock and i apologize for having to put you through the questioning i advise you to go by the hospital have someone take a look at you ill take her deanna gently finn eased her back to the chair i want you to wait here a minute i need to talk to lieutenant jenner she clung to his hand dont leave no just outside the door just for a minute detective jenner followed finn into the corridor nodding to a uniform to back off shes had a rough night mr riley im aware of that i dont want you to add to it neither do i but certain wheels have to turn ive got a nasty murder and as far as i can tell shes the only witness you wouldnt mind telling me where you were tonight finns eyes cooled no i wouldnt i was taping a segment on the south side id guess id have about a dozen witnesses to place me there until about midnight my driver took me home dropped me off just after one i put in a call to at onetwenty why because my house had been trashed you want to verify that contact your superior i dont doubt your word mr riley jenner rubbed his chin again toying with the timetable you said onetwenty give or take a minute whoever broke in left a message for deanna on the bedroom wall you can check with your associates for details im getting deanna out of here ill do that jenner made another note mr riley id take her out another way i wouldnt want her going through the studio hey arnie another plainclothes cop signaled from the studio end of the corridor mes finished here tell him to hang on a minute well be in touch mr riley saying nothing finn turned back into the dressing room he took off his own coat pushing deannas limp arms through the sleeves he didnt want to waste time looking for hers come on baby lets get out of here i want to go home she leaned heavily against him as he led her out no way im taking you to er dont leave me there im not leaving you he took the long way around circumventing the studio choosing the angled stairs that led to the parking lot because he knew what to expect before he opened the door he kissed her brow held her by the shoulders the place is going to be swarming with reporters and minicams she squeezed her eyes tight shivered i know its okay just hold on tight to me i already am when he shoved the door open the flash of klieg lights blinded her she shielded her eyes and saw nothing but eager bodies rushing toward her microphones stabbing out like lances and the wide demanding eye of the camera questions hurtled at her making her hunch her shoulders in defense as finn propelled her through the surging sea of reporters she knew most of them she realized liked most of those she knew once upon a time they had competed for stories once upon a time she would have been among them pressing forward scurrying for that one telling picture that one mumbled comment then flying to the news desk to get the item she was an item now on the air minutes even seconds before the competition but she was no longer the observer she was the observed how could she tell them how she felt how could she tell them what she knew her mind was like glass throbbing from some deadly highpitched whine she thought if she couldnt have silence she would explode and shatter christ dee a hand reached for her hesitating as she cringed away and she saw joe the minicam on his shoulder his baseball cap askew im sorry he said and swore again im really sorry its all right ive been there remember its just the job she climbed gratefully into finns car and closed her eyes tuned out jenner turned the studio over to the forensic team since hed already had two men question the occupants of the building he decided to wait until morning before doing a followup there instead he left the cbc building and drove to finn rileys home he wasnt surprised or displeased when finn pulled into the driveway behind him hows miss reynolds shes got a concussion finn said tersely theyre keeping her overnight for observation i had a feeling id find you here jenner nodded as they started up the walk chilly night he said conversationally dispatch showed your call came in at one twentythree first unit arrived at one twentyeight it was a quick response though it hadnt seemed quick as hed spent that endless five minutes looking over the destruction of his home are you handling b and es too lieutenant i like to diversify and the truth is he paused just outside the door i figure ive got an interest in this between the business in greektown and the investigation on those letters miss reynolds has been getting i figure ive got an interest does that bother you finn studied jenner in the starlight the man looked tired yet completely alert it was a combination finn understood perfectly no well then jenner sliced through the police tape over the damaged door maybe youll take me on the grand tour riley was a pretty snappy dresser jenner mused as they moved inside the kind who leaned toward leather jackets and faded jeans jenner had tried on a leather jacket once hed looked like a cop he always did did you mention the trouble here to miss reynolds no cant blame you shes had a rough night he glanced around the place looked as if it had been bombed so have you you could say that almost every room was trashed finn gestured toward the living area off the main hall i didnt take a lot of time going through it jenner grunted word was the minute finn had learned of the trouble at cbc hed sprinted out leaving the destruction behind you must be pretty steamed that was putting it mildly jenner mused what he saw on finns face was cold rage if hed run across the perp hed have sliced him into little pieces though it was unprofessional jenner would have given a great deal to see it i can replace the things finn said as they started upstairs yeah jenner stepped inside the bedroom nodded toward the wall so our friends taken to writing on walls taking out his pad jenner copied the writing style onto a blank page this was the first time the writer had exposed himself this way makes a statement one quick scan and hed taken in the devastation of the room forensics are going to have a hell of a time sorting through this mess he toed a broken perfume bottle with his foot tiffany he commented a hundred fifty an ounce my wife she likes that scent i bought her the cologne for her birthday and those sheets irish linen my grandmother had a tablecloth i used to rub my face over it when i was a kid nearly amused finn leaned on the doorjamb and studied jenner is this how you conduct an investigation lieutenant or do you moonlight for an insurance company always was a sucker for quality he slipped his pad back in his pocket just above the snug weight of his weapon so mr riley id have to say we have a connection so lieutenant id have to agree with you murder happened by midnight he scratched the back of his neck the drive from cbc to here takes fourteen minutes at the speed limit he spends say ten minutes setting the stage turning on the equipment another ten to get over here you get home about twenty after one yeah id say thats enough time youre not telling me anything i dont know lieutenant whats next well canvass the neighborhood tomorrow somebody might have seen something you havent had time to interview dan gardner no a ghost of a smile moved jenners lips my next stop mine too mr riley youd be better off going back to the hospital watching over your lady leave this to me ill watch out for deanna finn returned and im going to talk to gardner im going to use everything and everyone i know to get to the root of this i can go with you lieutenant or i can go around you thats not friendly mr riley im not feeling friendly lieutenant jenner dont imagine you are but this is police business so was greektown jenners brows lifted as he studied finn the man knew which buttons to push he mused i like you jenner said after a moment i liked the way you handled yourself in greektown saw you take that hit he scratched his chin considered you just kept right on reporting thats my job yeah and i got mine im willing to bend the rules a bit mr riley for a couple reasons one i really admire your lady and two i figure theres a tenyearold girl out there who just might owe you her life i might not have mentioned i have a granddaughter that age no you didnt mention it well jenner simply nodded again you can follow me in your car when deanna surfaced it was midmorning yet it wasnt necessary to orient herself she remembered everything too clearly she was in the hospital under observation she wished she could laugh at the term she understood that she would remain under all manner of observation for a long time she turned her head mindful of the dull ache swimming inside and studied finn he was dozing in the chair beside the bed his hand covering hers unshaven exhausted and pale he was the most comforting sight she could imagine not wanting to disturb him she shifted slowly but her slight movement woke him are you hurting no her voice was weak she put an effort into strengthening it you shouldnt have sat up all night theyd have found somewhere for you to stretch out i can sleep anywhere im a reporter remember he scrubbed his hands over his face then stretched out the kinks in his back you should try to get some more sleep i want to go home a mild concussion isnt enough to keep me in the hospital she sat up but cautiously knowing if she so much as sneezed hed run for a nurse no double vision no memory lapses no nausea youre pale as wax deanna youre not looking so hale and hearty yourself want to crawl in here with me later he scooted over to sit on the side of the bed and touched his hand to her cheek i love you i know i dont think i could have gotten through last night without you you dont have to get through anything without me she smiled but her eyes strayed from his to the television bracketed to the wall at the foot of the bed i dont suppose youve heard the morning news no he turned looked at her intently no he repeated well deal with it later yes she thought later was better it was horrible the way she died horrible the way it was all so perfectly staged i need to think about it but i cant seem to then dont dont push it deanna he looked over as he heard frans voice lifted high in indignant rage as she argued with the guard outside the door ill tell her youre resting no please i want to see her finn had just gone to the door to have a word with the guard when fran burst in she bulleted toward the bed and snatched deanna into her arms oh god ive been sick ever since i heard are you all right how bad are you hurt just a bump on the head she returned the embrace squeezing hard i was just about to get up and get dressed are you sure fran drew her back she might have been examining one of her children for symptoms youre so pale finn go get the doctor i think he should take another look at her no she took frans hands firmly in hers they just wanted me overnight for observation ive been observed the office whats going on something flickered in frans eyes then she shrugged chaos what else the cops are taking statements from everyone i should go in do something no the protest came quickly fiercely i mean it dee theres nothing you can do and if you came in at this point youd only add to the confusion as soon as i go back and tell everyone youre okay it should calm down a little her lips trembled before she wrapped her arms around deanna again you really are okay it must have been horrible for you every time i think of what could have happened i know comforted deanna cradled her head on frans shoulder angela god fran i still cant believe it who could have hated her that much pick a number fran thought i dont want you to worry about the show or the office we ran a rebroadcast today cassies canceling and rescheduling guests wed booked for the next week thats not necessary im the producer and i say it is after a last squeeze fran pulled back and turned to finn for support are you going to throw your weight in with me it doesnt appear to be necessary but sure im taking her up to the cabin for a while i cant just leave jenners bound to want to talk to me again and i have to talk to loren to my staff finn studied her a moment there was pain in her eyes as well as the dregs of terror and shock heres the way i see it he said mildly i can spring you out of here later today and take you to the cabin or i can arrange for them to keep you in that bed for another couple of days thats absurd deanna wanted to be angry but she was too tired just because were getting married doesnt mean you can arrange my life it does when youre too stubborn to do whats best for you well fran gave a satisfied nod and kissed finns cheek now that i know shes in capable hands im going to go find that doctor i need to talk to you she said under her breath then turned back to deanna it was a relief to see the sulky turn of her friends mouth dont worry about the details she told her the gang and i can handle everything ill be back in a few minutes fine great deanna plopped back on the pillows wincing when the sudden movement made her head pound just tell everyone i decided to go fishing good idea finn walked to the door to open it for fran ill see if i can round up someone to put through the release papers stay in bed he ordered and walked outside what is it you dont want her to know there are cops swarming all over the sixteenth floor fran cast one last worried glance over her shoulder as they walked to the elevators her office has been torn apart like someone went through it in an insane rage chairs hurled around broken glass all the lists shed put together for the wedding and the sketches of the dresses were ripped up somebody had written all over the walls in red ink as finn watched her cheeks drained of color so that her freckles stood out in stark relief it just said i love you again and again and again i dont want her to see it finn she wont im going to take care of her i know that fran pressed her fingers to her eyes but im scared whoever killed angela is so focused on dee i dont think hell ever leave her alone finns eyes were sharp as a sword he wont get near her theres someone i have to meet you stay with her until i get back after a twohour catnap jenner rapped on the door of dan gardners hotel suite beside him finn was running through a mental list of questions he wanted answered hed better be in the mood to talk this time jenner only shrugged he didnt mind taking the long route as long as it ended in the right place hard to talk when youre sedated conveniently finn murmured guys wife gets snuffed hes entitled to break down wouldnt you think hed want some details before he went under lieutenant the way i see it the longer he delays talking to you the longer he has to formulate an alibi angela perkins was a wealthy woman care to guess whos the chief beneficiary then if he killed her hed have been stupid not to have an alibi to begin with ive got a feeling youre a man used to being in charge of things and youre going to have to take a backseat here ive got an instinct about you mr riley so im letting you tag along that way i can pick your brain but youre going to have to remember whos running this investigation cops and reporters have a lot in common lieutenant we wont be the first whove used each other nope jenner heard the rattle of the chain but that doesnt change the pecking order finn nodded grudgingly as the door opened dan gardner looked like a man whod been on a wild twoday bender his face was gray his eyes sunken and his hair stood out in tufts his black silk robe and pajamas added an elegance that only accented his unkempt appearance like fresh gilt on a tattered painting mr gardner yeah dan brought a cigarette to his lips gulping in smoke like water im detective jenner he held up his badge dan glanced at it then spotted finn hold it whats he doing here research finn said im not talking to any reporters especially this one thats funny coming from someone who woos the press like a lovesick suitor finn put a hand on the door before dan could shut it ill keep it off the record but i can tell you youre better off speaking with me when youve got a cop around im in a real bad mood im not well i sympathize mr gardner jenner put in before finn could comment youre certainly not obliged to speak in mr rileys presence but i have a feeling hell just come back why dont we try it this way and keep this as short as possible it would be easier on you to do this here than to come to the station dan stared at them both a moment then with a shrug he turned around leaving the door open the drapes were still drawn giving the parlor of the suite a gloomy air the smell of cigarettes was strong mixing uneasily with the fragrance from the two huge vases of roses flanking the sofa dan sat between them blinking when jenner switched on a lamp im sorry to have to disturb you at this time mr gardner jenner began but i need your cooperation dan said nothing only took another greedy drag from the cigarette angelas brand he thought and felt the smoke sting bitterly in his throat can you tell us what you know about your wifes activities yesterday besides getting murdered with a humorless laugh he roused himself to go to the bar and pour a generous portion of whiskey finn only lifted a brow as dan drank it down poured again it was barely ten am it would help jenner continued if we had a clear sense of her movements throughout the day where she went who she had contact with she got up about ten dan came back to the sofa the whiskey helped he realized he felt as though he were gliding an inch above the floor she had a massage had her hair and makeup done a manicure all here in the suite he drank with one hand smoked with the other his movements mechanical and strangely rhythmic she did a print interview chicago tribune then went downstairs to the ballroom for the luncheon she had several other appointments through the day interviews meetings most of them here in the suite he crushed out the cigarette sat back with the blue haze of smoke hovering over his head like a dirty halo were you with her finn demanded dan shot him one resentful glance then shrugged i was in and out mostly out angela didnt like distractions when she was dealing with the press she had a dinner interview with premiere magazine to hype her next special in a jerky movement he reached over to yank another cigarette from the pack on the coffee table she told me she didnt know how long it would run and that she had a later meeting afterward that i should go out to a blues bar and amuse myself and did you jenner asked i had a steak a couple of drinks listened to some piano at the pump room jenner noted it down did you have any company i wasnt in the mood for company we havent had a lot of time to relax in the past few months so i took advantage of it his bloodshot eyes narrowed are you looking for angelas schedule or mine both jenner said pleasantly he doodled a bit a quick sketch of the room of dan gardners face it helps if we have a clear sense of things when did you last see your wife mr gardner just before seven when she was getting ready for dinner and did she tell you she planned to meet deanna reynolds at cbc later that night no he bit the word off if she had i would have discouraged it he leaned forward now enough of a showman to know which lines to punch he knows it too he added jerking his head toward finn thats why he wants in on the investigation to try to head it off its no secret deanna reynolds hated my wife was envious and driven to destroy her i have no doubt that she killed angela or had her killed thats an interesting theory finn mused is that the line youre going to feed through your publicist jenner cleared his throat did miss reynolds make any threats against your wife that youre aware of dans eyes cut back to jenner bored in i told you she attacked her physically once before christ knows she attacked her emotionally dozens of times over the years she wanted angela out of the way now she is that should be clear enough what are you doing about it were looking into it jenner said mildly mr gardner what time did you return to the hotel last night twelvethirty one oclock did you meet anyone speak with anyone who could verify that i resent the implication lieutenant my wife is dead he stabbed out the cigarette breaking it in two and from what ive been told there was only one person with her he stared at finn secure that he could say whatever he chose with impunity a person who had every reason to hurt her i dont appreciate being asked to supply an alibi but can you finn countered his teeth snapped together youre really reaching arent you riley do you really think you can throw the police off deanna and onto me finn lifted a brow i dont believe you answered the question its possible one of the night clerks saw me come in its also possible that the waitress at the club would remember serving me and what time i left what kind of alibi does deanna reynolds have was it rage jenner wondered or was it fear that simmered in gardners voice im afraid i cant discuss that at this time do you have any idea how your wife might have gained access to the cbc building and studio b she worked there for some time dan said dryly i imagine she walked in shed know the way theres a security system that wasnt in operation during the time your wife was based in the building then id imagine deanna let her in then she killed her he shifted forward resting one hand on the black silk covering his knee imagine what this will do for her ratings lieutenant jenner he knows dan jabbed a finger toward finn how many nielsen homes will tune in to watch a coldblooded killer riley shell murder the competition he laughed rubbing a hand over and over his face just like she murdered angela whoever killed your wife wont benefit from it jenner glanced at finn pleased to see he was maintaining an outward calm jenner decided he liked the pattern of their work together not something as cliched as good cop bad cop just teamwork did miss perkins have an appointment book a calendar her secretary kept her calendar but angela always carried a small date book in her purse would you mind if we took a look in her room dan pressed the heels of his hands to his eyes fuck do what you want you ought to order up some breakfast mr gardner jenner said as he rose yeah i ought to do that jenner took out a card and left it on the coffee table beside the ashtray of smoldering butts id appreciate it if youd contact me if you think of anything else well be out of your way in just a few minutes the first thing finn did in the bedroom of the suite was open the drapes light spilled relentlessly into the room the bureau top was crowded with bottles and pots the expensive toys of a vain woman who could afford the best a champagne flute with a pale pink outline of lipstick at the rim stood in the center a floral silk robe flowed gracefully over the arm of a chair its hem brushing matching balletstyle slippers the only evidence that a man shared the room was the suit hung on the valet you didnt mention an appointment book in her purse lieutenant there wasnt one he glanced around the room like a hound sniffing the air cosmetics hotel key cigarettes lighter a silk hankie a roll of certs an eelskin wallet with id credit cards and better than three hundred cash but no date book interesting finn nodded toward the champagne flute id say that was hers wouldnt you sitting there with her perfumes and skin creams more than likely theres another out in the parlor over by the wet bar lipstick on that too dark hotred lipstick good eye mr riley why dont we see if room service knows who angelas drinking partner was carla mendez had never had much excitement in her life shed been the oldest of five children born to a shoe salesman and a waitress and had lived a simple uninspired life at thirtythree she had three children and a husband who was slavishly faithful and usually out of work carla didnt mind her job as a hotel maid she didnt like it particularly but she did her job well if mechanically and tucked away tiny bottles of shampoo and skin cream as religiously as she tucked away her tips she was a small sturdy woman built like a fireplug with tightly permed black hair and tiny dark eyes that were nearly lost in a network of worry lines but her eyes were bright now flitting from cop to reporter she didnt like cops if jenner had approached her alone she would have closed up like a clam on principle but she couldnt resist finn riley the way his dimples deepened when he smiled at her the gentlemanly way hed taken her hand and he wanted to interview her it was for carla the biggest moment of her life sensing her mood jenner hung back and let finn take the ball what time did you come into miss perkinss room to turn down the bed mrs mendez ten oclock usually id turn down much earlier but she told me not to come in not to disturb her before ten she had appointments primly she tugged on the hem of her uniform i dont like to work so late but she was very nice the twentydollar tip had been even nicer ive seen her on tv too but she wasnt stuckup or anything she was real polite messy though she added she and her husband used about six bath towels between them every day and she had cigarette butts in every single ashtray dishes everywhere she glanced around the parlor cleaning up after people gives you insight she said and left it at that im sure it does finn gave her an encouraging smile was miss perkins with her husband when you were turning down the bed in their suite cant say didnt see him didnt hear him but i heard her and the other one the other one the other woman they were scratching at each other like cats carla tugged on her hem again examined her shoes not that i listened i mind my own business ive been working in this hotel for seven years you cant do that if you poke into peoples private lives but when i heard how shed been murdered miss perkins i said to gino thats my husband i said to gino that id heard miss perkins going at it with this woman in her suite only a couple hours before she was dead he said i should maybe tell my supervisor but i thought it might cause trouble so you havent told anyone about it finn prompted no and when you came in and said you wanted to talk to me about the people in i figured you already knew her eyes flashed back up maybe you didnt what can you tell us about the woman who was with miss perkins mrs mendez i didnt see her but i heard her all right heard both of them the woman said im sick and tired of playing your games angela and one way or the other theyre going to stop then miss perkins laughed i knew it was her cause like i said ive seen her on tv and she laughed the way people do when theyre feeling mean and she said something like oh youll keep playing darling the stakes carla screwed up her nose as she concentrated the stakes are too high she said for you to do anything else they called each other names for a while then the other woman said i could kill you angela but maybe ill do something even better than that then i heard the door slam and miss perkins was laughing again i finished up real quick and went out in the hall you know mrs mendez i think you should try my line of work she preened and tugged on her hem again youre very observant he added it comes natural i guess you see a lot of funny things working in a hotel im sure you do i wonder did you see the woman whod left no there wasnt anybody out there but it took me a couple of minutes to finish stacking fresh towels so she could have gotten on the elevator that was my last room so i went home after that the next morning i heard that miss perkins had been killed at first i thought maybe that woman had come back and killed her right there in my suite but i found out it didnt happen in the hotel at all it happened at the tv station where deanna reynolds has her show i like her show better she added guilelessly she has such a nice smile deanna tried to use that smile as finn hesitated at the front door of the cabin im fine she told him shed told him that repeatedly since shed been released from the hospital three days before finn youre going to pick up a few things at the store youre not leaving me to defend the fort against marauding hostiles besides she bent down to scratch the dogs ears i have a champion champion wimp he cupped deannas face in his hands let me worry okay its still a new experience for me to fret he grinned i like fretting over you deanna as long as youre not fretting so much you forget to buy me that candy bar hersheys big block no almonds he kissed her relieved when her lips curved gently sweetly under his the day hed had her to himself at the cabin had dulled the edge of her horror he knew but she still slept poorly and jolted at unexpected sounds why dont you take a nap kansas why dont you go get me that candy bar she drew back her smile securely in place then you can take a nap with me sounds like a pretty good deal i wont be long no she thought as she watched him walk to the car he wouldnt be long he hated leaving her alone though what he expected her to do was beyond her collapse in a hysterical heap she wondered lifting her hand in a wave as he headed down the lane run screaming from the house with a sigh she crouched down again to rub the dog while he whined and scratched at the door he loved to go for rides she thought now but finn had left him behind a canine sentry not that she could blame finn for being overprotective at this point shed been alone with a murderer after all a murderer who could have taken her life as quickly as cruelly as he had taken angelas everyone was worried about poor deanna she thought her parents fran simon jeff margaret cassie roger and joe and plenty of others from the newsroom even loren and barlow had called to express concern to offer help take all the time you need loren had told her without a single mention of ratings or expenses dont even think about coming back until youre stronger but she wasnt weak deanna decided she was alive no one had tried to kill her surely everyone must understand that one simple point yes she had been alone with a murderer but she was alive straightening she wandered around the cabin tidying what was already competently neat she brewed some tea she didnt want then wandered more with the cup warming her hands she poked at the cheerfully blazing fire she stared out the window she sat on the couch she needed desperately needed to work this wasnt one of their stolen weekends filled to the brim with laughter and lovemaking and arguments over newspaper editorials there wasnt a newspaper in the house she thought in frustration and finn said there was some trouble with the cable so television was out as well he was doing his best to keep the outside world at bay she knew to put her in a protective bubble where nothing and no one could cause her distress and shed let him because what had happened in chicago had seemed too horrible to think about shed let finn push it all to the side for her but now she needed to take some action were going back to chicago she told the dog who responded with a thud of his tail on the floor she turned to the steps intending to pack when she heard the sound of a car on the drive he couldnt even have gotten to the store yet she muttered heading to the door behind the happily barking dog look cronkite i love him too but he hasnt been gone ten minutes deanna pushed open the screen laughing as the dog bulleted through but when she looked up and saw the car the laughter died she didnt recognize the car a dull brown sedan with dings in both fenders but she recognized jenner and found herself tugging the collar of her flannel shirt around her throat she should have felt relieved to see him to know he was trying to solve the case instead she felt only a tightening of the nerves that trapped her somewhere between fear and resignation jenner grinned obviously charmed by cronkites yapping and dancing around his legs he bent down unerringly finding the spot between cronkites ears that sent the dog into spasms of pleasure hey there boy theres a good dog he chuckled when cronkite plopped down on his rump and extended a paw to shake know your manners do you with the dogs dusty paw in his hand he glanced up when deanna stepped out on the porch this is quite a watchdog youve got here miss reynolds im afraid thats as fierce as he gets the brisk december breeze invaded her bones youre a long way from chicago lieutenant nice drive leaving his hand extended for the dog to sniff he glanced around the snow had melted and the evergreens were glossily green the breeze hummed through denuded trees and threatened to pick up and get mean pretty place must feel good to get out of the city now and then yes it does miss reynolds im sorry to disturb you but i have some questions on the perkins homicide please come in ive just made tea but i can put on coffee if youd prefer how could they talk about murder without a nice sociable cup deanna thought as her stomach turned teas fine jenner walked toward the door with the dog prancing behind him sit down she gestured him inside toward the great room ill just be a minute mr rileys not with you jenner took a turn around the room interested in the getaway lives of the rich he went to the store hell be back shortly hepplewhite jenner noted a side table and ladderback chair the rug was native american navajo he imagined the glassware was irish waterford you have a good eye lieutenant her face bland deanna carried the tea tray into the room he didnt realize hed spoken aloud and smiled a little it didnt bother him to be caught snooping he got paid for it i like quality stuff even when i cant afford it he nodded to the vase on the mantel stuffed with early spring blooms staffordshire dresden annoyed deanna set the tray down with a snap im sure you didnt drive all the way out here to admire the bricabrac have you found out who killed angela no jenner settled himself on the sofa with the dog at his feet were beginning to put things together thats comforting sugar lemon she was playing it tough jenner thought black thanks he might have believed deannas act if it hadnt been for the shadows under her eyes with sugar lots of it his grin apologetic jenner began to spoon sugar into the cup deanna poured for him sweet tooth miss reynolds i dont want to make you go through your whole statement again and i appreciate it deanna caught herself snapping the words and sighed i want to cooperate lieutenant i just dont see what more i can tell you i had an appointment with angela i kept it someone killed her didnt it strike you as odd that shed want to meet so late deanna eyed jenner over the rim of her cup angela was fond of making odd demands and were you fond of going along with them no i wasnt i didnt want to meet her at all its no secret that we werent on friendly terms and i knew wed quarrel the fact that we would made me nervous deanna set down her cup curled up her legs i dont like confrontations lieutenant but i dont run away from them as a rule angela and i had a history that im sure youre aware of you were competitors jenner inclined his head a fraction you didnt like each other no we didnt like each other and it was very personal on both sides i was ready to have it out with her and a part of me hoped that we could settle things amicably another part was looking forward to yanking out a few handfuls of her hair i wont deny i wanted her out of my way but i didnt want her dead she looked back at jenner calmer now steadier is that why youre here am i a suspect jenner rubbed a hand over his chin the victims husband dan gardner seems to think you hated her enough to kill her or have her killed have her killed deanna blinked at that and nearly laughed so now i hired a convenient hit man paid him to murder angela knock me unconscious and roll tape very inventive of me she sprang up color washing back into her cheeks i dont even know dan gardner its flattering that he should consider me so clever and what was my motive ratings points it seems to me i should have arranged it so that i didnt miss the november sweeps the bruised helpless look was gone jenner noted she was fired up burning on indignation and disgust miss reynolds i didnt say we agreed with mr gardner she stared for a moment eyes kindling just wanted a reaction i hope i satisfied you jenner cocked a brow miss reynolds did you visit miss perkins at her hotel on the night she was murdered no frustrated deanna raked a hand through her hair why should i have we were meeting at the studio you might have gotten impatient jenner knew he was reaching deannas fingerprints hadnt been found in the suite certainly they werent on the extra champagne flute even if i had angela told me that shed be busy until midnight she had meetings did she mention with whom we werent chatting detective and i had no interest in her personal or her business plans you knew she had enemies i knew she wasnt particularly well liked part of that might have been her personality and part of it was because she was a woman with a great deal of power she could be hard and vindictive she could also be charming and generous i dont imagine you found it charming when she arranged for you to walk in on her and dr pike in compromising circumstances thats old news but you were in love with him i was almost in love with him deanna corrected a very large difference oh what was the point of all this she wondered and rubbed at the headache brewing dead center of her forehead i wont deny it hurt me and it infuriated me and it changed my feelings about both of them irrevocably dr pike tried to continue your relationship he didnt look on the incident in the same way i did i wasnt interested in continuing anything with him and i made that clear but he did persist for quite a while yes jenner recognized the emotion behind the clipped response and the notes the ones youve been receiving with some regularity for several years did you ever consider that he was sending them marshall she shook her head no theyre not his style what is deannas eyes shut she remembered the photographs the detectives report perhaps you should ask him we will have you been involved with anyone other than dr pike anyone who might have been so disturbed by the announcement of your engagement to mr riley that they would break into your office or mr rileys home no theres been what do you mean break in she gripped the wing of the chair she stood beside it seems logical that whoever sent the notes is also responsible for the destruction of your office and the house you share with mr riley jenner began and he believed for angelas murder when deanna could barely whisper the word when did this happen intrigued jenner stopped tapping his pencil on his pad the rosy glow anger had brought to deannas cheeks had drained leaving her face white as bone riley hadnt told her yet he realized and the man wasnt going to be pleased to have been scooped the night angela perkins was shot finn rileys house was broken into no still gripping the chair she shifted lowered herself before her legs buckled finn didnt no one told me she squeezed her eyes shut fighting the kick of nerves in her stomach when she opened them again they were dark as pitch and burning dry but you will i want to know what happened exactly what happened there was going to be more than a little tiff when finn riley returned jenner decided as he related the facts he watched her take them in she winced once as though the words were darts then went very still her eyes remained level and curiously blank until he had finished she said nothing for a moment leaning forward to pour more tea her hand was steady jenner admired her poise and control particularly since hed seen the ripple of horror cross her face you think that whoevers been sending the notes whoever broke into my office and my home killed angela it was a reporters voice jenner noted cool and calm and without inflection but her eyes werent blank any longer they were terrified for some reason he remembered a report shed done years before a woman in the suburbs whod been shot to death by her husband her eyes hadnt been blank then either its a theory he said at length it makes more sense for only one person to be involved then why not me her voice broke and she shook her head impatiently why angela and not me if he was so angry so violently angry with me why did he kill her and leave me alive she was in your way jenner said briskly and watched as the full impact struck deanna like a blow he killed her for me oh jesus he did it for me we cant be sure of that jenner began but deanna was already shoving out of her chair finn good god he could come after finn he broke into the house if finn had been there he would have she pressed a hand to her stomach you have to do something miss reynolds but she heard the sound of tires on gravel she whirled racing the dog to the door shouting for him finn was already cursing the other car in the drive when he heard her call his name his annoyance at the intrusion faded as he saw her sprint out of the house she leaped trembling into his arms choking back sobs finn gathered her close his eyes hot and lethal as they skimmed over her shoulder to where jenner stood on the porch what the hell have you done im sorry it was the best finn could think of to say as he faced deanna across the living room jenner had left them alone after finn thought bitterly hed dropped his bomb what for because i found out from jenner or because you didnt trust me enough to tell me in the first place that it happened at all he said carefully and it wasnt a matter of trust deanna youre barely out of the hospital and you didnt want to upset my delicate mental balance thats why the television is conveniently on the blink thats why you wanted to go to the store alone and didnt bring back the paper we wouldnt want poor little deanna to hear any news that might upset her close enough he plunged his hands into his pockets i thought you needed some time you thought well you thought wrong she spun around headed for the stairs you had no right to keep this from me i did keep it from you damn it if were going to fight at least do it face to face he stopped her on the landing grabbing her arm turning her around i can fight when im packing she shook him off and stalked into the bedroom you want to go back fine well go back after weve settled this she dragged an overnight case out of the closet we dont have to go anywhere im going she tossed the case onto the bed threw open the lid alone in quick jerky moves she plucked bottles and jars from the dresser im going hack to my apartment i can get whatever ive left at your house later no he said very calmly youre not she heaved a perfume bottle toward the open case it bounced merrily on the bed thats exactly what im doing with her eyes on his she pried his fingers loose you lied to me finn if jenner hadnt come out here for some followup questions i wouldnt have known about the breakin or that youd interviewed dan gardner and that hotel maid i wouldnt have known anything no and you might have gotten a few nights sleep you lied she repeated refusing to see past that and dont tell me keeping the truth from me is different than lying its the same i wont continue in a relationship that isnt honest you want honest thats fine he turned shut the door with a quiet click a final click ill do anything and everything in my power to protect you thats a fact eyes steady he walked back to her youre not walking out on me deanna thats a fact and youre not using some bullshit about rights and trust as your escape hatch if you want out then at least be honest all right she shifted so that he couldnt see the way her hands shook as she packed i made a mistake when i agreed to marry you and ive had time to think it through i need to concentrate on my career on my own life i cant do that if im trying to make a marriage work if im starting a family i talked myself into thinking i could do it all but i was wrong the diamonds on her finger winked mockingly at her she couldnt quite bring herself to take the ring off not yet i dont want to marry you finn and its not fair to either of us to continue this way my priority right now is my work and getting it back on track look at me deanna i said look at me with his hands firm on her shoulders he turned her to face him the sensation of panic faded into steely confidence youre lying i know you dont want to believe jesus christ deanna dont you know that i can see it in your face you could never lie worth a damn why are you doing this i dont want to hurt you any more than necessary finn she held herself rigid in his arms stared over his shoulder let me go not a chance in hell i dont want you her voice cracked i dont want this is that clear enough no he jerked her forward covered her mouth with his she trembled immediately her body shuddering against his her lips heating but that is its not the answer but her body yearned for his for the warmth the strength you want me to apologize again gently now he stroked a hand over her hair fine im sorry and id do exactly the same thing if you want to call it lying to you then id lie id do whatever i had to do to keep you safe i dont want to be protected she broke away curled her hands into impotent fists i dont need to be protected cant you see dont you understand he used me to kill her he used me he isnt going to hurt me i dont need to be protected but god knows who else he might hurt because of me me he said quietly furiously thats what this is all about you think he might try for me the best way to prevent that is to dump me right to make sure everyone knows youve broken it off her lips trembled before she pressed them together im not going to argue with you finn youre absolutely right about that he picked up her case and upended the contents dont ever try that with me again dont ever use my feelings on me like that again hell try to kill you she said dully i know he will so you lied to try to protect me when she opened her mouth shut it again he smiled quid pro quo deanna well call it even so you dont want to be protected neither do i what do you want she lifted her fisted hands to her cheeks then let them fall i want you to stop watching me as though i were going to fall apart done what else i want you to swear you wont keep anything from me no matter how much you think itll upset me deal and same goes she nodded slowly watching him youre still angry yeah im still angry its a residual effect when the woman i love cuts me in half you still want me god yes i still want you you havent made love with me since this happened whenever id turn to you youd soothe and youd cuddle but you havent touched me no i havent he felt the blood begin to swim in his veins i wanted to give you time i dont want time she shouted at him felt the first sweet snap of release im not fragile or weak or delicate i want you to stop looking at me as though i were as though id crumble im alive i want to feel alive make me feel alive he reached out brushed his knuckle down her cheek you should have asked for something more difficult he kissed her she could feel the sparks of fury he was struggling to bank taste the hot frustration the searing need dont she murmured dont be gentle not now he wanted to be but she was pulling him down on the bed her hands already frantic as they tugged at his clothes he couldnt be gentle couldnt tap the well of tenderness when her mouth was driving him beyond caution into madness her body vibrated against his as she arched and strained and writhed more was all she could think more of him more of that simmering violence she had watched him fight to chain for days she wanted him to release it now inside her she could hear her own heart drum heavily in her ears feel each separate pulse throb her muffled cry was one of triumph as he ripped her shirt aside seeking flesh the wind kicked against the windows rattling glass it hooted down the chimney struggling to puff smoke into the room but the fire blazed in the hearth and burned brighter with the threat of the storm on the bed they rolled like thunder his mouth was on her ravenous teeth scraping skin already damp with passion his breath was hot and quick his hands bruising in their hurry to possess she reared up to meet him her head falling back her moan long and feral faster faster the desperation peaked as he yanked at her jeans his hungry mouth racing down her shuddering torso toward the violent heat her hands dived into his hair pressed him closer closer her nails scraped unfelt down his back as the first orgasm pummeled her now she nearly wept it dragging him up frantic for him to fill her her hands clutched at his hips her legs wrapped around his waist now she said again then cried out when he drove himself into her m he yanked her body up plunged deeper thrusting hard still harder while the ferocity of pleasure racked through him his body felt like an engine tireless primed to run he mated it with hers steel cased in velvet pumping faster each time he felt her muscles contract like a moist fist around him when she arched straining he pulled her to him until they were torso to torso her teeth sank into his shoulder even as her body moved like wet silk against his again she went rigid her body stiffening then breaking into shudders her eyes sprang open staring glazed into his while she went limp i cant he shoved her back grasping her hands and dragging them over her head i can he devoured her letting the animal take over ripping each new response from her with impatient teeth enticing new fires with tongue and lips his breath was burning in his throat his blood pounding in his head in his loins the final wave of sensation swamped him flooded through his system like light white and blinding he thought she cried out again just his name as he emptied himself into her chapter twentyfour marshall pikes office looked like an elegant living room but no one lived there it reminded finn of an ambitious model home decorated for prospective buyers who would never slouch on the brocade sofa or wrestle on the aubusson rug there would certainly never be a careless ring left by a careless glass set on the chippendale coffee table no child would ever play hideandseek behind the formal silk draperies or cuddle up to read in one of the deepcushioned chairs even marshalls desk seemed more of a prop than a usable fixture the oak was highly polished the brass fittings gleamed the desk set of burgundy leather fit seamlessly into the color scheme of wines and ferns the ficus tree by the window wasnt plastic but it was so perfect its leaves so radically dustfree it might as well have been finn had lived with easy wealth all of his life and the material trappings it could buy but he found marshall pikes pristine office with its low hum of an air filter discreetly sucking impurities soulless i would naturally be happy to cooperate with the police piously marshall tugged the sleeves of his jacket over the monogrammed cuffs of his crisp white shirt as i explained to you they havent found it necessary to question me why would they i have nothing to say to the press as i explained to you im not here as a member of the press youre not obligated to talk to me pike but if you dont finn spread his hands jenner was going to be pissed he thought that he hadnt cleared this interview with the police but this particular contact was personal some of my associates might appreciate having their memory jogged about a certain incident between you and angela one that slipped through the cracks a couple of years ago i cant imagine that something so trivial would be of interest to anyone its amazing isnt it what grabs the viewers attention and what if presented with a certain angle will intrigue the police the man was reaching of course marshall assured himself there was nothing absolutely nothing to connect him with angela but a momentary lapse of judgment and yet a word to the wrong person could result in publicity his practice couldnt afford a few questions he decided a few answers wouldnt matter he was after all an expert at communication if he couldnt handle an overexposed reporter he didnt deserve the degrees hanging prominently on the wall behind him more he would enjoy outwitting the man deanna had chosen over him my last appointment for the day canceled he shook his head as if in pity for the unhappy couple who wouldnt benefit from his skills i dont have another engagement until seven i can spare you a few moments thats all ill need when did you hear about angelas death on the news the morning after the murder i was shocked i understand that deanna was with her in the studio as you know deanna and i had a relationship naturally im concerned about her im sure that will help her sleep easy at night i have tried to contact her to offer my support she doesnt need it territorial mr riley marshall asked with a curve of the lips absolutely dr pike finn answered in my profession its essential to be fairminded he continued to smile deanna meant a great deal to me at one time with some interviews you prodded with others you planted in marshalls case finn noted that the shorter the question the more expansive the answer did she a great deal of time has passed and deanna is engaged to you regardless i would still offer whatever support or help i could to someone i was fond of particularly under such shocking circumstances and angela perkins finn leaned back in his chair however relaxed his pose he was alert watching every flick of marshalls eye were you fond of her no he said shortly i was not yet it was your affair with miss perkins which ended your relationship with deanna there was no affair marshall linked his hands on the desktop there was a momentary lapse of control and common sense i came to understand rather quickly that angela had orchestrated the entire incident for her own reasons which were in my opinion to manipulate deanna and to cause her distress she was successful his smile was thin and humorless although deanna did not accept the position angela had offered her in new york she did sever ties with me you resent that i resent mr riley that deanna refused to see the incident for what it was less than nothing a mere physical reaction to deliberate stimuli there was no emotion involved none at all some people are more emotional about sex than others finn smiled wider deliberately baiting him deannas very emotional indeed he said and left it at that when finn remained silent annoyance pushed him on i dont understand how my unfortunate misstep could be related to the investigation i didnt say it was finn said pleasantly but just to clear up that matter why dont you tell me where you were on the night of the murder between the hours of eleven and two i was home alone yes alone confident now marshall relaxed his eyes were mild im sure youd agree if id been planning on murder i would have had the simple intelligence to provide myself with an alibi however i had dinner alone spent a few hours working on case studies then went to bed did you speak with anyone receive any phone calls i let the service take my calls i dont like to be interrupted when im working barring emergencies he smiled cockily do you advise me to contact my lawyer mr riley if you think you need one if he was lying finn mused he was cool about it when was the last time you saw angela for the first time in the interview there was a flash of genuine pleasure in marshalls eyes i havent seen angela since she made the move to new york that would be over two years ago have you had any contact with her since that time why would i we did not have a love affair as i explained you didnt have one with deanna either finn commented and had the satisfaction of wiping the smile from marshalls face but youve continued to contact her not for nearly a year she is not forgiving but you have sent notes made calls no i havent not until i heard about this she hasnt returned my calls so i must assume she neither wants nor needs my help assured hed been more than reasonable he tapped his cuff again rose as i said i do have an appointment at seven and i need to go home and change for the evening i must say this was an interesting interlude be sure to give deanna my best i dont think so finn rose as well but made no move to leave ive got another question you can call this one from reporter to psychologist marshalls lips jerked into a sneer how could i refuse its about obsession finn let the word hang a moment watching for any sign an avoidance of eye contact a tic a change in tone if a man or a woman was fixed on someone longterm say two or three years and he had fantasies but he couldnt bring himself to approach this person face to face and in these fantasies he felt hed been betrayed what would he be feeling love or hate a difficult question mr riley with such little information i can say that love and hate are as intricately entwined as the poets claim either one can take control and either one depending on circumstances can be dangerous obsessions are rarely constructive for either party tell me are you planning a show on the topic could be finn reached for his coat as a layman i wonder if someone who was dealing with that kind of obsession might be able to hide it go through the daytoday motions without letting the mask slip he studied marshalls face now the old john smith who mows down half a dozen people in a k mart the neighbors say what a nice quiet guy he was it happens doesnt it most people are very clever at allowing others to see only what they wish to be seen and most people only see what they choose in any case if the human race were simpler both of us would be looking for other means of employment you have a point thanks for your time as finn walked out of the office through the reception area and to the bank of elevators he wondered if marshall pike was the type who could calmly blow a womans face off and walk away there was cold blood there that much he was sure of smarm under the polish finn mused it could have been pure animal reaction he supposed a territorial instinct no finn concluded that unease came from the reporter in him the man was hiding something and it was up to him to ferret it out it wouldnt hurt to take a run by the hotel and see if anyone had spotted marshall in the area on the night of angelas death in his office marshall sat behind his desk he waited and waited until he heard the faint rumble of the elevator and he waited again until he heard nothing at all snatching up the phone he punched in numbers wiped his damp palm over his face he heard finns voice relay the information he already knew deanna wasnt there marshall slammed down the phone and buried his head in his hands goddamn finn riley goddamn angela and goddamn deanna he had to see her and he had to see her now you shouldnt have come back yet jeff stood in deannas office his pleasant homely face set in stubborn lines of worry the smell of paint was still fresh they both knew why the walls had been painted the rug replaced there were long jagged scratch marks marring the surface of deannas desk the police had unsealed the room only fortyeight hours before and there hadnt been time to repair or replace everything i was hoping youd be glad to see me i am glad to see you but not here since it was just past eight in the morning they were alone jeff felt obligated to convince her to give herself more time when the rest of the staff arrived he had no doubt they would add their weight but now it was up to him to watch out for her youve been through a nightmare dee and it hasnt even been a week yes it had she thought one week tonight but she didnt correct him jeff ive already been through this with finn he shouldnt have let you come in her hackles rose but she bit back the first furious retort perhaps her nerves were still raw she decided if she was ready to snarl at poor jeff finn doesnt let me anything if it makes you feel better he agrees with you completely about my taking more time i dont she eased a hip down on the wide sill of the plateglass window behind her wet snow fell in thick listless sheets i need to work jeff angelas death was horrible but hiding my head under the covers isnt going to make it or my part in it go away and i need my pals she held out a hand i really do she heard him sigh but he crossed to her and took her hand we wanted to be there for you dee all of us i know you did she squeezed his hand urging him down on the sill with her i guess this hasnt been easy on anyone did you have to talk to the police yeah he grimaced shoving at his glasses that detective jenner where were you on the night in question jeff demanded in such a perfect mimic of jenner that deanna laughed we all got the treatment simon was sweating bullets you know how he is under pressure wringing his hands gulping audibly he got so worked up that fran made him lie down then tore into the cop for harassment sorry i missed it she leaned her head against jeffs shoulder content to be back with friends what else did i miss she could feel his body tense and she squeezed his hand in reassurance id feel better if i knew jeff ive only gotten some sketchy details about how the office was torn up i miss our christmas tree her smile was brief and sad silly isnt it when you think of everything that was destroyed in here i miss that stupid tree ill get you another one just as ugly impossible but she let it go tell me he hesitated a moment the office was pretty messed up dee but it was mostly cosmetic damage once the cops let us in loren had it cleaned out repainted recarpeted he was royally pissed not at you he said quickly it was the whole deal you know the fact that somebody got in and did what they did ill call him deanna im sorry i dont know what else to say im so damn sorry you had to go through all that i wish i could say im sorry about angela but im not jeff im not he repeated and tightened his grip on her hand she wanted to hurt you she did everything she could to ruin your career using lew making up lies dragging that whole business with that creep football player into the public i cant be sorry she wont be around to try something else he let out a long breath i guess that makes me pretty cold no it doesnt angela didnt inspire great love and devotion you do she lifted her head and turned to smile at him when a sound in the doorway made them both jump oh god cassie stood a paperweight in one hand a brass sculpture in the other i thought someone had broken in again she pressed the hefty glass paperweight to her heart on watery legs deanna managed the two steps to a chair i came in early she said trying desperately to sound calm and in control i thought i might start catching up i guess that makes three of us with her eyes on deanna cassie set the sculpture and paperweight aside are you sure youre okay no deanna closed her eyes for a moment but i need to be here perhaps her nerves were raw and her temper short but by midmorning deanna found some comfort in the basic office routine bookings had to be rearranged and rescheduled others fell through completely due to the time lapse new story ideas were devised and discussed once word spread that deanna was back in harness the phones began to shrill people from the newsroom popped upstairs out of both genuine concern and pure curiosity bennys hoping youll do an interview roger told her an exclusive for old times sake deanna passed him half the sandwich she was nibbling at her now overburdened desk benny thinks a lot of old times sake its news dee and pretty hot when you consider it happened right here at cbc and involved two major stars a major star she thought what was the difference between a major star and a minor one she knew what loren would have said a minor star sought airtime a major star sold it give me some time will you she rubbed at the tension in the back of her neck tell him im thinking about it sure his gaze wandered from hers to his own hands id appreciate it if you decide to do it if you let me do the interview his eyes cut back to her then away again i could use the boost there are rumors of cutbacks in the newsroom again there are always rumors of cutbacks in the newsroom she resented the favor he was asking and wished she didnt all right roger for old times sake just give me a couple of days youre a peach dee and he felt like sludge id better get down ive got some bumpers to tape he rose leaving the sandwich untouched its good to have you back you know if you need a friendly ear ive got two off the record he had the grace to flush sure off the record she held up both hands as if to gesture the words back sorry im touchy i guess ill have cassie set up an interview in a day or two all right whenever youre ready he walked to the door this really sucks he murmured as he shut the door behind him you bet deanna leaned back in her chair closing her eyes letting herself hear only the impersonal murmur of the television across the room angela was dead she thought and that made her a hotter news item than she had ever been when she was alive the really horrid bottom line deanna knew was that she was now hot news as well and hot news made for hot ratings since the murder deannas hour reruns of deannas hour she corrected had spurted up in points pummeling the competition no game show or daytime drama could hope to withstand the mighty weight of murder and scandal angela had given her greatest rival the success shed hoped to take away shed only had to die to do it deanna her heart flew to her throat her eyes sprang open on the other side of her desk simon jumped as violently as she sorry he said quickly i guess you didnt hear me knock thats okay disgusted with her reaction she chuckled weakly my nerves dont seem to be as strong as i thought you look exhausted he tried to smile but couldnt bring it off having trouble sleeping he tumbled out a cigarette i thought youd quit me too embarrassed he moved his shoulders i know you said you wanted to start taping on monday thats right is there a problem its just that he trailed off puffing hard on the cigarette i thought under the circumstances but maybe it doesnt matter to you it just seemed to me deanna wondered if she grabbed onto his tongue and pulled if the words would spill out what the set he blurted out and passed a nervous hand over his thinning hair i thought you might want to change the set the chairs you know oh god she pressed a fist to her mouth as the vision of angela sitting cozily sitting dead in the spacious white chair flashed into her mind oh god i havent thought im sorry deanna for lack of something better he patted her shoulder i shouldnt have said anything im an idiot no no thank god you did i dont think i could have handled she imagined herself striding out on the set then freezing in shock and horror would she have run screaming as she had done before oh simon oh sweet jesus dee helplessly he patted her shoulder again i didnt mean to upset you i think you just saved my sanity put the set decorator on it simon please have him change everything the color scheme the chairs tables the plants everything tell him simon had already taken out a notebook to scribble down her instructions the simple habitual gesture somehow cheered deanna thanks simon im the detail man remember he tapped out the halfsmoked cigarette dont worry about it well have a whole new look but keep it comfortable and why dont you knock off early go get yourself a massage id rather work i know what you mean i didnt know it would affect me like this he tucked the pad away i worked with her for years i cant say i liked her much but i knew her i stood right here in this spot when she was sitting there he glanced up again meeting deannas eyes now shes dead i cant stop thinking about it neither can i whoever did it was in here too warily he scanned the room as if he expected someone to lunge out of a corner wielding a gun jesus im sorry all im doing is scaring the shit out of both of us i guess its eating on me because her memorial service is tonight tonight in new york no here i guess she wanted to be buried in chicago where she got her big break theres not going to be a viewing or anything because he remembered why and swallowed hard well theres just going to be a service at the funeral parlor i think i should go give the details to cassie will you i think i should go too this isnt just stupid finn said with barely controlled fury its insane deanna watched the windshield wipers sweep at the ugly icy sleet the snow that had fallen throughout the day had turned to oily gray slop against the curbs the sleet that replaced it battered down cold and mean it was a good night for a funeral her chin came up and her jaw tightened i told you that you didnt have to come with me yeah right he spotted the crowd of reporters huddled outside the funeral parlor and drove straight down the block goddamn press she nearly smiled at that felt a giddy urge to laugh out loud but she was afraid it would sound hysterical i wont mention anything about pots and kettles im going to park down the block he said between his teeth well see if we can find a side or a back entrance im sorry she repeated when hed parked sorry to have dragged you out to this tonight she had a headache she didnt dare mention and a raw sick feeling in her stomach that promised to worsen i dont recall being dragged i knew you wouldnt let me come alone so it amounts to the same thing i cant even explain to myself why i feel i have to do this but i have to do it suddenly she twisted toward him gripping his hand hard whoever killed her could be in there i keep wondering if ill know him if i look him in the face if ill know im terrified i will but you still want to go inside i have to the sleet helped she thought not only was it cold but it demanded the use of long disguising coats and shielding umbrellas they walked in silence against the wind she caught sight of the cbc van before finn ducked around the side of the building he hustled her inside drenching them both as he snapped the umbrella closed i hate goddamned funerals surprised she studied his face as she tugged off her gloves shed her coat she could see it now more than annoyance with her for insisting on attending more than concern or even fear there was dread in his eyes im sorry i didnt realize i havent been to one since in years whats the point deads dead flowers and organ music dont change it its supposed to comfort the living not so ive noticed we wont stay long she took his hand surprised that it would be he rather than she who needed comfort he seemed to shudder once lets get it over with they walked out of the alcove they could already hear the murmur of voices the muted notes of a dirge not organ music he realized horribly relieved but piano and cello in somber duet the air smelled of lemon oil perfume flowers he would have sworn he smelled whiskey as well sharp as a blade cutting through the overly sweetened air the thick carpet was a riot of deep red roses and muffled their footsteps as they walked down a wide hall on both sides heavy oak doors were discreetly shut at the end they were flung open cigarette smoke added to the miasma of scent when he felt her tremble finn tucked his arm more firmly around her waist we can turn around and leave deanna theres no shame in it she only shook her head then she saw the first video camera the press it seemed wasnt merely huddled outside several had been allowed in complete with camera crews microphones and lights cables were strewn over the garden of carpet in the main viewing room in silence they slipped inside the cathedral ceiling with its painted mural of cherubim and seraphim tossed the murmuring voices and chinking glasses everywhere the room was crowded with people as deanna looked from face to face she wondered if she would see grief or fear or simply resignation would angela feel she was being mourned properly and would her killer be here to observe no one wept finn noted he did see shock and sober eyes voices were muted respectfully and the cameras recorded it all would they he wondered inadvertently record one face one that couldnt quite hide the knowledge and the triumph he kept deanna close to his side knowing that the murderer could be in the room watching there was a photograph of angela in a gold frame the flattering publicity shot sat atop a gleaming mahogany coffin it reminded finn much too vividly of what lay inside the discreetly closed lid feeling deanna shudder beside him he instinctively drew her closer lets get the hell out of here no kansas but when he looked at her he saw more than the shock and fear he saw what was missing on so many of the other faces that crowded the room grief whatever her motives deanna said quietly she helped me once and whoever did this to her used me her voice broke i cant forget that neither could he that was what terrified him it would be better if dan gardner doesnt spot either one of us deanna nodded spotting him at the front of the room accepting condolences hes using her too even though shes dead its horrible hell ride her press for a while shed have understood that i suppose an interesting scene isnt it loren commented when he joined them he gave deanna a hard searching look then nodded youre looking well no im not grateful for the lie she kissed his cheek i didnt think youd come i could say the same he warmed her chilled hands between his it seemed necessary somehow but im already regretting it his expression changed to one of disgust as he looked over his shoulder at dan gardner rumor is he plans to air clips from this viewing along with the special angela taped for next may and hes demanding another five thousand a minute from sponsors the son of a bitch will get it too bad taste often costs more than good deanna murmured there must be five hundred people in here easily a handful are even sorry shes dead oh loren deannas stomach clenched like a fist i hate to admit im one of them then he sighed and shrugged off the mood shed have gotten an ego boost out of that piece of news to clear the emotion from his voice loren coughed gently into his hand you know i cant decide if angela deserved dan gardner or not its a tough call im sure she didnt deserve you the tears burning in her eyes made deanna feel like a hypocrite since they werent for angela were not staying loren why dont you come with us no im going to see this through but i think you should avoid any publicity here tonight slip out quietly when they were back in the alcove deanna turned into finns arms i had no idea he still loved her i dont think he did either he tipped her face up until their eyes were level are you all right actually im better she turned her head until her cheek rested on his shoulder most of the fear had ebbed she realized that jittering panic shed nearly grown accustomed to feeling in her stomach had quieted im glad we came excuse me kate lowells sultry voice had deanna turning her head she stood in the doorway sleek and somber in black silk her hair waves of flame over her shoulders im sorry to interrupt you havent deanna responded we were just leaving so am i she glanced over her shoulder toward the sounds of voices and music its not my kind of party she smiled slightly she was a bitch kate said and i hated her guts but im not sure even angela deserved to be used quite so blatantly she sighed once moving her shoulders as if to shrug it all away id like a drink and i need to talk to you she looked at finn and frowned i suppose itll have to be both of you and it hardly matters at this point she watched finns brow rise and smiled again with more feeling really gracious arent i listen why dont you find us a bar ill buy us all a drink and tell you a little story you might find interesting chapter twentyfive to hollywood kate said as she raised her glass of scotch land of illusions puzzled deanna nursed her wine while finn stuck with coffee it wasnt the sort of bar where one would expect to find one of hollywoods major stars the piano player was glumly noodling out the blues so that the notes rose sluggishly on air thick with smoke their corner was dim as kate had requested on the table scarred with nicks their drinks rested near a chipped amber glass ashtray you came a long way for the funeral of someone you didnt like deanna watched kates elegant nails tap the table in time with the piano i was in town but if i hadnt been id have made the trip for the pleasure of making sure she was dead kate sipped her scotch again then set the glass aside i dont imagine you cared for her any more than i did but this might be rougher on you since you found her kates eyes softened as she stared into deannas as the story goes it wasnt a pretty sight no it wasnt i wish it had been me kate said under her breath youre a softer touch always were even after everything she did and tried to do to you i know a lot more about that than you might imagine she added when deanna studied her things that didnt make it into the press angela liked to brag she hated you she inclined the glass toward finn because you didnt come to heel when she snapped her fingers and she wanted you for exactly the same reason she figured deanna was in her way from all manner of angles shed have done anything to remove you this isnt news noting that kates glass was dry finn signaled for another the lady he concluded was stalling no its just my little prelude she stretched back but the sinuous gesture was all nerves i dont suppose youd be surprised to know that angela went to some trouble and expense to dig up that business from your past deanna the date rape it backfired of course her lips curved into a lovely smile some of her projects did thats what she called them not blackmail she sulked a moment fingers tapping tapping tapping rob winters was one of her projects so was marshall pike she didnt glance at the waitress but nudged the glass aside even as it was set in front of her there are plenty more names that would astonish you she used a pi named beeker hes in chicago angela kept him very busy documenting data for her projects it cost me five thousand dollars to shoehorn his name out of angelas secretary but then everybody has a price i had mine she added quietly youre saying angela blackmailed people deanna leaned forward she traded secrets for money occasionally she preferred trading secrets for favors her terms again absently she reached into the plastic bowl of mixed nuts do me a little favor darling and ill keep this tidbit of information all to myself your wife has a drug problem senator dont worry i wont breathe a word if you just do me a favor what multigrammy winner was a victim of incest what popular television star has ties to the kkk ask angela she made it her business to know what skeleton was in what closet and if she was confident she had her hooks in you deeply enough she might tell you what closet it was a way of flexing her power she was confident she had her hooks in me and now shes dead kate acknowledged finns comment with a nod funny now that shes no longer a threat to me i feel compelled to do what she always threatened to do im going public actually id decided to do so on the very night she was murdered the police might find that convenient dont you think like a bad script i saw her that night she read the horror in deannas eyes not at the studio at her hotel we argued since there was a maid in the next room i imagine the police already know about it she lifted a brow at finn yes i can see at least you knew about it well then im going to go in and make a statement before they come to me i believe i even threatened to kill her kate closed her eyes theres that bad script again i didnt kill her but youll have to decide whether to believe me when im finished why are you telling us deanna demanded why dont you go directly to the police im an actress i like the chance to choose my audience you were always a good one dee she reached out then in a quick fleeting gesture of friendship and in any case i think youre entitled to know the whole story didnt you ever wonder why i backed out of coming on your show why ive never been available to appear on it yes but i think youve answered that angela was blackmailing you and the favor was for you to boycott my program that was one of them i was in a precarious and fascinating position a couple of years ago when you approached me i had two whopping boxoffice successes and the critics loved me the wholesomely sexy girlnextdoor dont believe that hype about stars not reading their reviews i pored over mine every word she said with a long dreamy smile i could probably still quote a few of the best ones all i ever wanted was to be an actor a star she corrected with an easy shrug and thats what they called me the first movie star of the new generation a throwback to bacall and bergman and davis and it didnt take me years one supporting role in a film that took off like a rocket and an academy nomination then i costarred with rob and we burned up the screen we broke hearts the next movie my name was over the title my image was locked in a woman who charms with a smile she laughed at that drank again the good girl the heroine the woman youd like your son to bring home for dinner thats the image thats what hollywood wants from me thats what the public expects and thats what ive delivered theyve given me plenty of credit for talent but the image is every bit as important her eyes slitted do you think the top producers and directors the players the men who decide what project flies and what project gets buried would flood my agent with offers if they knew their perfect heroine the woman who won an oscar for playing the desperately devoted mother had gotten pregnant at seventeen and had given up the child without a second thought she laughed when deannas mouth opened but it wasnt a merry sound doesnt fit does it even in these enlightened times how many of those ticket buyers would shell out seven bucks to watch me play the longsuffering or feisty heroine i dont deanna stopped waiting for her thoughts to settle i dont see why it should matter you made a choice one im sure was anything but easy for you and you were a child yourself amused kate glanced at finn is she really that naive about some things he was despite his pride in being a sharp judge of character doing some rapid mental shuffling i can see why an announcement like that would have shaken things up youd have taken some knocks in the press but youd have pulled out of it maybe i was afraid angela knew that and i was ashamed she knew that too she was very sympathetic at first how hard it must have been on you dear a young girl with her whole life in flux because of one tiny mistake how difficult it must have been for you to do what you thought was best for the child annoyed with herself kate flicked a tear away and you see since it had been difficult even horrible and because she was sympathetic i broke down then she had me she reminded me that it wouldnt do for certain hollywood brass to discover that id made this tiny mistake oh she understood she sympathized completely but would they would the ticketbuying public whod crowned me their valiant princess understand kate you were seventeen very slowly kate lifted her gaze to deannas i was old enough to make a child old enough to give her away old enough to pay for it i hope im strong enough now to face the consequences she frowned at her glass if she didnt survive if she crashed and burned it would kill her angela had known that a few years ago i wasnt its as simple as that i dont think i could have survived the hate mail then or the tabloids or the bad jokes she smiled again but deanna saw her pain i cant say im looking forward to it now but the simple fact is the cops are bound to track me down sooner or later theyll dig up beeker and all of angelas nasty files im going to choose my own time and place for my public announcement id like to do it on your show deanna blinked excuse me i said id like to do it on your show why two reasons first for me it would be the ultimate payback to angela you dont like that one she murmured seeing the disapproval in deannas eyes youll like this better i trust you youve got class and compassion this isnt going to be easy for me and im going to need both im scared she set her drink down i hate that reason but i might as well admit it i lost the child through my ambition she said quietly thats gone she said fiercely i dont want to lose what ive got deanna what ive worked for angelas just as dangerous to me dead as she was alive at least i can pick my time and place this way ive got a lot of respect for you i always have im going to have to talk about my private life my personal griefs id like to start off talking with someone i respect well juggle the schedule deanna said simply and do it monday morning kate closed her eyes a moment gathered what resources she had left thanks the sleet had stopped by the time they arrived home leaving the air chill and damp and gloomy clouds hovered thick and black there was a light on in one of the front windows streaming gold through the glass in cozy welcome the dog began to bark the moment finn slipped the key into the lock it should have been a homecoming but there was the everpresent smell of paint reminding them their home had been violated drop cloths were spread in the hallway and the dogs barking echoed emptily so many of the rooms had been cleared out of broken crockery damaged furniture it was like being greeted by a mortally ill friend we can still go to a hotel deanna shook her head no thats only another way of hiding i cant help feeling responsible for this then work on it she recognized the impatience in his voice she stooped to pet the dog as finn peeled off his coat they were your things finn things he shoved his coat on the hall rack in the mirrored surface he saw her head bent over the dogs just things deanna insured replaceable she stayed where she was but lifted her head her eyes were wide and weary i love you so much i hate knowing he was here that he touched anything that was yours he crouched beside her causing the dog to roll belly up in anticipation but finn took deanna by the shoulders his eyes suddenly fierce you are the only thing i have thats irreplaceable the first time i met you the first time i knew that nothing that had happened to me before or that would happen after would mean as much can you understand that his hand moved roughly into her hair its overwhelming what i feel for you its terrifying and its everything yes she brought her hands to his face guided his mouth to hers i can understand that emotions welled up pouring into the kiss so that her lips were urgent and edgy even as finn tugged at her coat the dog wriggled between them whining were embarrassing cronkite he murmured drawing deanna to her feet we should find him a wife you just want to go to the pound again and liberate another mutt now that you mention it but her smile faded quickly finn i have to talk to you about something sounds serious can we go upstairs she wanted the bedroom since it was almost fully restored hed seen that the work there had been completed first the things that hadnt been destroyed had been placed there above the bed where she knew a desperate message had been scrawled the paint was fresh and clean hed hung the painting there the one he had bought out from under her in the gallery so long ago awakenings all those vivid splashes of color that energy and verve hed known shed needed it there a reminder of life and so the room had become a haven are you upset about kate yes she kept her hand in his as they climbed the stairs but this is about something else she walked into the bedroom moved to the fireplace the window then back i love you finn the tone put him on guard weve established that loving you doesnt mean i have the right to intrude in every area of your life curious he tilted his head he could read her like a book she was worried which areas do you consider off limits youre annoyed baffled she tossed up her hands i can never quite understand how easily i can set you off especially when im trying to be reasonable i hate it when you think youre being reasonable just spill it deanna fine what did angela have on you his expression altered subtly from impatience to utter confusion huh dont do that she ripped off her coat and tossed it aside in her tasteful black suit and damp shoes she paced the room if you dont want to tell me just say so ill agree that anything youve done in the past isnt necessarily connected to our relationship slow down and stop stalking around the room what do you think ive done i dont know her voice sounded shrill to herself i dont know she said more calmly and if you think i dont need to know ill try to accept it but once the police question this beeker character your secret is bound to come out anyway hold on he held up both hands as she unbuttoned her suit jacket if im reading this correctly and stop me anytime if i veer off you think that angela was blackmailing me have i got that part marching to the closet she yanked out a padded hanger i said i wouldnt intrude if you didnt want me to i was being reasonable you certainly were he came over clamped his hands on her shoulders and steered her rigid body to a chair now sit down and tell me why you think i was being blackmailed i went to meet angela that night because she said she knew something about you something that could hurt you he sat himself then on the edge of the bed as a new kind of fury ate at him she lured you to the studio by threatening me not directly not exactly she dragged a hand through her hair there was nothing she could tell me that would change my feelings for you i wanted to make sure she understood that that she left us both alone deanna why didnt you come to me she winced from the simple rational question because i wanted to handle her myself she shot back because i dont need you or anyone running interference for me isnt that precisely what you misguidedly tried to do for me that shut her up but again only for a moment it was she knew master interviewer against master interviewer and it was a competition she didnt mean to lose youre evading the issue what would she have told me finn i dont have a clue im not gay i dont use drugs ive never stolen anything except a couple of comic books when i was twelve and nobody could prove it i dont think this is funny she wasnt blackmailing me deanna i had an affair with her but that was no secret she wasnt the first woman id been involved with but there havent been any deviant sexual encounters id want to hide i dont have any ties to organized crime never embezzled im not hiding any illegitimate children i never killed anyone he broke off abruptly and the impatient amusement drained out of his face oh jesus he brought both hands to his face pressing the heels to his eyes jesus christ im sorry competition forgotten she sprang up to go to him finn im sorry i should never have brought it up could she have done that he said to himself could even she have done that and for what he let his hands drop and his eyes were haunted for what done what deanna asked quietly her arms still around him finn drew back just a little as if what was working inside him might damage her my best friend in college pete whitney we got hooked on the same girl we got drunk one night really plowed and tried to beat the crap out of each other did a pretty good job made sure it was off campus then we decided hell she wasnt worth it and we drank some more his voice was cool detached his newscasters voice thats the last time ive been drunk pete used to joke that it was the irish in me that i could drink or fight or talk my way out of anything he remembered the way hed been then angry rebellious belligerent determined to be absolutely nothing like his chilly and civilized parents im not much of a drinker anymore and ive figured out that words are generally a better weapon than fists he gave me this finn tugged the celtic cross out from under his shirt closed his hand around it he was my closest friend the closest thing to family i ever had was deanna thought and ached for him we forgot about the girl she wasnt as important to either of us as we were to each other we killed off another bottle my eye was swollen up like a rotten tomato so i tossed him the keys climbed into the passenger seat passed out we were twenty and we were stupid the idea of getting into a car filthy drunk didnt mean anything to us when youre twenty youre going to live forever but pete didnt i woke up when i heard him scream thats it i heard him scream and the next thing i remember is waking up with all these lights and all these people and feeling as if id been run over by a truck hed taken a turn too fast hit a utility pole wed both been thrown from the car i had a concussion a broken collarbone broken arm lots of cuts and bruises pete was dead oh finn she wrapped her arms around him again held on it was my car so they figured id been driving they were going to charge me with vehicular manslaughter my father came down but by the time he got there theyd already found several witnesses who had seen pete take the wheel he wasnt any more or any less dead of course it didnt change that or the fact that id been drunk and stupid criminally careless he tightened his fingers around the silver cross i wasnt hiding it deanna its just not something i like to remember funny i thought about pete tonight when we walked into angelas funeral i havent been to one since petes his mother always blamed me i could see her point you werent driving finn does it really matter he looked at her then though he already knew the answer i could have been my father gave the whitneys a settlement and that was pretty much the end of it i wasnt charged with anything i wasnt held responsible he turned his face into deannas hair but i was i was just as responsible as pete the only difference is im alive and hes not the difference is you were given a second chance and he wasnt she closed her hand over his so that they both held the cross im so sorry finn so was he hed spent his adult life making himself into the man he was as much for pete as for himself he wore the cross every day as a talisman yes and as a reminder angela could have dug up the facts easily enough finn said she could even have made it appear that the riley money and power influenced the outcome but she would have blackmailed you not me shed have known if shed come to me id have told her to take out an ad i want to tell the police he eased her back on the bed so that they were curled together wrapped close well tell them a lot of things tomorrow gently he tipped her face toward his would you have protected me deanna she started to deny it but caught the gleam in his eye she knew hed recognize a lie yes so so thanks she smiled as she lifted her mouth toward his not so far away someone was weeping the tears were hot and bitter scalding the throat the eyes the skin photographs of deanna looked on smiling benignly at the sobbing form three candles tossed the only light their flames straight and true highlighting the pictures the single earring the lock of hair bound in gold thread all of the treasures on the altar of frustrated desire there were stacks of videotapes but the television screen was silent and dark tonight angela was dead but still that wasnt enough love deep dark and demented had triggered the gun but it wasnt enough there had to be more the candleglow shot the shadow of a form hunched into a ball racked with despair deanna would see had to see that she was loved cherished adored there was a way to prove it finn would have preferred to handle the interview alone jenner would have preferred to do the same since neither of them could manage to shake the other loose they drove to beekers office together might as well make the best of it jenner said im doing you a favor mr riley letting you tag along that statement earned jenner a frigid stare i dont tag along lieutenant and let me remind you that you wouldnt know about kate lowell or beeker if we hadnt come to you with the information jenner grinned and rubbed his chin which hed nicked shaving and i get the feeling you wouldnt have come to me if miss reynolds hadnt insisted she feels easier knowing the police are on top of things and how does she feel about your being involved in the investigation silence doesnt know jenner concluded as a man married thirtytwo years last july let me mention that youre skating on thin ice shes terrified and shes going to continue to be terrified until you have angelas killer under wraps cant argue with that now this kate lowell business being a reporter you might not agree but i think shes entitled to her privacy its tough to argue for privacy when you make your living in the public eye i believe in the right to know lieutenant but i dont believe in blackmail or in poking telescopic lenses into someones bedroom window got your dander up pleased jenner scooted through a yellow light me i feel sorry for her she was a kid probably scared youre a soft touch lieutenant like hell you cant be a cop and be a soft touch but he was damn it and since it embarrassed the hell out of him he took the aggressive route she still couldve killed angela perkins finn waited as jenner doubledparked then flipped the officeronduty sign over on the dash entertain me she argues with angela at the hotel shes fed up with angela enraged at being made to suffer for something that happened when she was still wet behind the ears theres that soft touch again keep going finn prompted as he climbed out of the car shes tired of angela holding it over her head and threatens her she hears the maid in the bedroom so she leaves but she follows angela to cbc confronts her in the studio murders her then deanna comes in and she gets creative shes been in films for years she knows how to set up a camera yes there was a quick nippy breeze that smelled of the lake finn drew it in the easy freshness of it as they crossed the street then she decides to disguise her motive by going public with exactly what she killed angela over better the world knows shes an unwed mother than a murderer it doesnt play jenner concluded not for me if beeker has half the dirt kate thinks well have a dozen more scenarios by dinnertime they walked into the office building jenner flashing his badge at the security guard in the lobby upstairs jenner scanned the wide corridor the oil paintings were originals and very good the carpet was thick tall leafy plants were tucked into niches every few feet the doors of beeker investigations were glass and whispered open into an airy reception area complete with a tidy miniature spruce for the holiday season a trim thirtyish brunette piloted a circular reception desk fashioned from glass blocks may i help you beeker jenner offered the receptionist his id for inspection mr beeker is in conference lieutenant will one of his associates be able to help you beeker he said again well wait but id buzz him if i were you very well her friendly smile chilled a few degrees may i ask what this is in reference to murder nice touch finn murmured when they wandered over to the deepcushioned chairs in the waiting area real joe friday stuff he took another look around very elegant surroundings for a pi a couple of clients like angela perkins means this guy nets in a month what i do in a year lieutenant jenner the receptionist obviously miffed stood in the center of the room mr beeker will see you now she guided them through another set of glass doors past several offices she knocked lightly on the door at the end of the hall and opened it clarence beeker was like his office trim subtly elegant and serviceable he stood a man of average height and slim build behind his belker desk the hand he extended was fineboned his hair was graying dashingly at the temples and he had a finely drawn face that was more handsome with the lines and crevices etched by time his body was obviously trim beneath his savile row suit might i see some identification his voice was smooth like cool cream over rich coffee jenner was disappointed hed expected beeker to be sleazy he examined the shield after slipping on silverframed reading glasses i recognize you mr riley i often watch your show on tuesday nights since youve brought a reporter along detective jenner i assume this is an unofficial visit its official enough jenner corrected mr rileys here as a special liaison of the mayors not by a flicker did jenner or finn react to the glib lie im honored please sit tell me what i can do for you im investigating angela perkinss murder jenner began she was a client of yours she was beeker settled behind his desk i was shocked and distressed to read about her death we have information leading us to believe that the deceased was blackmailing a number of people blackmail beekers graying brows rose it seems a very unattractive term to be connected to a very attractive woman its also an attractive motive for murder finn put in you investigated people for miss perkins i handled a number of cases for miss perkins over our tenyear association given the nature of her profession it was advantageous for her to be privy to details backgrounds the personal habits of those she would interview her interest and her use of those personal habits might have led to her death mr riley i investigated and reported for miss perkins im sure you understand both those functions i had no more control over her use of the information i provided than you do over the publics use of the information you provide to them and no responsibility none beeker agreed pleasantly we provide a service beeker investigations has an excellent reputation because we are skilled discreet and dependable we abide by the law detective and a code of ethics whether or not our clients do so is their business not ours one of your clients got her face shot off jenner said shortly wed like to see copies of the reports you wrote for miss perkins im afraid as much as i prefer to cooperate with the police that would be impossible unless you have a warrant he said pleasantly you dont have a client to protect mr beeker jenner leaned forward whats left of her is in a coffin im aware of that however i do have a client mr gardner has this company under retainer as the deceaseds husband and beneficiary i am morally bound to accede to his wishes which are to investigate his wifes murder to be frank gentlemen hes dissatisfied with the police investigation to date and as he was my client during his wifes life and continues to be after her death i cant ethically turn over my files without the proper warrant im sure you understand my position and youll understand mine finn said pleasantly liaison or not i am a reporter as such i have an obligation to inform the public it would be interesting to inform the public of the kind of work you did for angela i wonder how many of your other clients would appreciate that connection beeker had stiffened threats mr riley arent appreciated im sure theyre not but that doesnt make them any less viable finn glanced at his watch i think i have enough time to squeeze in a quick feature on the evening news wed be able to do an indepth version tomorrow jaw clenched beeker lifted his phone buzzed his secretary ill need copies of angela perkinss files all of them he cradled the phone again linked his fingers it will take a little time weve got plenty jenner assured him while were waiting why dont you tell us where you were on the night angela perkins was shot id be happy to i was at home with my wife and my mother as i recall we played threehanded bridge until about midnight then you wont object to us questioning your wife and your mother of course not though he wasnt pleased at being outmaneuvered beeker was a practical man perhaps i can offer you gentlemen coffee while we wait for the files chapter twentysix marshall pike had been waiting in his car in the cbc parking lot for more than an hour when deanna finally walked out he felt the quick unbidden tightening of his muscles in response at the sight of her part anger part lust for the past two years he had been forced to content himself with images of her on the tv screen seeing her now in the gloom of dusk shortskirted her legs flashing as she hurried toward a dark sedan exceeded his memories deanna he called to her climbing quickly out of his own car she stopped glanced toward him peering through the rapidly deepening night the quick friendly smile of greeting faded marshall what do you want you never returned any of my calls he cursed himself for sounding petulant he wanted to appear strong dynamic i wasnt interested in speaking with you youre going to speak with me he clamped his hand over her arm his gesture made deannas driver spring out of the car call off your dog deanna surely you can spare five minutes its all right tim but she removed marshalls hand before turning to her driver i wont keep you waiting long no problem miss reynolds he gave marshall a measured look then tipped his cap no problem at all if we could be private marshall gestured across the lot your guard will be able to see you deanna im sure hell leap to your rescue should i try to manhandle you i think i can handle you alone she crossed the lot with him hoping the meeting would be brief the wind was bitterly cold and she didnt relish speaking with him since i cant think of anything wed have to discuss on a personal level i assume you wanted to talk to me about angela it would have been difficult for you finding her yes it was i could help you professionally her brow quirked the wind and anger brought color to her cheeks a snap to her eyes no thanks tell me what you want for the moment he stared at her she was still perfect fresh seductive all luminous eyes and moist lips have dinner with me he said at last the french place you always liked so much marshall please there was no anger in her voice only pity it scraped like rusty blades over his ego oh yes i seem to have forgotten to congratulate you on your engagement to our dashing correspondent thank you is that all i want the file at her blank look he tightened his grip dont pretend you dont understand i know angela gave you a copy of her investigators report on me she told me she gloated over it i didnt ask for it before because id hoped that youd come to realize what i could offer you now under the circumstances i need it i dont have it rage darkened his face youre lying she gave it to you yes she did her arm was throbbing now but she refused to struggle do you really think i would have kept it all this time i destroyed it ages ago he gripped both her arms now nearly lifting her off her feet i dont believe you i dont give a damn what you believe i dont have it more furious than frightened she struggled against him cant you understand i didnt care enough to keep it you werent important enough bitch too incensed to think clearly he dragged her toward his car you wont hold that file over my head he grunted his wing tips skittering on the pavement as he was yanked from behind he went down painfully bruising his hip and his dignity no tim dont though she was shaking deanna grabbed her drivers arm before he could haul marshall to his feet and knock him down all over again tim adjusted his bulky coat seeing marshall was quelled you okay miss reynolds yes im fine hey a baseball cap shielding his eyes a camera on his shoulder joe raced across the lot dee you okay yes she pressed a hand to her temple as marshall got to his feet perfect she thought pictures at ten yes im okay i was just pulling into the lot when i saw this guy hassling you joes eyes narrowed the shrink right he slapped a hand on marshalls chest before marshall could step toward his car hold on pal dee you want me to call the cops or should tim and i just show this creep what happens to men who push women around just let him go sure she looked into marshalls eyes there was something dead in them now but she couldnt find any pity yes let him go the ladys giving you a break joe muttered if i catch you bothering her again i wont be so nice silently marshall got into his car he locked the doors fastened his seat belt before driving out of the lot are you sure he didnt hurt you miss reynolds no he didnt thank you tim no problem tim sauntered proudly back to the car i wish youd let me punch him joe gave a regretful sigh before looking back at deanna spooked you huh he glanced at the camera on his shoulder grimaced i got so pissed i didnt get any tape of it that at least was something i guess theres no point in my asking you not to mention this in the newsroom he grinned as he walked her to her car no point at all news is news she didnt want to tell finn but theyd made a deal no holding back shed hoped finn would have to work late but as luck would have it he opened the door and greeted her with a long sloppy kiss hiya hi yourself she rocked back on her heels and gave cronkite the caress he was whining for we had a change in schedule so i got home a little early the change in schedule had been canceling all of his appointments and spending his afternoon with jenner reading through beekers files made dinner cooperating deanna sniffed the air smells great new recipe with one brow cocked he tipped a finger under her chin what what what youre upset she scowled and pushed his hand away damn it finn thats irritating dont you know a woman likes to think she has some mystery still hoping to stall she peeled out of her coat and hung it on the hall rack what happened kansas well talk about it later im starving he merely shifted and blocked her path spill it she could argue but since an argument was precisely what she was hoping to avoid what was the point will you promise to hear me out and not overreact sure he smiled at her as he swung an arm around her shoulders and led her to the steps they sat together near the bottom landing with the dog happily at their feet is it about angela not directly she blew out a long breath it was marshall he sort of ambushed me in the parking lot ambushed his icy tone alerted her but when she looked up at finn his eyes seemed calm enough curious a little annoyed but calm just a figure of speech he was upset you know i havent returned his calls when finn said nothing she let the rest tumble out he was just angry and upset thats all about that and about the files angela had sent to me i told you about them marshall has it in his head that i kept them of course with the investigation going on hes worried naturally naturally finn said pleasantly hed hear about the rest anyway deanna reminded herself from joe or someone else in the newsroom that would be worse we had a little scuffle there was a dangerous light in finns eyes did he put his hands on you deanna shrugged hoping to lighten the mood in a manner of speaking it was really just one of those pushshove sort of things but tim was there she added quickly and joe so it was nothing it was really nothing he put his hands on you finn repeated and he threatened you i dont know that id call it a threat it was just finn he was already up removing his coat from the rack finn damn it you said youd be reasonable he shot her one look one stunningly frigid look that had her heart stopping i lied her knees were knocking together but she was on his heels as he strode out of the house the cold and the look in finns eye had her teeth chattering as she struggled into her coat stop this now right now what are you going to do im going to go explain to pike why he should keep his hands off my woman your woman that tore it she bounded ahead of him slapping both hands onto his chest dont you pull that macho bullshit on me finn riley im not going to her voice slid back down her throat when he propped his hands under her elbows and lifted her off the ground his eyes were blazing you are my woman deanna thats not an insult thats a fact anybody who manhandles you anybody who threatens you has to deal with me thats another fact got a problem with it no yes her feet hit the ground with a thump and she ground her teeth i dont know how was she supposed to think when all she could see were those furious deadly eyes boring into her lets go back inside and talk this through reasonably well talk when i get back she raced to the car after him im going with you there was still a chance a slim one that she could talk him down go inside deanna im going with you she opened the door climbed in and slammed it shut he wasnt the only one who could slice flesh with a look if my mans going to go make a fool of himself im going to be there got a problem with that finn slammed the door and turned the key hell no the best deanna could hope for now was that marshall wouldnt be home the wind had picked up and held a fresh threat of snow it raced through finns hair sent it flying around his face as he stalked up to marshalls door he had only one thing on his mind and like a skilled reporter easily blocked out all distractions deannas mumbled curses the occasional swish of tires on the street the numbing chill in the air hes not worth it deanna said for the hundredth time hes just not worth your making a scene i have no intention of making a scene im going to talk to him and hes going to listen and then unless im very much mistaken youll never see or hear from him again he had been wanting a confrontation since the day deanna had rushed out of the cbc building in tears and into his arms finn could already feel the grim satisfaction of pleasure postponed deanna saw his eyes slit like a predators as the door opened her stomach clenched and she had one wild thought to jump between them but finn didnt lunge as shed been half terrified he would he simply strolled across the threshold and into the foyer i dont believe i invited you in marshall ran a finger over the black tie of his tuxedo and im afraid im on my way out well make this as quick as possible since i dont believe deannas comfortable being here deannas always welcome in my home marshall said stiffly you are not what you dont seem to understand is that were a team when you threaten her you threaten me i dont react well to threats dr pike my conversation with deanna was personal wrong again finn stepped closer the feral gleam in his eyes had marshall stepping back if you come near her again if you ever put your hands on her again ill bury you in every way you can imagine there are laws to protect a man against a physical attack in his own home i have better ways of dealing with you angelas file on you made very interesting reading pike marshalls eyes slid to deanna she doesnt have the file she destroyed it no deanna doesnt have it but you dont know what i have do you marshalls attention snapped back to finn you have no right ive got the first amendment steer clear pike way clear or ill break you in half with it you bastard fear of exposure propelled marshall forward he swung out more in panic than design finn easily avoided the blow and followed it by one punishing fist to the midsection it was over in seconds deanna had done no more than squeak in response marshall had done no more than moan and finn she realized as she gaped had made no sound at all then he crouched down impossibly graceful and smooth listen carefully dont ever come near deanna again dont call dont write dont send a telegram are you getting this he was satisfied when marshall blinked that should conclude our little interview he stepped back to where deanna still stood openmouthed on the stoop quietly he shut the door lets go her legs were jelly she had to lock her knees to keep from swaying good god finn good god were going to have to reheat dinner he said as he guided her to the car you just i mean you she didnt know what she meant we cant just leave him there of course we can he doesnt need paramedics deanna i only wrinkled his tux and bruised his ego you hit him once she was seated strapped in she pressed both hands to her mouth his black mood had passed he felt almost sunny as he drove fast through the windswept night not exactly my style but since he swung first it worked for me she turned her head away she couldnt explain couldnt believe what she was feeling the way hed sliced marshall with words sharp and cold as a sword then hed shifted his body aside graceful as a dancer she hadnt seen the blow coming any more than marshall had hed moved so fast so stunningly she pressed a hand to her stomach and bit back a little moan pull over she said in a muffled voice right now he did terrified she was about to be sick disgusted because he hadnt reined in his temper long enough to make her stay home take it easy deanna im sorry you had to see that but whatever else hed intended to say was lost as she lunged at him in one fluid move she tore off her seat belt and whipped toward him her mouth was hot and wet and hungry through his shock and instant arousal he felt the violent thud of her heart and her hands jesus her hands cars sped by them he could only groan as she dived deeper into his mouth her tongue greedy her teeth vicious both of them were panting for air when she leaned back well he managed but his mind was wiped as clean as glass well im not proud of it she flopped back in her seat face flushed eyes bright i dont approve of intimidation or fighting i absolutely dont oh god with a half laugh she squeezed her eyes shut her body was vibrating like an overheated engine intellect she discovered could be completely overpowered by glands im going to explode drive fast will you yeah his aching hand trembled a bit as he turned the key again then as he punched the accelerator he started to grin the grin became a hard deepthroated laugh deanna im crazy about you she had to curl her fingers into fists to keep herself from tearing at his clothes were both crazy she decided drive faster marshall comforted himself as best he could pampering his bruised stomach muscles taking a painkiller shame and fury had driven him out of the house he opted for a drink first then two before keeping his date at the opera he hadnt thought hed enjoy the music or the company but both had soothed him he was a civilized man he reminded himself a respected man he would not be intimidated by some grandstanding reporter like finn riley he would simply bide his time calmly enchanted by the divas final aria he still felt peaceful when he pulled in to his driveway even though his stomach ached dully another dose of painkiller would take the edge off he knew fury and frustration had been eased by mozarts music humming lightly marshall set the security on his car if deanna had the file and he could no longer be sure he would convince her to return it to him but hed wait until riley was away on assignment they would talk he promised himself and finally set the past behind them as angela was behind them his eyes gleamed as he reached for his keys he thought he sensed a movement to his left he had time to turn time to understand he didnt have time to scream finn was watching deanna sleep when the phone rang theyd started on each other in the foyer worked their way up the steps halfway up theyd decided tactically that theyd made it far enough it made him grin to remember how shed torn at his clothes attacked him he thought smugly of course hed been a willing victim but shed shown surprising energy and amazing resilience he almost thought it a shame he hadnt dealt so satisfactorily with pike before he dismissed all thoughts of pike as he settled back pleasantly aroused when deanna curled her body against his he wouldnt wake her though it was very tempting to do so he was too relieved that she no longer tossed and turned or awakened quaking as she had for several nights after angelas murder instead he simply enjoyed the way her body fit to his he swore when the phone rang and she woke take it easy like deanna he expected to hear nothing but breathing when he lifted the receiver finn its joe joe he saw the tension dissolve from deannas shoulders i guess it would be pointless to mention its after one am got a tip for you pal i was whiling away some time with leno and monitoring my police scanner we had us a murder over at lincoln park im not on the crime beat i checked it out finn figured youd want to know right away instead of catching it on the early news it was pike you know the shrink who hassled dee today somebody did him finns gaze cut to deannas how the same way as angela in the face my police connection wouldnt give me much but he bought it right on his own doorstep a neighbor reported hearing gunshots around midnight a black andwhite checked it out and found him im calling from the cop shop weve got a unit on it storyll break top of the hour on sunrise thanks i figured dee would take it better from you yeah keep me posted you bet he hung up dispirited somethings wrong she could see it in his face in the way the air had seemed to thicken around him just tell me straight out finn okay he covered her hands with his marshall pikes been murdered her hands jerked once then went still how he was shot she already knew but had to ask the same as angela it was the same as angela wasnt it it looks that way she made a strangled sound in her throat but eased back when he reached for her im all right we need to tell the police about what happened after work today it has to be connected its possible dont circle around it she snapped out and pushed off the bed marshall harassed me today and we went over there hours later hes shot we cant pretend that one had nothing to do with the other and if it is connected what can you do whatever i can she dragged a sweater over her head snatched trousers from the closet even though i didnt pull the trigger i am the cause and there has to be something i can do she didnt resist when he put his arms around her but clung to him pressing her face to his shoulder i have to do something finn i cant bear it otherwise well go see jenner he cupped her face in his hands kissed her well figure something out okay she finished dressing in silence she was sure he wouldnt feel guilty about facing down marshall only hours before because he would see what he had done as pure and simple justice and perhaps he was right is that what whoever had leveled a gun at marshalls face had thought as well the idea sickened her ill wait downstairs she said as he pulled out his boots she saw the envelope before she reached the bottom landing it lay crisp and white against the glossy floor of the foyer inches inside the door there was a quick pain a twist in the gut like a fist punching muscle then she went numb crossing the polished wood bending down she opened the envelope as finn came down behind her goddamn it he took it from her limp fingers and read hell never hurt you again when they left the house someone was watching a heart bursting with love and need and terrible grief killing for her had been nothing it had been done before and needed to be done again perhaps she would see at last chapter twentyseven jeff stood in the control booth overlooking the studio biting his lip in agitation deanna was about to film her first show since angelas death camera three on dee he barked out orders take two zoom out wider on one pan give me dee tight three music in great great applause start the playback tape he applauded himself as did the others in the booth from their perch overlooking the stage they could see the audience surge to its feet and cheer ride it jeff ordered oh yeah he thought sharing the triumph shes back ride the applause down below deanna stood on the new set with its jewel tones and banks of cheery holly bushes and let the waves of applause wash over her it was she knew a show of support a welcoming home when her eyes filled she didnt bother to blink back the tears she didnt think about it thanks she let out a long unsteady breath its really good to be back i she trailed off while she scanned the crowd there were familiar faces dotted among the strangers faces from the newsroom from production pleasure glowed on her face its really good to see you before we get rolling id like to thank you all for your letters and phone calls over the past week your support has helped me and everyone involved with the show through a difficult time and that she thought was all the space she could give would give to the past now id like to bring out a woman whos given us all so many hours of entertainment shes incandescent luminous with a talent as golden as her eyes according to newsweek kate lowell can ignite the screen with a sweep of the eyelash by the flash of her signature smile shes proven both her popular and her critical appeal by holding the numberone boxoffice position for two straight years and by winning an oscar for her portrayal of the heroic unforgettable tess in deception ladies and gentlemen kate lowell again the applause erupted kate swept into it looking confident and fresh and every bit the star but when deanna took her hand she found it cold and trembling deliberately deanna wrapped her in an embrace dont do anything youre not ready to do she murmured in kates ear im not going to push you into any revelations kate hesitated a moment oh god im glad youre here dee lets sit down okay my knees are shaking it wasnt an easy show from any angle deanna was able to guide the first ten minutes through juicy hollywood chitchat keeping the audience amused to the point where she assumed kate had changed her mind about the announcement i like playing women of strength and character in a fluid movement that rustled silk kate crossed her long milliondollar legs and there do seem to be more scripts being written for strong women women who are not just bystanders but who have beliefs and standards theyre willing to fight for im grateful for the chance to play those women because i didnt always fight for what i wanted so you feel as though youre able to do that now through your work i relate to many of the characters ive played tess in particular because she was a woman who sacrificed everything risked everything for the sake of her child in an odd sort of way i mirrored tess mirror images are opposites and i sacrificed my child my chance with my child when i gave it up for adoption ten years ago damn in the control booth jeffs eyes popped wide the audience had dropped into stunned silence damn he said again camera two tight on kate man oh man but even as he worriedly bit his lip again he focused on deannas face shed known he realized and let out a long calming breath shed known an unplanned pregnancy at any time under any circumstances is frightening deanna wanted her audience to remember that how old were you i was seventeen i had as you know dee a supportive family a good home id just begun my modeling career and i thought the world was at my feet then i discovered i was pregnant the father do you want to talk about him was a nice sweet boy who was every bit as terrified as i he was my first she smiled a little now remembering him i was his we were dazzled by each other by what we felt for each other when i told him we just sat there numb we were in la and wed gone to the beach we sat there and watched the surf he offered to marry me some people might feel that would have been the answer you didnt not for me or the boy or the child kate continued using all of her skill to keep her voice level do you remember the way we used to talk about what we wanted to do when we grew up yes i do deanna linked her fingers with kates you never had any doubts id always wanted to be an actress id made some progress modeling and i was going to conquer hollywood come hell or high water then i was pregnant did you consider abortion discuss the option with the father with your family yes i did as difficult as it was dee i remember how supportive my parents were id hurt them disappointed them i didnt realize how much until i was older and had some perspective but they never wavered i cant explain to you why i decided the way i did it was a purely emotional decision but i think my parents unflagging support helped me make it i decided to have the baby and give it away and i didnt know not until it came time to do just that how hard it would be do you know who adopted the baby no kate dashed a tear away no i didnt want to know id made a deal i had chosen to give the child to people who would love and care for it and it wasnt my baby any longer but theirs she would be ten years old now nearly eleven eyes swimming she looked toward the camera i hope shes happy i hope she doesnt hate me thousands of women face what you faced each choice they make is theirs to make however difficult it is i think one of the reasons you play admirable accessible women so well is that youve been through the hardest test a woman can face when i played tess i wondered how everything would have worked out if id chosen differently ill never know do you regret your choice a part of me always will regret i couldnt be a mother to that child but i think ive finally realized after all these years that it really was the right one for everybody well be back in a moment deanna said to the camera then turned to kate are you all right barely i didnt think it would be so hard she took two deep breaths but kept her eyes on deanna rather than look out at the audience the questions are going to come fast and furious and god the press tomorrow youll get through it yes i will dee she leaned forward and gripped deannas hand it meant a lot to me to be able to do this here with you it seemed for a minute or two as if i were just talking to you the way we used to then maybe this time youll keep in touch yeah i will you know i realized while i was talking why i hated angela so much i thought it was because she was using me but it was because she was using my baby it helps knowing that hell of a show fran fisted her hands on her hips as deanna walked into the dressing room you knew i could tell you knew why the hell didnt you tell me me your producer and your best friend because i wasnt sure shed go through with it the strain of the past hour had deannas shoulders aching rolling them in slow circles she went directly to the lighted mirror to change makeup fran was miffed she understood that expected it just as she understood and expected it would wear off quickly and i didnt feel it was right to talk about it until she did give me a gauge on audience reaction fran after the shock waves died off id say about sixtyfive percent were in her corner maybe ten percent never got past the stunned stage and the remaining twentyfive were ticked off that their princess stumbled thats about how i figured it not bad deanna slathered her face with moisturizer shell be all right she lifted a brow at frans reflection where do you stand after a moment of stilted silence fran exhaled hard fluttering her choppy bangs in her corner one hundred percent it must have been hell for her poor kid god dee what made her decide to go public that way it all has to do with angela deanna began and told her blackmail too intrigued now for even mild annoyance fran let out a low whistle i knew she was a bitch but i never thought shed sunk that low i guess the list of suspects just expanded by several dozen her eyes widened you dont think kate no i dont not that she hadnt considered it thoroughly deanna thought logically and she hoped objectively even if i thought she killed angela which i dont she doesnt have any reason to have killed marshall she didnt even know him i guess not i wish the cops would figure it out and lock this lunatic up it worries me sick that youre still getting those notes now that all was forgiven she moved over automatically massaging deannas stiff shoulders at least i can rest easier knowing finn wont be going out of town until this is over how do you know that because fran caught herself looked quickly at her watch gosh what am i doing sitting around here talking ive got a hundred things fran deanna stood and stepped in front of her how do you know that finns not going out of town until this is over the last i heard he was scheduled to go to rome right after christmas i ah i must have gotten mixed up like hell damn it dee dont get that warrior look on your face how do you know because he told me okay she tossed up her hands in disgust and i was supposed to keep my big mouth shut about the fact that hes canceled the rome shoot and anything else that takes him out of chicago i see deanna lowered her eyes brushed a speck of lint from her teal silk skirt no you dont see because youve got your blinders on do you really expect the man to fly gleefully across the atlantic while this is going on for christs sake he loves you im aware of that but her spine was rigid i have things to do myself she said and stormed out good going myers muttering oaths fran snatched up the dressing room phone and called up to finns office if shed inadvertently started a war the least she could do was tell him to be fully armed in his office above the newsroom finn replaced the receiver and sent a scowl at barlow james youre about to get some reinforcements deannas on her way up fine pleased barlow settled back in his chair stretched his burly arms well get all this settled once and for all it is settled barlow im not traveling more than an hour away from home until the police make an arrest finn i understand your concerns for deanna i have them as well but youre shortsheeting the show youre overreacting really finns voice was cool deceptively so and i thought i was taking two murders and the harassment of the woman i love so well sarcasm didnt deflate barlow my point is that she can obtain roundtheclock protection professionals god knows a woman in her financial position can afford the very best not to slight your manhood finn but youre a reporter not a bodyguard and he continued before finn could respond as skilled a reporter as you are you are not a detective let the police do their job and you do yours you have a responsibility to the show to the people who work with you to the network to the sponsors you have a contract finn youre legally bound to travel whenever and wherever news is breaking you agreed to those terms hell you demanded them sue me finn invited eyes gleaming in anticipation of a bout he glanced up as the door slammed open she stood there in her snazzy silk suit eyes flashing chin angled each stride a challenge she marched to his desk slapped her palms on the surface i wont have it he didnt bother to pretend he didnt understand you dont have any say in this deanna its my choice you werent even going to tell me you were just going to make some lame excuse about why the trip was canceled youd have lied to me hed have killed for her he thought and shrugged now thats not necessary he leaned back in the chair steepled his fingers though he was wearing a sweater and jeans he looked every inch the star how did the show go this morning stop it just stop it she whirled jabbing a finger at barlow you can order him to go cant you i thought i could he lifted his hands let them fall i came from new york hoping to make him see reason i should have known better with a sigh he rose ill be in the newsroom for the next hour or so if you fare any better than i did let me know finn waited until the door clicked shut the sound was as definitive as that of the bell in a boxing ring you wont deanna so you might as well accept it i want you to go she said spacing each word carefully i dont want our lives to be interfered with its important to me youre important to me then do this for me he picked up a pencil ran it through his fingers once twice then snapped it neatly in two no your career could be on the line he tilted his head as if considering it and damn him his dimples winked at her i dont think so he was she thought as sturdy as unshakable and as unmovable as granite they could cancel your show throw out the baby with the bathwater though he wasnt feeling particularly calm he levered back propped his feet on the desk ive known network execs to do dumber things so lets say they decide to cancel a highly rated profitable and awardwinning show because im not going on the road for a while he stared up at her his eyes darkly amused i guess youd have to support me while im unemployed i might get to like it and retire completely take up gardening or golf no i know ill be your business manager youd be the star you know like a country western singer this isnt a joke finn it isnt a tragedy either his phone rang finn picked up the receiver said later and hung up again im sticking deanna i cant keep up with the investigation if im off in europe why do you need to keep up with it her eyes narrowed is that what youve been doing why there was a rerun last tuesday night all those calls from jenner youre not working on in depth youre working with him he doesnt have a problem with it why should you she spun away i hate this i hate that our private and professional lives are becoming mixed and unbalanced i hate being scared this way jumping every time theres a noise in the hall or bracing whenever the elevator door opens thats my point thats exactly how i feel come here he held out a hand gripping hers when she walked around the desk with his eyes on hers he drew her into his lap im scared deanna right down to the bone her lips parted in surprise you never said so maybe i should have male prides a twitchy business the fact is i need to be here i need to be involved to know whats happening its the only way ive got to fight back the fear just promise me you wont take any chances any risks hes not going after me deanna i want to be sure of that she closed her eyes but she wasnt sure after deanna left finn went down to the video vault an idea had been niggling at him since marshalls murder the notion that hed forgotten something or overlooked it all barlows talk about responsibili ties loyalties had triggered a memory finn skimmed through the black forest of video cases until he found february he slipped the cassette into the machine fastforwarding through news reports local world weather sports he wasnt sure of the precise date or how much coverage there had been but he was certain lew mcationeils previous chicago connection would have warranted at least one full report on his murder he got more than hed hoped for finn slowed the tape to normal eyes narrowing as he focused in on the cbc reporter standing on the snowy sidewalk violence struck in the early morning hours in this affluent new york neighborhood lewis mcationeil senior producer of the popular talk show angelas was gunned down outside his home in brooklyn heights this morning according to a police source mcationeil a chicago native was apparently leaving for work when he was shot at close range mcationeils wife was in the house the camera did its slow pan she was awakened shortly after seven am by the sound of a gunshot finn listened to the rest of the report eyes fixed grimly he zipped through another week of news gathering snippets on the mcationeil murder investigation he tucked his notes away and headed into the newsroom he found joe as the cameraman was heading out on assignment question make it a quick one im on the clock february ninetytwo lew mcationeils murder that was your camerawork on the new york standup wasnt it what can i say joe polished his nails on his sweatshirt my art is distinctive right where was he shot as i recall right outside his house as he thought back joe reached into his hip pocket for a baby ruth yeah they said it looked like he was cleaning off his car no i mean anatomically chest gut head none of the reports i reviewed said oh joe frowned shutting his eyes as if to bring the scene back to mind theyd cleaned up pretty good by the time we got there never saw the stiff he opened his eyes did you know lew some yeah me too tough he bit off a hefty section of chocolate why the interest something im working on didnt your reporter ask the cops for details who was that clemente right didnt last around here very long sloppy you know i cant say if he did or not look ive got to split he headed for the stairs then rapped his knuckles on the side of his head yeah yeah he headed up the steps backward watching finn seems to me i heard one of the other reporters talking he said lew caught the bullet in the face nasty huh yeah a grim satisfaction swam through finns blood very nasty jenner munched a midmorning danish washing down the cherry filling with sweetened coffee as he ate and sipped he studied the grisly photos tacked to the corkboard the conference room was quiet now but hed left the blinds open on the glass door that separated it from the bull pen of the precinct angela perkins marshall pike he stared at what had been done to them if he stared long enough he knew he could go into a kind of trance a state of mind that left the brain clear for ideas for possibilities he was just annoyed enough at finn for emotion to interfere with intellect the man should have told him the details of his conversation with pike however slight it had been it had been police business the idea of finn interviewing pike alone burned jenner more bitterly than the station house coffee he remembered their last meeting in the early hours of the morning that pike had been murdered were clear that the shooter knows miss reynolds jenner ticked the fact off on a finger was aware of her relationship or at least her argument with pike he held up a second finger he or she knows deannas address knew pikes and had enough knowledge of the studio to set up the camera after killing angela perkins agreed the notes have shown up under deannas door on her desk in her car in the apartment she still keeps in old town jenner had lifted a brow hoping that finn would offer some explanation for that interesting fact but he hadnt finn knew how to keep information to himself it was one of the things jenner admired about him it has to be someone who works at cbc jenner concluded agreed in theory finn smiled when jenner let out a huff of breath it could be someone who worked there its possible its a fan of deannas whos been in the studio a regular audience member lots of people have enough rudimentary knowledge of television to work a camera for a still shot i think thats stretching it so lets stretch it he sees her every day on tv could be a woman finn let that cook a moment then shook his head a remote possibility lets shuffle that aside for a minute and try out this theory its a man a lonely frustrated man he lives alone but every day deanna slips through the television screen right into his living room shes sitting right there with him talking to him smiling at him hes not lonely when shes there and he wants her there all the time he doesnt do well with women hes a little afraid of them hes a good planner probably holds down a decent job a responsible one because he knows how to think things through hes thorough meticulous impressed jenner pursed his lips sounds like youve done your homework i have because im in love with deanna i think i understand him thing is hes got this temper this rage he didnt kill in a rage i think he did that coolly and that was what chilled finns blood but he trashes my house deannas office he writes his feelings of betrayal on the wall all but splatters them there how did she betray him what changed from the time she got the first note to angelas murder she hooked up with you shed been involved with me for two years finn leaned forward we got engaged jenner the official announcement had barely hit the streets when we had angelas murder and the breakins so he killed angela because he was ticked at deanna reynolds he killed angela and pike because he loves deanna reynolds what better way to show his devotion than to remove people who upset or annoy her he trashed her things taking special care with the weddinggown sketches the newspaper reports of the engagement photographs of deanna and me he was enraged because shed announced publicly that she preferred another man to him that she was willing to take vows to prove it nodding slowly jenner doodled on a sheet of paper maybe you didnt get your psychiatrists degree at sears why hasnt he gone after you instinctively finn reached up to run his fingers over his sleeve beneath it was a scar from a bullet a bullet that hadnt come from the sniper or the swat team but he couldnt be sure because i havent done anything to hurt deanna marshall did on the day he was killed and a couple of years ago when he fell into angelas trap i should have talked to him jenner tapped a fist lightly on his files he could have known something seen something its possible hed received threats i doubt that he was the type whod have come running to the cops or he would have told me when i talked with him you were too busy beating him up i didnt beat him up finn folded his arms across his chest he swung i swung once in any case i meant he would have told me when i talked to him at his office a few days ago jenner stopped doodling you went to see him about angela perkinss murder it was a theory one you didnt feel necessary to share it was personal nothings personal on this nothing jenner edged forward eyes narrowed ive let you in on this investigation because i think youre a smart man and i sympathize with your position but you cross me and youre out ill do what i have to do lieutenant with or without you reporters arent the only ones who can harass keep that in mind jenner closed his file rose now i have work to do no jenner thought now sympathy and admiration aside he wasnt about to let finn go off on his own he might be wearing blinders to the fact that his life was in danger but jenner knew better he rose to refill his coffee cup and glanced through the glass door speak of the devil he murmured jenner pulled open the door looking for me he asked finn and waved away the uniform who was blocking finns path its all right officer ill see mr riley he nodded briefly at finn youve got five minutes its going to take a little longer finn studied the police photos on the board dispassionately there were snapshots of both victims taken prior to and after death side by side they were like beforeandafter shots gone desperately wrong youre going to need to put one more set up there twenty minutes later jenner completed his conversation with the detective in brooklyn heights theyre faxing us the file he told finn okay mr riley who knew that mcationeil was passing information on to angela deannas staff id be certain of that id also give odds that it would have leaked downstairs there was an excitement brewing in him now the kind he recognized as energy from a puzzle nearly solved theres always been a lot of interaction between deannas people and the newsroom are we on the same wavelength here three people are dead because they threatened deanna in some way i cant comment about that mr riley finn shoved back from the table damn it im not here as a reporter im not looking for a scoop the latest tidbit from an unnamed police source you want to frisk me for a mike i dont think youre after a story mr riley jenner said calmly if id ever thought that you never would have gotten your foot in the door but maybe i think youre too used to doing things your own way to running your own show to handle the delicate matter of cooperation finn slammed his hands down on the table if you think youre going to brush me off youre wrong youre right about the harassment lieutenant one phone call and i can have a dozen cameras dogging your every move i can put so much pressure on you that you wont be able to sneeze without someone sticking a mike up your nose before you catch your next breath chicago will be buzzing about a serial killer the commissioner and the mayor will love that wont they he waited half a beat you use me or ill use you its your choice jenner folded his arms on the table leaned forward against them i dont like threats neither do i but ill do a lot more than threaten if you try to block me out now he looked at the victims on the board he could lose it he spoke quietly now carefully he could lose it anytime and try to put her up there youre pissed because i did some tracking on my own fine be pissed but use me or by god ill use you objectively jenner buried his irritation calculating how much damage would be done by a media war too much he mused it was always too much lets do this mr riley lets say we theorize that mcationeil was the first victim of three and well want to keep that under our hat i told you im not interested in a story just laying down the ground rules well theorize that and that only a limited number of people had the knowledge that would lead to motive for his murder he gestured to a chair waiting for finn to sit again tell me about those people start with loren bach in the spirit of compromise jenner opened the file on loren that angela had commissioned from beeker cassie walked into deannas office then let out a long long sigh deanna stood on a stool in the center of the room the seamstress at her feet yards of shimmering white silk billowed its gorgeous its barely started but deanna was almost sighing herself as she brushed a hand over the sweeping skirt neatly pinned to the lacy bodice irish lace she mused for finn but youre right ive got to get my camera inspired cassie bolted for the door dont move im not going anywhere you must be still the seamstress complained over a mouthful of pins her voice was raspy as if shed already swallowed more than her share deanna used all her willpower not to shift from foot to foot i am being still youre vibrating like a spring sorry deanna took a long steadying breath i guess im nervous the bridetobe cassie recited as she walked back in with a palmcorder blocking her face deanna reynolds the reigning queen of daytime tv has chosen an elegant gown of italian silk the seamstress prompted with touches of irish lace and a sea of freshwater pearls exquisite cassie said soberly and tell us miss reynolds with an experts touch she zoomed in on deannas face how do you feel on this exciting occasion terrified she crossed her eyes if the fitting took five minutes over the allotted hour shed be making up time all week and partially insane other than that im enjoying every minute of it if youll just stand perfectly still ill do a little circle around so that our viewers can get the full effect cassie sidestepped panned back thisll go in my growing library of life behind deannas hour deanna felt her smile stiffen do you have a lot of tape oh a little of this a little of that simon pulling whats left of his hair out margaret tossing spitballs you racing for the elevator beneath the sparkling bodice deannas heart thudded thickly i guess ive never paid much attention so many cameras around you always keep that at hand dont you you never know what historical or humiliating moment you might capture someone had captured her deanna remembered while shed slept at her desk coming to work going from shopping playing with frans baby in the park theyd captured her unconscious in the studio beside angelas body cassie who was in and out of the office dozens of times a day cassie who knew every detail of deannas schedule cassie who had dated one of the studio camera operators turn it off cassie one more second turn it off her voice sharpened and deanna set her teeth to steady it sorry obviously baffled cassie lowered the camera i guess i got carried away its all right im just edgy deanna managed to smile again it was ridiculous she told herself it was insane even to speculate that cassie would be capable of murder its your first day back cassie touched her hand and deanna had to force herself not to jerk away god knows it was a madhouse around here after the show with all those calls coming in about kate lowell why dont you give yourself a break after youve finished the fitting and go home i can reschedule the rest of the afternoons business i think thats a good idea she spoke slowly over the erratic thud of her heart ive got a lot of things to deal with at home cassies mouth thinned i didnt mean you should jump out of one madhouse into another youre not going to get any work done there with all those painters and carpenters slogging away i think she saw that deannas eyes had focused behind her and turned jeff her mouth softened at the admiration on his face she looks fabulous doesnt she yeah really he glanced at the camera cassie held you got pictures sure capture the moment listen unless its a crisis hold it off will you this is a momentous occasion dees going home early oh good idea finn called deanna he said to tell you he had a meeting and hed see you at home he thought he might get there by four well thats lucky maybe ill beat him there not if you dont hold still the seamstress muttered but it was barely threethirty when deanna slipped into her shoes and grabbed her briefcase cassie can you call tim already done he should be waiting downstairs thanks she stopped by the desk feeling ashamed and foolish about her earlier thoughts im sorry about before cassie the camera business dont worry about it cassie zipped open one of the daily letters that heaped on her desk i know im a nuisance she chuckled i like being a nuisance with it see you tomorrow okay dont stay late more at ease deanna walked to the elevator checking her watch as she punched the down button with any luck she could surprise finn by arriving first it wouldnt take much effort she knew to persuade him to fix some blackened chicken and pasta she was in the mood for something spicy to cap off her first day back in harness she could deal with a mountain of paperwork and phone calls there then if she scheduled a break she could slink into something designed to drive finn crazy theyd have dinner late very late she decided and swung out of the elevator maybe shed wrap a few lastminute christmas gifts or talk finn into baking some cookies she could run a couple of the new segment ideas by him the flash of sunlight had her reaching automatically for her tinted glasses slipping them on she climbed into the back of the waiting limo hi tim she closed her eyes and stretched the limo was beautifully warm hi miss reynolds turned out to be a beautiful day out of habit she reached for the bottle of chilled juice that was always stocked for her she looked up idly at the back of her driver despite the cars warmth he was huddled inside his coat his cap tipped low sure did sipping the juice she flipped open her briefcase she set the file neatly labeled wedding plans aside and reached for the daily correspondence cassie had culled for her to read shed always considered the drive to and from the office part of the workday in this case she had to make up the time shed taken with the fitting and for knocking off early but by the third letter the words were blurring there was no excuse for being so tired so early in the day annoyed she slid her fingers under her glasses to rub her eyes clear but they blurred all the more as if shed swabbed them with oil her head spun once sickly and her arm fell heavily to the seat beside her so tired she thought so hot as if in slow motion she tried to shrug out of her coat the papers fluttered to the floor and the effort of reaching for them only increased the dizziness tim she leaned forward pressed a hand against the back of the front seat he didnt answer but the word had sounded dim and far away to her own ears as she struggled to focus on him the half empty bottle of juice slipped from her numbed fingers somethings wrong she tried to tell him as she slid bonelessly to the plushly carpeted floor of the car somethings very wrong but he didnt answer she imagined herself falling through the floor of the limo and into a dark bottomless pit chapter twentyeight deanna dreamed she was swimming up through redtinted clouds slowly sluggishly pulling herself toward the surface where a faint white light glowed through the misty layers she moaned as she struggled not from pain but nausea that rolled up burning in her throat in defense she kept her eyes closed taking long deep breaths and willing the sickness back drops of clammy sweat pearled on her skin so that her thin silk blouse clung nastily to her arms and back when the worst had passed she opened her eyes cautiously she had been in the car she remembered tim had been driving her home and shed become ill but she wasnt home now hospital she wondered dully when she let her eyes cautiously open the room was softly lit with delicate violets trailing up the wallpaper a white ceiling fan gently stirred the air with a whispering sound of blades a glossy mahogany bureau held a collection of pretty colored bottles and pots a magnificent poinsettia and a miniature blue spruce decorated with silver bells added seasonal flair hospital she thought again groggily she tried to sit up her head spun again hideously shooting that fist of nausea back into her stomach her vision doubled when she tried to bring her hand to her face it felt weighted down for a moment she could only lie still fighting back the sickness she saw that the room was a box a closed windowless box like a coffin a spear of panic sliced through the shock she reared up shouting stumbling drunkenly from the bed staggering to a wall she ran her fingers over the delicate floral wallpaper in a dizzy search for an opening trapped she wheeled around eyes wide trapped she saw then what was on the wall over the bed it was enough to crush the bubbling hysteria a huge photograph smiled sassily down at her for several stunned moments deanna stared at deanna slowly with the sound of her own heartbeat thudding in her ears she scanned the rest of the room no there were no doors no windows just flowers bowers of them wall to wall but there were other photographs dozens of pictures of her were lined on the side walls candid shots magazine covers press photos stood cheek by jowl against the dainty wallpaper oh god oh god she heard the whimpering panic in her own voice and bit down fiercely on her lip looking away from her own images her eyes glassy with shock she stared at the refectory table its snowy white runner stiff with starch as a backdrop for silver candle holders glossy white tapers dozens of little treasures had been arranged there an earring shed lost months before a tube of lipstick a silk scarf simon had given her one christmas a glove of supple red leather one of a pair that had disappeared the winter before there was more she eased closer straining against the tidal wave of fear as she studied the collection a memo shed handwritten to jeff a lock of ebony hair wrapped in gold cord other photographs of her always of her in elegant and ornate frames the shoes shed been wearing in the limo were there as well along with her jacket neatly folded the place was like a shrine she realized with a shudder the sound in her throat was feral and frightened there was a television in the corner a shelf of leatherbound albums and most terrifying cameras bracketed the upper corners of the room the pinpoints of their red lights beamed like tiny eyes she stumbled back fear soaring like a slickly coated bird her gaze sliced from one camera to the other youre watching me she fought back the terror in her voice i know you are you cant keep me here theyll look you know theyll find me theyre probably looking already she looked down at her wrist to check the time but saw that her watch was gone how long she wondered frantically it might have been minutes or days since shed passed out in the car the car her breath began to hitch tim she pressed her lips together until the ache snapped through the need to weep tim you have to let me go ill try to help you i promise that ill do whatever i can please come in here talk to me as though only her invitation had been required a section of the wall slid open in reflex deanna surged forward only to bite back a moan of despair as her head spun in sickening circles from the drug still she straightened her shoulders and hoped that she hid the worst of her fear tim she began then only stared in confusion welcome home deanna his face flushed with shy pleasure jeff stepped into the room he carried a silver tray on which rode a wineglass a china plate of herbed pasta and a single red rosebud i hope you like the room in his unhurried and efficient way he set the tray on the bureau it took a long time for me to get it just right i didnt want you to be just comfortable i wanted you to be happy i know theres no view he turned toward her eyes too bright though apology quavered in his voice but its safer this way no one will bother us when were in here jeff calm she ordered herself she had to stay calm you cant keep me here yes i can ive planned it all carefully ive had years to work it out why dont you sit down dee youre probably feeling a little groggy and i want you to be comfortable while you eat he stepped forward and though she braced he didnt touch her later he continued after you understand everything youll feel a lot better you just need time he lifted a hand as if to touch her cheek but drew it away again as if he didnt want to frighten her please try to relax you never let yourself relax i know you might be a little afraid right now but its going to be all right if you fight me ill have to because he couldnt bear to say the words he slipped a hypo out of his pocket i dont want to her instant recoil had him pushing the needle out of sight again really i dont and you wouldnt be able to get away smiling again he moved a table and chair closer to the bed you need to eat he said pleasantly you always worried me when it came to taking care of yourself all those hurried or skipped meals but ill take good care of you sit down deanna she could refuse she thought she could scream and rant and threaten and for what shed known jeff or thought shed known him for years he could be stubborn she reminded herself but shed always been able to reason with him i am hungry she told him and hoped her stomach wouldnt rebel youll talk to me while i eat explain things to me she gave him her best interviewers smile yes the smile burned across his face like a fever i thought you might be angry at first im not angry im afraid id never hurt you he took one of her limp hands in his and squeezed lightly i wont let anyone hurt you i know you might be thinking about getting past me deanna getting through the panel but you cant im really very strong and youre still weak from the drug no matter what you do youll still be locked in sit down as if in a dream she did as he told her she wanted to run but even as the thought communicated from brain to body her legs folded how could she run when she could barely stand the drug was still in charge of her system it was precisely the kind of detail he would have thought of precisely the kind of detail that had made him such an invaluable part of her team its wrong to keep me here jeff no its not he set the tray on the table in front of her ive thought about it for a long long time and this is for the best for you im always thinking of you later on we can travel together ive been looking into villas in the south of france i think youd like it there he touched her then just a brushing caress on her shoulder beneath her blouse her skin crawled i love you so much why didnt you ever tell me you could have talked to me about the way you felt i couldnt at first i thought it was just because i was shy but then i realized that it was all like a plan a life plan yours and mine anxious to explain he pulled up another chair as he leaned forward his glasses slid down his nose while her vision blurred then cleared she watched him shove them up again an old habit once an endearing one that now chilled her blood there were things you needed to do experiences and men you had to get out of your system before we could be together i understood that dee i never blamed you for finn it hurt me resting his hands on his knees he let out a sigh but i didnt blame you and i couldnt blame him his face brightened again how could i when i knew how perfect you were the first time i saw you on tv i couldnt get my breath it scared me a little you were looking right at me into me ill never forget it you see i was so lonely before an only child i grew up in this house youre not eating deanna i wish you would obediently she picked up her fork he wanted to talk seemed eager to the best way to escape she calculated was to understand you told me you grew up in iowa thats where my mother took me later my mother was wild the apology crept back into his voice she would never listen to anyone never obey the rules so naturally uncle matthew had to punish her he was older you see he was head of the family hed keep her in this room trying to make her see that there were proper ways to do things and improper ways his face changed as he spoke tightening around the mouth and eyes growing somehow older sterner but my mother never learned no matter how hard my uncle tried to teach her she ran away and got pregnant when i was six they took her away she had a breakdown and i came to live with uncle matthew there was no one else to take me in you see and it was his family duty deanna choked down a bite of pasta it stuck like paste in her throat but she was afraid to try the wine he could have drugged it she thought like the bottle of juice im sorry jeff about your mother its okay he shrugged it off like a snake shedding skin his face smoothed out again like a sheet stroked with careful hands she didnt love me no ones ever loved me but uncle matthew and you its just wine dee your favorite kind grinning at the joke he picked up the glass and sipped to show her i didnt put anything in it i didnt have to because youre here now with me drugged or not she avoided the wine unsure how it would mix with the drugs in her system what happened to your mother she had dementia she died is your dinner all right i know pastas your favorite its fine deanna slipped another bite through her stiff lips how old were you when she died i dont know doesnt matter i was happy here with my uncle it made him nervous to talk about his mother so he didnt he was a great man strong and good he hardly ever had to punish me because i was good too i wasnt a trial to him like my mother was we took care of each other he spoke quickly now fresh excitement blooming he was proud of me i studied hard and i didnt hang out with other kids i didnt need them i mean all they wanted to do was ride in fast cars and listen to loud music and fight with their parents i had respect and i never forgot things like cleaning my room or brushing my teeth uncle matthew always told me i didnt need anybody but family and he was the only family i had then when he died there was you so i knew it was right jeff deanna used all her skills to keep the conversation flowing to steer it in the direction she wanted do you think your uncle would approve of what youre doing now oh absolutely he beamed his face sunny and innocent and terrifying he talks to me all the time up here he tapped his head winked he told me to be patient to wait until the time was right you know when i first started sending you letters yes i remember i dreamed about uncle matthew for the first time then only it wasnt like a dream it was so real he told me i had to court you the way a gentleman would that i had to be patient he always said that good things take time he told me that i would have to wait and that i had to look out for you men are supposed to cherish their women to protect them people have forgotten that no one seems to cherish anyone anymore is that why you killed angela jeff to protect me i planned that for months he leaned back again rested one bent leg across his knee conversations with deanna had always been a high point of his life and this he thought was the very best you didnt know that i let her think i was taking lews place lews lew mcationeils after i killed him lew her fork rattled against the china when it slipped through her fingers you killed lew he betrayed you i had to punish him and he used simon until i started to work with you i never really had friends simons my friend i was going to kill him too but i realized hed been used it wasnt really his fault was it no she said it quickly punctuating the word by laying her hand over jeffs no jeff it wasnt simons fault i care very much about simon i wouldnt want you to hurt him thats what i thought he grinned a child praised by an indulgent adult you see i know you so well deanna i know everything about you your family your friends your favorite foods and colors where you like to shop i know everything youre thinking its as though i were right inside your head or youre inside mine he added slowly sometimes id think you were inside mine i knew you wanted angela to go away and i knew youd never hurt her yourself youre too gentle too kind he turned his hand over to squeeze hers so i did it for you i arranged to meet her in the parking lot at cbc she sent her driver away just like id told her to i let her in took her down to the studio id told her that i had copied papers from the office story ideas guests plans for remotes she was going to buy them from me only she didnt tell me you were coming incredibly his bottom lip poked out in a pout she lied to me about that you killed her and you turned the cameras on i was angry with you his mouth quivered his eyes lowered deanna gripped her fork again with some idea of using it as a weapon the effects of the drug were wearing off and she felt stronger she thought she could thank fear for that but his eyes lifted to hers and the searing light in them had her fingers going numb i knew it was wrong but i wanted to hurt you i nearly wanted to kill you you were going to marry him dee i could understand your sleeping with him weak flesh uncle matthew explained all about how sex can pervert and how weak people can be even you the hand that covered hers tightened tightened until bone rubbed bone so i understood and i was patient because i always knew youd come to me but you couldnt marry him you couldnt take vows i knew it was you when you opened the door i always know when its you i hit you i wanted to hit you again but i couldnt so i carried you to the chair and i put angela in the other one and turned on the camera i wanted you to see what id done for you id already been upstairs in your office he compressed his lips sighed and gently released her throbbing hand it was wrong of me to wreck your office i shouldnt have gone to finns house either im sorry he said it as though hed neglected to keep a luncheon appointment jeff have you ever told anyone about your feelings just my uncle when we talk in my head he was sure youd understand soon and come home with me and after i heard what that creep did to you in the parking lot i knew it was nearly time marshall he tried to hurt you joe told me how hed acted so i waited for him i killed him the same way id killed the others it was symbolic deanna my vision destroyed their vision its almost holy dont you think its not holy to kill jeff youre too forgiving his eyes scanned her face adoringly if you forgive people whove hurt you theyll only hurt you again you have to protect whats yours he remembered the dog that had come into their yard time after time digging up uncle matthews flowers spoiling the grass hed cried when his uncle had poisoned the dog cried until uncle matthew had explained to him why it was right and honorable to defend your own against any intruder with that in mind he got up and went to the bureau he opened the top drawer and took out a list ive planned it he told her you and i always make lists and plan things out were not the type who run off without thinking are we beaming again he offered the list to her lew mcneil angela perkins marshall pike dan gardner jamie thomas finn riley finn was all she could say hes not for sure i put him down in case he hurt you i nearly did it once before nearly but at the last minute i realized i was only going to kill him because i was jealous it was like uncle matthew was there and he jerked the rifle at the last minute i was really glad i didnt kill him when i saw how upset you were that hed been shot in greektown deanna said through trembling lips that day in greektown you shot him it was a mistake im really sorry oh god horrified she cringed back oh my god it was a mistake his voice was sulky dangerously so jeff looked away from her i said i was sorry i wont do anything to him unless he hurts you he hasnt he wont then i wont have to do anything about him her palm dampened against the paper and her heart began to beat heavily in her throat promise me you wont jeff its important to me that finns safe hes been very good to me im better for you there was a childs petulance on his face now deanna exploited the moment promise me jeff or ill be very unhappy you dont want that do you no he struggled between her needs and his own i guess it doesnt matter now not now that youre here you have to promise she clamped her teeth together to keep the desperation from her voice reason she told herself calm reason i know you wouldnt break your word to me all right if it makes you happy to show his sincerity he took out a pen and scratched finns name off the list see thank you and dan gardner no his voice sharp he folded the page hes already hurt you dee hes said terrible things about you he helped angela try to ruin you he has to be punished but he doesnt matter jeff hes nothing calm she reminded herself calm but firm adult to child and jamie thomas that was years and years ago i dont care about them i do i care id have killed him first right away but he was in europe hiding out he said scornfully its not easy to get a weapon through customs so i was patient now he beamed hes back now you know hes in new hampshire ill be going there soon the drug was no longer making her ill but the nausea rolled greasily in her stomach i dont care about him about any of them jeff i dont want you to hurt them for me he turned his face away sulking i dont want to talk about this anymore i want you have to think about what i want too he shoved the list back in the drawer slammed it hard enough to rattle bottles im only thinking of you yes i know i know you are but if you go to new york to kill gardner or new hampshire for jamie ill be all alone here i dont want to be locked up alone jeff dont worry his tone gentled ive got plenty of time and ill be very careful im so glad youre here would you let me go outside please i need some air i cant not yet it isnt part of the plan he sat again leaning forward you need three months horror drained her blood you cant keep me locked up like this for three months its all right youll have everything you need books tv company ill rent movies for you cook your meals ive bought clothes for you he sprang up to slide open another panel see i spent weeks choosing just the right things he gestured inside to the closet full of slacks and dresses and jackets and theres shirts and sweaters nightclothes and underthings in the bureau over here he pushed open another hidden door the bathroom he flushed stared at his shoes there arent any cameras in there i swear i wouldnt spy on you in the bathroom i stocked your favorite bath oils and soaps your cosmetics youll have everything you need everything you need everything you need the words spun around and around in her head she couldnt keep the hitch out of her voice i dont want to be locked up im sorry thats the only thing i cant give you right now soon when youve really come to understand itll be different but anything else you want ill get for you whenever i have to leave youll be all right here the rooms secure soundproofed even if someone came into the house they wouldnt find you outside the door is a bookcase its really cool i designed it myself no one would ever guess there was a room in here so youll be safe and sound whenever im gone and when im busy around the house i can watch you he pointed toward the cameras so if you need me ill know theyll come and find me jeff sooner or later they wont understand you have to let me go no i have to keep you do you want to watch tv he crossed over picked up the remote from the nightstand we have full cable fighting back a hysterical laugh she pressed her fingers to her eyes no no not now you can watch whenever you want and the shelf is full of videos movies and tapes ive taken of you and the scrapbooks he bustled around the room an energetic host anxious to entertain ive kept them for you everything thats ever been written up on you is in here or theres the stereo i have all your favorite music theres a little refrigerator in the bathroom that i stocked with drinks and snacks jeff she could reel that bubble of panic swelling her hands shook as she stood youve gone to a lot of trouble i understand that and i understand that youve done what you thought you had to do but this is wrong youre keeping me prisoner no no no he came to her quickly grabbing her hands when she jerked back youre like the princess in the fairy tale and im protecting you im cherishing you its like youre under a spell dee one day youll wake up and ill be here and well be happy im not under a spell she yanked away fury simmering under fear like an exotic stew and im not a goddamn princess im a human being with the right to make my own choices you cant lock me up and expect me to be grateful because ive got bathroom privileges i knew youd be angry at first disappointment sighed through his voice as he reached down for her dinner dishes but youll calm down the hell i will she leaped at him striking out with her free hand the first blow glanced off his cheekbone china shattered on the floor and flew like bullets snarling she scrambled after a shard she screamed fighting like a madwoman as he wrestled her to the floor he was strong so much stronger than he looked with those long gangly arms he made no sound no sound at all simply clamped a hand painfully on her wrist until her fingers opened to release the makeshift weapon he dragged her to the bed stoically suffering her flailing feet and fists when she was pressed under him his erection hard against her thigh her terror doubled there were worse things than being locked in no she tried to buck him off her fingers fisting and unfisting while he clamped her hands over her head i want you deanna god i want you his fumbling kiss dampened her jaw the sensation of her body writhing beneath his had a red haze of need cloaking his vision her heart was chugging like a piston against his and her skin was soft as water hot as fire please please he was almost weeping as his mouth covered hers just let me touch you no sickened she turned her head control she grasped onto her only hope youd be no better than jamie youre hurting me jeff you have to stop hurting me tears tracked down his cheeks when he lifted his head im sorry deanna im so sorry its just that ive waited so long we wont make love until youre ready i swear it dont be afraid of me i am afraid he wouldnt rape her she realized and was almost ashamed that she was willing to settle for that you have me locked up youve told me no one can find me what if something happened to you i could die here nothings going to happen ive planned everything every detail i love you deanna and i know under it all you love me too youve shown me in hundreds of ways the way you smile at me the way you touch me or laugh the way youll catch my eye across the room you made me your director i cant begin to explain what that meant to me you trusted me to guide you you believed in me in us its not love i dont love you youre just not ready yet now you need to rest he braceleted her wrists in one hand fought the hypo free with the other no dont she twisted wrenched begged please dont i cant go anywhere youve said i cant get away you need to rest he said quietly and slid the needle under her skin ill watch out for you deanna her head lolled back and his tears fell to mix with hers he waited miserably until her struggles to fight off the drug ceased when her body went limp he clamped down on the urge to stroke his hands over it not until shes ready he reminded himself content to brush the dampness from her cheeks gently he shifted her onto the pillows and placed a chaste kiss on her brow his princess he thought studying her as she slept hed built her an ivory tower theyd live there together forever isnt she perfect uncle matthew isnt she beautiful youd have loved her too youd have known she was the one the only one he sighed uncle matthew wasnt speaking to him hed been wrong to allow sex to twist his plans hed have to be punished bread and water only for two days thats what his uncle would have done meekly he crouched down to clean up the broken dishes he tidied the room turned the lights down with one last longing glance at deanna he slipped out of the room shutting the panel silently i think it would be best if youd take miss reynolds home jenner rode up in the elevator with finn he still resented finns earlier pressuring but he covered it with quiet dignity id prefer that she was out of the office when we reinterrogate her staff the minute she finds out thats what you intend to do she wont budge pleased that matters seemed to be moving forward finn leaned against the wall ill do what i can to convince her to stay out of the way but thats the best i can offer deannas fiercely loyal she wont want to accept that one of her own people is involved she may have to jenner headed out of the car the moment the doors opened if she kicks up too much of a fuss we can take her people in to the station shell like that less you can try you dont know her the way i do lieutenant cassie he said as he walked into the reception area she in no baffled she stopped gathering the stacks of mail shed intended to post on the way home what are you doing here cassie drew jenner inclined his head wed like to ask you some more questions i wonder if you could get the rest of miss reynoldss staff together i i dont know whos still in the building finn why dont you buzz everyone he suggested and find deanna for me will you he wanted to get her out and quickly some instinct told him to hurry he intended to heed it tell her im in the mood to cook shes gone home she left right after you called i called he felt uneasy did deanna tell you i called no you left a message about a meeting and getting home early it came in during her fitting and she left as soon as she was done finn shoved open the door to deannas office took one quick scan did you take the message no i was in with her when it came in jeff took it his eyes were like blue ice when he turned back did he say he spoke to me yes i guess is something wrong fear began to gnaw through confusion cassies gaze darted from jenner to finn and back again is something wrong with deanna rather than answer finn grabbed the phone and punched in his home number two rings later he heard the answering machine click on with his teeth set he waited through the message deanna pick up if youre there pick up the phone damn it shed have to be home by now she left more than an hour ago finn whats going on what did jeff tell her that youd called just as i said why didnt you answer the phone i frightened and not knowing why she put a hand on the desk to keep her balance i didnt hear the phone i didnt hear it wheres jeff i dont know he but finn was already racing down the hall he burst into one room found simon in consultation with margaret hey finn dont bother to knock wheres jeff he wasnt feeling well he went home simon was rising from the desk as he spoke whats the problem finn though her hands were stiff with cold cassie tugged on finns sleeve i called for tim myself i talked to him he met her downstairs get him on the line now mr riley jenner spoke calmly as cassie rushed off to obey ive got a blackandwhite on its way to your house right now odds are miss reynolds wasnt answering the phone thats all what the hells going on simon demanded whats happened now tim doesnt answer his page cassie stood in the hallway a hand at her throat i got his machine on his home phone give me the address jenner said briskly chapter twentynine mr riley i know youre upset but youre going to have to let me handle this jenner stood on the sidewalk in front of jeffs suburban home aware he was only temporarily blocking finn from storming the door shes in there i know it not to belittle your instincts but we cant know that we only know that jeff hyatt delivered a message were going to check everything out jenner reminded him the same way we checked out the driver tim omalley who wasnt home finn ground out staring at the windows behind jenner and the company car wasnt in the lot and no ones seen omalley since sometime in the afternoon his gaze icy still cut like a blade back to jenner so where the hell is he where the hell is deanna thats what were going to try to find out im not going to waste my time telling you to get back in your car and go home but i am telling you to let me handle this with hyatt so handle it his voice might have been cold his eyes frosty but jenner recognized a powder keg ready to explode the melodious sound of church bells rang out when jenner pressed the doorbell beneath his feet was a mat with the word welcome woven in black in the center of the door was a glossy christmas wreath topped by a bright red bow colored lights had been neatly strung around the frame jeff hyatt appeared ready for the holidays hed known they would come and he was ready clad comfortably in a tattered sweater and baggy sweats jeff descended the stairs hed watched them arrive from his bedroom window he smiled to himself as he paused before the door this he knew was the next step toward freeing deanna toward binding her he pulled open the door hey finn confusion clouded his eyes as he looked at his visitors whats up where is she finn spaced each word precisely yes there was a powder keg inside him and only the knowledge that it could explode over deanna kept it tapped i want to know where she is hey his grin tilted inffconfusion jeff stared blankly at finn then at jenner whats going on is something wrong mr hyatt jenner stepped neatly between the two men i need to ask you some questions okay jeff rubbed his fingertips against his temple no problem do you want to come in thank you mr hyatt jenner began did you relay a message to miss reynolds at approximately three oclock this afternoon yeah why wincing jeff continued to massage his temple jesus can we sit down ive got this monster headache he turned into the living area the furnishings were straight out of a catalogue matching tables matching chairs twin lamps a soulless practical suite favored by uninspired bachelors or newlyweds on a strict budget only jeff sat you told her i called sure i did jeffs smile was cautious his eyes were wary your assistant said to tell dee you had this meeting and were planning on getting home early you didnt talk to mr riley jenner demanded no i thought it was kind of weird that the call came through my office but when i went to tell dee i saw that she and cassie were all involved dee was getting her wedding dress fitted she looked incredible why did you leave the office early this headache i havent been able to ditch it all day it makes it hard to concentrate listen he stood again obviously impatient and bewildered whats this all about is it some kind of crime to deliver a phone message what time did you leave the office right after i talked to dee i came home well i went to the store first picked up some more heavyduty aspirin i thought if i laid down awhile his voice trailed off somethings happened to dee as if his legs wouldnt support him he lowered slowly to the couch again oh my god is she hurt she hasnt been seen since she left the office jenner told him oh god jesus have you talked to tim didnt he drive her home were unable to locate mr omalley on a shaking breath jeff rubbed his hands over his face it wasnt a message from your assistant was it finn i didnt ask any questions i wasnt paying attention his jaw quivered when he dropped his hands again his eyes were dark with an emotion disguising itself as fear all i could think about was getting home and going to bed i just said sure ill tell her and i did i dont believe you finn didnt move a muscle but the words cracked toward jeff like a slap youre a meticulous man jeff thats how deanna describes you and the minutes were ticking away why would you with everything thats been going on pass along a halfbaked message like that it was supposed to be from you jeff shot back the way finn studied him as if he could see all the secrets swimming in his brain put jeff on edge why wouldnt i pass it along then you wont mind if we go through the house finn turned to jenner through every inch of it you think i jeff snapped his mouth shut pushed himself from the couch go ahead he said to both men search it go through every room i want you to we appreciate your cooperation mr hyatt it would be best if you came with us while we do fine jeff stood for a moment staring at finn i know how you feel about her and i guess i cant really blame you for this they went through every room searching through closets cupboards through the garage where jeffs undistinguished sedan was parked it took less than twenty minutes finn noted the tidy practical furnishings the wellpressed practical clothes as a director for a numberone show hed be well compensated financially and finn could see that he sure as hell wasnt spending any money on himself just what he wondered was jeff hyatt saving his pennies for i wish she was here jeff felt a quick gleeful surge as they walked past the bookcase at least shed be safe i want to help i want to do something we can start with the press we can get national coverage by morning well have everyone in the country looking for her everybody knows her face he looked beseechingly at finn someone will see her he cant keep her locked in a tower somewhere wherever he has her finn never took his eyes off jeffs ill find her without a backward glance finn strode out of the house seconds later the sound of his engine roared i cant blame him jeff muttered he looked toward jenner no one could he locked up carefully behind the policeman his smile grew wider wider wider as he climbed the stairs they might come back a small grinning part of him hoped they would because he would lead them right through the house right by the hidden room where his princess slept they would never find her and eventually they would go away he and deanna would be alone always he turned on the television in his room the evening news didnt interest him he flipped a switch on the splitter behind the set and settled down to watch deanna she slept on still as a doll behind the glass of the screen the tears he wept now were of simple joy jenner caught up with finn at home he made no mention of the speed limits finn had ignored well be checking out hyatt and omalley thoroughly why dont you be a reporter and get the story on the air itll be on the air standing in the chill december wind finn struggled to stave off panic hyatt looked as innocent as a newborn lamb didnt he yes he did jenner blew out a smoky breath three days until christmas he thought he would do everything in his power to be certain it was a day of celebration i had some trouble with that house finn said after a moment what kind nothing out of place not a crooked picture not a dustball books and magazines lined up like soldiers furniture all but geometrically arranged everything centered squared and bandbox clean i noticed obsessive thats how it strikes me he fits the pattern jenner acknowledged that with a slight nod a man can be obsessively neat without being obsessively homicidal where was the christmas tree finn muttered the christmas tree hes got the wreath hes got the lights but no tree youd think hed have a tree somewhere maybe hes one of those traditionalists who dont put it up until christmas eve but the omission was interesting one more thing lieutenant he claims he came home early to lie down the bed in his room was the only thing mussed up pillow scrunched a bit bedspread wrinkled we got him up from his nap so he says why did he have his shoes on finns eyes gleamed in the lowering light the laces were tied in double knots someone that neat doesnt lie down on his bed with his shoes on hed missed that clue damn it jenner thought i believe i mentioned this before mr riley you have a good eye he couldnt stay at home not without her finn did the only thing that seemed possible he went back to the station avoiding the newsroom he couldnt bear to answer questions to be asked questions he went to his office brewed a pot of strong coffee he added a healthy dose of whiskey to the first cup he booted up his computer finn fran stood in the doorway her face splotchy her eyes swollen and red before hed risen completely she took a stumbling step forward oh god finn he stroked her shaking shoulders though he felt no well of comfort that he could offer it was just the routine the show of comfort that meant nothing to anyone i had to take kelsey to the pediatrician for her checkup i wasnt here i wasnt even here you couldnt have changed anything i might have she shoved away eyes fierce now how did he get to her ive heard a dozen different stories this is the place for them truth or accuracy which do you want both ones not the same as the other fran youve been in the game long enough accurately we dont know she left early went out to the lot where her car and driver were supposed to be waiting now shes gone her driver seems to have vanished into thin air she didnt like the cool control of his voice or the workaday hum of his computer then whats the truth finn why dont you tell me what the truth is the truth is that whoever has been sending her those notes whoever killed lew mcationeil angela and pike has deanna theyve got an apb out on her and one on omalley and the car tim wouldnt he couldnt why the single word was like a bullet because you know him because hes part of deannas extended family fuck that he could have finn sat down drained half his coffee the shock of caffeine and whiskey spread through him like velvet lightning but i dont think he did i cant be sure until he turns up if he turns up why wouldnt he fran demanded hes worked for dee for two years hes never missed a single day hes never been dead before has he he swore at her at himself when her color faded to paste rising he poured her whiskey straight im sorry fran im half out of my mind how can you sit in here and say things like that how can you work think about work when dees out there somewhere this isnt some international disaster youre covering goddamn it where youre the steady unflappable journalist this is dee he jammed useless hands in his pockets when somethings important vital when the answer means everything you sit you work you think it through you take all the facts and create a scenario that plays something thats accurate i think jeffs got her jeff fran choked on whiskey youre crazy jeffs devoted to dee and hes harmless as a baby hed never hurt her im counting on that he said dully im betting my life on it i need everything youve got on him fran personnel records memos files i need your impressions your observations i need you to help me she said nothing only studied his face no his eyes werent cold she realized they were burning up and there was terror behind them give me ten minutes she said and left him alone she came back in less than her allotted time with a stack of files and a box of computer disks his employment record resume application for employment tax info fran smiled weakly i lifted his desk calendars he keeps them from year to year they were all filed meticulous obsessive though his blood iced finn accessed the first disk thats his personnel file from cbc i hope you dont mind breaking the law not a bit this application is from april eightynine when did dee go on air at cbc about a month before that fran reached for the whiskey to unclog her throat it doesnt prove anything no but its a fact the first he could build on same address hes got now howd he afford a house like that when hed been working as a radio gofer he inherited it his uncle left it to him finn i had to call dees family she pressed a hand to her mouth theyre getting the first flight out in the morning im sorry he stared hard at the screen families hed never had one to worry about before i should have done it no i didnt mean that i just i dont know what to say to them tell them were going to get her back thats the truth fran see if you can find the date in his calendar when lew mcationeil was killed it was february ninetytwo yeah i remember she opened the book flipped through the pages skimming jeffs neat precise notations we had a show that day jeff was directing i remember because we had snow and everybody was worried that the audience would be thin do you remember if he came in sure he was here he never missed looks like he had a ten oclock meeting with simon hed have had time finn murmured christ almighty do you really think he could have gone to new york shot lew come back and waltzed into the studio to direct a show all before lunch yes finn thought coldly oh yes he did fact lew was killed about seven thats central time theres an hours time difference between chicago and new york speculation he flies in and out maybe he charters a plane i need his receipts he doesnt keep his personal stuff here then ill have to get back in his house you make sure he comes in tomorrow morning and you make sure he stays she got up poured coffee into her whiskey all right what else lets see what else we can find shed lost track of time day or night there was no difference in the claustrophobic world jeff had created for her her head was cotton from the drug her stomach raw but she ate the breakfast hed left for her she didnt open the plain white envelope hed left on her tray for a timeless sweaty interlude she tried to find an opening in the wall had pried and poked with a spoon until her fingers had cramped uselessly all shed accomplished was to mar the pristine wallpaper she couldnt be sure if he was gone or how long shed been alone then she remembered the television and jumped like a cat on the remote still morning she thought her eyes filming with tears as she scanned the channels how easy it was to time your life around the familiar schedule of daytime tv the bright laughter of a familiar game show was both mocking and soothing shed slept through her own show she realized and choked back a bitter laugh where was finn what was he doing where was he looking for her she rose mechanically walked into the bathroom though shed already checked once she repeated the routine of standing on the lip of the tub climbing onto the lid of the toilet and searching for hidden cameras she had no choice but to trust jeff that he wouldnt pry in this room she slid the door closed tried not to think about the lack of a lock and she stripped she had to bite back the fear that he would come in when she was most vulnerable she needed the cold bracing spray to help clear her mind she scrubbed hard letting her thoughts focus as she soaped and rinsed soaped and rinsed he hadnt missed a detail she thought her brand of shampoo of powder creams she used them all finding some comfort in the daily routine wrapped in a bath sheet she walked back into the bedroom to go through the drawers she chose a sweater trousers just the sort of outfit she would pick for a day of relaxing at home ignoring the fresh shudder she carried the outfit and the lacy underwear hed provided into the bathroom dressed she began to pace pacing she began to plan finn parked his car half a block down then backtracked on foot he walked straight to jeff hyatts front door he didnt bother to knock since hed just hung up his car phone with fran he knew jeff was in the office finn had the extra set of keys fran had taken from jeffs bottom desk drawer there were three locks a lot of security he mused for a quiet neighborhood he unbolted all three and once inside took the precaution of locking up again he started upstairs first clamping down on the urge to dive wildly into desk and files instead he searched meticulously going through each drawer each paper with his reporters eye keen for any tiny detail he wanted a receipt some proof that jeff had traveled to new york and back on the day of lews murder the police might overlook his reporters instinct but they wouldnt overlook facts once they had jeff in custody they would sweat out of him deannas whereabouts he kept his eyes open too for some proof that jeff had another house a room an apartment he might be holding her there he wouldnt believe she was dead the pattern so far was to kill people in public places he shut the last drawer of the desk and moved to the files by the time hed finished his palms were damp biting back the taste of despair he strode from the office into jeffs bedroom hed found nothing absolutely nothing except proof that jeff hyatt was an organized dedicated employee who lived quietly and well almost too well within his means while finn searched the bedroom deanna paced the floor beneath him she knew she would have only one chance and that failure would be more than risky it might be fatal in the room above finn scanned row after row of videotapes the man was beyond a buff finn mused he was fanatical the neat labels indicated television series movies news events over a hundred black cases lined the wall beside the television finn juggled the remote in his hand deciding if he had time after searching the house hed screen a few to see if there was anything more personal on tape he set the remote down only a push of a button away from bringing deanna to life on screen he turned to the closet the scent of mothballs an old womans odor tickled his nostrils slacks hung straight and true jackets graced padded hangers the shoes were stretched on trees the photo album he found on the shelf revealed nothing but snapshots of an elderly man sometimes alone sometimes with jeff beside him his jaw seemed permanently clenched his lips withered to a scowl beneath each shot was a careful notation uncle matthew on th birthday june uncle matthew and jeff easter uncle matthew november there was no one else in the book just a man young a little thin and his hardfaced uncle never a young girl or a laughing child a romping pet the book felt unhealthy diseased in his hand finn slid it back on the shelf careful to align the edges details he thought grimly two could play underwear was tucked into the top dresser drawer all snowy white boxers pressed and folded there was nothing beneath them but plain white paper lightly scented with lilac it was almost worse than the mothballs finn thought and moved down to the next drawer none of the usual hiding places was utilized he found no papers no packets taped to the undersides or backs of drawers no valuables tucked into the toes of shoes the nightstand drawer held a current tv guide with selected programs highlighted in yellow a pad and a sharpened pencil and an extra handkerchief joined it hed been in the house for nearly an hour when he hit pay dirt the diary was under the pillow it was leather bound glossy and locked finn was reaching in his pocket for his penknife when he heard the rattle of a key in the lock goddamn it fran he glanced back at the closet rejecting it instantly not only as a cliche but also as a humiliating one hed rather face a foe than hide from one he stepped forward toward the bedroom door just as jeff walked down the hallway whistling on his way to the kitchen dont seem too devastated do you you son of a bitch muttering under his breath finn slipped toward the stairs he couldnt wait to see her jeff knew he was taking a chance leaving the office when fran was so insistent that he stay but hed slipped out antsy to get home to get to deanna the office was in an uproar he thought no one could work and he could always claim to have needed to be alone nobody would blame him he poured a glass of milk arranged fancy tea cookies on a china plate and put them all on a tray with another single rose shed be rested now he was certain shed be feeling better more at home and soon very soon she would see how well he could care for her finn waited at the top of the stairs he heard jeff whistling and the sound of dishes ringing together he heard the footsteps a quiet click followed moments later by another then he heard nothing at all where did the bastard go he wondered moving quietly he descended the stairs he slipped like a shadow from room to room by the time he reached the kitchen he was baffled he saw the bakery box of cookies caught the candy scent of icing but the man had vanished like smoke you look wonderful secure in the soundproofed room jeff smiled shyly at deanna do you like the clothes theyre very nice she willed herself to smile back i took a shower i cant believe you went to all the trouble to pick out all my favorite brands you saw the towels i had them monogrammed with your initials i know her stomach rolled it was very sweet of you jeff cookies theyre the ones you like best yes they are watching him she walked over fighting not to grit her teeth she kept her eyes on his as she chose a cookie bit in delicately wonderful she saw his gaze lower to her mouth as she licked at a crumb you were gone a long time i came back as soon as i could im going to turn in my resignation next week i have plenty of money put away and my uncle invested i wont have to leave you again its lonely here by myself she sat on the edge of the bed youll stay with me now wont you as long as you want sit with me in a subtle invitation she touched the bed beside her i think if you explain things to me now id be ready to understand his hands trembled as he set the tray down youre not angry no im still a little scared it frightens me to be locked in here im sorry he eased down beside her careful to keep an inch of space between them one day itll be different jeff she made contact by laying her hand over his why did you decide to do this how did you know this was the time i knew it had to be soon before the wedding when i came in yesterday and saw you in your wedding dress i couldnt wait any longer it was like a sign you were so beautiful dee but it was a terrible risk tim was downstairs waiting it was me i was waiting i used his hat and his coat the sunglasses i had to get tim out of the way how when he looked down staring at their joined hands her heart dropped jeff is tim dead i didnt do it the way i did the others eager anxious he looked back at her his eyes as hopeful as a childs i wouldnt have done that tim didnt hurt you but i had to get him out of the way and fast i liked him too really so i was real quick he didnt suffer i put him in the trunk of the car after and then when id brought you here i drove the car to a parking lot downtown i left it there and i came home to be with you his face crumbled when she turned hers away youve got to understand deanna im trying to oh god tim you havent hurt finn i promised i wouldnt hes had you all this time and ive been waiting i know i know instinctively she soothed theyre looking for me arent they they wont find you but theyre looking yes his voice rose as he pushed off the bed everything had gone perfectly up till now he reminded himself perfectly but he felt as though he were standing on the edge of a cliff and couldnt see the bottom and theyll look and look and then theyll stop and nobody will bother us nobody its all right she rose too though her legs trembled you know how curious i am about everything always asking questions you wont miss being on television dee he used his sleeve to wipe a tear away im your best audience i could listen to you for hours and hours i do but now i wont have to watch a tape now it can be real you want it to be real dont you more than anything her heart slammed against her ribs as she reached out to stroke his cheek and you want me youre all ive ever wanted his face twitched under her palm all these years youre all ive wanted ive never been with another woman not like pike not like riley i was waiting for you she wished she could harden her heart but part of her wept for him you want to touch me she steeled herself and lifted his hand placed it on her breast like this youre soft so soft there was something pathetic and terrifying about the way his hand shook against her even as his fingers moved to caress if i let you touch me the way you want will you let me go outside he jerked back as though shed burned him bitter betrayal welled in his throat youre trying to trick me no jeff it was all right for her desperation to show she told herself let him see her weakness i dont like being closed in it frightens me i only want to go outside for a few minutes get some air you want me to be happy dont you its going to take time his mouth set in a stubborn line youre not ready you know how i have to keep busy jeff she stepped toward him careful to keep her eyes fixed on his when she slid her arms up his chest his eyes clouded darkened sitting here like this hour after hour is upsetting me i know how much youve done for me and she felt the outline of the syringe in his pocket i know you want us to be together we are together he brought his unsteady hand back to her breast when she didnt flinch he smiled well always be together he lowered his head to kiss her she slipped the needle from his pocket deanna he murmured her sharp indrawn breath betrayed her she twisted fighting to plunge the needle into him as they grappled to the floor searching for jeff finally brought finn back to the bookcase he had seen what he and jenner had missed on their first search the dimensions he thought as the spit in his mouth dried to dust the dimensions were wrong the bookcase couldnt be an end wall couldnt be she was in there he realized deanna was in there and she wasnt alone he had one panicked notion of hurling himself bodily against the shelves his body quivered with the effort of holding back it wasnt the way god knew what jeff would do to her in the time it took him to break through struggling for calm he began to search methodically for a mechanism she was losing the hypo squirted out of her fingers when he rolled over her she screamed as her head rapped hard against the floor though her vision blurred she could see him above her his face distorted his tears running and she knew he could kill not only others but her you lied he cried out in an agony of despair you lied i have to punish you i have to and sobbing he closed his hands around her throat she used her nails to rake his face the blood surged to the surface and ran like his tears when he howled in pain she squirmed free her fingers brushed over the syringe as he snagged her ankle i loved you i loved you now i have to hurt you its the only way youll understand its for your own good thats what uncle matthew says its for your own good youll have to stay in here youll have to stay and have bread and water until youre ready to behave he chanted the words as he dragged her back toward the bed im doing my best for you arent i i gave you a roof over your head i put clothes on your back and this is the way you thank me youll just have to learn i know best he snagged her hand yanked up her arm she plunged the needle into him finn heard the sound of sirens in the distance but they meant nothing every ounce of concentration was focused on the puzzle at hand there was a way in there was always a way and he would find it its here he murmured to himself right here the son of a bitch didnt walk through the wall his finger hit a nub he twisted the panel opened in welloiled silence deanna stood beside the bed the syringe gripped in one hand eyes glazed murmuring her name jeff crawled across the mattress toward her i love you deanna his hand brushed hers before he went limp oh jesus deanna in one leap finn had her in his arms she swayed the needle dropping from her loose fingers finn his name burned her bruised throat and felt like heaven from what seemed like a long long distance she heard him swear when her body jerked with a shudder did he hurt you tell me if youre hurt no no he wanted to take care of me she buried her face in finns shoulder he only wanted to take care of me lets get out of here he carried her through the opening down the hall where he dragged at the locks i kept asking him to let me go outside she breathed in the raw air like wine he shot you finn he was the one who shot you and he killed tim she jolted at the sound of screeching brakes well jenner climbed out of his car moments ahead of two black andwhites the picture of finn carrying deanna down the front steps wasnt what hed expected to see after hed gotten the frantic call from fran myers but it was an image that satisfied went off on your own again mr riley you cant trust a reporter lieutenant guess not good to see you miss reynolds merry christmas deanna studied her reflection in the dressing room mirror the bruises had faded from her throat and the haunted look had ebbed from her eyes but her heart was still sore as joe had often told her during her reporting days she had one that bled too easily she couldnt afford for it to bleed now she had a show to do in thirty minutes hey she glanced over saw finn smiled hey back can you spare a minute ive got several for you she swiveled in her chair held out her hands dont you have a plane to catch i called the airport my flight is delayed two hours ive got time on my hands suspicion gleamed in her eyes youre not going to miss that plane i know i know youve already laid down the law ive got a job to do and youre not going to support me if i screw it up im going to rome only a week off schedule he bent down kissed her i figured i had time to give one more shot at talking you incoming with me ive got a job to do too the press is going to be all over you she arched her brows promises promises she stepped off the chair turned a circle how do i look like something i dont want to be several thousand miles away from he tipped up her chin looked deep into her eyes youre hurting im better finn weve been through this she saw his face change harden dont i dont know how long its going to take before i close my eyes and stop seeing you in that room knowing you were there all those hours and id walked right by you he pulled her roughly against him i still want to kill him hes sick finn all those years of emotional abuse he needed to escape and he used television and one day the day he found his uncle dead i walked out of the screen and into his life i dont give a damn how sick he is how warped or how pathetic he drew her back i cant deanna i dont have it in me to care and i cant stand hearing you blame yourself im not really im not i know it wasnt my fault nothing he did was my fault still she thought of tim whose body had been found in the trunk of her company car in a downtown parking lot i was never real to him finn even all the time we worked together i was never anything but an image a vision everything he did he did because hed twisted that image i cant blame myself for that but i can still be sorry dee fran stepped into the doorway winked at finn we need the star in five the stars ready i can postpone the flight stick around for the press conference after the show i can handle reporters she kissed finn firmly on the mouth ive had plenty of experience want to get married kansas with his arm around her he walked her into the corridor down toward the set you bet i do april third be there i never miss a deadline he turned her around to face him im crazy about you and winced bad choice of words she wasnt surprised that she could laugh nothing surprised her now call me from rome marcie leaped forward to repair deannas lipstick and dont forget you have to handle the flowers for the church and reception you have the list i made you behind her back he rolled his eyes which one all of them no you dont marcie threw up a hand before deanna could lean into another kiss youve got thirty seconds and i dont want my work smeared stay tuned kansas ill be back deanna took another step toward stage the hell with it she whirled around flew into finns arms over marcies groan she clamped her lips to his hurry back she told him and rushed toward the stage nailing her cue the floor director stabbed a finger toward her over the sound of applause she smiled into the cameras glass eye and slipped seamlessly into millions of lives good morning its good to be home the end
