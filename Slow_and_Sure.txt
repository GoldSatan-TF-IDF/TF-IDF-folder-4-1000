talbots return xxvi from the sidewalk to the shop slow and sure chapter i six months after its most time for paul to come home said mrs hoffman i must be setting the table for supper i wonder how he will like my new picture said jimmy a delicate boy of eight whose refined features thoughtful look and high brow showed that his mind by no means shared the weakness of his body though only eight years of age he already manifested a remarkable taste and talent for drawing in which he had acquired surprising skill considering that he had never taken lessons but had learned all he knew from copying such pictures as fell in his way let me see your picture jimmy said mrs hoffman have you finished it she came up and looked over his shoulder he had been engaged in copying a humorous picture from the last page of harpers weekly it was an ambitious attempt on the part of so young a pupil but he had succeeded remarkably well reproducing with close fidelity the grotesque expressions of the figures introduced in the picture that is excellent jimmy said his mother in warm commendation the little boy looked gratified do you think i will be an artist some day he asked i have no doubt of it said his mother if you can only obtain suitable instruction however there is plenty of time for that you are only seven years old i shall be eight tomorrow said jimmy straightening up his slender form with the pride which every boy feels in advancing age so you will i had forgotten it i wonder whether i can earn as much money as paul when i get as old said jimmy thoughtfully i dont think i can i shant be half as strong it isnt always the strongest who earn the most money said his mother but paul is smart as well as strong so are you smart you can read unusually well for a boy of your age and in drawing i think paul is hardly your equal though he is twice as old jimmy laughed thats true mother he said paul tried to draw a horse the other day and it looked more like a cow you see then that we all have our different gifts paul has a talent for business i think hell be rich some day mother i hope he will for i think he will make a good use of his money while mrs hoffman was speaking she had been setting the table for supper the meal was not a luxurious one but there was no lack of food beside rolls and butter there was a plate of cold meat an apple pie and a pot of steaming hot tea the cloth was scrupulously clean and i am sure that though the room was an humble one not one of my readers need have felt a repugnance to sitting down at mrs hoffmans plain table for the benefit of such as may not have read paul the peddler i will explain briefly that mrs hoffman by the death of her husband two years previous had been reduced to poverty which compelled her to move into a tenement house and live as best she could on the earnings of her oldest son paul supplemented by the pittance she obtained for sewing paul a smart enterprising boy after trying most of the street occupations had become a young street merchant by a lucky chance he had obtained capital enough to buy out a necktie stand below the astor house where his tact and energy had enabled him to achieve a success the details of which we will presently give besides his own profits he was able to employ his mother in making neckties at a compensation considerably greater than she could have obtained from the broadway shops for which she had hitherto worked scarcely was supper placed on the table when paul entered he was a stout manly boy of fifteen who would readily have been taken for a year or two older with a frank handsome face and an air of confidence and selfreliance which he had acquired through his independent efforts to gain a livelihood he had been thrown upon his own resources at an age when most boys have everything done for them and though this had been a disadvantage so far as his education was concerned it had developed in him a confidence in himself and his own ability to cope with the world not usually found in boys of his age well mother said he briskly i am glad supper is ready for i am as hungry as a wolf i think there will be enough for you said his mother smiling if not we will send to the bakers for an extra supply is a wolf hungry paul asked jimmy soberly accepting pauls simile ill draw you one after supper jimmy and you can judge answered paul your animals all look like cows paul said his little brother i see you are jealous of me said paul with much indignation because i draw better than you after supper you can look at my last picture said jimmy it is copied from harpers weekly pass it along now jimmy i dont think it will spoil my appetite jimmy handed it to his brother with a look of pardonable pride excellent jimmy i couldnt do it better myself said paul you are a little genius i like drawing so much paul i hope some time i can do something else besides copy no doubt you will i am sure you will be a famous artist some day and make no end of money by your pictures thats what i would like to make money fie jimmy i had no idea you were so fond of money i would like to help mother just as you are doing paul do you think i will ever earn as much as you do a great deal more i hope jimmy not but what i am doing well added paul in a tone of satisfaction did you know mother it is six months today since i bought out the necktie stand is it paul asked his mother with interest have you succeeded as well as you anticipated better mother it was a good idea putting in a case of knives they help along my profits why i sold four knives today making on an average twentyfive cents each did you that is indeed worth while it is more than i used to average for a whole days earnings before i went into this business how many neckties did you sell paul asked jimmy i sold fourteen how much profit did you make on each about fourteen cents can you tell how much that makes i could cipher it out on my slate no matter ill tell you it makes a dollar and ninetysix cents that added to the money i made on the knives amounts to two dollars and ninetysix cents almost three dollars yes sometimes i sell more neckties but then i dont always sell as many knives however i am satisfied i have made two dozen neckties today paul said his mother i am afraid you did too much mother oh no there isnt much work about a necktie then i owe you a dollar and twenty cents mother i dont think you ought to pay me five cents apiece paul thats fair enough mother if i get fourteen cents for selling a tie certainly you ought to get five cents for making one but your money goes to support us paul and where does yours go mother a part of it has gone for a new dress paul i went up to stewarts today and bought a dress pattern i will show it to you after supper thats right mother you dont buy enough new dresses considering that you are the mother of a successful merchant you ought to dash out doesnt jimmy want some clothes i am going to buy him a new suit tomorrow he is eight years old tomorrow is he what an old fellow you are getting to be jimmy how many gray hairs have you got i havent counted said jimmy laughing i tell you what mother we must celebrate jimmys birthday he is the only artist in the family and we must treat him with proper consideration ill tell you what jimmy ill close up my business at twelve oclock and give all my clerks a halfholiday then ill take you and mother to barnums museum where you can see all the curiosities and the play besides how would you like that ever so much paul said the little boy his eyes brightening at the prospect theres a giant there isnt there how tall is he somewhere about eighteen feet i believe now you are making fun paul well its either eighteen or eight one or the other then theres a dwarf two feet high or is it inches of course its feet he couldnt be so little as two inches well jimmy i dare say youre right then its settled that we go to the museum tomorrow you must go with us mother oh yes i will go said mrs hoffman and i presume i shall enjoy it nearly as much as jimmy chapter ii barnums museum barnums museum now lives only in the past its successor known as woods museum is situated at the corner of twentyninth street and broadway but at the time of my story the old barnums stood below the astor house on the site now occupied by those magnificent structures the herald building and the park bank hither flowed daily and nightly a crowd of visitors who certainly got the worth of their money only twentyfive cents in the numberless varied curiosities which the unequaled showman had gathered from all quarters of the world jimmy had often seen the handbills and advertisements of the museum but had never visited it and now anticipated with eagerness the moment when all its wonders should be revealed to him in fact he waked up about two hours earlier than usual to think of the treat in store for him paul as he had promised closed up his business at twelve oclock and came home at halfpast one the three were on their way to the museum the distance was but short and a very few minutes found them in the museum jimmys eyes opened wide as they took in the crowded exhibition room and he hardly knew what to look at first until the approach of a giant eight feet high irresistibly attracted him it is a remarkable circumstance that barnums giants were always eight feet high on the bill though not always by measure sometimes the great showman lavishly provided two or three of these titans where they came from nobody knew it has been conjectured by some that they were got up to order but upon this point i cannot speak with certainty as a general thing they are goodnatured and harmless in spite of their formidable proportions and ready to have a joke at their own expense oh see that big man exclaimed jimmy struck with awe as he surveyed the formidable proportions of the giant hes bigger than you will ever be jimmy said paul i wouldnt like to be so tall said the little boy why not you could whip all the fellows that tried to tease you they dont tease me much paul do they tease you at all asked his brother quickly not very often sometimes they call me limpy because i am lame id like to catch any boy doing it said paul energetically id make him see stars i dont mind paul but i do just let me catch the next fellow that calls you limpy and he wont do it again by this time a group had gathered round the giant paul and jimmy joined it was you always so large asked a boy at pauls side i was rather smaller when i was a baby said the giant laughing how much do you weigh two hundred and seventyfive pounds that beats you jimmy said paul were you big when you were a boy i was over seven feet high on my fifteenth birthday said the giant did the teacher lick you often asked one of the boys shyly not very often he couldnt take me over his knee very well what an awful lot of cloth you must take for your clothes said the last boy thats so my lad i keep a manufactory running all the time to keep me supplied do you think thats true paul asked jimmy doubtfully not quite answered paul smiling dont you need to eat a good deal was the next question oh no not much half a dozen chickens and a couple of turkeys are about all i generally eat for dinner perhaps i could eat more if i tried if any of you boys will invite me to dinner ill do my best im glad you aint my son said one of the boys i shouldnt like to keep you in food and clothes well now i shouldnt mind having you for a father said the giant humorously looking down upon his questioner a boy of twelve and rather small of his age with a humorous twinkle in his eye you wouldnt whip me very often would you here there was a laugh at the expense of the small boy and the group dispersed now youve seen a large man jimmy said paul im going next to show you a small one they moved on to a different part of the building and joined another crowd this time surrounding the illustrious tom thumb at that time one of the attractions of the museum theres a little man smaller than you are jimmy said paul so he is said jimmy is that tom thumb yes i didnt think he was so small im glad im not so little no it might not be very comfortable though you could make a good deal of money by it tom is said to be worth over a hundred thousand dollars i guess it doesnt cost him so much for clothes as the giant probably not i dont think he would need to run a manufactory for his own use but there were multitudes of curiosities to be seen and they could not linger long jimmy was particularly interested in the waxwork figures which at first he thought must be real so natural was their appearance there were lions and tigers in cages who looked out from between the gratings as if they would like nothing better than to make a hearty meal from one or more of the crowd who surrounded the cages jimmy clung to pauls hand timidly couldnt they get out paul he asked no the cages are too strong but even if they could i dont think they would attack you you would only be a mouthful for them i dont see how mr barnum dared to put them in the cages i dont think barnum would dare to come very near them but he has keepers who are used to them but it was time for the afternoon performance to commence the play was uncle toms cabin which no doubt many of my readers have seen they got very good seats fronting the stage though some distance back when the curtain rose jimmys attention was at once absorbed it was the first time he had ever seen a play and it seemed to him a scene of rare enchantment to paul however it was much less of a novelty he had frequently been to barnums and the old bowery though not as often as those boys who had no home in which to spend their evenings mrs hoffman was scarcely less interested than jimmy in the various scenes of the play it was not particularly well acted for most of the actors were indifferent in point of talent but then none of the three were critics and could not have told the difference between them and firstclass performers both laughed heartily over the eccentricities of topsy probably the most original character in mrs stowes popular story and jimmy was affected to tears at the death of little eva to his unaccustomed eyes it seemed real and he felt as if eva was really dying but taking it altogether it was an afternoon of great enjoyment to jimmy whose pleasures were not many well jimmy how did you like it asked paul as they were working their way out slowly through the crowd it was beautiful paul i am so much obliged to you for taking me i am glad you liked it jimmy we will go again some time they were stepping out on the sidewalk when a boy about pauls size jostled them rudely theres limpy said he with a rude laugh youd better not say that again peter blake he said menacingly why not demanded peter defiantly it wont be safe said paul significantly ill call you limpy if i like you may call me so and i wont mind it but dont you call my little brother names i dont mind paul said jimmy but i do said paul no boy shall call you names when i am near pauls resolute character was well understood by all the boys who knew him and peter would not have ventured to speak as he did but he did not at first perceive that jimmy was accompanied by his brother when he did discover it he slunk away as soon as he could they were walking up park row when jim parker once an enemy but now a friend of paul met them he looked excited and hurried up to meet them when were you home paul he asked abruptly two or three hours since i have just come from barnums then you dont know whats happened paul turned instantly no what is it your house has caught fire and is burning down the engines are there but i dont think they can save it let us hurry home brother said paul its lucky ive got my bankbook with me so if we are burned out we can get another home at once excited by this startling intelligence they quickened their steps and soon stood in front of the burning building chapter iii the burning of the tenement house the scene was an exciting one the occupants of the large tenement house had vacated their rooms in alarm each bearing what first came to hand and reinforced by a numerous crowd of outsiders were gazing in dismay at the sudden conflagration which threatened to make them homeless och hone och hone that iver i should see the day exclaimed a poor irish woman wringing her hands its ruined intirely i am by the fire is that you mrs hoffman and paul indade its a sad day for the likes of us it is indeed mrs mcgowan do you know how the fire caught its all along of that drunken brute jim oconnel he was smokin in bed bad luck to him as drunk as a baste and the burnin tobacker fell out on the shates and set the bed on fire cheer up mrs mcgowan said the hearty voice of mrs donovan we aint burnt up ourselves and thats a comfort ive lost all my money said mrs mcgowan disconsolately i had twentysiven dollars and thirty cents in the bank and the bankbooks burnt up och hone you can get your money for all that mrs mcgowan said paul just tell them at the savingsbank how you lost your book and they will give you another do you think so asked mrs mcgowan doubtfully i feel sure of it then thats something said she looking considerably relieved whin can i get it i will go with you to the bank tomorrow thank you paul and its you thats a fine lad intirely all my pictures will burn up said jimmy you can draw some new ones said paul i am afraid mother you will never wear that new dress of yours its a pity i bought it just at this time heres a bundle i took from your room mrs hoffman said a boy pushing his way through the crowd my dress is safe after all said mrs hoffman in surprise it is the only thing we shall save you can have it made up and wear it in remembrance of the fire mother i shall be likely to remember that without meanwhile the fire department were working energetically to put out the fire stream after stream was directed against the burning building but the fire had gained too great headway it kept on its victorious course triumphantly baffling all the attempts that were made to extinguish it then efforts were made to prevent its spreading to the neighboring buildings and these were successful but the building itself old and rotten a very tinderbox was doomed in less than an hour the great building full as a hive of occupants was a confused mass of smoking ruins and still the poor people hovered around in uncertainty and dismay in that peculiarly forlorn condition of mind induced by the thought that they knew not where they should lay their heads during the coming night one family had saved only a teakettle to commence their housekeeping with a little girl had pressed close to her breast a shapeless and dirty rag baby her most valued possession a boy of twelve had saved a wellused pair of skates for which he had traded the day before while an old woman bleareyed and wrinkled hobbled about groaning holding in one hand a lookingglass an article the most unlikely of all one would think to be of use to her did you save nothing mrs donovan asked paul shure and i saved my flatirons and my tub i threw out of the window but some spalpeen has walked off with it i wish it had fallen on his head whatll my pat say when he comes home from work its lucky no lives were lost thrue for you mrs hoffman it might have been a dale worse i dont mind meself for ive strong arms and ill soon be on my fate again but my patll be ravin he had just bought a new coat to go to a ball wid tomorrow night and its all burnt up in the fire do you see that poor craythur wid the lookin glass im glad i didnt save mine for i wouldnt know what to do wid it well mrs donovan we must find a new home ive got a sister livin in mulberry street shell take me in till i can get time to turn round but i must stay here till my pat comes home or he would think i was burnt up too the crowd gradually diminished every family however poor had some relations or acquaintances who were willing to give them a temporary shelter though in most cases it fed to most uncomfortable crowding but the poor know how to sympathize with the poor and cheerfully bore the discomfort for the sake of alleviating the misfortune which might some day come upon themselves where shall we go mother asked jimmy anxiously mrs hoffman looked doubtfully at paul i suppose we must seek shelter somewhere she said how will the fifth avenue hotel suit you asked paul i think i will wait till my new dress is finished she said smiling faintly why whats the matter paul youre not burnt out are you turning at the voice paul recognized sam norton a newsboy who sold papers near his own stand just about so sam he answered were turned into the street and where are you going to stop over night thats more than i know mother here isnt sure whether she prefers the st nicholas or fifth avenue paul likes to joke at my expense said mrs hoffman come over and stop with us tonight said sam my motherll be glad to have you thank you sam said mrs hoffman who knew the boy as a friend of paul but i shouldnt like to trouble your mother itll be no trouble said sam eagerly if you think it wont sam said paul well accept for tonight i am afraid they wouldnt take us in at any of the big hotels with only one dress and that not made up by way of baggage tomorrow ill find some other rooms come along then said sam leading the way well have a jolly time tonight paul by way of celebrating the fire its jolly enough for us but i shouldnt like it too often i say paul said sam wheeling round if youre out of stamps ive got a dollar or two that i can spare thank you sam youre a brick but ive saved my bankbook and ive got plenty to start on much obliged to you all the same it was true that paul was in an unusually good position to withstand the blow which had so unexpectedly fallen upon him he had a hundred and fifty dollars in the hands of mr preston a wealthy gentleman who took an interest in him and moreover had a hundred dollars deposited to his credit in a savingsbank beside his stock in trade probably amounting to at least fifty dollars at the wholesale price so there was no immediate reason for anxiety it would have been rather awkward however to look up a shelter for the night at such short notice and therefore sam nortons invitation was particularly welcome sam led the way to the lodgings occupied by his parents they were located on pearl street not far from centre and were more spacious and well furnished than any in the burned tenement house you go up first and tell your mother sam said paul she wont know what to make of it if we go in without giving her any notice all right said sam ill be down in a jiffy two minutes were sufficient for sam to explain the situation his mother a good motherly woman at once acknowledged the claim upon her hospitality she came downstairs at once and said heartily to paul whom she knew come right up paul and so this is your mother i am very glad to see you mrs hoffman come right up and ill do all i can to make you comfortable i am afraid we shall give you trouble mrs norton said mrs hoffman not in the least the more the merrier thats my motto i havent got much to offer but what there is you are very welcome to the room into which they were ushered was covered with a plain coarse carpet the chairs were wooden but there was a comfortable rockingchair a cheap lounge and a bookcase with a few books besides several prints upon the wall sams father was a policeman while his mother was a new england woman of good commonschool education neat and thrifty and so though their means were small she managed to make a comfortable home mrs hoffman looked around her with pleased approval it was pleasant to obtain even temporary refuge in so homelike a place is this your little brother who draws such fine pictures asked mrs norton jimmy looked pleased but mystified how should mrs norton have heard of his pictures you must draw me a picture tonight wont you asked mrs norton i should like to if i can have a pencil and some paper all mine are burned up sam will give you some from his desk but you must be hungry sam was drawn aside by his mother and after a whispered conference was dispatched to the butchers and bakers when he soon returned with a supply of rolls and beefsteak from which in due time an appetizing meal was spread to which all did full justice chapter iv the policemans home it was not till later in the evening that mr norton came in he had been on duty all day and tonight he was free though one of the constituted guardians of the public peace he was by no means fierce or formidable at home especially after he had doffed his uniform and put on an old coat edward said his wife this is pauls mother who was burned out today so i have asked her to stay here till she can find a place of her own that is right said the policeman mrs hoffman i am glad to see you paul has been here before he is one of sams friends paul likes to keep in with father said sam slyly considering he is on the police if he is to be known by the company he keeps said mr norton he might have to steer clear of you here i may explain why sam was a newsboy though his father was in receipt of a salary as a policeman he attended school regularly and only spent about three hours daily in selling papers but this gave him two or three dollars a week more than enough to buy his clothes the balance he was allowed to deposit in his own name at a savingsbank thus he was accumulating a small fund of money which by and by might be of essential use to him the group that gathered around the suppertable was a lively one although half the party had been burned out but paul knew he was in a position to provide a new home for his mother and thus was saved anxiety for the future you have very pleasant rooms mrs norton said mrs hoffman yes we have as good as we can afford twenty dollars a month is a good deal for us to pay but then we are comfortable and that makes us work more cheerfully how do you like being a policeman mr norton asked paul i dont like it much but it pays as well as anything i can get i sometimes feel anxious about him said mrs norton he is liable to be attacked by ruffians at any time the day he came home with his face covered with blood i was frightened then i can tell you how did it happen i was called in to arrest a man who was beating his wife said the policeman he was raging with drink at the time he seized one of his wifes flatirons and threw it at me it was a stunner however i managed to arrest him and had the satisfaction of knowing that he would be kept in confinement for a few months i have to deal with some tough customers a policeman down in this part of the city has to take his life in his hand he never knows when hes going to have a stormy time i wish my husband were in some other business said mrs norton there are plenty of men that would like my position said her husband its sure pay and just as good in dull times as in good besides some people think its easy work just walking around all day theyd better try it theres one part mr norton likes said his wife slyly its showing ladies across the street i dont know about that rejoined the policeman it gets rather monotonous crossing the street continually and theres some danger in it too poor morgan was run over only three months ago and injured so much that hes been obliged to leave the force then some of the ladies get frightened when theyre halfway over and make a scene i remember one old woman who let go my arm and ran screaming in among the carriages and it was a miracle that she didnt get run over if she had clung to me shed have got over all right i dont think ill be a policeman said sam i might have to take you up paul and i shouldnt like to do that paul isnt bad said jimmy who was very apt to take a joke seriously and who always resented any imputation upon his brother he never got took up in his life then he wasnt found out i suppose said sam he never did anything bad retorted jimmy indignantly thank you jimmy said paul laughing ill come to you when i want a firstclass recommendation if i never did anything bad i suppose you wont call that horse bad that i drew the other day it was a bad picture said the little boy but people dont get took up for making bad pictures thats lucky said sam or i shouldnt stand much chance of keeping out of the stationhouse i move jimmy gives us a specimen of his skill ive got a comic paper here somewhere he can copy a picture out of that where is it asked jimmy eagerly the paper was found and the little boy set to work with great enthusiasm and soon produced a copy of one of the pictures which was voted excellent by that time he was ready to go to bed paul and he had to take up with a bed on the floor but this troubled them little they felt thankful under the circumstances to have so comfortable a shelter indeed jimmy troubled himself very little about the future he had unbounded faith in paul to whom he looked up with as much confidence as he would have done to a father early the next morning mr norton was obliged to enter upon his daily duties the poor must be stirring betimes so they all took an early breakfast mother said paul it wont be much use to look up new rooms before the middle of the forenoon i think i will open my stand as usual and return at ten and then we can go out together very well paul i will help mrs norton if she will let me till then there is no need of that mrs hoffman i would rather do it i want to make some return for your kindness so the two women cleared away the breakfast dishes and washed them and then mrs hoffman sewed for two hours upon a shirt which his mother had commenced for sam jimmy amused himself by copying another picture from the comic paper before mentioned meantime paul got out his stock in trade and began to be on the watch for customers he bought a copy of the herald of his friend sam and began to pore over the advertisements headed furnished rooms and apartments to let let me see soliloquized paul here are four elegantly furnished rooms on fifth avenue only fifty dollars a week without board cheap enough but im afraid it would be rather too far away from my business i suppose thats the only objection said sam slyly there might be one or two others sam suppose you pick out something for me what do you say to this paul said sam pointing out the following advertisement furnished neatly for housekeeping front parlor including piano with front and back bedrooms on second floor front basement gas bath hot and cold water stationary tubs rent reasonable west twentyseventh street that would be very convenient especially the piano and the stationary tubs observed paul if i decide to take the rooms you can come round any time and practice on the tubs thank you paul i think id rather try the piano i thought you might be more used to the tubs however thats too far up town for me are you going to get furnished rooms i havent spoken to mother about it but as we have had all our furniture burned up we shall probably get furnished rooms at first perhaps this might suit you then said sam reading from the paper to let for housekeeping several nicely furnished rooms terms moderate apply at bleecker street that must be near where barry used to live would it be too far no i dont think it would it isnt far to walk from bleecker street but it will depend a little on the terms terms moderate read off sam they might call them so even if they were high i wish there were some rooms to let in our building i shouldnt mind taking them if they were as nice as yours how long have you lived there we only moved on the first day of may how much do you charge for your neckties boy asked a female voice looking up paul beheld a tall hardvisaged female who had stopped in front of his stand twentyfive cents answered paul seems to me theyre rather high returned the wouldbe customer cant you sell me one for twenty cents i never take less than twentyfive madam i am looking for a nice birthday present for my nephew said the hardvisaged lady but i dont want to spend too much if youll say twenty cents ill take two im sorry but i have only one price said the young merchant ill give you twentytwo cents i shall have to charge twentyfive i suppose i must pay it then said the lady in a dissatisfied tone here give me that blue one the necktie was wrapped up and the money reluctantly paid how would you like to be her nephew sam asked paul as soon as she was out of hearing you might get a nice birthday present now and then shouldnt wonder if that twentyfive cents bust the old woman do you often have customers like that not very often the other day a young man after wearing a necktie for a week came back and wanted to exchange it for one of a different color did you exchange it i guess not i told him that wasnt my style of doing business he got mad and said hed never buy anything more of me that reminds me of a man that bought a tribune of me early in the morning and came back after reading it through and wanted to exchange it for a times but i must be goin or ill be stuck on some of my papers chapter v house hunting at ten oclock paul closed up his business for the forenoon and returning to their temporary home found his mother waiting for him well paul she said inquiringly have you heard of any good rooms here is an advertisement of some nicely furnished rooms in bleecker street and paul pointed to the herald they may be above our means paul at any rate we can go and look at them we must expect to pay more if we take them furnished do you think we had better take furnished rooms asked mrs hoffman doubtfully i think so mother just now all our furniture is burned you know and it would take too much of our capital to buy new when we get richer we will buy some nice furniture perhaps you are right paul at any rate we will go and look at these rooms if they dont suit us i have the paper with me and we can look somewhere else may i go mother asked jimmy we might have to go about considerably jimmy said paul i am afraid you would get tired if mrs norton will let you stay here i think it will be better said his mother are you sure he wont be in your way mrs norton bless his heart no returned the policemans wife heartily i shall be glad of his company mr norton and sam are away most of the time and i get lonely sometimes jimmy felt rather flattered by the thought that his company was desired by mrs norton and readily resigned himself to stay at home paul and his mother went out and got on board a bleecker street car which soon brought them to the desired number the house was quite respectable in appearance far more so certainly than the burned tenement house the time had been when bleecker street was fashionable and lined with the dwellings of substantial and prosperous citizens that time had gone by still it was several grades above the streets in the lower part of the city paul rang the bell and the door was opened by a maidservant i saw an advertisement in the herald about some rooms to let said paul can we see them ill speak to the mistress was the reply wont you come in they entered the hall and were shown into the parlor where they took seats on a hard sofa soon the door opened and a tall lady entered you would like to look at my rooms she inquired addressing mrs hoffman if you please they are on the third floor all that i have vacant if you will follow me i will show you the way at the top of the second staircase she threw open the door of a goodsized room furnished plainly but neatly there is another room connected with this she said and a bedroom on the upper floor can go with it is it arranged for housekeeping asked mrs hoffman yes you will find the back room fitted for cooking come in and i will show you she opened a door in the rear room displaying a pantry and sink while a cookingstove was already put up both rooms were carpeted in the front room there was a sofa a rockingchair some shelves for books while three or four pictures hung from the walls i dont see any sleeping accommodations said mrs hoffman looking around i will put a bed into either room said the landlady i have delayed doing it till the rooms were let how do you like it mother asked paul very well but mrs hoffman hesitated thinking that the charge for such accommodations would be beyond their means paul understood and asked in his turn how much do you ask for these rooms by the month with the small room upstairs besides yes thirty dollars a month mrs hoffman looked at paul in dismay this was more than three times what they had been accustomed to pay we can afford to pay more than we have hitherto he said in a low voice besides there is the furniture but thirty dollars a month is more than we can afford said his mother uneasily my mother thinks we cannot afford to pay thirty dollars said paul the price is very reasonable said the landlady you wont find cheaper rooms in this street i dont complain of your price said mrs hoffman only it is more than we can afford to pay could you take less no said the landlady decidedly i am sure to get tenants at that price then paul i think we must look further said his mother if you dont find anything to your mind perhaps you will come back suggested the landlady we may do so how much would you charge for these two rooms alone twentysix dollars a month the prices named above are considerably less than the present rates but still as pauls income from his business only amounted to fifty or sixty dollars a month it seemed a good deal for him to pay we may call again said mrs hoffman as they went downstairs but we will look around first how much do you think we can afford to pay paul asked mrs hoffman we can easily afford twenty dollars a month mother that is more than three times as much as we pay now i know it but i want a better home and a better neighborhood mother when we first took the other rooms six dollars a month was all we were able to pay now we can afford better accommodations what other rooms have you got on your list paul there are some rooms in prince street near broadway i am afraid they would be too highpriced at any rate we can go and look at them they are near by the rooms in prince street proved to be two in number well furnished and though not intended for housekeeping could be used for that purpose the rent was twentyfive dollars a month i do not feel able to pay more than twenty dollars said mrs hoffman that is too little ill split the difference and say twentytwo and a half i suppose you have no other children i have one other a boy of eight then i dont think i should be willing to let you the rooms said the landlady her manner changing i dont like to take young children he is a very quiet boy no boys of eight are quiet said the landlady decidedly they are all noisy and troublesome jimmy is never noisy or troublesome said mrs hoffman resenting the imputation upon her youngest boy of course you think so as you are his mother rejoined the landlady you may be mistaken you know perhaps you object to me also said paul i am more noisy than my little brother i look upon you as a young man said the landlady a remark at which paul felt secretly complimented i think we shall have to try somewhere else mother he said perhaps we shall find some house where they dont object to noisy boys it seemed rather a joke to paul to hear jimmy objected to as noisy and troublesome and for some time afterward he made it a subject for joking jimmy the latter took it very goodnaturedly and seemed quite as much amused as paul the herald had to be consulted once more two other places near by were visited but neither proved satisfactory in one place the rooms were not pleasant in the other case the price demanded was too great its twelve oclock already said paul listening to the strokes of a neighboring clock i had no idea it was so hard finding rooms i wonder whether mrs norton would keep us a day longer perhaps we can go out this afternoon and prove more successful paul ive a great mind to consult mr preston mother i think ill call at his place of business at any rate as i may need to draw some of the money we have in his hands you know weve all got to buy new clothes very well paul do as you think best you wont need me no mother mrs hoffman returned to her temporary quarters and reporting her want of success was cordially invited by mrs norton to remain as her guest until she succeeded in obtaining satisfactory rooms chapter vi paul takes a house on madison avenue paul kept on his way to the office of mr preston those who have read the previous volume will remember him as a gentleman whose acquaintance paul had made accidentally attracted by our heros frank straightforward manner and manly bearing he had given him some work for his mother and on other occasions had manifested an interest in his welfare he now held one hundred and fifty dollars belonging to paul or rather to mrs hoffman for which he allowed legal interest on entering the mercantile establishment of which mr preston was at the head paul inquired for him of one of the salesmen he is in his office said the latter can i see him i dont know do you want to see him personally yes if he has time to see me from whom do you come i come on my own business then i dont think you can see him said the clerk judging that a boys business couldnt be very important if you will be kind enough to carry in my name said paul mr preston will decide that paul happened to have in his pocket a business card of the firm from which he bought the silk used in making up his neckties he wrote on the back his name paul hoffman and presented it to the clerk the latter smiled a little superciliously evidently thinking it rather a joke that a boy of pauls age should think himself entitled to an interview with mr preston during business hours and on business of his own however he took the card and approached the office theres a boy outside wishes to see you mr preston he said from whom does he come asked his employer a portly pleasantlooking gentleman on business of his own he says here is his card oh to be sure paul hoffman repeated mr preston glancing at the card tell him to come in i wonder what business he can have with mr preston thought the clerk considerably surprised you can go in he said on his return paul smiled slightly for he observed and enjoyed the others surprise well my young friend said mr preston cordially how are you getting on pretty well in business sir answered paul but we got burned out yesterday how burned out i mean the tenement house in which we lodged was burned down no one injured i hope no sir but we lost what little we had there were you at home at the time no sir my mother and little brother and myself were at barnums museum but for that we might have saved some of our clothing well have you got a new place no sir we are stopping at the rooms of some friends i am looking out for some furnished rooms as i dont want to buy any new furniture as all our clothes are burned i may have to draw fifty dollars of the money in your hands how much rent do you expect to pay i suppose we must pay as much as twenty dollars a month for comfortable furnished rooms can you afford that my business brings me in as much as fifty dollars a month you havent engaged rooms yet no sir my mother and i went out to look at some this morning we only saw one place that suited us that we could have got for twentytwo dollars and a half rent but when they heard of my little brother they wouldnt take us i see some persons object to young children i am glad you have not engaged a place yet paul looked at mr preston inquiringly a gentleman of my acquaintance proceeded the merchant is about sailing to europe with his family he is unwilling to let his house fearing that his furniture would be injured besides the length of his stay is uncertain and he would want to go into it at once if he should return suddenly what i am coming to is this he wants some small family to go in and take care of the house while he is away they would be allowed to live in the basement and use the chambers on the upper floor in return they would receive the rent free how would your mother like to make such an arrangement very much answered paul promptly he saw at a glance that it would be a great thing to save their rent amounting at the sum they expected to pay to more than two hundred and fifty dollars a year where is the house it is in madison avenue between thirtythird and thirtyfourth streets this was a considerable distance uptown about three miles away from his place of business but then paul reflected that even if he rode up and down daily in the cars the expense would be trifling compared with what they would save in houserent besides it would be rather agreeable to live in so fashionable a street do you think my mother can get the chance he asked i think so the gentleman of whom i spoke mr talbot expects to sail for europe next wednesday by the cunard line so the matter must be decided soon shall i call upon mr talbot asked paul or shall you see him here he is by good luck said mr preston as the door opened and an elderly gentleman entered talbot you are just the man i want to see indeed i am glad to hear that what is it have you arranged about your house yet no i came in partly to ask if you knew of any trustworthy family to put in while i am away i can recommend some one who will suit you i think returned mr preston the young man at your side he hasnt got a family already inquired mr talbot with a humorous glance at our hero it seems to me he is rather forward i believe not said mr preston smiling but he has a mother a very worthy woman and a little brother as for my young friend himself i can recommend him from my own knowledge of his character in fact he has done me the honor of making me his banker to the extent of a hundred and fifty dollars so that you will go bail for him well that seems satisfactory what is his name paul hoffman are you in a countingroom asked mr talbot turning to paul no sir i keep a necktie stand below the astor house i must have seen you in passing i thought your face looked familiar how much can you make now at that from twelve to fifteen dollars a week sir very good that is a good deal more than i made at your age or i added mr preston paul was burned out yesterday he added and is obliged to seek a new home when he mentioned this to me i thought at once that you could make an arrangement for your mutual advantage i shall be glad to do so said mr talbot your recommendation is sufficient mr preston do you understand the terms proposed he continued addressing paul yes sir i think so we are to have our rent free and in return are to look after the house that is right i dont wish the house to remain vacant as it contains furniture and articles of value and an empty house always presents temptations to rogues you will be free to use the basement and the upper floor when the rest of the house needs cleaning or anything of that kind as for instance when i am about to return it will be done under your or your mothers oversight but i will pay the bills directions will be sent you through my friend mr preston all right sir said paul how soon would you wish us to come i would like you and your mother to call up this evening and see mrs talbot you can move in next tuesday as we sail for europe on the following day yes sir said paul in a tone of satisfaction i will expect you and your mother this evening my number is we will be sure to call sir mr talbot now spoke to mr preston on another topic oh by the way paul said mr preston in an interval of the conversation you said you wanted fifty dollars i dont think i shall need it now mr preston answered paul i have some other money but i supposed i might have to pay a months rent in advance now that will not be necessary i will bid you goodmorning sir goodmorning paul call on me whenever you need advice or assistance thank you sir i will thats what i call a good days work said paul to himself in a tone of satisfaction twenty dollars a month is a good deal to save we shall grow rich soon at that rate he determined to go home at once and announce the good news as he entered the room his mother looked up and inquired well paul what news ive engaged a house mother a house where on madison avenue you are joking paul no i am not or if i am its a good joke for we are really to live in a nice house on madison avenue and pay no rent at all i cant understand it paul said his mother bewildered paul explained the arrangement which he had entered into it is needless to say that his mother rejoiced in the remarkable good luck which came to them just after the misfortune of the fire and looked forward with no little pleasure to moving into their new quarters chapter vii the house on madison avenue in the evening as had been agreed paul accompanied his mother uptown to call on mrs talbot and receive directions in regard to the house they had no difficulty in finding it on ringing the bell they were ushered into an elegantly furnished parlor the appearance of which indicated the wealth of the owner suppose we give a party mother after we move in said paul as he sat on the sofa beside his mother awaiting the appearance of mrs talbot mrs talbot might have an objection to our using her parlors for such a purpose i wonder said paul reflectively whether i shall ever have a house of my own like this not unless your business increases said his mother smiling i rather think you are right mother seriously though there are plenty of men in new york who live in style now who began the world with no better advantages than i you see there is a chance for me too i shall be satisfied with less said his mother wealth alone will not yield happiness still it is very comfortable to have it no doubt if it is properly acquired if i am ever rich mother you may be sure that i shall not be ashamed of the manner in which i became so i hope not paul their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of mrs talbot she was a stout comelylooking woman of middle age and pleasant expression i suppose this is mrs hoffman she said paul and his mother both rose i am mrs hoffman said the latter i suppose i speak to mrs talbot you are right keep your seat mrs hoffman is this your son paul bowed with instinctive politeness and his mother replied in the affirmative mr talbot tells me that you are willing to take charge of the house while we are absent in europe i shall be glad to do so we have been looking out for a suitable family and as our departure was so near at hand were afraid we might not succeed in making a satisfactory arrangement fortunately mr preston spoke to my husband of you and this sets our anxiety at rest i hope i may be able to answer your expectations mrs talbot said mrs hoffman modestly i think you will said mrs talbot and she spoke sincerely she had examined her visitor attentively and had been very favorably impressed by her neat dress and quiet ladylike demeanor she had been afraid when first informed by her husband of the engagement he had made that mrs hoffman might be a coarse untidy woman and she was very agreeably disappointed in her appearance i suppose she said you would like to look over the house thank you i should i also wish you to see it that you may understand my directions in regard to the care of it follow me if you please we will first go down into the basement mrs hoffman rose paul kept his seat not sure whether he was included in the invitation or not your son can come too if he likes said mrs talbot observing his hesitation paul rose with alacrity and followed them he had a natural curiosity to see the rooms they were to occupy they descended first into the basement which was spacious and light it consisted of three rooms the one in front quite large and pleasant it was plainly but comfortably furnished the kitchen was in the rear and there was a middle room between these will be your apartments said mrs talbot of course i have no objection to your moving in any of your own furniture if your desire it we have only ourselves to move in said paul we were burned out early this week indeed you were unfortunate i thought so at the time said mrs hoffman but if it had not been for that paul would not have called upon mr preston and we should not have heard of you were you able to save nothing asked mrs talbot scarcely anything if you are embarrassed for want of money suggested mrs talbot kindly i will advance you fifty dollars or more if you require it you are very kind said mrs hoffman gratefully but we have a sum of money more than enough for our present needs deposited with mr preston we are not less obliged to you for so kind an offer mrs talbot was still more prepossessed in favor of her visitors by the manner in which her offer had been declined she saw that they had too much selfrespect to accept assistance unless actually needed i am glad to hear that she said it is not all who are fortunate enough to have a reserve fund to fall back upon now if you have sufficiently examined the basement we will go upstairs while passing through the upper chambers mrs talbot gave directions for their care which would not be interesting to the reader and are therefore omitted i had intended she said to offer you the use of the upper chambers but they are so far off from the basement that it might be inconvenient for you to occupy them if you prefer you may move down two bedsteads to the lower part of the house i have no objection to your putting one in the diningroom if you desire it thank you mrs talbot i should prefer it then you may consider yourself at liberty to do it i believe i have now said all i wanted to you can you come here next tuesday yes we will do so by the way i forgot to inquire the size of your family i have only one other child a little boy of eight mrs talbot heard this with satisfaction for she was aware of the destructive propensities of children and preferred that the family in charge should be small i believe i have nothing further to say said mrs talbot should anything else occur to me i will mention it to you on tuesday when you come here permanently paul and his mother took their leave when they were in the street paul inquired well mother what do you think of mrs talbot i like her very much she seems to be a real lady so i think she seems to be very kind and considerate we are very fortunate to get so good a home and save the entire rent it will save us two hundred and forty dollars a year we shall be able to save up considerable money every year but theres one thing i want to say mother as we are in so much better circumstances there will be no need of your working on neckties any more are you going to discharge me from your employment paul said his mother smiling not unless you are willing mother but you will have enough to do looking after the house i would rather keep on making neckties it is a work that i like in return i will hire my washing done and all the rougher work perhaps that will be better said paul but you can do both if you like i dont mean to lead an idle life paul i should not feel happy if i did i was always fond of sewing that is in moderation when i made shirts for that establishment in broadway for such low prices i cannot say that i enjoyed that very much i am glad to be relieved of such work though at that time i was glad to get it those days have gone by forever i hope mother i am young and strong and i dont see why there isnt as good a chance for me to succeed as for other poor boys who have risen to wealth and eminence i am going to work for success at any rate but we shall have to make some purchases before tuesday what kind of purchases jimmy and i are out of clothes you know my entire wardrobe has been consumed by the devouring element as the reporters say now being a young man of fashion i dont quite like being reduced to one suit and one shirt with other things in proportion if you could wait i would make you some shirts but i cant wait i shouldnt feel like wearing the shirt i have on more than a fortnight i hope not said his mother smiling suppose i should be invited to a party and be obliged to decline with thanks on account of having only one shirt my reputation as a young man of fashion would be gone forever so i should think tomorrow i will buy a couple of shirts and these will last me with the help of the washerwoman until you can make me some new ones then i will go to bookairs tomorrow and take jimmy with me and buy new suits for both i am afraid you are getting extravagant paul if we live on madison avenue we must dress accordingly you know mother that reminds me i must buy two trunks also two yes one for you and the other for jimmy and myself at present i could tie up all my clothes in a handkerchief that is if i had a spare one but i am going to have some more you must have some new things also mother i can wait till we get settled in our new home i am afraid you wont have money enough for all the articles you mean to buy i may have to draw some from mr preston i think i will call on him tomorrow and do so i forgot how much we had to buy i shall close up business tomorrow and monday and spend the time in preparation for moving mrs hoffman would not had the matter rested with her have been in favor of expending so much money but she had considerable confidence in pauls judgment and indeed their prospects looked bright enough to warrant it so she withdrew her objections and paul had his own way as he generally did chapter viii a gift the next forenoon paul called at mr prestons place of business on entering the office he found mr talbot conversing with him talbot said mr preston this is your new tenant paul hoffman goodmorning paul said mr talbot pleasantly mrs talbot tells me that you and your mother called last evening yes sir i was called away by an engagement but i am glad to say that mrs talbot approves my choice thank you sir i hear from mr preston that you have been unfortunate in being burned out yes sir we have been burned out but we hadnt much to lose were you able to save any of your clothing my mother saved a new dress she had just bought was that all yes sir it will cost you considerable to replace what was destroyed considerable for me sir i called this morning to ask mr preston for fifty dollars from the money he has of mine to spend for clothes for my mother and brother and myself will fifty dollars be sufficient i have some money on hand that will be all i shall need to draw it will be a pity to disturb your savings your care of my house will be worth more than the rent i will give you fifty dollars besides suiting the action to the word mr talbot took out his pocketbook and drew therefrom five tendollar bills which he placed in pauls hands you are very kind said paul in grateful surprise we felt well paid by having our rent free you are quite welcome but i ought to tell you that it is to mrs talbot you are indebted rather than to myself she suggested my giving you the money having been much pleased with your mothers appearance i am very much obliged to her also then said paul and so will be my mother when i tell her we will try to give you satisfaction i feel sure you will said mr talbot kindly that is a fine boy he said after paul had bidden them goodmorning and left the office he is an excellent boy said mr preston warmly he is straightforward manly and honest how did you fall in with him he fell in with me said mr preston laughing how is that as i was turning the corner of a street downtown one day he ran into me and nearly knocked the breath out of me which prepossessed you in his favor inquired mr talbot smiling not at first however it led to a little conversation by which i learned that he was a street candy merchant and that some young thief had run off with all his stock in trade he was then in hot pursuit learning that his mother was a seamstress and a worthy woman i employed her to make me some shirts i have followed the fortunes of the family and have been pauls adviser since then and latterly his banker he is now proprietor of a streetstand and making for a boy of his age quite a fair income your account interests me if i am as well satisfied as i hope to be with the family i will hereafter seek out some way of serving him i am certain you will be satisfied the two gentlemen now conversed of other things with which the reader has no concern paul went home in high spirits and delighted his mother and jimmy with the gift he had received now mother he said get on your bonnet and shawl and well go out shopping wont you take me too paul asked jimmy to be sure i will i am going to buy you a suit of clothes jimmy the little boy clapped his hands new clothes were a rarity to him and the purchase of a new suit therefore would be a memorable event i do not propose to detail pauls purchases they consisted of new suits for jimmy and himself and a complete outfit of under garments closing with the purchase of two plain substantial trunks mrs hoffman deferred her own shopping till monday when later in the day the various articles arrived paul regarded them with much complacency it looks as if we were getting up in the world he said you deserve to succeed paul said his mother you have been industrious and faithful and god has prospered you i have had a good mother to encourage me said paul or i should not have done so well you are right to say that paul said mrs norton it isnt every boy that has a good mother that is true there are some boys i know who would do well if their mothers were not shiftless and intemperate you remember tommy oconnor mother dont you yes paul i met him in nassau street yesterday he was lounging about in rags doing nothing he asked me to lend him five cents i asked him why he was not at work he said his mother took all his money and spent it for drink then she got quarrelsome and beat him how can any mother behave in that way said mrs hoffman shuddering i dont know but there is more than one mother that does it though its more likely to be the father the next day dawned bright and pleasant can i put on my new clothes paul asked jimmy yes said paul its sunday and well all put on our best clothes and go to church i should like that said the little boy delighted mrs hoffman readily agreed to the plan if of late the family had remained at home on sunday it was at first for want of good clothing not from any want of respect for religious institutions during mr hoffmans life they had attended regularly and paul had belonged to a sundayschool jimmy being too young the church they had formerly attended being in harlem they could not of course go so far but dropped into one not far from union square they were shown seats by the sexton and listened attentively to the services though it must be confessed that jimmys attention was occasionally diverted to his new clothes of which he was not a little proud mrs hoffman felt glad once more to find herself enjoying religious privileges and determined henceforth to attend regularly as they were leaving the church paul suddenly found himself to his surprise next to mr and mrs talbot whom he had not before observed goodmorning mr talbot he said mr talbot turned on being addressed and said what paul are you here mr talbot this is my mother said paul mrs hoffman said mr talbot with as much courtesy as if he were addressing his social equal i am glad to make your acquaintance my dear this is mrs hoffman mrs talbot greeted both cordially and made some inquiries about jimmy she observed with pleasure the neat appearance of the entire family feeling sure that those who were so careful about their own appearance would be equally careful of her house she also thought more favorably of them for their attendance at church having herself a high respect for religious observances of course paul and his mother thanked her in fitting terms for the gift which had enabled them to replace their losses by the fire after a brief conversation they parted mr and mrs talbot going uptown while paul and his mother had nearly two miles to walk in a different direction next sunday we shall be walking uptown also said paul it will look well in the directory paul hoffman merchant house madison avenue wont it yes said his mother so long as it doesnt mention that you live in the basement some time i hope to occupy a whole house of my own in madison avenue perhaps so who knows i see paul you are getting ambitious where shall i be paul asked jimmy who felt that his future prospects deserved consideration oh youll be a famous artist and have a studio on fifth avenue do you think so paul asked the little fellow seriously i hope so all you want is a little help from me now and then if i had time i would give you a course of lessons in drawing you draw awfully paul do you draw any better of course i do mother said paul with much gravity that boys selfconceit is unbounded you ought to talk to him about it but though paul liked to joke jimmy he had already decided after they moved uptown to give him an opportunity of developing his talent by engaging a drawing teacher for him the large saving in their expenses from not being obliged to pay rent would allow him to do this easily he had not yet mentioned this to jimmy for he meant to surprise him chapter ix julius at the time appointed paul and his mother moved into their new home it was necessary to buy but a small quantity of new furniture as mrs talbot authorized them to take down from the upper rooms anything of which they had need she was led to this offer by the favorable opinion she had formed of mrs hoffman with the exception therefore of some bedding and a rockingchair the latter purchased nothing it took a little time of course to get accustomed to their new quarters when however they had got to feel at home they enjoyed them it was no longer possible of course for paul to come home to the noonday meal since the distance between his place of business and the house on madison avenue was two miles and a half he therefore was accustomed to take his lunch at a restaurant for his mother had adopted the common new york custom of having dinner at the end of the day it was about six weeks after pauls removal to madison avenue that one day on approaching the restaurant on fulton street where he proposed to lunch his attention was drawn to a famishedlooking boy who was looking in at the window at the viands within it was impossible to misinterpret his hungry look paul understood it at once and his heart was stirred with compassion his own prosperity had not hardened him but rendered him more disposed to lend a helping hand to those more needy are you hungry johnny he asked the boy turned at the sound of the words aint i just he said didnt you have any breakfast i had a piece of bread was that all yes could you eat a plate of meat if i gave you some try me and see was the reply come in then said paul will you pay for it asked the young arab almost incredulous yes i will pay for it the boy waited for no further assurance he was not in a position to refuse so advantageous a proposal he shuffled in therefore directly behind paul it was not an aristocratic eatinghouse but its guests were welldressed and the ragged boy at once attracted unfavorable attention get out of here said a waiter he told me to come in said the boy beginning to tremble at the thought of losing the proffered dinner paul at whom he pointed was known at the restaurant did this boy come in with you asked the waiter yes said paul hes going to dine with me all right the waiter was rather surprised at pauls selection of a table companion but payment being thus guaranteed could interpose no further objections sit down there johnny said paul indicating a seat at one of the side tables and taking the seat opposite himself now whatll you have he asked handing his young guest the bill of fare the young arab took it and holding it upside down looked at it in perplexity i cant read said he handing it back i suppose you can eat though said paul whatll you have anything thats good i aint pertikler said the boy do you like stewed oysters the boy eagerly replied in the affirmative stewed oysters for two ordered paul thatll do to begin on johnny whats your real name julius anything else thats all the name i know you can take another when you need it did you ever hear of julius caesar yes said the boy paul was a little surprised to discover the boys range of historical information what do you know about him he asked i dont know him ive seed him said the boy where have you seen him asked paul rather astonished down in baxter street does he live there asked paul yes he keeps a barber shop there evidently the young arab supposed that julius caesar colored barber within the precincts of the five points was the one referred to by his questioner paul did not explain to him his mistake have you got any father or mother no said the boy where do you live in centre street what do you do for a living sometimes i black boots sometimes i beg who do you live with jack morgan is he any relation to you i dunno answered the boy the conversation was here interrupted the stews were placed on the table with a plate of crackers the boys eyes glistened he seized the spoon and attacked his share with evident appetite poor little chap thought paul sympathetically he doesnt often get a good dinner today he shall have all he can eat when the boy had finished he said will you have some pudding or would you like some more oysters id like the oysters if its all the same to you answered julius another stew and some apple dumpling ordered paul julius was in appearance about twelve years of age in reality he was fourteen being small of his age he had black hair and a dark complexion his face was thin and his figure slender he had the expression of one who was used to privation and knew how to bear it without much hope of anything better his clothes were soiled and ragged but his face was clean water was cheap and he was unfashionably neat for the quarter in which he lived the stew was brought and an extra plate of bread and butter now go ahead said paul eat all you want julius needed no other invitation he proceeded vigorously to accomplish the work before him and soon both bread and oysters were disposed of have you got enough asked paul smiling yes said julius im full have you ever seen the satisfied look of an alderman as he rose from a sumptuous civic banquet the same expression was visible on the face of the young arab as he leaned back in his chair with his hands thrust into his pockets then said paul we may as well be going the boy seized his ragged cap and followed his benefactor from the eatinghouse when they reached the sidewalk he turned to paul and said that was a bully dinner paul understood that he intended to thank him though his gratitude was not directly expressed im glad you liked it said he but i must be going now julius looked after him until he turned the corner hes been good to me he said to himself maybe i can do something for him some day the young arab had had few occasions for gratitude the world had been a hard stepmother to him it was years since he had known father or mother and as long as he could remember he had been under the guardianship of a social outlaw named jack morgan who preyed upon the community whenever he got a chance whenever he was under the ban of the law julius had shifted for himself or been transferred to one of his lawless companions the chances seemed to be in favor of julius growing up such another as his guardian had he been differently constituted he would have been worse than he was but his natural instincts were healthful and when he had been left entirely to himself he had lived by honest industry devoting himself to some of the street occupations which were alone open to him his most perilous period was when jack resumed his guardianship as he had done a fortnight previous on being released from a three months residence at blackwells island what the tie was between him and the boy was unknown julius knew that jack was not his father for the latter had never made that claim sometimes he vaguely intimated that julius was the son of his sister and consequently his nephew but as at times he gave a different account julius did not know what to think but he had always acquiesced in his guardianship and whenever jack was at liberty had without hesitation gone back to him after a brief pause julius followed paul to the corner and saw him take his place beside the necktie stand he then remembered to have seen him there before i thought i knowd him he said ill remember him now he wandered about vaguely having no regular occupation he had had a blackingbox and brush but it had been stolen and he had not replaced it he had asked jack to lend him the money requisite to set him up in the business again but the latter had put him off intimating that he should have something else for him to do julius had therefore postponed seeking any other employment beyond hovering about the piers and railway stations on the chance of obtaining a job to carry a carpetbag or valise this was a precarious employment and depended much more on good fortune than the business of a newsboy or bootblack however in the course of the afternoon julius earned twentyfive cents for carrying a carpetbag to frenchs hotel that satisfied him for he was not very ambitious he invested the greater part of it in some coffee and cakes at one of the booths in fulton market and about nine oclock tired with his days tramp sought the miserable apartment in centre street which he shared with jack morgan chapter x a room in centre street in a room on the third floor of a miserable tenement house in centre street two men were sitting each had a forbidding exterior and neither was in any danger of being mistaken for a peaceful lawabiding citizen one attired in a red shirt and pants was leaning back in his chair smoking a clay pipe his hair was dark and his beard nearly a week old over his left eye was a scar the reminder of a wound received in one of the numerous affrays in which he had been engaged this was jack morgan already referred to as the guardian of the boy julius he was certainly a disreputablelooking ruffian and his character did not belie his looks the other man was taller better dressed and somewhat more respectable in appearance but like jack he too was a social outlaw and the more dangerous that he could more easily assume an air of respectability and pass muster if he chose as an honest man well marlowe said jack morgan to the latter who had just entered hows business not very good said marlowe shaking his head i havent been so hard up for a long time you havent lost much by being shut up ive had my board and lodging free said morgan but id rather look out for myself i dont like free hotels marlowe smiled thats where youre right jack i never tried it but once and then i didnt like it any better than you youre a sharp one you always cover your tracks the cops dont often get hold of me said marlowe with pride you remember that big bond robbery a year ago yes you wasnt in that yes i was the rest of the fellows got trapped thats so but i heard in time and got off did you make anything out of it i made sure of a thousanddollar bond did you put it off yes i sold it for half price where is the money it lasted me a month said marlowe coolly i lived then you can bet but i havent done much since do you see that he took from his vest pocket a dollar greenback what of it its my last dollar then youve got to do something yes havent you thought of anything ive got a plan that may work here julius entered and his entrance produced a brief interruption what luck julius asked morgan nothing much i got a bundle to carry for a quarter have you got the money theres ten cents i bought my supper with the rest give it to me jack morgan took the ten cents and thrust it into his pocket you aint smart julius he said you ought to have brought more than that buy me a blackingbox and i will said julius ill see about it but marlowe you were just goin to tell me of your plan shall i tell before him asked marlowe indicating the boy drive ahead hes one of us theres a house on madison avenue that ive heard about it belongs to a man thats gone to europe then there isnt much left in it worth taking thats where youre wrong ive found out that he has left all his plate locked up in a safe on the second floor and some bonds too its most likely has he got much so i hear who told you a man that was in his service he was discharged for drunkenness and he owes this mr talbot a grudge is he a thief himself no but he is willing to help us out of revenge then you can depend on his information yes there is no doubt of it is the house empty no theres a family in charge thats bad not so bad its a widow with two children one a little boy of eight or thereabouts the other sixteen do you know anything about them the oldest boy is a street peddler he keeps a necktie stand below the astor house hitherto julius had not taken much interest in the conversation that his disreputable guardian should be planning a burglary did not strike him with surprise it seemed only a matter of course but the last remark of marlowe put a different face upon the matter the description was so exact that he felt almost certain the boy spoken of must be his new friend to whom he had been indebted for the best dinner he had eaten for many a day he began to listen now but not too obtrusively as that might awaken suspicion a boy of sixteen may give trouble said jack morgan he is easily disposed of said marlowe indifferently i wish it were only the woman and little boy we had to deal with we can easily secure the boys absence for that night how i cant tell yet but theres plenty of ways he might be arrested on a false charge and kept over night in the stationhouse or theres other ways but i cant tell till i know more about him a letter might be sent him asking him to go over to brooklyn wouldnt do his mother would get somebody else in his place we must find out all about him hows that boy of yours is he sharp he ought to be hes knocked about for himself long enough we can try him come here my son julius rose from his seat and walked up to the pair hark you my lad can you do as youre told julius nodded weve got something for you to do itll lead to money do you hear i hear said julius have you heard what we were talking about i heard but i didnt mind then i want you to hear and mind too now have you ever seen a necktie stand between dey and cortlandt streets yes theres a boy keeps it ive seed him so far so good then do you know anything about him julius shook his head then i want you to find out all you can about him find out if hes got any friends in brooklyn or just outside of the city ill tell you what i know about him and then you must learn as much more as possible do you know his name no it is paul hoffman he and his mother live in a house that they take care of on madison avenue we want to break into that house some night next week and carry off some plate and bonds that are in the safe if we make the haul well do well by you i understand said julius nodding intelligently what we want pursued marlowe is to have the boy sleep out of the house the night we make the attempt that will leave the coast clear if the woman wakes up and discovers us well threaten to kill her if she makes any fuss do you hear julius nodded again do you think you can do what we want yes thats well well wait for the boys report before we lay our plans jack now thats settled well send out for some whisky and drink success to the job then you must find the money marlowe for im dead broke here boy take this said marlowe handing julius the bill he had recently displayed and bring back a pint of whisky all right said julius and mind you bring back the change or i must go without breakfast tomorrow morning ill remember said julius when he had gone out marlowe said where did you pick up that boy jack he isnt your son is he no i have no son i picked him up one day when he was a little chap he didnt seem to belong to nobody so i took him home and hes been with me ever since where does he go when you are shut up jack thats a good part of the time you know into the streets he picks up a living there somehow i dont ask how and he always comes back to you when you get out again yes loves you like a father eh said marlowe laughing hes used to me said jack indifferently not being sentimental he never troubled himself to expect affection from his young ward and would not have felt very deeply afflicted if he had deserted him still he too had got used to the society of julius who was the only living thing that clung to him and probably would have felt a degree of regret at his loss there are few however callous who do not feel some satisfaction in companionship marlowe laughed what are you laughing at said jack i was thinking jack that you wasnt exactly the right sort to train up a boy in the way he should go and all that if he takes pattern by you its easy to tell where hell fetch up he aint a bad sort said jack has he ever been over to the island no then he hasnt followed your teaching thats all i can say never mind about the boy said jack who had grown weary of the subject he can take care of himself here julius reappeared with the whisky both men brightened up at the sight of their favorite beverage have you got a pack of cards asked marlowe are there any cards asked jack appealing to julius the boy found some hidden away in the cupboard and the men taking them were soon intent upon a game of poker julius looked on for a time for he too knew something of the game but after a time he became drowsy and threw himself upon a pallet in the corner which he shared with his guardian he didnt sleep immediately however for now that his attention was drawn away from the game he began to consider how he should act in the matter which had been confided to him should he prove true to his guardian and treacherous to paul or should he repay the latter for the kindness he had received at his hands it was a difficult question while he was pondering it his eyes closed and he fell asleep the men continued to play for about two hours for penny stakes the game had no interest for them unless something was staked upon it and the winner pocketed his winnings with as much satisfaction as if it had been a thousand times as large chapter xi free lunch about seven oclock the next morning julius awoke jack morgan was still asleep and breathing heavily his coarse features looked even more brutal in his state of unconsciousness the boy raised himself on his elbow and looked thoughtfully at him as he slept how did i come to be with him this was the question which passed through the boys mind he aint my father for hes told me so is he my uncle i wonder sometimes but not often this question had suggested itself to julius but in general he had not troubled himself much about ancestry a good dinner was of far more importance to him than to know who his father or grandfather had been he did not pretend to have a warm affection for the man between whom and himself existed the only tie that bound him to any fellowcreature they had got used to each other as jack expressed it and that served to keep them together when the law did not interfere to keep them apart in general julius had obeyed such orders as jack gave him but now for the first time a question of doubt arose in his mind he was called upon to do something which would injure paul whose kindness had produced a strong impression upon him should he do it this led him to consider how far he was bound to obey jack morgan he could not see that he had anything to be grateful for if jack was flush he received some slight advantage on the other hand he was expected to give most of his earnings to his guardian when they were living together while he was thinking the man opened his eyes awake eh he asked yes said julius what time is it the clock has gone seven i can tell that by my stomach ive got a healthy appetite this morning have you got any money not a penny jack thats bad just feel in the pocket of my breeches there they are on the floor see if you can find anything julius rose from the pallet and did as he was ordered theres twelve cents he said good well divide we can get a breakfast at bradys free lunch saloon take six cents of it i aint going to get up yet all right said the boy you must look sharp and pick up some money before night or we shall go to bed hungry do you hear yes jack when marlowe and i get hold of that gold and plate in madison avenue well have a grand blowout you remember what marlowe told you last night about the boy that keeps the necktie stand near dey street yes i am to find out all i can about him yes see if you can find out if he has any friends out of the city julius nodded we want to have the coast clear so that we can break in next monday night the sooner the better im dead broke and so is marlowe but i guess we can stand it till then all right jack morgan turned over and composed himself to sleep again he had said all he thought necessary and had no pressing business to call him up julius opened the door and went out down the rickety stairs and out through a narrow covered alleyway to the street for the room which jack morgan and he occupied was in a rear tenement house several dirty and unsavorylooking children they could not well be otherwise in such a locality barefooted and bareheaded were playing in the court julius passed them by and sauntered along toward the city hall park he met several acquaintances newsboys and bootblacks the former crying the news the latter either already employed or looking for a job where are you goin julius asked a bootblack of his acquaintance goin to get breakfast got any stamps sixpence you cant get a square meal for that im goin to freelunch places thats good if youre hard up what are you doin now nothin much why dont you black boots havent got any box or brush you can borrow mine if youll give me half you make what are you goin to do ill try sellin papers for a change ill do it said julius promptly for he saw that the arrangement would under the circumstances be a good one for him where will i see you tonight ill be here at six oclock all right hand over your box so the business arrangement was concluded an arrangement not uncommon among street professionals it is an illustration on a small scale of the advantage of capital the lucky possessor of two or three extra blackingboxes has it in his power to derive quite a revenue enormous when the amount of his investment is considered as a general thing such contracts however burdensome to one party are faithfully kept it might be supposed that boys of ordinary shrewdness would as soon as possible save up enough to buy a box and brush of their own but as they only receive half profits that is not easy after defraying expenses of lodging and meals julius obtained one job before going to breakfast he waited for another but as none seemed forthcoming he shouldered his box and walked down nassau street till he reached a basement over which was the sign free lunch he went downstairs and entered a dark basement room on one side was a bar with a variety of bottles exposed at the lower end of the apartment was a table containing a couple of plates of bread and butter and slices of cold meat this was the free lunch for which no charge was made but it was understood to be free to those only who had previously ordered and paid for a drink many came in only for the drinks so that on the whole the business was a paying one julius walked up to the bar and called for a glass of lager here johnny said the barkeeper while he was drinking a miserablelooking man whose outward appearance seemed to indicate that fortune had not smiled upon him lately sidled in and without coming to the bar walked up to the table where the free lunch was spread out whatll you have to drink my friend asked the barkeeper pointedly the man looked rather abashed and fumbled in his pockets im out of money he stammered then keep away from the lunch if you please said the proprietor of the establishment no lunch without a drink thats my rule im very hungry faltered the man in a weak voice i havent tasted food for twentyfour hours why dont you work i cant get work thats your lookout my lunch is for those who drink first julius had listened to this conversation with attention he knew what it was to be hungry more than once he had gone about with an empty stomach and no money to buy food he saw that the man was weak and unnerved by hunger and he spoke on the impulse of the moment placing five cents in his hand take that and buy a drink god bless you uttered the man seizing the coin whatll you have asked the barkeeper anything the money will buy a glass of lager was placed in his hands and eagerly quaffed then he went up to the table and ate almost ravenously julius bearing him company god bless you boy he said may you never know what it is to be hungry and without a penny in your pocket ive knowed it moren once said julius have you already poor boy what do you do for a living sometimes one thing sometimes another said julius im blackin boots now so i am relieved by the charity of a bootblack murmured the other thoughtfully the boy has a heart cant you get nothin to do asked julius out of curiosity yes yes enough to do but no money said the other look here said the barkeeper dont you eat all there is on the table that wont pay on a fivecent drink that wont he had some cause for speaking for the man who was almost famished had already eaten heartily he desisted as he heard these words and turned to go out i feel better he said i was very weak when i came in thank you my boy and he offered his hand to julius which the latter took readily it aint nothin he said modestly to me it is a great deal i hope we shall meet again street boy as he was julius had found some one more destitute than himself and out of his own poverty he had relieved the pressing need of another it made him feel lighterhearted than usual it was the consciousness of having done a good action which generally brings its own reward however trifling it may have been though himself uneducated he noticed that the man whom he had relieved used better language than was common among those with whom he was accustomed to associate and he wondered how such a man should have become so poor i dont want to see that man again said the barkeeper he spends five cents and eats twenty cents worth if all my customers were like that i should soon have to stop business do you know him never seed him afore said julius he shouldered his box and ascended the steps to the sidewalk above he resolved to look out for business for the next two hours and then go around to the necktie stand of paul hoffman chapter xii a good action meets its reward paul hoffman was standing beside his stock in trade when all at once he heard the question so common in that neighborhood shine yer boots i guess not said paul who felt that his income did not yet warrant a daily outlay of ten cents for what he could easily do himself ill shine em for nothin said the boy such a novel proposition induced paul to notice more particularly the boy who made it why for nothing he asked in surprise not recognizing julius you gave me a dinner yesterday said julius are you the boy asked paul with interest im the one answered julius will you have a shine i dont want any pay for the dinner said paul youre welcome to it id rather give you a shine persisted julius all right said paul pleased by his grateful spirit and he put out his foot wont you let me pay for it asked paul when the job was finished and his boots were resplendent with a firstclass polish no said julius hastily drawing back thank you then have you had good luck this morning i got four shines said julius i once blacked boots myself for a little while said paul youre doin better now yes im doing better now so will you some day i hope do you live in a house on madison avenue asked julius abruptly yes said paul surprised who told you you take care of the house for a gentleman as has gone to europe dont you how do you know it demanded paul i want to tell you something said julius only dont you never let on as i told you all right go ahead said paul more and more mystified aint there some gold and bonds kept in the house why do you ask demanded paul eying the boy with suspicion theres a couple of chaps thats plannin to rob the house said julius sinking his voice almost to a whisper and looking cautiously about him to guard against being overheard who are they how do you know it asked paul startled one is jack morgan the man i live with the other is a friend of his tom marlowe did you hear them talking about it yes last night did they tell you about it they wanted me to find out all about you if youd got any friends in brooklyn or anywheres round they want to get you off the night theyre goin to break in when is that next monday what made you tell me all this cause you was good to me and give me a dinner when i was hungry give me your hand said paul his heart warming toward the boy who exhibited so uncommon a feeling as gratitude its dirty said julius showing his hand stained with blacking never mind said paul grasping it warmly youre a good fellow and id rather take your hand than a good many thats cleaner julius rough arab as he was looked gratified and his face brightened he felt that he was appreciated and was glad he had revealed the plot now said paul you have told me about this mans plans are you willing to help me further are you willing to let me know anything more that you find out about the robbery yes i will said julius unhesitatingly then ill depend upon you what sort of a man is this that you live with whats his name his name is jack morgan hes a bad sort he is hes shut up most of the time what makes you stay with him im used to him there aint nobody else i belong to is he your father no he aint any relation sometimes he says hes my uncle but maybe it aint so i dunno is he a strong man yes hes a hard customer in a fight how about the other man thats marlowe hes the same sort i like jack best do you think they will try to break in next monday night if they think you are away what will you tell them what do you want me to tell them asked julius looking at him earnestly i dont know said paul thoughtfully if you should say i was going to be away theyd want to know where and how you found out they might suspect something thats so said julius suppose they heard that i would remain in the house what would they do to prevent it they might get you took up on a false charge and put in the stationhouse over night or maybe theyd seize you if they got a chance and lock you up somewhere how could they have heard that mr talbot left any valuables in the house julius shook his head on that point he could give no information you may tell them said paul after a moments thought that i have an aunt mrs green living in brooklyn whereabouts in brooklyn no third avenue said paul at a venture can you remember yes they will probably send a message from her late monday evening for me to go over there will you go i will leave the house for they will probably be watching but i shall not go far and i shall leave the house well guarded julius nodded ill tell em he said he was about to go when paul called him back wont you get yourself into trouble he said i should not want to have any harm come to you they wont know im in the game answered julius will you come tomorrow and let me know what they say yes julius crossed broadway and turned into fulton street leaving paul full of thought he felt what a great advantage it was to be forewarned of the impending danger since being forewarned was forearmed as with the help of the police he could prepare for his burglarious visitors he saw that the money he had paid for a dinner for a hungry boy was likely to prove an excellent investment and he determined that this should not be the last favor julius received from him meanwhile julius returned to business with the help of his blacking materials he succeeded in earning a dollar before the close of the day unluckily half of this was to be given to the young capitalist who had supplied him with a box and brush but still fifty cents was more than he would probably have earned if he had been compelled to depend upon chance jobs at six oclock he met his young employer and handed over fifty cents which the other pocketed with much satisfaction do you want to take the box agin tomorrow he asked yes said julius all right you can keep it then you can take it home with you and bring me the stamps tomorrow night at this same hour so the contract was continued and julius having treated himself to some supper went home jack morgan was already there he looked up as julius entered whered you get that box he asked i borrored it of a boy yes i give him half i makes how much did you make today ten shines that was a dollar and half of it went to you yes jack where is it i had to get my dinner and supper theres all thats left he handed jack ten cents why didnt you keep the whole of the money grumbled jack you neednt have paid the boy hed have licked me then id lick him julius shook his head that would be cheatin he said i wouldnt want to cheat him when he give me the box oh youre gettin mighty particular sneered jack not very well satisfied at having so large a portion of the boys earnings diverted from himself if i had a box and brush of my own i could keep all the stamps i made said julius im dead broke i cant give you no money to buy one did you go to see that boy i told you of paul hoffman yes if thats his name yes i went to see him and did you find out anything asked jack with eagerness yes well out with it then dont let me do all the talking hes got an aunt as lives in brooklyn whereabouts no third avenue how did you find out i got him to talkin thats good and did he suspect you no said julius no third avenue repeated jack i must put that down did he tell you the name mrs green thats good well trump up a message from her late monday evening i wish i knew how things was arranged in the house maybe i could go there said julius what to the house yes i could go there in the evenin and ask him if hed let me have some old clothes maybe hed invite me upstairs and you could use your eyes thats a good idea but i dont believe youd get a chance to go up shall i try yes you may try tomorrow night if we make a haul you shall have your share halloo marlowe these last words were addressed to marlowe who entered unceremoniously without knocking im in luck said marlowe heres a fiver and he displayed a fivedollar greenback come out and well have a jolly supper jack accepted the invitation with alacrity communicating to his companion as they walked along the information julius had picked up chapter xiii paul makes a purchase it is not very pleasant to be informed that your house is to be entered by burglars still if such an event is in prospect it is well to know it beforehand while paul felt himself fortunate in receiving the information which julius gave him he also felt anxious however well he might be prepared to meet the attack he did not like to have his mother and jimmy in the house when it was made burglars in nearly every case are armed and if brought to bay would doubtless use their arms and the possible result of a chance shot was to be dreaded on monday night therefore if that should be the one decided upon by the burglars he made up his mind that his mother and jimmy should sleep out of the house he lost no time in proposing this plan to his mother mother said he on reaching home i have had some news today not bad i hope said mrs hoffman i leave you to judge answered paul with a smile we are to have visitors next monday evening visitors paul who are they mr jack morgan and mr marlowe are they friends of yours i never heard you mention them i never saw them that i know of then why did you invite them here they invited themselves i dont understand it paul if you dont know them why should they invite themselves here perhaps youll understand me better mother when i tell you their business what is it they are burglars burglars repeated mrs hoffman turning suddenly pale and sinking back into a chair for she had been standing yes mother they have found out though i cant tell how that there are some bonds and plate in the safe upstairs and that is their reason for coming how did you find out paul what a dreadful thing gasped mrs hoffman it will be worse for them than for us i am thinking said paul it was a boy told me a boy that lives with them ill tell you about it he gave his mother an account of what had already been communicated to him oh dear we shall be murdered in our beds exclaimed his mother in dismal accents upon this jimmy began to cry but paul only laughed i thought you were braver jimmy he said if i buy you a pistol will you promise to use it i dont know said jimmy dubiously i should be afraid to shoot a great big man would he have a pistol too probably at this jimmy began to cry again and paul hastened to say dont be afraid i dont mean to have you sleep in the house that night where can we go i think mrs norton will let you stop with her that night and you will come too paul said mrs hoffman and let the house be robbed mother what would mr talbot think of that but you will be killed what can you do against such bad men what would you recommend mother asked paul you might write a letter to them telling them you knew all about their plan and you would have them arrested if they came i dont think mother said paul laughing that that would be the best course i want to get them here and catch them then they can be shut up and we shall be safe from any further attempts i am going to police headquarters and they will tell me what to do probably two or three officers will be concealed in the house and when the burglars are fairly in will arrest them you neednt stay paul it is my duty mother we are left by mr talbot in charge of the house and what it contains some of us ought to be here at such a time i will take care not to get into danger mrs hoffman was a woman and a mother and it was with difficulty that paul could convince her that it was his duty to remain at length however she acquiesced and agreed to go and see mrs norton the next day and ask permission to remain with her on monday night the next day julius came to pauls stand is there any news julius asked paul nothin much said julius jack wants me to call up to your house and find out where the gold is kept how does he think you are going to do it without my suspecting he told me to go up and ask for some old clothes then if you didnt let me into the house i was to ask for something to eat a good plan said paul when are you coming tonight very well ill be ready for you is there any change in the evening no theyre comin monday night ill be ready for them said paul what are you goin to do asked julius and he fixed a pair of sharp black eyes on paul can i trust you julius demanded paul with a keen glance at the boy yes said julius then said paul i mean to have them arrested theyll walk into a trap julius looked thoughtful dont you like it julius i dunno said the boy slowly do you like this man morgan i dont like him im used to him and you dont like the idea of his being arrested through your means julius nodded i know how you feel but i dont see how it can be helped if he didnt rob us he would rob somebody else did he ever do any honest work not as i knows on how does he live by stealin and gamblin i hope he wont teach you to follow his example julius i dont want to be like him why not i want to be respectable like you you know its wrong to steal yes said julius but without any great depth of conviction the fact is stealing was too familiar to his observation to excite in him detestation or horror but he was a sharp boy he knew that his guardian for the last five years had spent more than half the time in confinement even when free he lived from hand to mouth julius had made up his mind that it did not pay he saw that an honest mechanic got a good deal more comfort and enjoyment out of life than jack and he had a vague wish to become respectable this was encouraging as far as it went higher considerations might come by and by if you want to be respectable julius ill help you said paul will you said julius yes you are doing me a great favor i shall be in your debt and thats the way i will pay you you mustnt grow up like the man you live with i dont want to well talk about that after monday we shall have more time then shall i come up tonight then yes come julius strolled away with his blackingbox and paul was left to his reflections hell make a good boy if hes only encouraged said paul to himself i dont know what would have become of me if id been brought up by burglars like him theres nothing like having a good mother there aint any excuse for a boy going wrong if hes got a good mother paul was right our destinies are decided more than we know by circumstances if the street boys brought up to a familiarity with poverty and often with vice and crime go astray we should pity as well as condemn and if we have it in our power to make the conditions of life more favorable for any it is our duty as the stewards of our common father to do what we can it occurred to paul that he had no old clothes to give julius all his wardrobe not very extensive at the best having been burned up in the fire which consumed his old home as he had told julius to come up it was necessary that he should have something to give him and he therefore decided to provide himself at a secondhand clothing store he knew well enough where they were to be found his old street companions used to go to chatham street and baxter street in search of clothing and these localities though not distinguished for fashion are at least reasonable in their scale of prices a little earlier than usual paul closed his stand and walked across the city hall park and up chatham street to a store he had frequently seen like most of its class it had a large portion of its stock displayed outside where the proprietor stood keeneyed and watchful on the lookout for customers can i sell you something this afternoon he asked obsequiously as paul halted in front of his store that depends upon whether i see anything that suits me answered paul before he had finished the dealer had seized his arm and hurrying him into the store pulled down a coat on the merits of which he began to expatiate with voluble tongue i dont want anything for myself said paul i want to buy a coat for a boy of twelve have you got anything of the right size paul need not have asked the trader was keen at a sale and if barnums giant had called for a secondhand suit would have sworn boldly that he had the very thing in the present case paul found a coat which as well as he could judge would about fit julius at any rate the street boy was not likely to be fastidious as to the quality or exact fit of a coat which at all events would be a decided improvement upon the one he was now wearing what is the price of this asked paul five dollars was the reply paul was too well accustomed to the ways of chatham street to pay the first price demanded or the second or third finally he succeeded in getting the coat for one dollar and a half which was cheap although the dealer made a fair profit even at this price before the bargain was concluded a tall man strayed in and watched the bargaining with slight interest paul would have been not a little surprised had he known that this man was one of the burglars against whom he was contriving measures of defense it was indeed marlowe who having dexterously picked the pocket of a passenger on the third avenue cars an hour before found himself thirty dollars richer by the operation and being himself out at elbows had entered this shop on an errand similar to pauls what can i sell you asked the shopkeeper to his new customer i want a coat said marlowe roughly good and cheap dont try any of your swindling tricks on me for i wont stand them with the details of the negotiation that followed we have nothing to do it is enough to say that this chance meeting between paul and marlowe was not without its results though neither knew the other chapter xiv the spot upon the coat when julius went home at six oclock he found marlowe and his guardian if jack morgan deserves the title sitting over a game of cards they looked up as he entered the room well julius how are you getting on asked jack have you found out anything more not yet jack then its time you did im goin up to the house tonight does he know it yes he told me to come what made him do that i axed him for some old clothes he told me to come up tonight and hed give me some thats good said jack approvingly mind you keep your eyes open when youre there find out where the swag is kept itll save me and marlowe some trouble julius nodded ill do my best he said what time are you going up in an hour or so i hope well make a haul marlowe said jack i havent been in luck lately if i could raise a thousand or so id clear out of these diggings the cops know me too well where would you go supposin you got the money asked his companion id go to california they dont know me there something might turn up for me ill go with you jack if you go ive got tired of new york and as you say they know me too well hereabouts will you take the boy no said jack carelessly he knows how to take care of himself hell be better off here julius listened to this conversation thoughtfully watching the speaker as he spoke and it helped him to a decision in a matter that had troubled him somewhat he could not help seeing that jack morgan cared nothing for him except so far as it suited his convenience to have his companionship looking back he could not see that he owed him any gratitude the balance of favors was on the other side he had done more for jack than jack for him he asked himself if he wanted to go with jack morgan on this journey and he answered his own question in the negative it was better that he should leave him now forever with him he could only look forward to a future of shame and disgrace what are you thinking about boy asked marlowe do you want to go to california with jack and me no answered julius why not id rather stay here answered julius shortly when i was a lad id have liked to go off on a journey like that i like stayin here hes used to the streets said jack he likes em thats best as he cant go can you take care of yourself asked marlowe i always has said julius thats so said jack laughing you aint given me much trouble julius the men resumed their game and the boy looked on silently after awhile seven oclock struck and julius rose from his seat im goin he said all right julius keep your eyes open i know said the boy he had saved enough money to pay for a ride uptown he took the fourth avenue cars and in half an hour found that he had reached the cross street nearest to his destination five minutes later he rang the basement bell of the house in madison avenue paul saw him enter the area and went himself to open the door come in julius he said i have been expecting you have you had any supper i bought some coffee and cakes i think you can eat a little more said paul smiling mother cant you give julius some dinner is this the boy you expected paul yes mother i saved some for him sit down at the table julius she said hospitably julius did as he was told and directly mrs hoffman took from the oven a plate of meat and vegetables which had thus been kept warm and poured out a cup of tea also these were placed before the young arab his eyes lighted up with pleasure at the tempting feast and the vigor of his assaults showed that the coffee and cakes which he had partaken had by no means destroyed his appetite mrs hoffman and paul looked on with pleasure glad that they had been able to give pleasure to their young visitor jimmy who had heard them speak of julius hovered near surveying him with curiosity he wanted to interview julius but hardly knew how to begin finally he ventured to ask are you the boy that lives with the robbers jimmy said his mother reprovingly but julius was not sensitive yes he answered aint you afraid of them continued jimmy what for asked julius because robbers are bad men they wouldnt hurt me said the young arab indifferently you aint a robber are you no said julius in a matteroffact tone what makes you live with them i havent got anybody else to live with said julius are they going to rob this house jimmy you are talking too much said paul reprovingly i suppose they havent changed their plans have they julius no they mean to come next monday yes did they know you were coming up here this evening yes i told em you were goin to give me some cloes yes said paul ive got a coat for you he opened a bundle and displayed the purchase he had made that afternoon in chatham street try it on julius he said julius took off the ragged coat he had on and tried on the one paul had purchased it is an excellent fit said mrs hoffman look at yourself in the glass said paul julius surveyed himself with satisfaction though secondhand the coat was decidedly superior to the one he had taken off its a bully coat he said thank you you are quite welcome julius you may as well wear it you can put your old one in a paper and take it back with you jack wanted me to find out where the money was kept said julius you may tell him it is in a safe in the front room on the second floor but how did he expect you would find out he left that to me and what will you tell him i dunno ill think of something he wont suspect you will he i guess not suppose he did hed kill me said julius what a dreadful man he must be exclaimed mrs hoffman shuddering how do you dare to live with him i shant live with him much longer said julius he said tonight hed go to californy if he got swag enough here what is swag asked mrs hoffman bewildered he means money or articles of value explained paul i dont think hell go to california julius i think hell go somewhere else i guess ill go said julius moving toward the door you need not be in a hurry we should like to have you stay longer hell expect me said julius go then if you think it best but it is a long distance downtown and you must be tired here is money to pay your fare in the cars thank yer said julius he accepted the money and went out first however promising to call upon paul the next day at his stand and let him know whether there was any change in jack morgans plans i pity the poor boy said mrs hoffman after he went out what a dreadful thing it is to live with such a desperate man i will see what i can do to help him next week said paul we shall owe him something for letting us know of the robbery i shudder to think what might have happened if we had been taken by surprise we might have been murdered in our beds jimmy looked so frightened at this suggestion that paul laughed it is no laughing matter mother he said but jimmy looked so thoroughly scared that i couldnt help being amused dont be alarmed jimmy well take good care of you meanwhile julius was returning to the miserable room which he called home he was thinking how he could communicate the information agreed upon without arousing the suspicions of the two confederates finally he decided upon a story which seemed to him satisfactory it was nine oclock when he entered the room where jack morgan and marlowe having got tired of playing cards were leaning back against the wall in their chairs smoking clay pipes the room was full of the odor of a villainous quality of cheap tobacco when julius reappeared well julius said jack removing his pipe from his mouth and regarding him eagerly what luck good said julius briefly what have you found out i found out that the swag is in a safe upstairs on the second floor good exclaimed jack admiringly didnt i tell you he was a sharp one marlowe how did you find that out asked marlowe keenly you didnt ask did you i aint a fool answered julius you havent answered my question they give me some supper said julius who had got his story ready and while i was eatin i heard mrs hoffman tell paul that she had got some men to move the safe from the front room on the second floor into the bathroom she didnt say what was in it but its likely the moneys there the boys right marlowe said jack did they give you anything else besides supper asked marlowe yes they give me this coat answered julius indicating the coat he had on aint it a bully fit maybe theyd like to adopt you said jack jocosely if me and marlowe go to californy you can go there meanwhile marlowes attention had been drawn to the coat it struck him that he had seen it before he soon remembered surely it was the one that he had seen purchased in chatham street the same afternoon coats in general are not easily distinguishable but he had noticed a small round spot on the lapel of that and the same reappeared on the coat which julius brought home chapter xv suspicion julius had been about the streets all day and felt tired he threw himself down in the corner and was soon asleep marlowe and jack kept on with their game the latter wholly unconscious of the thoughts that were passing through the mind of his companion finally marlowe at the conclusion of a game said i wont play any more tonight jack tired eh tired of playing but ive got something to say to you out with it said morgan tilting his chair back against the wall wait a minute saying this marlowe rose from his seat and advancing to the corner leaned over the sleeping boy and listened intently to his deep regular breathing whats up asked morgan surprised i wanted to make sure that the boy was asleep answered marlowe why dont you want him to hear no i dont for what i have to say is about him go ahead i mistrust that hes going to sell us jack what exclaimed morgan dont speak so loud you might wake him as he spoke marlowe came back and resumed his seat bending over and speaking to jack in a low tone what have you got into your head marlowe said jack incredulously julius sell us impossible why impossible hed never think of such a thing what put it into your head ill tell you do you see that coat he brought home yes what of it the boy paul hoffman gave it to him i saw him buy it this afternoon in a secondhand store in chatham street are you sure the coat is the same yes i know it by a spot i noticed at the time now what should he take the trouble to buy a coat for unless the boy had done him some service its different from giving him an old coat he had thrown aside thats so said jack thoughtfully perhaps hes took a fancy to julius perhaps he has repeated marlowe incredulously you know he aint rich enough to buy coats to give away i cant think the boy would betray us said jack slowly perhaps he wouldnt i aint sure but we must guard against it how we must attack the house sooner than we meant suppose we say saturday night the boy will be in the house it cant be helped if he makes trouble we must silence him id rather have a clear field monday night so would i but suppose the cops are waiting for us if i thought julius would do that said jack scowling at the sleeping boy id kill him myself i dont see why we cant do it saturday night we can easily overpower young hoffman as for julius hell be asleep of course he mustnt know of our change of plan if you think it best said morgan in a tone of indecision but im almost sure i can trust the boy i trust nobody said marlowe i wouldnt trust my own brother if he had an interest in goin against me do you trust me asked jack smiling yes i trust you for we are both in the same boat it wouldnt do you any good to betray me yes were both in the same boat but youre steerin well marlowe just make your plans and count me in you always had a better headpiece than i then saturday night let it be todays thursday then we have only two days to get ready it will do well lock the boy in that night so he cant make mischief if he wakes up and finds that we are gone during this conversation julius remained fast asleep jack soon lay down and marlowe also the latter having taken up his quarters with his friend the next morning julius was the first to wake he leaned on his elbow and looked carelessly at the sleepers big bloated with a coarse ruffianly face jack lay back with his mouth open anything but a sleeping beauty julius had never thought much of his appearance but now that he had himself begun to cherish some faint aspirations to elevate himself above his present condition he looked upon his associates with different eyes and it struck him forcibly that his guardian had a decidedly disreputable look i wont stay with him long thought julius if hes took by the cops ill set up for myself and never go back to him marlowe lay alongside of his companion not so disreputable as he in appearance but not a whit better as regards character he was the abler of the two mentally and so was the more dangerous as julius looked at him carelessly he was startled to hear marlowe talk in his sleep he was prompted by a natural curiosity to listen and this was what he heard dont trust the boy make it saturday night these words fastened the attention of julius his heart beat quicker as it was revealed to him that his want of fidelity was discovered or at least suspected he lay quite still hoping to hear more but marlowe said nothing in addition indeed these words were the precursor of his waking julius saw the indications of this and prudently closed his own eyes and counterfeited sleep so when marlowe in turn looked about him he saw as he thought that both his companions were asleep he did not get up for there was nothing to call him up early he was not one of the toiling thousands who are interested in the passage of eighthour laws eight hours of honest industry would not have been to his taste he turned over but did not again fall asleep meanwhile julius after a sufficient interval appeared to wake up he rose from his couch and gave himself a general shake this was his way of making his morning toilet are you awake julius asked marlowe yes you sleep sound dont you like a top how did they treat you at that house in madison avenue they was kind to me they gave me some supper did they ask you if you had a father yes what did you tell em that i hadnt got none did they ask who you lived with yes said julius after a slight pause and you told em i told em i lived with a friend some of the time when he wasnt absent in the country said julius grinning as he referred to jacks frequent terms of enforced seclusion was you ever at the island julius no thats odd you dont do credit to jacks teaching likely ill go some time said julius who knowing that he was suspected thought it would not do to seem too virtuous it aint so bad when youre used to it let me see that coat julius tossed it over to marlowe it was the only part of his clothing which he had taken off when he went to bed its a good coat yes a bully one the boy young hoffman used to wear it didnt he likely he did but hes a good deal too big to wear it now how big is he most as tall as jack said julius jack being considerably shorter than marlowe big enough to make trouble however hell get a telegram monday to go over to brooklyn thatll get him out of the way thats a good plan that is said julius knowing very well that it was only said to deceive him shall you see him today if you want me to i dont know said marlowe do you know where he sleeps no said julius you didnt tell me to ask of course not it would only make him suspect something but i didnt know but you heard something said as you did about the safe he eyed julius keenly as he spoke and the boy perceiving it concluded that this was the cause of the sudden suspicion which appeared to have been formed in marlowes mind of course he knew nothing of the coat as paul had not told him of having purchased it i didnt hear nothin said about it he answered if hes away you wont mind thats true i suppose you didnt find out where his mother sleeps yes i did its the front basement there was a bed in the room marlowe asked no further questions and the conversation dropped julius threw his blackingbox over his back and opening the door went out his mind was busily occupied with the revelation which he had unexpectedly overhead it seemed clear that the plans of the burglars had been changed and that the attack was to be made on saturday night and not on monday night as first proposed he must tell paul hoffman for he had made his choice between his new friend and his old guardian on the one side was respectability on the other a disreputable life and julius had seen enough of what it had brought to jack not to relish the prospect in his own case he determined to acquaint paul with the change of plan and went around to broadway for that purpose but paul had not got opened for business he had delayed in order to do an errand for his mother i can go later thought julius it will do just as well in this he was mistaken as we shall see chapter xvi locked up for the night about nine oclock after a comfortable breakfast for which he had paid out of his mornings earnings julius went round again to pauls necktie stand he had just opened for business when the boy came up youre late this mornin said julius i was here before yes i was detained at home is there anything new yes there is said julius what is it they suspect somethin who jack and marlowe they think i aint to be trusted how do you know did they tell you so inquired paul with interest no marlowe talked in his sleep what did he say dont trust the boy make it saturday night saturday night repeated paul in excitement why thats tomorrow night julius nodded do they know you overheard no so you came and told me youre a good fellow julius you have done me a great favor youve been good to me said julius thats why i did it i shall be ready for them tomorrow night then said paul this conference was watched though neither julius nor paul was aware of it marlowe on leaving the room some time after julius had come into the vicinity with the design of getting a view of paul and ascertaining whether he was the boy whom he had seen purchasing the coat he came up a moment after julius reached the stand of course he identified paul and his suspicions as to the good understanding between him and julius were confirmed by seeing them together he listened intently hoping to catch something of their conversation but though not far off the street noises were such as to render this impossible the young viper he said to himself hes sold us as sure as my names marlowe ill wring his neck for him hell find hes got into dangerous business he went back and reported to jack what he had seen if i thought the boy was playin us a trick growled jack id strangle him but i aint sure you didnt hear what he said no i couldnt hear but it stands to reason that hes sold us what do you want me to do nothing yet the boy dont know that we have changed our plans he thinks we trust him let him think so and when we get ready to go out saturday night well tie him hand and foot so he cant stir then well go up to the house and take em unprepared all right said jack your heads longer than mine marlowe you know best of course i do said marlowe youve got the strength and ive got the brain jack morgan extended his arms and watched his muscular development with satisfaction he was not sensitive about the slight to his understanding he was content to be thought what he was a strong and dangerous animal what preparations were necessary to be made were made during that day and the next by the two confederates they were made during the absence of julius that he might know nothing of what was going on further to mislead him the two spoke two or three times on the previous evening of their expedition of monday night julius fathomed their design and was sharp enough not to appear particularly interested so saturday night came at six oclock julius entered the room and found the two seated together he had had half a mind not to appear at all but to cut loose from them forever but this would lead to suspicion and he changed his mind though he had not seen paul since he had reason to believe that he had made preparations to receive the two burglars in all probability they would be arrested and this would be their last meeting how are you jack he said as he entered the room with a little qualm at the thought that this man bad as he was was so near falling into the hands of justice and by his means jack looked at him but did not answer his expression was menacing as julius perceived and his heart beat more quickly as he thought has he found out anything but luckily for him neither jack nor marlowe knew anything definite had it been so the boys life would have been in peril have you seen young hoffman today asked marlowe no he dont know were going to call monday night does he no said julius and he answered truly where could he find out you might say something to let him know what would make me do that said julius boldly you might think hed pay you for telling him he aint rich said julius do you know what id do to you if i found out as youd sold us here broke in jack morgan his dull eyes gleaming fiercely id kill you what makes you say that to me jack said julius not showing the fear he felt oh it aint nothin to you then no it isnt of course this was a falsehood but it would have been idle to expect the truth from one like julius under such circumstances he knew jack well enough to understand that he was quite capable of carrying out his threat and it decided him when the two went out to go out himself and not to return they might find out that he had been dealing falsely with them and if so his life was in danger it was yet early and he decided to go out at once as he usually did for it was not very agreeable to pass an entire evening in the miserable tenement rooms where are you going asked marlowe as he lifted the latch of the door im goin out i havent had any supper you can do without supper tonight eh jack yes he can do without supper tonight why whats up demanded the boy never mind whats up answered marlowe you aint goin out tonight im hungry well bring you some supper were goin out ourselves you never kept me in before said julius who felt that it was best to show surprise at the action of the confederates though it did not surprise him thats neither here nor there you aint goin out tonight all right said julius if you say so only bring a feller some grub well bring you some said jack who was not as fully convinced as his comrade of julius treachery they left the room carefully locking the door behind them julius sat down on the bed and began to review the situation evidently he was to be locked up in the room through the night while jack and marlowe were robbing the house on madison avenue in all probability they would be arrested and prevented from returning but suppose one or both escaped from the trap in which they were expected to fall if their suspicions of his fidelity were aroused now they would be confirmed by the discovery of the police knowing the desperate character of both julius reflected with a shudder that his life would possibly be sacrificed it would not do for him to remain here he must escape by some means but how this was a difficult question to answer the room was on the third floor with a solitary window looking out into a small dirty court it was too high up to jump with safety and there was nothing in the room by which he could descend he was still considering this question an hour later when the two returned jack had in his hand a couple of apples there said he tossing them to julius thatll do you till mornin thank you said julius it was true that he had had no supper and he ate the apples with a good appetite the two men sat down and producing the same old greasy pack of cards which they had before used began to play it was not until a late hour that they could go about the business which they had planned twelve oclock was as early as they could venture to attempt entering the house to prime them for the task they had brought in with them a plentiful supply of whisky of which they partook at frequent intervals they offered none to julius by and by julius went to bed he knew they would not go out till eleven probably and he would like to have kept awake till then but this would have been unusual and perhaps have increased suspicion so after awhile he lay quiet and pretended to be asleep the men kept on playing cards till halfpast ten then marlowe spoke well hold up now its time to be goin what time is it most eleven the boys asleep is he marlowe went to the bed and leaned over julius felt his breath on his face but gave no sign that he was still awake he was filled with curiosity to know whether marlowe and jack meant to carry out their plan this evening he seems to be asleep said marlowe but well lock him in to make sure in three hours well be back if all goes well with plenty of swag i hope so marlowe ive got tired of livin this way well go to california if we come out right im with you jack on that a pal of mine went out to the mines and got rich then he swore off and turned respectable so would i if i had plenty of tin ive no objection myself with plenty of money to back me moneys what makes the difference between people in this world give me a hundred thousand and instead of bein tom marlowe i would be thomas marlowe esq our eminent fellowcitizen and you would be the hon john morgan eh jack jack laughed at the unfamiliar title though possibly he was no more undeserving of it than some who flaunt it in the face of society im the figger for an honorable he said but its time to be goin heres good luck and he poured down a glass of the whisky at one gulp they carefully locked the door behind them and their heavy steps were heard descending the rickety stairs julius listened till the sound was no longer heard then he jumped up from the pallet on which he had been counterfeiting sleep and said to himself it aint safe to stay here any longer how shall i get out chapter xvii trapped it was close upon midnight when marlowe and jack approached the house in madison avenue there was one thing connected with the position of the house not before mentioned which favored their attempt it was a corner house and in the rear a high wall separated the area from the street the two confederates judged that this would be the most feasible way of entrance boost me up marlowe first said jack morgan youre lightern me and can get up alone im fat and clumsy and i couldnt go it alone to save my neck all right jack are you ready yes shove away jack raised by his companion got firm hold of the top of the wall and by an effort clambered over im over all right he said in a low voice get over yourself marlowe looked cautiously up and down the street till he was satisfied no policeman was in sight then making a leap seized the wall and by the exercise of his strength drew himself up and then of course easily descended into the area here we are said jack in a tone of satisfaction now for work the lights are all out said marlowe softly i hope they are all asleep its likely they are did julius say whether any of them slept in the basement he didnt find out well we must risk it well reconnoiter a little and see whats the best way to get in at length it was decided that a particular window afforded the easiest ingress of course it was fastened inside but they were not novices and this presented not the slightest difficulty to their practiced hands with an instrument pointed with a diamond they cut out the pane of glass just beneath and thrusting in a hand marlowe turned back the fastening then the window was softly raised and both entered they were now in the kitchen it was dangerous to grope about in the dark for some article of furniture might be overturned and that would probably create an alarm which would be fatal to their plans the first thing therefore was to strike a light they had a dark lantern with them and this was speedily lighted then both removed their shoes and one after the other filed into the entry take care jack said marlowe the woman may be sleeping in the front basement and might hear you if you make the least noise suppose she does we must gag her if its the boy ill dispose of him pretty quick all was still as death neither had the slightest idea that their plan was known and that preparations of a most unwelcome character had been made for their reception that in fact they had ventured into a trap but on the previous evening paul had called at the nearest police station and communicating what he knew in regard to the intended attack had asked for a guard one of the force had been instructed to go back with him and carefully examine the house the better to provide not only for defense but for the capture of the burglars they will enter through the back area window said the officer at once where do you sleep my mother and little brother sleep in the front basement i sleep upstairs the basement must be left vacant certainly i wouldnt trust mother and jimmy there such a night you had better all go upstairs to the upper floor if you like and we will conceal ourselves on the second floor we will do as you think best i will stay with you no paul said mrs hoffman terrified i cant think of your exposing yourself to so much danger im not afraid mother i think it is my duty you can do no good said the officer there will be enough of us to take care of them with some reluctance paul gave up his plan he was bold and courageous and like most boys of his age he was fond of adventure an encounter with burglars promised no little excitement and he wanted to be present and have his share in it but when he saw how uneasy and alarmed his mother was he yielded his desire as i am sure you my boy reader would have done in his place even had your wish been as strong as his jimmy was now fast asleep but neither mrs hoffman nor paul could so readily compose themselves to slumber under the circumstances they were standing at the head of the attic stairs listening intently for the slightest sound from below which might indicate the arrival of the expected visitors at length they heard a pistol shot then a shriek then confused noises of feet and voices and they knew that the encounter had taken place we must go back and explain what had happened carrying their shoes in their hands the two burglars crept up the basement stairs their hopes were high their entrance had not yet been observed and even if it were they were two strong men against a woman and two boys the oldest only halfgrown there seemed nothing to fear now for the safe said marlowe its somewhere on the second floor the door of the room may be locked then itll take us longer thats all but the door was not locked and the safe was in the front room on the second floor in the back room the police were concealed and were listening intently to the movements of the burglars should the latter discover them they were ready for an immediate attack but they hoped the visitors would get to work first in this hope they were gratified by chance the two confederates entered the front room first heres the safe marlowe whispered jack in tones of satisfaction now if lucks on our side well make a raise you talk too much cautioned his companion work first and talk afterward they approached the safe and jack kneeled down before it and prepared to effect an entrance marlowe was about to follow his example when his ear made acute by necessity distinguished a footstep outside jack said he in a sharp whisper i hear a step outside instantly jack morgan was on his feet do you think we are heard perhaps so if we are we must secure ourselves it may be the boy if it is well quiet him pretty quickly they never dreamed of any opposition which they would be unable to withstand paul was of course no match for them and as to mrs hoffman she might go into a fit of hysterics or might give the alarm it would be easy to dispose of her since therefore there was nothing to fear the two confederates thought it best to face the enemy at once and put him hors de combat thereupon marlowe opened the door at once and to his dismay found himself confronted by four stalwart policemen the games up jack he shouted save yourself he made a spring eluding the grasp of the officers and plunged downstairs at a breakneck rate meanwhile jack had snapped a pistol at one of the policemen but it missed fire by a return shot he was wounded in the shoulder and his right arm hung useless he broke into a volley of execrations do you surrender demanded the officer at whom he had fired i must said jack in a surly tone youre four to one only one policeman had followed marlowe downstairs circumstances favored the escape of this the more dangerous villain of the two at the foot of the basement stairs was a door and on the outside was a bolt this marlowe had noticed on going up and the knowledge stood him in good stead he got downstairs sufficiently in advance of the policeman to bolt the door and so obstruct his progress this gave him time and time was allimportant to him while the officer was kicking at the door and trying to burst it open as he finally did marlowe dashed through the kitchen and got out at the open window then he had to scale the wall but this was easy to do on the inside for there was a narrow ledge midway in less than a minute he was on the pavement outside and fleeing from the danger under cover of the darkness when he had got far enough to dare to slacken his pace time also came for thought and he was able to consider how it happened that four officers were concealed in the house there was but one possible explanation it was that cursed boy he muttered grinding his teeth in a fierce rage he betrayed us he upset the likeliest plan ive joined in for years he shall suffer for it curse it before i go to sleep this night ill give him a lesson he wont need but one his soul thirsting for revenge he hurried back to the miserable room in which julius was confined he had no doubt of finding him for he was satisfied the boy could not get out meanwhile jack morgan was compelled by superior force to surrender at discretion the blood was trickling from the wound in his shoulder and on the whole he looked the burglar to perfection while they were slipping on the handcuffs the officer who had pursued marlowe returned and reported that he had escaped bully for him said jack hes smart marlowe is so his name is marlowe is it you knew it before said jack in a surly tone who told you about our coming here tonight never mind said the officer it was our business to find out and we found out i know well enough who blabbed growled jack curse him id like to strangle him i dont know whom you suspect my man said the officer but i think itll be some time before youll have a chance to carry out your benevolent purpose perhaps it will returned jack but marlowe aint took yet hell attend to the business for both of us and there wis a look of malignant joy on his face as he thought of the sure retribution that would overtake julius chapter xviii the value of a clothesline when julius found himself alone and understood that his companions had actually started on their illegal expedition he felt that there was pressing need of action he must escape by some means while the prospect was that they would be captured and so prevented from returning on the other hand one or both might escape and in that case he knew enough of their savage and brutal character to realize that he would be in the greatest danger he rose from his bed and began to devise ways and means of escape the first and most obvious outlet of course was the door but this was locked and the key was in marlowes possession then there was the solitary window it was on the third floor and looked out into a court it was too high to jump from and the only other way was by a rope but there was no rope in the room had there been a bedstead of the right kind the bedcord would have served his purpose but there was no bedstead at all with a democratic contempt for such a luxury all three slept on the floor the prospect was not encouraging i wonder if i could hang out of the window thought julius he looked out and decided that he would run the risk of breaking a limb if he attempted it so that plan had to be given up julius sat down and reflected it occurred to him that perhaps mrs oconnors key she roomed just beneath would open the door at any rate it was worth trying he stamped on the floor with such force that as he expected it attracted the attention of those beneath listening intently he heard the woman ascending the staircase he began to jump up and down with renewed vigor whats the matter wid ye called mrs oconnor through the keyhole are you drunk im sick returned julius is it the jumpin toothache ye have asked the irish woman im awful sick i dont know what it is open the door and ill come in i cant the doors locked and jack has gone away here julius began to groan again poor bye said the compassionate woman what will i do for ye try the door with your key perhaps it will open it ill do that same she drew out a key and tried to put it in the lock but to no purpose it would not fit i cant open it she said this was a severe disappointment to julius who saw his chances of success fade away one by one have you got a clothesline mrs oconnor he asked suddenly yes said the good woman rather astonished with a vague idea that julius expected to cure himself by means of it and what for do you want it if you will go down to the court and throw it up to me ill get out of the window and what good will that do you i will go for the doctor ill go meself and save you the trouble but he cant get through the keyhole thrue for you wait a bit and ill do it mrs oconnor descended and obtaining from her room a wellworn clothesline went below and after two or three futile attempts succeeded in throwing it up so that julius could seize it thank you mrs oconnor said the boy in exultation ill come down directly he soon had it secured and then boldly got out of the window and swung off in a minute he was by the side of his friend how do ye feel now asked the good woman in a tone of sympathy better said julius what made them lock ye up they didnt think id want to go out till mornin goodbye mrs oconnor im goin for the doctor you can get your line in the mornin he left the house with a quick alert step showing no further evidence of pain mrs oconnor noticed it and wondered that he should have got over his sickness so soon julius had been tempted to take her into his confidence and explain the real state of the case but in the uncertain issue of the burglary he decided that it would not be best goodbye old house he said looking back to it in the indistinct light i shall never come back and live here again ill go down to the wharves and find a place to sleep the rest of the night he turned his steps in the direction of the east river he found an outoftheway corner on one of the piers where he disposed himself for sleep it was nothing new to him scores of times he had spent the night in similar places and never found fault with the accommodations they might be poor but the best of it was there was nothing to pay and he must be indeed unreasonable who could complain under such circumstances he fell asleep but the shadow of recent events was upon him he dreamed that marlowe had him by the throat and woke up in terror to find a dockhand shaking him by the shoulder avast there said the man who had caught some phrases from the sailors wake up and pay for your lodgins all my moneys in the bank said julius i cant get at it till the bank opens not then either said the dockhand goodhumoredly well ill let you off this time your wifes expectin you home are you sure of that said julius i told her i was goin to a party and she neednt expect me home till mornin well the partys broke up and youd better be going returned the other goodnaturedly meanwhile let us go back to marlowe whom we left hurrying home a little past midnight intent upon wreaking his vengeance on julius for his treachery had he found the boy it would have gone hard with him the ruffianly instinct of the burglar was predominant and he might have killed him in the intensity of his blind rage but the foresight and prudent caution of julius defeated his wrathful purpose and when he reached the shabby room which he called home his intended victim had escaped marlowe did not at once discover the boys flight he unlocked the door but it was dark within for the window looked out upon an inclosed court and permitted only a scanty light to enter before striking a light he locked the door again and put the key in his pocket this was to prevent the boys escape on the one hand and any outside interference on the other then he drew a match from his pocket and lighted a fragment of candle upon the table this done he turned his eyes toward the bed with stern exultation but this was quickly turned into angry surprise the boys gone he exclaimed with an oath how could he have got out with the door locked the open window and the rope hanging from it revealed the method of escape marlowe strode to the window with a feeling of keen disappointment was he to be robbed of his revenge after all he had depended upon this with certainty and meant to have it though he should be arrested the next minute and he knew that though he had escaped from the house of his meditated crime he was still in great peril doubtless julius had given full information to the police of his name and residence and even now they might be in pursuit of him he ground his teeth when he thought of this and clinched his fist in the impotent desire for vengeance if i had him here he muttered id crush him as i would a spider and he stamped angrily upon the floor but where could he have got the rope that was the next question he knew that there was none in the room and how one could have been smuggled in with the door locked was something that puzzled him julius himself could not very well have brought one in as on account of its bulk it would have attracted the attention either of jack morgan or himself perhaps the woman downstairs might know something about it he reflected and this led him to go down and knock at mrs oconnors door after a little pause mrs oconnor came to the door and opened it whats wanted she asked then recognizing her visitor as one of the lodgers in the room above she added is it the boy yes where is he demanded marlowe abruptly its gone to the doctor he is gone to the doctor repeated marlowe mystified what do you mean he was taken sick jist after you wint away and as he couldnt open the door which was locked he pounded on the floor my key wouldnt fit so he asked me to throw up a clothesline which i did and the poor crayther got out of the winder and wint for the doctor hell be back soon im thinkin no he wont growled marlowe hes a thief and a villain and hes run away did i iver hear the likes exclaimed mrs oconnor whod have thought it shure ive a good mind to wring your neck for helping him off said marlowe forgetting in his anger the politeness due to the fair sex would you thin exclaimed mrs oconnor incensed then my husband would do the same to you you brute i am glad the boys gone so i am and i hope hell never get into your clutches again you monster tim wake up there and defind yer wife from the thafe thats insulted her before tim oconnor aroused from his sleep at his wifes call marlowe with a smothered execration retreated to his own room and began to consider his position he must fly there was no doubt of that remaining in his old haunts he would unquestionably fall into the hands of the police now probably on his track he must get away and that very night any delay would be dangerous he must leave the city and remain in hiding for the present while he was making hurried preparations steps were heard on the stairs and there was a loud knocking on the door whos there demanded marlowe open in the name of the law was the reply of the officers who had tracked him to his lair wait a minute said marlowe he rushed to the window and descended swiftly by the same rope which had given julius deliverance it had escaped the attention of the officers on account of the darkness and while the officers were waiting for the door to be opened he eluded their vigilance and made his escape chapter xix a curiosity shop marlowe realized that he had made the city too hot to hold him the police with whom he had a more intimate acquaintance than he desired were already on his track and it was doubtful if he could escape the affair in which he was implicated was a serious one and if arrested and tried he could hardly hope for less than ten years imprisonment this is rather a long term of confinement to be taken out of a mans life and must be avoided if possible but one way of escape seemed feasible and this marlowe tried as a desperate experiment he made his way swiftly through the darkness to a tumbledown building not far from baxter street the front door was unlocked he opened it and feeling his way up for there were no lights knocked in a peculiar way at a door just at the head of the stairs his knock was evidently heard for shuffling steps were heard within a bolt was drawn and marlowe confronted a little old man of feeble frame and deeply furrowed face who scanned the face of his visitor by the light of a candle which he held above his head why its marlowe he said hush jacob dont mention my name im in trouble whats in the wind now shut the door and ill tell you i may as well say that the conversation which ensued was interlarded with expressions common to the lawless class which marlowe represented but i prefer to translate them into common speech the room which they entered seemed full of odds and ends of wearing apparel and might have been taken for a pawnbrokers shop or secondhand clothing store or it might have been taken for a dressingroom to a theatre but that the articles displayed had long since seen their best days with few exceptions what have you been up to asked jacob varying the form of his question jack morgan and i tried to break into a house on madison avenue tonight couldnt you get in yes but the police were in waiting for us they nabbed jack but i got away they followed me to jacks room but i got out of the window theyre on my track now they didnt see you come in here asked the old man alarmed no i have given them the slip but theyll have me unless you help me my son ill do what i can what is your plan to disguise myself so that my own mother wouldnt know me see what you can do for me my reader will now understand the character of the old mans business thieves and others who had rendered themselves amenable to the law came to him for disguises paying heavily for the use of what articles he supplied them in many cases he was obliged to give them credit but the old adage there is honor among thieves was exemplified here for he seldom failed sooner or later to receive full payment it might be and probably was from motives of policy that his customers were so honorable for if unfaithful to their agreements they could hardly expect to be accommodated a second time and this was a serious consideration when appealed to by marlowe jacob understood that the details of the disguise were left to his judgment he raised his candle and took a good look at his customer then he dove under a heap of clothing on the floor and fished out a dirty sailors dress try it on he said i dont know about that said marlowe hesitating i dont know any sailors lingo thats no matter you can say shiver my timbers cant you yes i can do that thats enough its all i know myself but it wont do any harm to pick up something else the police wont never think of you as a sailor i dont know but youre right jacob shiver my timbers if i dont and he laughed as he used the expression try it on i guess itll be about right said the old man marlowe quickly stripped off the suit he wore and arrayed himself in the strange and unfamiliar garb presented by good luck it had originally been made for a man of about his size and there was no discrepancy likely to excite suspicion let me look at myself said he jacob produced a small cracked glass and the exburglar surveyed his transformed figure what do you think of it asked the dealer the dress is well enough but theyll know my face sit down what for i must cut your hair what then ill give you a red wig theres nothing will disguise you so quick as different colored hair have you got a wig yes here it is its ugly enough better wear it than your own hair at sing sing thats where youre right old man go ahead you understand your business ill put myself in your hands marlowe sat down in a wooden chair with a broken back and the old man proceeded with trembling hands to cut his black locks with a pair of large shears which he kept for this and other purposes youre cutting it pretty close jacob i shall look like a scarecrow all the better said the old man laconically when the operation was over marlowe surveyed his closelycropped head in the cracked mirror with some disgust youve made a beauty of me he said however it had to be done now wheres that wig he was adjusting it awkwardly when jacob took it from his hands and put it on properly now look at yourself he said marlowe did look and as the old man had predicted found his looks so transformed that he hardly knew himself thats good he said in a tone of satisfaction it dont improve my beauty but then i aint vain i care more for my liberty if it hadnt been for that cussed boy there wouldnt have been any need of this what boy jack morgans boy julius what did he do he split on us gave warning of our attempt thats how we came to be taken id give something to get at him maybe you will ill try at any rate if not now my revenge will keep is that all not quite sit down again the old man stained the face of his visitor so adroitly that he appeared to be deeply pitted with smallpox your own mother wouldnt know you now he said with pride thats so jacob youre a regular genius replied marlowe i aint sure about its being me youre sure about it shiver your timbers said the old man shiver my timbers but i forgot about it do you think ill do yes but you mustnt wash your face till it is dry i sometimes forget to do it now i guess i can get along without it for a day or two now how much are you going to ask for all this seventyfive dollars its a good deal how long would you get if you got took asked jacob significantly youre right its worth the money but i cant pay you now jacob you wont forget it said the old man composedly for he expected this since marlowes attempt at burglary had been unsuccessful youll pay me when you can shiver my timbers messmate but i will good said the old man youre getting it i dont think those landlubbers the cops will know me in this rigout better youll do well jacob ill pay you as soon as i can by the way havent you any place where you can stow me for the night it wont do for me to go back to jacks room its too hot for me lay down anywhere said jacob i havent got any bed i lie down on the clothes thatll do i aint used to bridalchambers or silk counterpanes i am as tired as a dog here goes he flung himself down in a corner on an indiscriminate pile of clothing and in five minutes was breathing deeply and fast asleep had he been a novice in his illegal profession the two narrow escapes he had just had and the risk which in spite of his disguise he at present run would have excited him and prevented his sleeping but he was an old hand and used to danger it was not the first time he had eluded the authorities and was not likely to be the last so he fell asleep upon his strange couch and slept as unconcernedly as an infant the old man did not immediately lie down he held up and examined attentively the suit marlowe had thrown oft which according to custom became his perquisite in addition to the cash payment demanded and was gratified to find it in good condition he next plunged his hands into the pockets but marlowe had transferred their contents to his new attire however jacob would have been little richer had his visitor neglected to do so having finished his scrutiny the old man blew out the candle and lay down in the corner opposite marlowe chapter xx the disguised listener on the monday morning succeeding the attempt at burglary so happily defeated paul thought he ought to go round to the countingroom of mr preston and acquaint him with the particulars he accordingly deferred opening his place of business if i may use so ambitious a phrase of the humble necktie stand over which he presided and bent his steps toward mr prestons countingroom the latter had just arrived goodmorning paul said mr preston smiling i know all about it about what sir inquired paul surprised about the burglary who told you our hero asked in astonishment didnt you know it was in the papers no sir i read it on my way downtown these reporters get hold of everything read that mr preston put into pauls hands a morning paper pointing to the following paragraph on saturday evening an attempt was made to rob the house of nathaniel talbot no madison avenue the attempt was made by two wellknown burglars familiarly known as jack morgan and tom marlowe the enterprise promised to be successful as mr talbot is absent in europe with his family during his absence the house is taken care of by a mrs hoffman whose son paul a boy of sixteen keeps a necktie stand below the astor house paul who seems to be possessed of courage and coolness learned that the attempt was about to be made and determined not only to frustrate it but to get hold of the burglars he gave information at police headquarters and when the brace of worthies arrived they met a reception as unexpected as it was unwelcome they were permitted to effect an entrance and met with no drawback till they reached the second story then the police made their appearance on the scene and effected the capture of morgan marlowe succeeded in effecting his escape but the police are on his track and his haunts in the city being known there is every reason to believe that he will be captured great credit is due to the boy paul through whose bravery and good judgment mr talbots house has been saved from robbery and probably two noted desperadoes captured paul read this paragraph with pleasure as may readily be supposed he was glad to find that his efforts in mr talbots behalf were likely to secure recognition i never thought of getting into the papers he said looking up i dont see how the reporters found out about it oh the reporters are everywhere probably they call every evening at police quarters and obtain information of all such cases you see paul you are getting famous i only did what i ought to do said paul modestly i agree to that but that is more than many of us can say if we all could say it with justice we should have a very different world from what we have at present besides said paul who though he liked praise wanted to be just there is some one else a boy too who had more to do with the affair than i who was that the boy who told me the house was to be entered tell me all about it i told you i knew all about it but there is one thing the paper does not explain how you found out the plans of those villains i will tell you sir one day i saw a boy in front of the eatinghouse where i usually dine who looked hungry i have known what it was to be hungry myself and i pitied him so i asked him in and gave him some dinner i think it was the next day that he came round and asked me if i did not live in mr talbots house on madison avenue he said the man he lived with and another were intending to break into it and rob the safe they seemed to know that my mother and myself were the only ones who occupied it how old a boy was he i dont know his age he looks about twelve but he may be older what do you suppose made him bring you the information i think he felt grateful for the dinner i gave him did you see him more than once yes several times it seems the two men intended at first to make the attempt this evening but for some reason they came to distrust the boy who was acquainted with their plans and fixed it for saturday they didnt intend to let him know of their change of plan but he overheard one of them talking in his sleep he came and told me this was lucky as otherwise i should not have been ready for them what is the name of this boy julius he has certainly done you and mr talbot great service what is your opinion of him has he been spoiled by living with thieves i dont think he has if he could have a chance to do better i think he would he shall have a chance i suppose you will see him soon i shouldnt wonder if he would come round to my stand today if he does bring him here yes sir i will what you have told me paul continued mr preston does not lessen your own merits but for your kindness to this poor boy you would have heard nothing of the intended burglary and been unable to take the measures which have proved so happily successful you are determined to praise me mr preston said paul because you deserve it i shall take care to write particulars to mr talbot who will doubtless have seen the paragraph you have just read and will be interested to hear more i shall not forget your part in the affair thank you sir i shall be glad to have mr talbot know that i am faithful to his interests he shall know it a boy entered the office at this point with a number of letters from the post office and mr preston began to read them paul saw that it was time to go and bade him goodmorning goodmorning paul said his patron dont forget to bring me the boy julius i wont forget sir paul was not likely to forget for he too felt grateful to julius and was glad to think the poor boy was likely to receive a reward for his services through the arrest of jack morgan he would be thrown upon his own exertions and aid would doubtless be welcome paul felt an honorable satisfaction in knowing that he was rising in the world and he was unselfish enough to desire to see others prosper also he was not mistaken in supposing julius would call upon him about eleven oclock he came up to the stand goodmorning julius said paul cordially goodmorning said the smaller boy was jack and marlowe round to your house last night yes was they took asked julius anxiously morgan was captured but marlowe escaped the boys countenance fell and he looked alarmed do you think theyll take him they are on his track i dont think that he can escape if he does hell kill me said julius he suspected me afore now hell know i let out about him and jack he wont dare to come near you why wont he he knows the police are after him hell hide somewhere i dont know said julius thoughtfully hell be awful mad with me hell try to do me some harm if he can i should be sorry to have any harm come to you julius said paul earnestly if marlowe is arrested it will be all right he shut me up last night before he went away jack and he did how was that julius gave an account of his confinement and how he escaped through the help of mrs oconnor he did not know of marlowes subsequent visit to the room and his disappointment at finding the bird flown he did not know of this not having dared to go round there since lest he should come upon jack or marlowe now he knew it was only the latter he had to fear you managed it pretty well about getting away said paul it reminds me of something that happened to me i was locked up in a hotel once the same way and he gave julius a little account of his adventure at lovejoys hotel with the jeweler from syracuse as narrated in an earlier volume of this series paul the peddler julius was interested in the story have you got any money julius asked paul when he had finished ive got ten cents i didnt have much luck this mornin i left my blackinbox in the room and i didnt dare to go after it as i thought i might meet marlowe or jack havent you had any breakfast then yes i went down to the long branch boat and got a chance to carry a carpetbag the gentleman gave me a quarter i spent fifteen cents for breakfast and ive got ten left you must stop and go to dinner with me julius it is twenty minutes to eleven already i shall go at twelve you spend too much money on me said julius never mind that where would i be if you hadnt told me about this burglary i should have known nothing about it and i might have been murdered ive told about you to mr preston a friend of mr talbot whose house i live in and he wants me to bring you round to his countingroom he is going to do something for you julius brightened up he had never had any friend excepting jack morgan and the reader can form some idea of the value of such a friend as jack when does he want me to come to his room he asked ill go round with you after dinner you want to rise in the world dont you julius id like to but i aint had any chance i think mr preston will give you a chance you can be thinking what you would like to do and he will help you to it i would like to go out west im afraid to stay here marlowe might find me i dont know but you are right julius out west there is more of a chance to rise you can tell mr preston what you wish while the boys were talking a man stood near by who listened attentively to what was said hearing every word neither paul nor julius remarked him he was a tall man with red hair and a face marked by the smallpox he was dressed in the garb of a sailor of course this was marlowe it was imprudent for him to post himself in so public a place but he trusted to his disguise and he wanted to hear for himself the conversation between the two boys he learned what he suspected before that to the boy julius he was indebted for the failure of his attempt at burglary when the two boys went to dinner he followed them chapter xxi a brighter prospect for julius after dinner paul went again to mr prestons place of business accompanied by julius the disguised sailor who had lingered outside the restaurant followed the two at a safe distance had not paul and julius been so occupied with their own affairs they might have noticed marlowe as it was they were quite unconscious of being followed they were fortunate in finding mr preston in his office and at leisure mr preston said paul this is the boy i spoke to you about what is your name my lad asked the merchant julius answered the street boy my young friend paul tells me that you have done him and his employer a great service did you live with the men who were engaged in the burglary yes sir i suppose they have been in prison at different times yes sir moren half the time what did you do then worked for myself what did you do blacked boots or sold papers when i got a chance i smashed baggage did you get paid for that asked mr preston with a smile he means carried bundles or carpetbags explained paul i understand did these men ever want you to steal or join them in burglary sometimes they was goin to take me last night but they was afraid id peach and locked me up at home i hope you have no desire to become a burglar no sir i want to be respectable like paul you are right there my lad now have you any plans for the future id like to go out west would you rather go there than remain in new york yes sir hes here who is here marlowe he wasnt took hell murder me if he gets hold of me marlowe is one of the burglars i suppose yes sir hes the worst i hope he will be taken probably he will find it hard to escape as the police are on his track but i dont know but you are right about going out west many boys like yourself have been sent out by the childrens aid society i know some of em said julius you will stand a better chance of succeeding there than here i am willing to help you if you wish to go out mr preston took out his pocketbook and drew therefrom a roll of bills here are fifty dollars he said for me asked julius in almost incredulous surprise yes for you i hope you will make a good use of it julius selected a fivedollar bill which he thrust into his vest pocket and handed the remainder to paul keep it for me paul he said i might lose it you have done well said mr preston approvingly until you leave the city it will be best to leave the money in pauls hands now my lad i must bid you goodmorning as business claims my attention try to lead a good life and you have my best wishes for your welfare he offered his hand which julius took shyly the two boys went out and again marlowe followed them and tried to overhear what they said dont you feel rich julius he heard paul say he was very good to me said julius fifty dollars is a good deal of money for a boy like you fifty dollars said marlowe to himself so the young dog got fifty dollars for selling jack n me he thinks hes done a good thing well see well see he instantly conceived the design of getting hold of this fifty dollars as we know he was almost penniless and money he sorely needed to effect his escape from the city where he was placed in hourly peril to take it from julius would give him more pleasure than to obtain it in any other way for it would be combining revenge with personal profit not that this revenge would content him his resentment was too deep and intense to be satisfied with any such retaliation he wanted to make the boy suffer he would hardly have shrunk from taking his life he was in fact a worse man than jack morgan for the latter was not naturally cruel though under temptation he might be led to desperate acts now tell me what you want to do julius said paul i want to go out west you are rather young to travel alone besides you dont know anything about the west do you julius admitted that he did not his education had been very much neglected he probably could not have named half a dozen states and had the vaguest idea of the west he had heard it spoken of and some boys whom he used to know about the streets had gone out there but beyond that he knew nothing how far do you think it is to the west asked paul about a hundred miles it is all of that said paul laughing now ill tell you what i would do if i were in your place what were you ever in the newsboys lodging house lots of times then you know mr oconnor the superintendent yes hes very kind to us boys well suppose we go round and ask him when the next company of boys starts for the west you could go with them and he will find you a place out there what do you say i would like to do that said julius with evident satisfaction then we will go up at once i guess my business can wait a little longer youre very kind to me said julius gratefully youll lose money goin round with me so much no matter for that it wont ruin me besides youve done me a great service i ought to be willing to do something for you that aint nothin i think different come along well settle this matter at once the two boys kept on their way till they reached the lodging house all was quiet for in the daytime the boys are scattered about the streets earning their livelihood in different ways only at suppertime they come back and in the evening the rooms are well filled paul had been here before not as a guest for he had always had a home of his own but he had called in the evening at different times julius had often passed the night there during the lengthened intervals of jacks enforced residence in public institutions they met mr oconnor just coming out how do you do paul i hope youre well julius said the superintendent who has a remarkable faculty for remembering the names and faces of the thousands of boys that from time to time frequent the lodging house do you want to see me yes sir answered paul but we wont detain you long never mind about that my business can wait julius wants to go out west proceeded paul now what we want to find out is when you are going to send a party out this day week who is going out with it it is not quite decided i may go myself said the superintendent can julius go out with you yes we havent got our full number he can go then youre all right julius said paul what gave you the idea of going out west julius asked mr oconnor marlowes after me said julius briefly the superintendent looked mystified and paul explained didnt you read in the papers he asked about the burglary on madison avenue at mr talbots house yes had julius anything to do with that through his means the burglars were prevented from carrying out their designs and one of them was captured this was jack morgan with whom julius lived the other a man named marlowe got off as he suspected julius beforehand of betraying them and is a man of revengeful disposition julius is afraid of staying in the city while he is at large we both think he had better go west there he may have a chance of doing well no doubt why some of our boys who have gone out there have grown rich others have persevered in seeking an education and there are lawyers ministers and doctors as well as merchants now prosperous and respected who graduated from the streets of new york and were sent out by our society the face of julius brightened as he heard these words i hope ill do well he said it depends a good deal on yourself my boy said the superintendent kindly firmly resolve to do well and you will very likely succeed youve had a rough time of it so far and circumstances have been against you but ill try to find a good place for you where youll have a chance to learn something and to improve then it will be your own fault if you dont rise to a respectable place in society ill try said julius hopefully and he meant what he said he had lived among social outlaws all his life and he realized the disadvantages of such a career he shuddered at the idea of following in the steps of jack morgan or marlowe a considerable portion of whose time was spent in confinement he wanted to be like paul for whom he felt both respect and attachment and the superintendents words encouraged and made him ambitious chapter xxii marlowe overtakes his victim on emerging into the street the two boys parted company it was time for paul to go back to his business julius was more indifferent to employment he had five dollars in his pocket and fortyfive dollars deposited with paul accustomed to live from hand to mouth this made him feel very rich it was a bright pleasant day and it occurred to him that it would be very pleasant to make an excursion somewhere it made little difference to him where the first place that occurred to him was staten island it is six miles from the city or half an hour by water the boats start from a pier near the battery wheres he going i wonder thought marlowe following at a little distance as no conversation had passed between the boys about the excursion he was quite in the dark but he was determined to follow whereever it might be he soon ascertained julius met a street acquaintance tom barker a newsboy and accosted him tom come with me where you goin to staten island whats up nothin im goin for the benefit of my health come along i cant come havent you got the stamps ill pay ive got to go to twentyseventh street on an errand ill go with you tomorrow cant wait said julius i must go alone goin to staten island thought marlowe in exultation ill get a chance at him there marlowe had not much money with him but he had enough to pay the fare to staten island ten cents so he kept on the track of julius and passed the wicket just behind him the boat was approaching the pier and they had not long to wait julius went to the forward part of the boat and took a seat just in front of the boiler marlowe took a position near but not too near he had considerable confidence in his disguise but did not want to run any unnecessary risk of recognition it so happened that a few steps from him was a genuine specimen of the profession he was counterfeiting with the sociability characteristic of a sailor he undertook to open a conversation with marlowe hollo shipmate he said hollo yourself said the counterfeit not over pleased with the salutation i thought id hail you seein we both foller the sea have you been long ashore not long answered marlowe where was your last vyge to californy answered marlowe hesitating what craft here was an embarrassing question marlowe wished his questioner at the north pole but felt compelled to answer the sally ann he answered you dont say said the other with animation i was aboard the sally ann myself one vyge confound you im sorry to hear it thought the impostor theres more than one sally ann its likely he said who was your captain captain rice mine was captain talbot how long was your vyge shipmate now marlowe had no knowledge of the number of days such a voyage ought to take he knew that the california steamers came in in three or four weeks and the difference of speed did not occur to him not to speak of the vastly greater distance round cape horn thirty days he answered at random thirty days exclaimed the sailor in amazement did you go round the horn in thirty days yes we had favorable winds explained marlowe he must be crazy or hes no sailor thought the true son of neptune he was about to ask another question when marlowe who suspected that he had made a blunder turned abruptly and walked away he aint no sailor said the questioner to himself he never lived in the forecastle i know by his walk marlowe had not the rolling gait of a seaman and the other detected it at once went round the horn in thirty days soliloquized the sailor that yarns too tough for me to swallow whats he got on that rig for meanwhile julius looked around him with enjoyment cheap as the excursion was he had but once made it before it had been seldom that he had even twenty cents to spare and when he had money he had preferred to go to the old bowery or tony pastors for an evenings entertainment now he felt the refreshing influence of the sea breeze he was safe from marlowe so he thought he had left danger behind him in the great dusty city before him was a vision of green fields and the delight of an afternoon without work and without care he was sure of a good supper and a comfortable bed for had he not five dollars in his pocket julius felt as rich as stewart or vanderbilt and so he was for the time being but he would have felt anxious could he have seen the baleful glance of the disguised sailor for marlowe though he had changed his seat still managed to keep julius in sight but there was another who in turn watched him and that was the genuine sailor the latter was bent on finding out the meaning of the disguise for disguise he knew it to be he was not long in discovering that marlowe was watching julius with a malignant glance he hates the lad thought the sailor does he mean him harm he was making an excursion of pleasure but he had another object in view he had a cousin living on staten island and he was intending to make him a call but this business was not imperative and he resolved to follow out the present adventure if he tries to harm the lad said the kindhearted sailor hell have to take me too so while marlowe watched julius he was watched in turn the boat reached the first landing and some of the passengers got off but julius made no motion to disembark and of course marlowe did not shortly afterward the second landing was reached but it was not until the boat touched the third that julius rose from his seat and descended the stairs to the lower deck the two sailors followed julius walked up the road that leads to the pier he had no particular destination he cared little where he went his main object being to get back into the country the sailor soon perceived that marlowe had no object except to follow julius all his movements depended upon the boys when julius turned he turned also what has he got agin the boy thought the sailor he shant harm him if jack halyard can prevent it marlowe was tall and strong and a formidable opponent the sailor was three inches shorter but he was broadshouldered and had an immense chest it was clear that he was very powerful he was thoroughly brave also fear was a stranger to him and he did not hesitate for a moment to encounter marlowe in the boys defense julius kept on at one place he stopped to watch two boys who were pitching ball to each other he asked them if he might join in the game but the boys looked contemptuously at his shabby clothes and one of them said rudely we dont play with ragamuffins i aint a ragamuffin said julius perhaps youre a gentleman in disguise said one with a sneer im as much of a gentleman as you are retorted julius angrily clear out you beggar we dont want you here said the second boy arrogantly julius walked on indignantly they insult me because i am poor he said to himself ill be rich some time perhaps the possibility of becoming rich had never occurred to him before today but mr oconnors words and the fifty dollars which had been given him made him hopeful and ambitious he had heard that some of the rich men who owned warehouses in the great city had once been poor boys like himself might he not rise like them for the first time in his life he seemed to be having a chance marlowe saw him leave the boys with satisfaction had julius stopped to play with them his scheme of vengeance would have been delayed perhaps frustrated it would not do for him to attack the boy in the presence of others but julius w r as walking away from the village into the interior if he only went far enough he would be at his mercy what should he do to him he might kill him but killing is rather a dangerous game to play at in a civilized community ill take his money thought marlowe and beat him within an inch of his life ill teach him to betray me at length julius wandered to a spot solitary enough to suit his purpose strange to say the boy had not turned or noticed his pursuer marlowe was quite out of his thoughts who would think of finding him in this quiet scene but he was destined to be rudely awakened from his dream of security all at once he felt a hand upon his shoulder turning quickly he saw one whom he supposed to be a sailor whats wanted he asked youre wanted what for asked julius not yet recognizing his enemy dont you know me asked marlowe no but i know you you young villain exclaimed marlowe unable longer to repress his fury im the man you sold along with jack morgan ive got a reckoning with you my lad and its goin to be a heavy one i havent followed you all the way from new york for nothing chapter xxiii a timely rescue julius was filled with a terrible fear when in the man who stood over him menacingly he recognized tom marlowe he knew the mans brutal disposition and that he was very much incensed against him he looked wildly around him for help but he could see no one the sailor had hidden behind a large tree and was not visible youre looking for help are you sneered marlowe look all you want to youre in my power now tell me you treacherous young dog why shouldnt i kill you julius regarded him in silent terror you didnt think id get away from the cops you set on my track did you you thought youd get rid of me did you wheres that money you got for selling us eh i didnt sell you said julius trembling dont lie to me i know all about it i followed you when you went with that boy that keeps the necktie stand i know how much you got it was fifty dollars julius was bewildered he did not understand how marlowe could have gained this information do you deny this demanded marlowe i didnt know i was to get any money stammered julius i wouldnt have told of you but paul had been kind to me so you forgot all about jack morgan and me you were ready to sell your best friends but you didnt count the cost my chicken we generally pay up for such favors i promised jack id settle our account and im goin to do it is jack took asked julius shrinking under the mans fierce glance yes he is curse you if it hadnt been for your blabbing tongue wed both have got off with the swag now hand over that money and be quick about it what money faltered julius you know well enough the fifty dollars julius felt thankful now that he had deposited the greater part with paul i havent got it you lie exclaimed marlowe brutally i gave it to paul all except five dollars i dont believe you empty your pockets julius did so but only five dollars were found marlowe was badly disappointed fifty dollars would have been of essential service to him and they had dwindled to five what business had you to give the money to him he demanded harshly i was afraid i might lose it give me the five dollars julius reluctantly handed the bill to his enemy who thrust it into his pocket now said he seizing julius by the shoulder with a dark and menacing look ill give you a lesson youll remember to the last day of your life he threw julius upon the ground and was about savagely to kick the helpless boy who would in all probability have died from the brutal treatment he was likely to receive when he was seized by the collar and sent whirling backward by a powerful hand avast there you lubber said the sailor who had felt it time to interfere what are you about marlowe turned furiously upon his unexpected assailant ill soon let you know if you dont leave here pretty sudden what business is it of yours he said furiously its always my business said the sailor manfully when i see a big brute pitching into a youngster like that i aint the man to stand by and see it done he wants to kill me dont let him implored julius that i wont my lad hell have to kill me too if thats what hes after hell find me a tough customer i reckon this is my boy i shall beat him as i please said marlowe angrily i am not his boy said julius fearing the sailor would credit the statement dont you be afraid my lad if you were his boy ten times over he shouldnt beat you while i am by marlowe was terribly enraged he saw his victim slipping from his grasp just as he was about to glut his vengeance upon him he was a man of violent passions and they got the better of his prudence stand back he shouted advancing toward the intrepid sailor or i will serve you and the boy alike im ready said the other coolly squaring off scientifically marlowe aimed a heavy blow at his head which had it taken effect would have prostrated and perhaps stunned him but it was warded off and a counter blow returned which took better effect marlowe staggered under it but it only maddened him halfblinded he rushed once more upon his opponent but received a welldirected blow full in the chest which stretched him at the sailors feet the latter forbore to take an unmanly advantage of his foes position but calmly waited for him to rise do you want more he asked coolly marlowe had he been wise would have desisted but he was filled with a blind unreasoning rage and advanced again to the attack but he was no match for the stout sailor he fared this time no better than before but again was stretched at the sailors feet by this time the conflict had attracted attention several men came running up among them a member of the local police whats the meaning of all this demanded the latter ask the boy said the sailor julius thus appealed to answered that man wanted to kill me but the sailor stopped him its a lie growled marlowe hes my boy and i was punishing him are you his boy asked the policeman turning to julius no where do you live in new york do you know him yes who is he marlowe saw that it was getting dangerous for him and was anxious to get away the boy may shift for himself he said if you take so much interest in him you can take care of him these last words were addressed to the sailor he turned on his heel and hoped to get away without further trouble stop there said the officer we havent done with you yet what do you want demanded marlowe endeavoring to conceal his alarm under an air of surly bravado i want to know who you are im a sailor then youre a land sailor retorted the true son of neptune is he a sailor asked the officer of julius no sir what is his name his name is marlowe answered julius in spite of the black and menacing looks of his enemy intended to intimidate him marlowe the man implicated in the burglary in madison avenue julius was not required to answer this for at the question showing that he was known marlowe with an oath took to flight closely pursued by all present he had run half a mile before he was secured but his pursuers at length caught up with him and after a sharp struggle in which they were materially assisted by the powerful sailor he was taken and bound if i ever get free ill kill you he muttered between his teeth to julius youll rue this days work julius secure as he was at present could not help shuddering as he heard these threatening words but he felt thankful that he had escaped the present danger the peril was over for the time but julius could not help feeling that he was not wholly safe as long as marlowe was at large i may as well add here that the burglar was delivered to the new york authorities and in due time had his trial was convicted and sentenced to ten years imprisonment in the prison at sing sing this adventure and the excitement attending it spoiled the enjoyment of julius for the afternoon he returned to the pier and took passage on the boat bound for the city he called on paul at his stand and surprised him with the news of marlowes capture and his own narrow escape i am glad to hear it julius said paul so that sailor that followed you was marlowe yes did you see him i noticed him two or three times but had no idea he was following us i never should have known him he looked so different he might have got away if he hadnt been so anxious to revenge himself on you hes got my five dollars said julius regretfully it might have been much worse youve got fortyfive dollars left yet do you want any of it you may give me five more paul drew a fivedollar bill from his pocket and handed it to julius by the way julius he said where do you expect to sleep tonight in the lodgin house come up and stop with me we can find room for you besides my mother will give you a good supper you are very kind to me paul said julius gratefully i ought to be you did us all a great service you must stay with us till it is time for you to go out west julius made some faint objections out of bashfulness but he was so pleasantly received by mrs hoffman and treated with so much kindness that he came to feel quite at home and needed no urging after the first night jimmy asked him a multitude of questions about the burglars how they looked and how they lived to which julius answered patiently when you are out west you must write to us how you are getting along julius said mrs hoffman kindly julius blushed and did not answer he seemed much embarrassed wont you asked jimmy i dont know how to write said julius at last feeling suddenly ashamed of his ignorance such a big boy as you cant write said jimmy in amazement there is plenty of time to learn said paul cheerfully julius has had no chance to learn yet but after he gets to the west he will make it up the mortification which julius felt at his ignorance made him determine to study hard whenever he could he felt that if he wanted to occupy a respectable position in society he must at least know how to read and write chapter xxiv the poor artist a week later julius started for the west with a company of boys who went out under the auspices of the childrens aid society his adventures out west will make the subject of another volume on the day succeeding his departure paul was at his stand when his attention was drawn to a man of respectable appearance but poorly clad and thin and emaciated who after a little hesitation accosted a gentleman who was passing in these words sir i hope you will excuse my liberty in addressing you but i have been sick and am without money can you spare me a trifle i never give to street beggars said the gentleman coldly the applicant shrank back abashed and a look of pain and mortification overspread his features paul noticed it and his heart was filled with compassion he saw that the man was not a common street beggar that except under the pressure of necessity he would not have asked help stepping up to him as he was slowly moving away paul said gently can i assist you in any way sir the other turned at the words i am in great need of help he said i am without money and i have a little daughter at home who wants bread as he said this he came near breaking down let me help you said paul and he drew a dollar from his pocket and passed it to the applicant a thousand thanks for your generous kindness said the stranger gratefully but and here he glanced at pauls humble place of business can you spare this money easily said paul i am doing very well and saving up money every week then i will accept it there are some kind hearts in the world i felt very much depressed by the refusal i just received it was a great sacrifice of pride for me to ask help of any one but the thought of my little daughter removed all my scruples i could bear privation and hunger myself but i could not bear to see her suffer where do you live asked paul in centre street it is a miserable place but all i can afford may i ask your business i am an artist i came from england my native country some months since hoping to better my fortune here but i fell sick in a short time and continued so until a week since you are not looking well i have overcome my disease but i need nourishing food and i have not been able to buy it how did you pay your expenses while you were sick i brought over with me a small sum of money and by great economy i made it last till a week since i am unknown and though i have two pictures finished i cannot sell them i was told that america was a good country for the poor but i do not find it so for me it may be after you are known but what shall i do in the meantime here an idea came to paul he had long intended to obtain a teacher of drawing for jimmy it would be a charity to employ this poor artist if he were competent did you ever give lessons in drawing he asked yes i gave lessons in england i would gladly find scholars here but i am not known i have a little brother who has a great taste for drawing said paul you may begin with him thank you said the stranger warmly you give me new hope i will teach him gladly and leave the price of the lessons to you if you will tell me where you live i will call there at noon you will want to buy some food for your little girl yes poor little mary i must not leave her waiting any longer i shall be very glad to see you at my poor room it is no centre street back room third floor ask for mr henderson i will be sure to call the artist made his way to a bakers where he bought a loaf of bread also at a shop near by he obtained a pint of milk and provided with these he hastened home to his hungry child at noon after taking lunch paul found his way to the address given him by the artist the room was dark and scantily furnished mr henderson sat before an easel trying to work he got up hastily as paul entered i am glad to see you my good young friend he said take a seat is this your little daughter asked paul come here mary and speak to the gentleman said her father mary henderson was a delicate looking little girl of eight years with dark hair and eyes she would have been pretty if she had been stronger and more healthy a few weeks of good food and country air would bring back the roses to her cheeks and fill out her emaciated form have you any pictures finished asked paul i have two small ones would you like to see them very much the artist went to a closet and produced two small pictures unframed one was an english country landscape pretty in design and executed as paul thought with taste i like that he said the other is better said mr henderson he exhibited the other canvas it was a simple sketch of a brother and sister on their way to school the faces were bright and pretty the attitudes natural and graceful and all the details were well carried out you are right said paul this is the best picture the girls face looks familiar it is your own little girl is it not then you see the resemblance yes it is very like but but it represents a blooming healthful child while my poor mary is thin and pale yet when the picture was painted before i left england it was an exact likeness you see what privation and the bad air of the city have done for her she will look like it again a few weeks will bring her back i hope so you ought to get a good price for these pictures mr henderson if i had a name i could if you are willing to trust me with them i will see what i can do for you thank you a thousand times i may not be able to sell them but i will try have you set a price on them no i will sell them for anything they will fetch for five dollars even if no more can be obtained i hope to get more mary wrap up the pictures for the gentleman said her father the little girl did so if you can call on me this evening at halfpast seven mr henderson said paul i will make arrangements about your giving lessons to my little brother i will certainly do so you will not be afraid to leave your little girl alone she can stay with a neighbor then i will expect you paul wrote down his address and took his leave with the pictures under his arm he had thought of a customer he knew that mr preston was not only rich but kindhearted and charitable even if he did not want the pictures he thought he would be willing to give a small sum for them and even a little would be of great service to the povertystricken artist he therefore made his way to mr prestons countingroom and was admitted to his presence are you busy mr preston asked our hero not particularly i can spare you a few minutes he looked inquiringly at the parcel paul carried under his arm i have come to sell you some pictures mr preston you havent turned artist said the merchant surprised no but i am acting as agent for a poor artist who is in great need of money a poor artist in both senses of the word eh paul no i think not i am not a judge of pictures but these seem to me very good let me see them paul unrolled the bundle and displayed them mr preston took them in his hands and examined them with interest they are good pictures he said after a pause who is the artist an englishman named henderson i will tell you all i know of his story he has been very unfortunate and is now in pressing need of assistance mr preston listened to the story with which the reader is already familiar when it was concluded he said we must help him i am going to take him as teacher for my little brother jimmy i will purchase the picture of the children for fifty dollars it will be a fortune to the poor man said paul joyfully when shall you see him tonight then i will give you the money to hand to him besides i will give him a note to goupil who will allow him to exhibit the other picture in his store that may secure its sale thank you mr preston you will do him a great kindness paul left the picture of which he had disposed and taking the other under his arm went back to the necktie stand he felt an honest pleasure in the thought of the happiness he was about to confer upon the poor artist it will set him on his feet he thought chapter xxv mr talbots return jimmy said paul on reaching home there is a gentleman coming to see you this evening a gentleman to see me repeated the little boy in surprise yes mr henderson but i dont know him you will know him very soon he is an artist and is going to give you lessons how good you are paul said jimmy joyfully but he added considerately wont you have to pay him a good deal no he is a poor man and it is partly to help him that i have engaged him to give you lessons i expect him in an hour so get out your best drawings so that he will see how far you are advanced does he paint pictures i should like to see some of them i have one with me oh let me see it paul removed the paper from the painting he had brought with him and displayed it to his little brother it is beautiful paul i wonder if i can ever paint such a nice picture no doubt you can if you study faithfully i brought away another of mr hendersons pictures which i like better than this but i have sold it to mr preston how much did you get for it fifty dollars isnt that a large price asked mrs hoffman not for a good picture i dare say jimmy will by and by be charging as much as that for a picture i hope so paul i would like to earn some money you are too young to earn money now jimmy that will come in good time soon after the supper table was cleared mr henderson called i am glad to see you mr henderson said paul cordially this is my mother mrs hoffman and here is the young scholar i told you of jimmy looked up shyly he has seen your picture and likes it by the way i have sold one of your pictures the one introducing the children thank you for your kindness said the artist his face brightening you have done what i could not do and it will give me very welcome aid i hope the price will be satisfactory said paul i did not expect much said mr henderson who inferred that the price obtained was small i am unknown and i have no right to expect much for my work i sold it to a friend of mine for fifty dollars continued paul fifty dollars exclaimed the poor artist hardly crediting the testimony of his ears yes said paul enjoying his surprise is it satisfactory satisfactory it is ten times as much as i expected how can i ever thank you said mr henderson seizing pauls hand in his fervent gratitude the purchaser is rich and he has promised to speak a word to goupil in your favor heaven sent you to my help said the artist what a change has a single day wrought this morning i woke without a penny and my poor child without bread tonight i am rich and hope has once more visited me i owe all my good fortune to you will you permit me to give lessons to your brother without charge no said paul decidedly i think every one ought to be paid for their work what i have done for you has given me very little trouble i am glad that i could help you i know what it is to be poor and most people would call me poor now but i can earn enough for our expenses and lay up something besides so i do not feel poor now jimmy go and bring your drawings and show the gentleman the drawings were brought and to jimmys delight elicited warm approval from the artist your brother has great talent said he i shall be very glad to have him for a pupil it is much pleasanter to teach where the scholar has taste and talent when would you like the lessons to begin as soon as possible tomorrow if you can come and at what time at any time i suppose the day would be better yes it would be better on account of the light besides i like to be with my little daughter in the evening have you a little daughter asked mrs hoffman yes madam she must be nearly the age of my young pupil here bring her with you at any time said motherly mrs hoffman i shall be glad to have her come if she would not be in the way not at all we have plenty of room and jimmy has no playmate we shall be very glad to see her mary will enjoy coming said her father i appreciate your kindness in inviting her by the way mr henderson suggested paul why dont you move into the upper part of the city it will be more convenient for you especially if you get other pupils it is a good plan said the artist i could not do so before because i had no money now thanks to your kindness i can do so it was arranged that jimmy should take two lessons a week for which paul agreed to pay a dollar each the sum was small but to mr henderson it was an important help i will anticipate the future so far as to say that after a while through the persistent efforts of paul aided by mr preston he obtained three other pupils from whom he was able to obtain a higher price and occasionally he effected the sale of a picture so that he was able to occupy more comfortable rooms and provide himself with better clothing the days of his adversity were over and he now enjoyed a moderate degree of prosperity little mary regained her lost flesh and color and once more looked as she did when she sat for the figure of the girl in her fathers picture which paul had sold to mr preston she came often with her father when he was to give a lesson to jimmy and sometimes mrs hoffman called to invite her to accompany jimmy and herself to central park as to jimmy he surprised his teacher by the rapid progress which he made he would have devoted all his time to drawing if his mother had permitted but she was not willing that he should neglect his school studies for jimmy now attended school his health too had improved and he no longer looked weak and delicate so several months passed away pauls business continued good it did not increase much for there was not an opportunity for that but he averaged fifteen dollars a week profit and that he justly felt was a very good income from such a limited business mrs hoffman continued to make ties for paul so she too earned three or four dollars a week and as they had no house rent to pay they were able not only to live very comfortably paying all the bills promptly but to save up money besides in addition to the money in mr prestons hands paul had an account at a downtown savingsbank which already amounted to over two hundred dollars we must save money now mother said paul for mr talbot will be coming home by and by and then we shall have to look up other rooms and pay rent do you know when he means to come home has mr preston told you no mother i think i will call round in the morning and inquire he has already been away more than a year when paul entered mr prestons countingroom the next morning that gentleman looked up from his desk and said i was just about to write you a letter paul indeed sir yes i am in receipt of a letter from mr talbot in which he announces his immediate return home he will be here in four weeks and he desires your mother to engage women to clean the house thoroughly and put it in order for his occupation of course you will keep an account of all you have to expend in this way and you can hand me the bill yes sir i will see that it is done paul heard with some regret of mr talbots speedy return it would curtail his income considerably still he felt that mr talbot would be satisfied with the manner in which his mother and himself had acquitted themselves of their trust and that was a source of satisfaction he gave his mother immediate notice of the approaching return of mr talbot and she began to look about for rooms to which to remove at length she found a very comfortable place at twenty dollars a month half that sum would have obtained them shelter in a poor tenement house but both paul and his mother had become fastidious and felt that such economy would be out of place they must have a respectable and comfortable home even if they were prevented thereby from adding so much to their account at the savingsbank at length the steamer in which the talbots had taken passage arrived a coach brought them from the pier to the house mrs hoffman and paul were in waiting to receive them mrs talbot expressed herself pleased with the neat appearance of the house and mr talbot called paul aside my young friend he said i deferred till my return home the acknowledgment of your very creditable conduct in the defense of my house you showed a coolness and good judgment remarkable in one of your age in return for this and in acknowledgment of the generally satisfactory manner in which you and your mother have kept my house i ask your acceptance of this pocketbook with its contents when paul opened it he was astonished and delighted to find that it contained two onehundred dollar bills one of them properly belongs to you mother he said but mrs hoffman refused to take it no paul she said you are the treasurer of our little household take this money and add to your savings some time you will find it useful in enlarging your business or entering upon a new one i will put it in the savingsbank as you recommend mother but you must remember that the fund there is yours as much as mine i will promise to call for money paul whenever i want it i like to think that we have so large a fund to draw upon in case of need chapter xxvi from the sidewalk to the shop one morning some months later paul was looking over the advertising columns of the herald as his eye glanced carelessly over the chances for business his attention was drawn to the following for sale the stock and fixtures of a gentlemens small furnishing store good reasons for selling apply at no sixth avenue i wonder how much it would cost thought paul i wish i had a small store instead of a stand i could make more money besides it would be more comfortable in cold and stormy weather it was a raw morning in november paul had his hands in his pockets and had much ado to keep warm but he knew that worse days were to come the winter before he had suffered not a little on some days when he felt the necessity of keeping at his business let me see he reflected i have about six hundred dollars that is something but it wouldnt go far toward stocking a store still i have a great mind to go up and look at the place and inquire about terms the more paul thought about it the more he felt a desire to go he accordingly got a boy in whom he felt confidence to attend his stand while he himself jumped on a sixth avenue car and rode up to the shop advertised on entering he found it small but neat and to all appearance a good stand for business the proprietor a man of thirtyfive or thereabouts came forward what can i show you he asked i saw your advertisement in the herald said paul and came to inquire about it you want to sell out yes it is on account of my wifes health the doctor says the city air doesnt agree with her and orders her into the country i dont want to be separated from her and besides i have a chance to open a store in a country town where my uncle lives is this a good stand for business excellent i am making more money here than i can expect to outside of the city but of course that is not to be put in the scale against my wifes health were you thinking of going into the business i should like to but i have not much capital at what price do you value your stock at two thousand dollars that is more money than i have got ill tell you what i will do if you will give me a thousand dollars down and give me good security for the balance payable a year hence i will sell out to you what is the rent a thousand dollars isnt that a good deal in proportion to the value of my stock it is but i keep turning it over last year after paying rent and all expenses including wages to a boy of seventeen who assisted me i cleared two thousand dollars to paul this seemed considerable it would be a great improvement upon his present position and he would enjoy much more being the owner of a store than of a street stand but where would he get the money couldnt you take less than a thousand dollars down he asked the man shook his head i need that amount at once he said you had better accept my terms you cant do better cant you raise the money somewhere i will see said paul he had thought of mr preston he knew that mr preston was his friend and that he was fully able to assist him he would go and see him and consult him about the matter not directly asking him for help but giving him an opportunity to offer i will come back tomorrow and give you my answer he said come tonight if you can very well i will if possible paul was fortunate enough to find mr preston in goodmorning paul said the merchant pleasantly what can i do for you this morning i want to consult you on a matter of business mr preston i shall be glad to advise you as well as i can hereupon paul explained the matter first displaying the advertisement do you think the shop favorably situated for business asked mr preston yes sir is it pretty well stocked yes sir if i had it i might want to increase the stock a little so the man asks a thousand dollars cash yes sir how much money have you six hundred well paul i think favorably of your plan if you want to take the shop i will lend you the money you need and stand security for the remainder thank you sir said paul joyfully wait a minute till you hear my conditions this is strictly a business arrangement between us i expect you to pay me interest at the legal rate and to pay it punctually as it falls due you understand that yes sir that is only fair as you say it is only fair yet borrowers are apt to forget it they will make all sorts of promises when they want to borrow and break them afterward even honest men will think it is enough to pay interest whenever it is convenient forgetting that by their neglect they are injuring their credit some years since i helped two former clerks to establish themselves in business both were honest but while one was prompt in all his engagements and waited upon me on the very day the interest came due with the money ready the other obliged me to send for it and then put me off on every occasion though he paid finally the result was that after a while i assisted the first cheerfully to extend his business the second hearing of it made a similar application which i promptly refused do you wonder at it not at all sir i think you were perfectly right be prompt in all your engagements that is a good rule in business and in everything else i have confidence in your integrity and shall be very glad to assist you go and finish your negotiation and when you want the money come to me thank you sir not only for your kind offer but for your advice he is going to succeed said the merchant as paul went out he will some day be a prosperous man the merchant was pleased at the respect with which his advice was received young america is very apt to regard the counsel of the old and experienced as of slight value but in this they make a great mistake there are plenty of young men who from their own selfsufficiency and impatience of good advice go to financial ruin every year he shows wisdom who avails himself of the experience of other men avoiding their errors and imitating what in them is worthy of imitation paul returned to the shop and made a careful examination of the stock he came to the conclusion that the price asked was not excessive and agreed to pay it in the course of two days the transfer was concluded and paul transferred the small stock of his necktie stand to the shop which he had taken during all this time he had said nothing to his mother of the change he had made he wanted to surprise her mother he said on the second morning of his possession i want you to take a little walk with me this morning may i go too paul asked jimmy yes jimmy i meant to invite you so get your cap where shall we walk to paul asked his mother i dont mean to tell you just yet you will soon know is it a secret asked mrs hoffman smiling yes it is a great secret then i will try to stifle my curiosity for a time what is it paul whisper it to me said jimmy you must wait too said paul i believe you are more curious than mother they had not far to walk when they reached the shop the sign told them nothing for paul had not yet had time to have his own put up he had given the order to a signpainter but it would take time to fulfill it i want to go in here a minute he said shall we wait outside asked his mother no come in i would like to have you see the shop the three entered a young clerk who had been in the employ of the former proprietor and whom paul had agreed to retain at the same wages was behind the counter goodmorning mr hoffman he said have you sold anything this morning asked paul yes sir i have entered the sales on the slate let me see them a new style of necktie is out i think it will be well to get it it was asked for this morning very well just make a memorandum of it paul said mrs hoffman who had listened to the conversation in surprise have you anything to do with this store i am the proprietor answered paul smiling is it true how did it happen i wanted to surprise you mother and so i told you nothing about it when did you come into it this is only the second day mr preston helped me or i could not have carried out the arrangement do you think you can pay all your expenses and make money asked mrs hoffman a little frightened when she heard of the rent which paul had agreed to pay i mean to try mother i dont feel much afraid i shall devote myself faithfully to business and if i dont do well it wont be my fault we have kept our promise and shown how paul advanced slowly but surely from the humble position of a street merchant to be the proprietor of a shop now that several years have elapsed i am able to say that he succeeded even beyond his anticipations at the end of two years he took a larger shop and engaged two extra clerks prompt in his engagements and of thorough integrity he is likely to be even more prosperous as the years roll on his mother is no longer dependent upon him mr henderson the english artist now able to obtain purchasers for his pictures at remunerative prices asked her to become his wife and a mother to his little girl and after a little hesitation she consented partly i think because jimmy liked the artist so much mr henderson took pains to instruct jimmy and develop his talent with such encouraging success that pauls prediction seems likely to be fulfilled and i shall not be surprised if the name of james hoffman should before many years rank among the most prominent in the
