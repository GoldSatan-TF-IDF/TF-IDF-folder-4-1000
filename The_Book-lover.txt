how easily how secretly how safely they expose the nakedness of human ignorance without putting it to shame these are the masters who instruct us without rods and ferules without hard words and anger without clothes or money if you approach them they are not asleep if investigating you interrogate them they conceal nothing if you mistake them they never grumble if you are ignorant they cannot laugh at you you only o books are liberal and independent you give to all who ask and enfranchise all who serve you assiduously truly you are the ears filled with most palatable grains you are golden urns in which manna is laid up rocks flowing with honey or rather indeed honeycombs udders most copiously yielding the milk of life storerooms ever full the fourstreamed river of paradise where the human mind is fed and the arid intellect moistened and watered fruitful olives vines of engaddi figtrees knowing no sterility burning lamps to be ever held in the hand the library therefore of wisdom is more precious than all riches and nothing that can be wished for is worthy to be compared with it whosoever acknowledges himself to be a zealous follower of truth of happiness of wisdom of science or even of the faith must of necessity make himself a lover of books richard de bury books are friends whose society is extremely agreeable to me they are of all ages and of every country they have distinguished themselves both in the cabinet and in the field and obtained high honors for their knowledge of the sciences it is easy to gain access to them for they are always at my service and i admit them to my company and dismiss them from it whenever i please they are never troublesome but immediately answer every question i ask them some relate to me the events of past ages while others reveal to me the secrets of nature some teach me how to live and others how to die some by their vivacity drive away my cares and exhilarate my spirits while others give fortitude to my mind and teach me the important lesson how to restrain my desires and to depend wholly on myself they open to me in short the various avenues of all the arts and sciences and upon their information i safely rely in all emergencies in return for all these services they only ask me to accommodate them with a convenient chamber in some corner of my humble habitation where they may repose in peace for these friends are more delighted by the tranquility of retirement than with the tumults of society francesco petrarca books are the glasse of counsell to dress ourselves by they are lifes best business vocation to

petitioner they are for company the best friends in doubts counsellours in damp comforters times perspective the home travellers ship or horse the busie mans best recreation the opiate of idle wearinesse the minds best ordinary natures garden and seedplot of immortality a writer of the sixteenth century quoted in allibones dictionary but how can i live here without my books i really seem to myself crippled and only half myself for if as the great orator used to say arms are a soldiers members surely books are the limbs of scholars corasius says of a truth he who would deprive me of books my old friends would take away all the delight of my life nay i will even say all desire of living balthasar bonifacius rhodiginus for books are not absolutely dead things but do contain a potency of life in them to be as active as that soul was whose progeny they are nay they do preserve as in a vial the purest efficacy and extraction of that living intellect that bred them i know they are as lively and as vigorously productive as those fabulous dragons teeth and being sown up and down may chance to spring up armed men many a man lives a burden to the earth but a good book is the precious lifeblood of a master spirit embalmed and treasured up on purpose for a life beyond life john milton books are a guide in youth and an entertainment for age they support us under solitude and keep us from being a burden to ourselves they help us to forget the crossness of men and things compose our cares and our passions and lay our disappointments asleep when we are weary of the living we may repair to the dead who have nothing of peevishness pride or design in their conversation jeremy collier god be thanked for books they are the voices of the distant and the dead and make us heirs of the spiritual life of past ages books are the true levellers they give to all who will faithfully use them the society the spiritual presence of the best and greatest of our race no matter how poor i am no matter though the prosperous of my own time will not enter my obscure dwelling if the sacred writers will enter and take up their abode under my roof if milton will cross my threshold to sing to me of paradise and shakspeare to open to me the worlds of imagination and the workings of the human heart and franklin to enrich me with his practical wisdom i shall not pine for want of intellectual companionship and i may become a cultivated man though excluded from what is called the best society in the place where i live william ellery channing in a corner of my house i have books the miracle of all my possessions more wonderful than the wishingcap of the arabian tales for they transport me instantly not only to all places but to all times by my books i can conjure up before me to a momentary existence many of the great and good men of past ages and for my individual satisfaction they seem to act again the most renowned of their achievements the orators declaim for me the historians recite the poets sing dr arnott wondrous indeed is the virtue of a true book not like a dead city of stones yearly crumbling yearly needing repair more like a tilled field but then a spiritual field like a spiritual tree let me rather say it stands from year to year and from age to age we have books that already number some hundred and fifty human ages and yearly comes its new produce of leaves commentaries deductions philosophical political systems or were it only sermons pamphlets journalistic essays every one of which is talismanic and thaumaturgic for it can persuade man o thou who art able to write a book which once in two centuries or oftener there is a man gifted to do envy not him whom they name citybuilder and inexpressibly pity him whom they name conqueror or cityburner thou too art a conqueror and victor but of the true sort namely over the devil thou too hast built what will outlast all marble and metal and be a wonderbringing city of mind a temple and seminary and prophetic mount whereto all kindreds of the earth will pilgrim thomas carlyle good books like good friends are few and chosen the more select the more enjoyable and like these are approached with diffidence nor sought too familiarly nor too often having the precedence only when friends tire the most mannerly of companions accessible at all times in all moods they frankly declare the authors mind without giving offence like living friends they too have their voice and physiognomies and their company is prized as old acquaintances we seek them in our need of counsel or of amusement without impertinence or apology sure of having our claims allowed a good book justifies our theory of personal supremacy keeping this fresh in the memory and perennial what were days without such fellowship we were alone in the world without it a bronson alcott consider what you have in the smallest chosen library a company of the wisest and wittiest men that could be picked out of all civil countries in a thousand years have set in best order the results of their learning and wisdom the men themselves were hid and inaccessible solitary impatient of interruption fenced by etiquette but the thought which they did not uncover to their bosom friend is here written out in transparent words to us the strangers of another age we owe to books those general benefits which come from high intellectual action thus i think we often owe to them the perception of immortality they impart sympathetic activity to the moral power go with mean people and you think life is mean then read plutarch and the world is a proud place peopled with men of positive quality with heroes and demigods standing around us who will not let us sleep then they address the imagination only poetry inspires poetry they become the organic culture of the time college education is the reading of certain books which the common sense of all scholars agrees will represent the science already accumulated in the highest civilization the book is still the highest delight ralph waldo emerson a great book that comes from a great thinker it is a ship of thought deepfreighted with truth with beauty too it sails the ocean driven by the winds of heaven breaking the level sea of life into beauty where it goes leaving behind it a train of sparkling loveliness widening as the ship goes on and what a treasure it brings to every land scattering the seeds of truth justice love and piety to bless the world in ages yet to come theodore parker what is a great love of books it is something like a personal introduction to the great and good men of all past times books it is true are silent as you see them on their shelves but silent as they are when i enter a library i feel as if almost the dead were present and i know if i put questions to these books they will answer me with all the faithfulness and fulness which has been left in them by the great men who have left the books with us john bright i love my books as drinkers love their wine the more i drink the more they seem divine with joy elate my soul in love runs oer and each fresh draught is sweeter than before books bring me friends whereer on earth i be solace of solitude bonds of society i love my books they are companions dear sterling in worth in friendship most sincere here talk i with the wise in ages gone and with the nobly gifted in our own if love joy laughter sorrow please my mind love joy grief laughter in my books i find francis bennoch books are the windows through which the soul looks out henry ward beecher books are our household gods and we cannot prize them too highly they are the only gods in all the mythologies that are beautiful and unchangeable for they betray no man and love their lovers i confess myself an idolater of this literary religion and am grateful for the blessed ministry of books it is a kind of heathenism which needs no missionary funds no bible even to abolish it for the bible itself caps the peak of this new olympus and crowns it with sublimity and glory amongst the many things we have to be thankful for as the result of modern discoveries surely this of printed books is the highest of all and i for one am so sensible of its merits that i never think of the name of gutenberg without feelings of veneration and homage january searle the only true equalizers in the world are books the only treasurehouse open to all comers is a library the only wealth which will not decay is knowledge the only jewel which you can carry beyond the grave is wisdom to live in this equality to share in these treasures to possess this wealth and to secure this jewel may be the happy lot of every one all that is needed for the acquisition of these inestimable treasures is the love of books j a langford let us thank god for books when i consider what some books have done for the world and what they are doing how they keep up our hope awaken new courage and faith soothe pain give an ideal life to those whose homes are hard and cold bind together distant ages and foreign lands create new worlds of beauty bring down truths from heaven i give eternal blessings for this gift and pray that we may use it aright and abuse it not james freeman clarke books we know are a substantial world both pure and good round these with tendrils strong as flesh and blood our pastime and our happiness will grow william wordsworth precious and priceless are the blessings which books scatter around our daily paths we walk in imagination with the noblest spirits through the most sublime and enchanting regions regions which to all that is lovely in the forms and colors of earth add the gleam the light that never was on sea or land the consecration and the poets dream a motion of the hand brings all arcadia to sight the war of troy can at our bidding rage in the narrowest chamber without stirring from our firesides we may roam to the most remote regions of the earth or soar into realms where spensers shapes of unearthly beauty flock to meet us where miltons angels peal in our ears the choral hymns of paradise science art literature philosophy all that man has thought all that man has done the experience that has been bought with the sufferings of a hundred generations all are garnered up for us in the world of books there among realities in a substantial world we move with the crowned kings of thought there our minds have a free range our hearts a free utterance reason is confined within none of the partitions which trammel it in life in that world no divinity hedges a king no accident of rank or fashion ennobles a dunce or shields a knave we can select our companions from among the most richly gifted of the sons of god and they are companions who will not desert us in poverty or sickness or disgrace edwin p whipple my latest passion shall be for books friedrich ii of prussia for what a world of books offers itself in all subjects arts and sciences to the sweet content and capacity of the reader in arithmetic geometry perspective optics astronomy architecture sculptura pictura of which so many and such elaborate treatises are of late written in mechanics and their mysteries military matters navigation riding of horses fencing swimming gardening planting etc what so sure what so pleasant what vast tomes are extant in law physic and divinity for profit pleasure practice speculation in verse or prose their names alone are the subject of whole volumes we have thousands of authors of all sorts many great libraries full well furnished like so many dishes of meat served out for several palates and he is a very block that is affected with none of them robert burton except a living man there is nothing more wonderful than a book a message to us from the dead from human souls whom we never saw who lived perhaps thousands of miles away and yet these on those little sheets of paper speak to us amuse us vivify us teach us comfort us open their hearts to us as brothers we ought to reverence books to look at them as useful and mighty things if they are good and true they are the message of christ the maker of all things the teacher of all truth charles kingsley golden volumes richest treasures objects of delicious pleasures you my eyes rejoicing please you my hands in rapture seize brilliant wits and musing sages lights who beamed through many ages left to your conscious leaves their story and dared to trust you with their glory and now their hope of fame achieved dear volumes you have not deceived henry rantzau illustration illustration chapter i on the choice of books the choice of books is not the least part of the duty of a scholar if he would become a man and worthy to deal with manlike things he must read only the bravest and noblest books books forged at the heart and fashioned by the intellect of a godlike man january searle the most important question for you to ask yourself be you teacher or scholar is this what books shall i read for him who has inclination to read there is no dearth of reading matter and it is obtainable almost for the asking books are in a manner thrust upon you almost daily shall you read without discrimination whatever comes most readily to hand as well say that you will accept as a friend and companion every man whom you meet on the street shall you read even every good book that comes in your way simply because it is harmless and interesting it is not every harmless book nor indeed every good book that will make your mind the richer for the reading of it never perhaps has the right choice of books been more difficult than at present and never did it behoove more strongly both teachers and scholars to look well to the character of that which they read first then let us consider what books we are to avoid all will agree that those which are really and absolutely bad should be shunned as we shun a pestilence in these last years of the nineteenth century there is no more prolific cause of evil than bad books there are many books so utterly vile that there is no mistaking their character and no question as to whether they should be avoided there are others which are a thousandfold more dangerous because they come to us disguised wolves in sheeps clothing affecting a character of harmlessness if not of sanctity i have heard those who ought to know better laugh at the silly jokes of a very silly book and offer by way of excuse that there was nothing very bad in it i have heard teachers recommend to their pupils reading matter which to say the least was of a very doubtful character now the only excuse that can be offered in such cases is ignorance i didnt know there was any harm in the book but the teacher who through ignorance poisons the moral character and checks the mental growth of his pupils is as guilty of criminal carelessness as the druggists clerk who by mistake sells arsenic for quinine step down and out of that responsible position which you are in no wise qualified to fill the direction of the pupils habits of reading the choice of reading matter for them is by no means the least of the teachers duties the elder pliny eighteen hundred years ago was accustomed to say that no book was so bad but that some part of it might be read with profit this may have been true in plinys time but it is very far from correct nowadays a large number of books and many which attain an immense circulation are but the embodiment of evil from beginning to end others although not absolutely and aggressively bad contain not a single line that can be read with profit what are the sure criterions of a bad book there is no better authority on this subject than the rev robert collyer he says if when i read a book about god i find that it has put him farther from me or about man that it has put me farther from him or about this universe that it has shaken down upon it a new look of desolation turning a green field into a wild moor or about life that it has made it seem a little less worth living on all accounts than it was or about moral principles that they are not quite so clear and strong as they were when this author began to talk then i know that on any of these five cardinal things in the life of man his relations to god to his fellows to the world about him and the world within him and the great principles on which all things stable centre that for me is a bad book it may chime in with some lurking appetite in my own nature and so seem to be as sweet as honey to my taste but it comes to bitter bad results it may be food for another i can say nothing to that he may be a pine while i am a palm i only know this that in these great first things if the book i read shall touch them at all it shall touch them to my profit or i will not read it right and wrong shall grow more clear life in and about me more divine i shall come nearer to my fellows and god nearer to me or the thing is a poison faust or calvin or carlyle if any one of these cardinal things is the grain and the grist of the book and that is what it comes to when i read it i am being drugged and poisoned and the sooner i know it the better i want bread and meat and milk not brandy or opium or hasheesh and robert southey the poet expresses nearly the same thing young readers you whose hearts are open whose understandings are not yet hardened and whose feelings are not yet exhausted nor encrusted with the world take from me a better rule than any professors of criticism will teach you would you know whether the tendency of a book is good or evil examine in what state of mind you lay it down has it induced you to suspect that what you have been accustomed to think unlawful may after all be innocent and that may be harmless which you have hitherto been taught to think dangerous has it tended to make you dissatisfied and impatient under the control of others and disposed you to relax in that selfgovernment without which both the laws of god and man tell us there can be no virtue and consequently no happiness has it attempted to abate your admiration and reverence for what is great and good and to diminish in you the love of your country and your fellowcreatures has it addressed itself to your pride your vanity your selfishness or any other of your evil propensities has it defiled the imagination with what is loathsome and shocked the heart with what is monstrous has it disturbed the sense of right and wrong which the creator has implanted in the human soul if so if you are conscious of any or all of these effects or if having escaped from all you have felt that such were the effects it was intended to produce throw the book in the fire whatever name it may bear in the titlepage throw it in the fire young man though it should have been the gift of a friend young lady away with the whole set though it should be the prominent furniture of a rosewood bookcase it is the case with literature as with life says arthur schopenhauer the german philosopher wherever we turn we come upon the incorrigible mob of humankind whose name is legion swarming everywhere damaging everything as flies in summer hence the multiplicity of bad books those exuberant weeds of literature which choke the true corn such books rob the public of time money and attention which ought properly to belong to good literature and noble aims and they are written with a view merely to make money or occupation they are therefore not merely useless but injurious nine tenths of our current literature has no other end but to inveigle a thaler or two out of the public pocket for which purpose author publisher and printer are leagued together of bad books we can never read too little of the good never too much the bad are intellectual poison and undermine the understanding from thomas carlyles inaugural address at edinburgh on the occasion of his installation as rector of the university in i quote the following potent passage i do not know whether it has been sufficiently brought home to you that there are two kinds of books when a man is reading on any kind of subject in most departments of books in all books if you take it in a wide sense he will find that there is a division into good books and bad books everywhere a good kind of a book and a bad kind of a book i am not to assume that you are unacquainted or illacquainted with this plain fact but i may remind you that it is becoming a very important consideration in our day there is a number a frightfully increasing number of books that are decidedly to the readers of them not useful but an ingenious reader will learn also that a certain number of books were written by a supremely noble kind of people not a very great number of books but still a number fit to occupy all your reading industry do adhere more or less to that side of things in short as i have written it down somewhere else i conceive that books are like mens souls divided into sheep and goats some few are going up and carrying us up heavenward calculated i mean to be of priceless advantage in teaching in forwarding the teaching of all generations others a frightful multitude are going down down doing ever the more and the wider and the wilder mischief keep a strict eye on that latter class of books my young friends speaking of those books whose inward character and influence it is hard at first to discern john ruskin says avoid especially that class of literature which has a knowing tone it is the most poisonous of all every good book or piece of book is full of admiration and awe it may contain firm assertion or stern satire but it never sneers coldly nor asserts haughtily and it always leads you to reverence or love something with your whole heart it is not always easy to distinguish the satire of the venomous race of books from the satire of the noble and pure ones but in general you may notice that the coldblooded crustacean and batrachian books will sneer at sentiment and the warmblooded human books at sin much of the literature of the present day though good to be read by persons of ripe age has a tendency to agitate rather than confirm and leaves its readers too frequently in a helpless or hopeless indignation the worst possible state into which the mind of youth can be thrown it may indeed become necessary for you as you advance in life to set your hand to things that need to be altered in the world or apply your heart chiefly to what must be pitied in it or condemned but for a young person the safest temper is one of reverence and the safest place one of obscurity certainly at present and perhaps through all your life your teachers are wisest when they make you content in quiet virtue and that literature and art are best for you which point out in common life and familiar things the objects for hopeful labor and for humble love there would be fewer bad books in the world if readers were properly informed and warned of their character and we may believe that the really vicious books would soon cease to exist if their makers and publishers were popularly regarded with the same detestation as other corrupters of the public morals he who has published an injurious book says robert south sins as it were in his very grave corrupts others while he is rotting himself addison says much the same thing writers of great talents who employ their parts in propagating immorality and seasoning vicious sentiments with wit and humor are to be looked upon as the pests of society and the enemies of mankind they leave books behind them to scatter infection and destroy their posterity they act the counterparts of a confucius or a socrates and seem to have been sent into the world to deprave human nature and sink it into the condition of brutality and william cobbett is still more severe in his denunciation in his advice to young men he says i hope that your taste will keep you aloof from the writings of those detestable villains who employ the powers of their mind in debauching the minds of others or in endeavors to do it they present their poison in such captivating forms that it requires great virtue and resolution to withstand their temptations and they have perhaps done a thousand times as much mischief in the world as all the infidels and atheists put together these men ought to be held in universal abhorrence and never spoken of but with execration but the shunning of bad books is only one of the problems presented to us in the choice of our reading in the great multitude of really good and valuable books how shall we choose those which are of the most vital importance to us to know the universal habit of desultory reading reading simply to be entertained is a habit not to be indulged in nor encouraged by scholars or by those who aspire to the station of teachers there are perhaps a score of books which should be read and studied by every one who claims the title of reader but aside from these each person should determine through a process of rigid selfexamination what course of reading and what books are likely to produce the most profitable results to him find out if possible what is your special bent of mind what line of inquiry or investigation is the most congenial to your taste or mental capacity having determined this question let your reading all centre upon that topic of study which you have made your own let it be literature science history art or any of the innumerable subdivisions of these subjects in other words choose a specialty and follow it with an eye single to it alone says frederic harrison every book that we take up without a purpose is an opportunity lost of taking up a book with a purpose every bit of stray information which we cram into our heads without any sense of its importance is for the most part a bit of the most useful information driven out of our heads and choked off from our minds we know that books differ in value as much as diamonds differ from the sand on the seashore as much as our living friend differs from a dead rat we know that much in the myriadpeopled world of books very much in all kinds is trivial enervating inane even noxious and thus where we have infinite opportunities of wasting our effort to no end of fatiguing our minds without enriching them of clogging the spirit without satisfying it there i cannot but think the very infinity of opportunities is robbing us of the actual power of using them to know anything that turns up is in the infinity of knowledge to know nothing to read the first book we come across in the wilderness of books is to learn nothing to turn over the pages of ten thousand volumes is to be practically indifferent to all that is good it is of paramount importance says schopenhauer to acquire the art not to read in other words of not reading such books as occupy the public mind or even those which make a noise in the world and reach several editions in their first and last year of existence we should recollect that he who writes for fools finds an enormous audience and we should devote the ever scant leisure of our circumscribed existence to the masterspirits of all ages and nations those who tower over humanity and whom the voice of fame proclaims only such writers cultivate and instruct us and john ruskin offers the following pertinent advice to beginners it is of the greatest importance to you not only for arts sake but for all kinds of sake in these days of book deluge to keep out of the salt swamps of literature and live on a little rocky island of your own with a spring and a lake in it pure and good i cannot of course suggest the choice of your library to you for every several mind needs different books but there are some books which we all need and assuredly if you read homer plato aeschylus herodotus dante shakspeare and spenser as much as you ought you will not require wide enlargement of your shelves to right and left of them for purposes of perpetual study among modern books avoid generally magazine and review literature sometimes it may contain a useful abridgment or a wholesome piece of criticism but the chances are ten to one it will either waste your time or mislead you if you want to understand any subject whatever read the best book upon it you can hear of not a review of the book a common book will often give you much amusement but it is only a noble book which will give you dear friends if any of us could recall the time which we have spent in desultory and profitless reading and devote it now faithfully to the prosecution of that special line of study which ought long ago to have been chosen how largely we might add to our fund of useful knowledge and how grandly we might increase our intellectual stature and again remarks james herbert morse if i could recover the hours idly given to the newspaper not for my own gratification but solely for my neighbor at the breakfasttable i could compass a solid course of english and american history get at the antecedents of political parties in the two countries and give the reasons for the existence of gladstone and parnell of blaine and edmunds in modern politics and there is undoubtedly a reason for them all two columns a day in the newspapers which i could easily have spared for they were given mainly to murdertrials and the search for corpses or to the romance of the reporter concerning the same have during the last ten years absorbed just about the time i might have spent in reading a very respectable course in history one embracing say curtius and grote for greece mommsen merivale and gibbon for rome macaulay and green for my roots in saxondom bancroft hildreth and palfrey for the ancestral tree in america together with a very notable excursion into spain and holland with motley and prescott a course which i consider very desirable and one which should set up a man of middle age very fairly in historical knowledge i am sure i could have saved this amount out of any ten years of my newspaper reading alone without cutting off any portion of that really valuable contribution for which the daily paper is to be honored and which would be needed to make me an intelligent man in the history of my own times it is not necessary that in selecting a library or in choosing what you will read you should have many books at your disposal a few books well chosen and carefully read will be of infinitely more value to you than any miscellaneous collection however large it is possible for the man of one book to be better equipped in knowledge and literary attainments than he whose shelves are loaded with all the fashionable literature of the day if your means will not permit you the luxury of a library buy one book or a few books chosen with special reference to the line of reading which you have determined upon let no honeymouthed bookagent persuade you to buy of his wares unless they bear exactly upon your specialty you cannot afford to waste money on mere catchpenny or machine publications whose only recommendation is that they are harmless and that they sell well that man is to be envied who can say i have a library of fifty or of a hundred volumes all relating to my chosen line of thought and not a single inferior or worthless volume among them i have before me a list of books books fashioned by the intellect of godlike men books which every person who aspires to the rank of teacher or scholar should regard as his inheritance from the masterminds of the ages if you know these books or some of them you know much of that which is best in the great world of letters you cannot afford to live in ignorance of them platos dialogues

and credence and in my herte have hem in reverence so hertely that there is game none that from my bookes maketh me to gone but it be seldome on the holy daie save certainly whan that the month of may is comen and that i heare the foules sing and that the floures ginnan for to spring farwell my booke and my devotion geoffrey chaucer having chosen the books which are to be our friends and counsellors the next question to be considered is how shall we use them shall we read them through as hastily as possible believing that the more we read the more learned we are or shall we not derive more profit by reading slowly and by making the subjectmatter of each book thoroughly our own i do not believe that any general rule can be given with reference to this matter some readers will take in a page at a glance and will more thoroughly master a book in a week than others could possibly master it in six months it required frederick w robertson half a year to read a small manual of chemistry and thoroughly to digest its contents miss martineau and auguste comte were remarkably slow readers but then that which they read lay fructifying and came out a living tree with leaves and fruit yet it does not follow that the same rule should apply to readers of every grade of genius it is generally better to read by subjects to learn what different writers have thought and said concerning that matter of which you are making a special study not many books are to be read hastily through a person who was a very great reader and hard thinker says bishop thirlwall once told me that he never took up a book except with the view of making himself master of some subject which he was studying and that while he was so engaged he made all his reading converge to that point in this way he might read parts of many books but not a single one from end to end this i take to be an excellent method of study but one which implies the command of many books as well as of much leisure seneca the old roman teacher says definite reading is profitable miscellaneous reading is pleasant the reading of many authors and of all kinds of works has in it something vague and unstable says quintilian every good writer is to be read and diligently and when the volume is finished it is to be gone through again from the beginning martin luther in his table talk says all who would study with advantage in any art whatsoever ought to betake themselves to the reading of some sure and certain books oftentimes over for to read many books produceth confusion rather than learning like as those who dwell everywhere are not anywhere at home reading says locke the philosopher furnishes the mind only with materials of knowledge it is thinking that makes what are read over we are of the ruminating kind and it is not enough to cram ourselves with a great load of collections unless we chew them over again they will not give us strength and nourishment much reading says dr robert south is like much eating wholly useless without digestion desultory reading writes julius c hare is indeed very mischievous by fostering habits of loose discontinuous thought by turning the memory into a common sewer for rubbish of all thoughts to flow through and by relaxing the power of attention which of all our faculties most needs care and is most improved by it but a wellregulated course of study will no more weaken the mind than hard exercise will weaken the body nor will a strong understanding be weighed down by its knowledge any more than oak is by its leaves or than samson was by his locks he whose sinews are drained by his hair must already be a weakling says thomas carlyle learn to be good readers which is perhaps a more difficult thing than you imagine learn to be discriminative in your reading to read faithfully and with your best attention all kinds of things which you have a real interest in a real not an imaginary and which you find to be really fit for what you are engaged in the most unhappy of all men is the man who cannot tell what he is going to do who has got no work cut out for him in the world and does not go into it for work is the grand cure of all the maladies and miseries that ever beset mankind honest work which you intend getting done says ralph waldo emerson the best rule of reading will be a method from nature and not a mechanical one of hours and pages it holds each student to a pursuit of his native aim instead of a desultory miscellany let him read what is proper to him and not waste his memory on a crowd of mediocrities the three practical rules which i have to offer are never read any book that is not a year old never read any but famed books never read any but what you like or in shakspeares phrase no profit goes where is no pleasure taen in brief sir study what you most affect let us read good works often over says another writer some skip from volume to volume touching on all points resting on none we hold on the contrary that if a book be worth reading once it is worth reading twice and that if it stands a second reading it may stand a third this indeed is one great test of the excellence of books many books require to be read more than once in order to be seen in their proper colors and latent glories and dimdiscovered truths will byandby disclose themselves again let us read thoughtfully this is a great secret in the right use of books not lazily to mumble like the dogs in the siege of corinth as dead bones the words of the author not slavishly to assent to his every word and cry amen to his every conclusion not to read him as an officer his generals orders but to read him with suspicion with inquiry with a free exercise of your own faculties with the admiration of intelligence and not with the wonder of ignorance that is the proper and profitable way of reading the great authors of your native tongue says sir arthur helps there is another view of reading which though it is obvious enough is seldom taken i imagine or at least acted upon and that is that in the course of our reading we should lay up in our minds a store of goodly thoughts in wellwrought words which should be a living treasure of knowledge always with us and from which at various times and amidst all the shifting of circumstances we might be sure of drawing some comfort guidance and sympathy in any work that is worth carefully reading there is generally something that is worth remembering accurately a man whose mind is enriched with the best sayings of his own country is a more independent man walks the streets in a town or the lanes in the country with far more delight than he otherwise would have and is taught by wise observers of man and nature to examine for himself sancho panza with his proverbs is a great deal better than he would have been without them and i contend that a man has something in himself to meet troubles and difficulties small or great who has stored in his mind some of the best things which have been said about troubles and difficulties and john ruskin no book is worth anything which is not worth much nor is it serviceable until it has been read and reread and loved and loved again and marked so that you can refer to the passages you want in it as a soldier can seize the weapons he needs in an armory or a housewife bring the spice she needs from her store i am not at all afraid says matthew browne of urging overmuch the propriety of frequent very frequent reading of the same book the book remains the same but the reader changes and the value of reading lies in the collision of minds it may be taken for granted that no conceivable amount of reading could ever put me into the position with respect to his book i mean as to intelligence only in which the author strove to place me i may read him a hundred times and not catch the precise right point of view and may read him a hundred and one times and approach it the hundred and first the driest and hardest book that ever was contains an interest over and above what can be picked out of it and laid so to speak on the table it is interesting as my friend is interesting it is a problem which invites me to closer knowledge and that usually means better liking he must be a poor friend that we only care to see once or twice and then forget the great secret of reading consists in this says charles f richardson that it does not matter so much what we read or how we read it as what we think and how we think it reading is only the fuel and the mind once on fire any and all material will feed the flame provided only it have any combustible matter in it and we cannot tell from what quarter the next material will come the thought we need the facts we are in search of may make their appearance in the corner of the newspaper or in some forgotten volume long ago consigned to dust and oblivion the mind that is not awake and alive will find a library a barren wilderness now gather up the scraps and fragments of thought on whatever subject you may be studying for of course by a notebook i do not mean a mere receptacle for odds and ends a literary dustbin but acquire the habit of gathering everything whenever and wherever you find it that belongs in your line or lines of study and you will be surprised to see how such fragments will arrange themselves into an orderly whole by the very organizing power of your own thinking acting in a definite direction this is a true process of selfeducation but you see it is no mechanical process of mere aggregation it requires activity of thought but without that what is any reading but mere passive amusement and it requires method i have myself a sort of literary bookkeeping i post my literary accounts bringing together in proper groups the fruits of much casual reading edward gibbon the historian tells us that a taste for books was the pleasure and glory of his life let us read with method he says and propose to ourselves an end to what our studies may point the use of reading is to aid us in thinking among practical suggestions to those who would read for profit i have found nothing more pertinent than the following from the posthumous papers of bryan waller procter always read the preface to a book it places you on vantage ground and enables you to survey more completely the book itself you frequently also discover the character of the author from the preface you see his aims perhaps his prejudices you see the point of view from which he takes his pictures the rocks and impediments which he himself beholds and you steer accordingly understand every word you read if possible every allusion of the author if practicable while you are reading if not make search and inquiry as soon as may be afterward have a dictionary near you when you read and when you read a book of travels always read with a map of the country at hand without a map the information is vague and transitory after having read as much as your mind will easily retain sum up what you have read endeavor to place in view the portion or subject that has formed your mornings study and then reckon up as you would reckon up a sum the facts or items of knowledge that you have gained it generally happens that the amount of three or four hours reading may be reduced to and concentrated in half a dozen propositions these are your gains these are the facts or opinions that you have acquired you may investigate the truth of them hereafter although i think that ones general reading should extend over many subjects yet for serious study we should confine ourselves to some branch of literature or science otherwise the mind becomes confused and enfeebled and the thoughts dissipated on many things will settle profitably on none a man whose duration of life is limited and whose powers are limited also should not aim at all things but should content himself with a few by such means he may master one and become tolerably familiar perhaps with two or three arts or sciences he may indeed even make valuable contributions to them without this economy of labor he cannot produce any complete work nor can he exhaust any subject every scholar is familiar with lord bacons classification of books some to be tasted others to be swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention coleridges classification of the various kinds of readers is perhaps not quite so well known he said that some readers are like jellybags they let pass away all that is pure and good and retain only what is impure and refuse another class he typified by a sponge these are they whose minds suck all up and give it back again only a little dirtier others again he likened to an hourglass and their reading to the sand which runs in and out and leaves no trace behind and still others he compared to the slave in the golconda mines who retains the gold and the gem and casts aside the dust and the dross charles c colton the author of lacon says there are three kinds of readers first those who read to think and they are rare second those who read to write and they are common third those who read to talk and they form the great majority and goethe the greatest name in german literature makes still a different classification some readers he tells us enjoy without judgment others judge without enjoyment and some there are who judge while they enjoy and enjoy while they judge in these days when so far as readingmatter is concerned we are overburdened with an embarrassment of riches we cannot afford to read even in the books which we have chosen as ours those things which have no relationship to our studies which do not concern us and which are sure to be forgotten as soon as read the art of reading says philip gilbert hamerton in his admirable essay on the intellectual life is to skip judiciously the art is to skip all that does not concern us whilst missing nothing that we really need no external guidance can teach this for nobody but ourselves can guess what the needs of our intellect may be but let us select with decisive firmness independently of other peoples advice independently of the authority of custom and charles f richardson referring to the same subject remarks the art of skipping is in a word the art of noting and shunning that which is bad or frivolous or misleading or unsuitable for ones individual needs if you are convinced that the book or the chapter is bad you cannot drop it too quickly if it is simply idle and foolish put it away on that account unless you are properly seeking amusement from idleness and frivolity if it is something deceitful and disingenuous your task is not so easy but your conscience will give you warning and the sharp examination which should follow will tell you that you are in poor literary company illustration illustration chapter iii on the value and use of libraries all round the room my silent servants wait my friends in every season bright and dim angels and seraphim come down and murmur to me sweet and low and spirits of the skies all come and go early and late from the old worlds divine and distant date from the sublimer few down to the poet who but yestereve sang sweet and made us grieve all come assembling here in order due and here i dwell with poesy my mate with erato and all her vernal sighs great clio with her victories elate or pale uranias deep and starry eyes bryan waller procter a library is the scholars workshop to the teacher or professional man a collection of good books is as necessary as a kit of tools to a carpenter and yet i am aware that many persons are engaged in teaching who have neither a library of their own nor access to any other collection of books suitable to their use there are others who having every opportunity to secure the best of books with a public library near at hand offering them the free use of works most valuable to them yet make no effort to profit by these advantages they care nothing for any books save the textbooks indispensable to their profession and for these only so far as necessity obliges them to do so the libraries of many persons calling themselves teachers consist solely of schoolbooks many of which have been presented them by accommodating bookagents for examination with a view to introduction and yet we hear such teachers talk learnedly about the introduction of english literature into the common schools of the country and the necessity of cultivating among the children a wholesome love and taste for reading if inquiry were made we might discover that by a study of english literature these teachers understand some memoriter exercises in shaws manual or brookes primer and that as to good reading some there are who are entertained more deeply by pecks bad boy than by shakspeares merchant of venice talk not about directing and cultivating the readingtastes of your pupils until you have successfully directed and cultivated your own and the first step towards doing this is the selection and purchase of a library for yourself which shall be all your own a very few books will do if they are of the right kind and they must be yours a borrowed book is but a cheap pleasure an unappreciated and unsatisfactory tool to know the true value of books and to derive any satisfactory benefit from them you must first feel the sweet delight of buying them you must know the preciousness of possession you plead poverty the insufficiency of your salary but do you not spend for other things entirely unnecessary much more every year than the cost of a few books the immediate outlay need not be large the returns which you will realize will be great in proportion to your good judgment and earnestness not only will the possession of a good library add to your means of enjoyment and increase your capacity for doing good it may if you are worldlyminded and we all are put you in the way of occupying a more desirable position and earning a more satisfactory reward for your labors there are two kinds of books that you will need in your library first those which are purely professional and are in the strictest sense the tools of your craft second those which belong to your chosen department of literature and are to be regarded as your friends companions and counsellors i cannot of course dictate to you what these books shall be the lists given in the chapters which follow this are designed simply as suggestive aids but in a library of fifty or even thirty wellchosen volumes you may possess infinite riches and means for a lifetime of enjoyment while on the other hand if your selection is injudicious you may expend thousands of dollars for a collection of the odds and ends of literature which will be only an incumbrance and a hindrance to you i would urge upon every young man as the beginning of his due and wise provision for his household says john ruskin to obtain as soon as he can by the severest economy a restricted serviceable and steadily however slowly increasing series of books for use through life making his little library of all the furniture in his room the most studied and decorative piece every volume having its assigned place like a little statue in its niche and one of the earliest and strictest lessons to the children of the house being how to turn the pages of their own literary possessions lightly and deliberately with no chance of tearing or dogsears and henry ward beecher emphasizes the same thing remarking that among the early ambitions to be excited in clerks workmen journeymen and indeed among all that are struggling up in life from nothing to something the most important is that of forming and continually adding to a library of good books a little library growing larger every year is an honorable part of a mans history it is a mans duty to have books a library is not a luxury but one of the necessaries of life how much do you think we spend altogether on our libraries public or private as compared with what we spend on our horses asks another enthusiastic lover of books already quoted if a man spends lavishly on his library you call him mad a bibliomaniac but you never call any one a horsemaniac though men ruin themselves every day by their horses and you do not hear of people ruining themselves by their books we talk of food for the mind as of food for the body now a good book contains such food inexhaustibly it is a provision for life and for the best of us yet how long most people would look at the best book before they would give the price of a large turbot for it though there have been men who have pinched their stomachs and bared their backs to buy a book whose libraries were cheaper to them i think in the end than most mens dinners are we are few of us put to such trial and more the pity for indeed a precious thing is all the more precious to us if it has been won by work or economy and if public libraries were half as costly as public dinners or books cost the tenth part of what bracelets do even foolish men and women might sometimes suspect there was good in reading as well as in munching and sparkling whereas the very cheapness of literature is making even wise people forget that if a book is worth reading it is worth buying the truest owner of a library says the author of hesperides is he who has bought each book for the love he bears to it who is happy and content to say here are my jewels my choicest material possessions who is proud to crown such assertion thus i am content that this library shall represent the use of the talents given me by heaven that mans library though not commensurate with his love for books will demonstrate what he has been able to accomplish with his resources it will denote economy of living eagerness to possess the particles that compose his library and quick watchfulness to seize them when means and opportunities serve such a man has built a temple of which each brick has been the subject of curious and acute intelligent examination and appreciation before it has been placed in the sacred building every man should have a library exclaims william axon the works of the grandest masters of literature may now be procured at prices that place them within the reach almost of the very poorest and we may all put parnassian singingbirds into our chambers to cheer us with the sweetness of their songs and when we have got our little library we may look proudly at shakspeare and bacon and bunyan as they stand in our bookcase with other noble spirits and one or two of whom the world knows nothing but whose worth we have often tested these may cheer and enlighten us may inspire us with higher aims and aspirations may make us if we use them rightly wiser and better men good old george dyer the friend of the poet southey as learned as he was benevolent was wont to say libraries are the wardrobes of literature whence men properly informed may bring forth something for ornament much for curiosity and more for use any library is an attraction says the venerable a bronson alcott and victor hugo writes a library implies an act of faith which generations still in darkness hid sign in their night in witness of the dawn john bright the great english statesman and reformer in a speech at the opening of the birmingham free library a short time ago remarked you may have in a house costly pictures and costly ornaments and a great variety of decoration yet so far as my judgment goes i would prefer to have one comfortable room well stocked with books to all you can give me in the way of decoration which the highest art can supply the only subject of lamentation is one feels that always i think in the presence of a library that life is too short and i am afraid i must say also that our industry is so far deficient that we seem to have no hope of a full enjoyment of the ample repast that is spread before us in the houses of the humble a little library in my opinion is a most precious possession jean paul richter it is said was always melancholy in a large library because it reminded him of his ignorance a library may be regarded as the solemn chamber in which a man can take counsel of all that have been wise and great and good and glorious amongst the men that have gone before him said george dawson also at birmingham if we come down for a moment and look at the bare and immediate utilities of a library we find that here a man gets himself ready for his calling arms himself for his profession finds out the facts that are to determine his trade prepares himself for his examination the utilities of it are endless and priceless it is too a place of pastime for man has no amusement more innocent more sweet more gracious more elevating and more fortifying than he can find in a library if he be fond of books his fondness will discipline him as well as amuse him a library is the strengthener of all that is great in life and the repeller of what is petty and mean and half the gossip of society would perish if the books that are truly worth reading were read when we look through the houses of a large part of the middle classes of this country we find there everything but what there ought most to be there are no books in them worth talking of if a question arises of geography they have no atlases if the question be when a great man was born they cannot help you they can give you a gorgeous bed with four posts marvellous adornments luxurious hangings and lacquered shams all round they can give you dinners ad nauseam and wine that one can or cannot honestly praise but useful books are almost the last things that are to be found there and when the mind is empty of those things that books can alone fill it with then the seven devils of pettiness frivolity fashionableness gentility scandal small slander and the chronicling of small beer come in and take possession half this nonsense would be dropped if men would only understand the elevating influences of their communing constantly with the lofty thoughts and high resolves of men of old times the author of dreamthorpe filled with love and enthusiasm discourses thus i go into my library and all history unrolls before me i breathe the morning air of the world while the scent of edens roses yet lingers in it while it vibrates only to the worlds first brood of nightingales and to the laugh of eve i see the pyramids building i hear the shoutings of the armies of alexander i feel the ground shake beneath the march of cambyses i sit as in a theatre the stage is time the play is the play of the world what a spectacle it is what kingly pomp what processions file past what cities burn to heaven what crowds of captives are dragged at the chariot wheels of conquerors i hiss or cry bravo when the great actors come on shaking the stage i am a roman emperor when i look at a roman coin i lift homer and i shout with achilles in the trenches the silence of the unpeopled assyrian plains the outcomings and ingoings of the patriarchs abraham and ishmael isaac in the fields at eventide rebekah at the well jacobs guile esaus face reddened by desert sunheat josephs splendid funeral procession all these things i find within the boards of my old testament what a silence in those old books as of a halfpeopled world what bleating of flocks what green pastoral rest what indubitable human existence across brawling centuries of blood and war i hear the bleating of abrahams flocks the tinkling of the bells of rebekahs camels o men and women so far separated yet so near so strange yet so wellknown by what miraculous power do i know you all books are the true elysian fields where the spirits of the dead converse and into these fields a mortal may venture unappalled what kings court can boast such company what school of philosophy such wisdom the wit of the ancient world is glancing and flashing there there is pans pipe there are the songs of apollo seated in my library at night and looking on the silent faces of my books i am occasionally visited by a strange sense of the supernatural they are not collections of printed pages they are ghosts i take one down and it speaks with me in a tongue not now heard on earth and of men and things of which it alone possesses knowledge i call myself a solitary but sometimes i think i misapply the term no man sees more company than i do i travel with mightier cohorts around me than did ever timour or genghis khan on their fiery marches i am a sovereign in my library but it is the dead not the living that attend my levees illustration illustration chapter iv books for every scholar these books of mine as you well know are not drawn up here for display however much the pride of the eye may be gratified in beholding them they are on actual service southey to assist teachers and scholars and those who aspire to become such in making judicious selection of worldfamous books for their libraries i submit the following list which includes the greater part of all that is the very best and the most enduring in our language it is not intended to embrace professional works nor works suited merely for students of specialties the books named are such as will grace the library of any scholar no matter what his profession or his preferences they are books which every teacher ought to know they are books of which no one can ever feel ashamed the first thing naturally when one enters a scholars study or library says holmes is to look at his books one gets a notion very speedily of his tastes and the range of his pursuits by a glance round his bookshelves and take my word for it if you want a library of which you will be proud you cannot be too careful as to the character of the books you put in it poetry chaucers poetical works or if not the complete works at least the canterbury tales in speaking of the great works in english poetry it is natural to mention chaucer first although as a general rule he should be one of the last read it is sufficient to say according to the proverb that here is gods plenty dryden spensers faerie queene not to be read through but in selections we can scarcely comprehend how a perusal of the faerie queene can fail to insure to the true believer a succession of halcyon days hazlitt the works of william shakspeare the

doctor faustus and the jew of malta he had in him all those brave translunary things which the first poets did have drayton beaumont and fletcher and especially the faithful shepherdess a play very characteristic of fletcher being a mixture of tenderness purity indecency and absurdity hallam john websters tragedies to move a horror skilfully to touch a soul to the quick to lay upon fear as much

george herbert there is poetry and enough to spare it is the household bread of his existence george macdonald miltons poetical works the paradise lost was mentioned in the former list but you cannot well do without his shorter poems also milton almost requires a solemn service of music to be played before you enter upon him charles lamb popes poetical works come we now to pope that prince of sayers of acute and exquisite things robert chambers drydens poems dryden is even better than pope he has immense masculine energies ibid goldsmiths select poems no one like goldsmith knew how to be

coleridges select poems the ancient mariner christabel and genevieve these might be bound up in a volume of twenty pages but they should be bound in pure gold stopford brooke the poems of john keats no one else in english poetry save shakspeare has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of keats his perfection of loveliness matthew arnold the christian year by john keble i am not a churchman i dont believe in planting oaks in flowerpots but such a poem as the rosebud makes one a proselyte to the culture it grows from dr holmes tennysons poems tennyson is a born poet that is a builder of airy palaces and imaginary castles he has chosen amongst all forms the most elegant ornate exquisite m taine longfellows poetical works in the pure amiable homelike qualities that reach the heart and captivate the ear no one places longfellow second the critic bryants poetical works the great characteristics of bryants poetry are its strong commonsense its absolute sanity and its inexhaustible imagination r h stoddard the poems of john g whittier the lyric poet of america his poems are in the broadest sense national anon in addition to the works named above there are several

germany and spain says lord macaulay has been translated into our own tongue i would not dissuade any person from studying either the ancient languages or the languages of modern europe but i would console those who have not time to make themselves linguists by assuring them that by means of their own mother tongue they may obtain ready access to vast intellectual treasures to treasures such as might have been envied by the greatest linguists of the age of charles the fifth to treasures surpassing those which were possessed by aldus by erasmus and by melanchthon i name some of the treasures which you may thus acquire homers iliad of this work without which no scholars library is complete many translations have been made the most notable are george chapmans popes tickells cowpers lord derbys bryants americans will of course prefer bryants translation but derbys is more poetical and the greatest scholars award the palm of merit to chapman says lowell chapman has made for us the best poem that has yet been englished out of homer aeschylus prometheus bound has been rendered into english verse by elizabeth barrett browning agamemnon has been translated by dean milman and the entire seven tragedies by dean potter the prometheus is a poem of the like dignity and scope as the book of job or the norse edda emerson aristophanes the translation by john hookham frere is admirable we might apply to the pieces of aristophanes the motto of a pleasant and acute adventurer in goethe mad but clever a w schlegel virgils aeneid the best known translations of virgil are drydens christopher pitts john coningtons william morriss your choice among these will lie between the last two virgil is far below homer yet virgil has genius enough to be two men lord lytton horaces odes epodes and satires there are excellent translations by conington lord lytton and t martin there is horace charming man of the world who will condole with you feelingly on the loss of your fortune but

translated by bayard taylor what constitutes goethes glory is that in the nineteenth century he did produce an epic poem i mean a poem in which genuine gods act and speak h a taine of the best poetry written in the modern foreign tongues you will have no difficulty in finding excellent translations there are good english editions of dante petrarch ariosto and tasso of calderon and camoens of moliere corneille racine and victor hugo and of goethe and schiller and to make your collection complete for all the purposes of a scholar you will want longfellows poets and poetry of europe

brownings lowell longfellow and coventry patmore whose angel in the house is a most finished piece of writing and the sweetest analysis we possess of quiet modern domestic feeling cast coleridge at once aside as sickly and useless and shelley as shallow and verbose byron until your taste is fully formed and you are able to discern the magnificence in him from the wrong never read bad or common poetry nor write any poetry yourself there is perhaps rather too much than too little in the world already says frederic harrison i am for the school of all the great men and i am against the school of the smaller men i care for wordsworth as well as for byron for burns as well as for shelley for boccaccio as well as for milton for bunyan as well as rabelais for cervantes as much as for dante for corneille as well as for shakspeare for goldsmith as well as goethe i stand by the sentence of the world and i hold that in a matter so human and so broad as the highest poetry the judgment of the nations of europe is pretty well settled the busy world may fairly reserve the lesser lights for the time when it knows the greatest well nor shall we forget those wonderful idealizations of awakening thought and primitive societies the pictures of other races and types of life removed from our own all those primeval legends ballads songs and tales those proverbs apologues and maxims which have come down to us from distant ages of mans history the old idyls and myths of the hebrew race the tales of greece of the middle ages of the east the fables of the old and the new world the songs of the

descriptive of his own library sitting last winter among my books and walled round with all the comfort and protection which they and my fireside could afford me to wit a table of highpiled books at my back my writingdesk on one side of me some shelves on the other and the feeling of the warm fire at my feet i began to consider how i loved the authors of those books how i loved them too not only for the imaginative pleasures they afforded me but for their making me love the very books themselves and delight to be in contact with them i looked sideways at my spenser my theocritus and my arabian nights then above them at my italian poets then behind me at my dryden and pope my romances and my boccaccio then on my left side at my chaucer who lay on my writingdesk and thought how natural it was in charles lamb to give a kiss to an old folio as i once saw him do to chapmans homer i entrench myself in my books equally against sorrow and the weather if the wind comes through a passage i look about to see how i can fence it off by a better disposition of my movables if a melancholy thought is importunate i give another glance at my spenser when i speak of being in contact with my books i mean it literally i like to be able to lean my head against them the very perusal of the backs is a discipline of humanity there mr southey takes his place again with an old radical friend there jeremy collier is at peace with dryden there the lion martin luther lies down with the quaker lamb sewell there guzman dalfarache thinks himself fit company for sir charles grandison and has his claims admitted nothing while i live and think can deprive me of my value for such treasures i can help the appreciation of them while i last and love them till i die and perhaps i may chance some quiet day to lay my overbeating temples on a book and so have the death i most envy illustration chapter v what books shall young folks read the greatest problem presented to the consideration of parents and teachers nowadays is how properly to regulate and direct the reading of the children there is no scarcity of readingmatter the poorest child may have free access to books and papers more than he can read the publication of periodicals and cheap books especially designed to meet the tastes of young people has developed into an enterprise of vast proportions every day millions of pages of reading matter designed for children are printed and scattered broadcast over the land but unlimited opportunities often prove to be a damage and a detriment and overabundance rather than scarcity is to be deplored as a general rule the books read by young people are not such as lead to studious habits or induce correct ideas of right living they are intended simply to amuse there are no elements of strength in them leading up to a noble manhood i doubt if in the future it can be said of any great statesman or scholar that his tastes had been formed and his energies directed and sustained through the influence of his early reading but rather that he had attained success and whatever of true nobility there is in him in spite of such influence this was not always so the experience of a few wellknown scholars will illustrate from my infancy says benjamin franklin i was passionately fond of reading and all the money that came into my hands was laid out in the purchasing of books i was very fond of voyages my first acquisition was bunyans works in separate little volumes i afterwards sold them to enable me to buy r burtons historical collections they were small chapmens books and cheap forty volumes in all my fathers little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity most of which i read i have often regretted that at a time when i had such a thirst for knowledge more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was resolved i should not be bred to divinity there was among them plutarchs lives which i read abundantly and i still think the time spent to great advantage there was also a book of defoes called an essay on projects and another of dr mathers called an essay to do good which perhaps gave me a turn of thinking that had an influence on some of the principal future events of my life this bookish inclination at length determined my father to make me a printer i stood out some time but at last was persuaded and signed the indenture when i was yet but twelve years old i now had access to better books an acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one which i was careful to return soon and clean often i sat up in my chamber the greatest part of the night when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned in the morning lest it should be found missing about this time i met with an odd volume of the spectator i had never before seen any of them i bought it read it over and over and was much delighted with it i thought the writing excellent and wished if possible to imitate it with that view i took some of the papers and making short hints of the sentiments in each sentence laid them by a few days and then without looking at the book tried to complete the papers again by expressing each hinted sentiment at length and as fully as it had been expressed before in any suitable words that should occur to me then i compared my spectator with the original discovered some of my faults and corrected them now it was that being on some occasions made ashamed of my ignorance in figures which i had twice failed learning when at school i took cockers book on arithmetic and went through the whole by myself with the greatest ease i also read sellers and sturnys book on navigation which made me acquainted with the little geometry it contains but i never proceeded far in that science i read about this time locke on the human understanding and the art of thinking by messrs de port royal while i was intent on improving my language i met with an english grammar i think it was greenwoods having at the end of it two little sketches on the arts of rhetoric and logic the latter finishing with a dispute in the socratic method and soon after i procured xenophons memorable things of socrates wherein there are many examples of the same method i was charmed with it adopted it dropped my abrupt contradiction and positive argumentation and put on the humble inquirer hugh miller that most admirable scotchman and selfmade man relates a similar experience during my sixth year i spelled my way through the shorter catechism the proverbs and the new testament and then entered upon the highest form in the dames school as a member of the bible class but all the while the process of learning had been a dark one which i slowly mastered in humble confidence in the awful wisdom of the schoolmistress not knowing whither it tended when at once my mind awoke to the meaning of the most delightful of all narratives the story of joseph was there ever such a discovery made before i actually found out for myself that the art of reading is the art of finding stories in books and from that moment reading became one of the most delightful of my amusements i began by getting into a corner on the dismissal of the school and there conning over to myself the newfound story of joseph nor did one perusal serve the other scripture stories followed in especial the story of samson and the philistines of david and goliath of the prophets elijah and elisha and after these came the new testament stories and parables assisted by my uncles too i began to collect a library in a box of birch bark about nine inches square which i found quite large enough to contain a great many immortal works jack the giantkiller and jack and the beanstalk and the yellow dwarf and blue beard and sinbad the sailor and beauty and the beast and aladdin and the wonderful lamp with several others of resembling character those intolerable nuisances the usefulknowledge books had not yet arisen like tenebrious stars on the educational horizon to darken the world and shed their blighting influence on the opening intellect of the youthhood and so from my rudimental books books that made themselves truly such by their thorough assimilation with the rudimental mind i passed on without being conscious of break or line of division to books on which the learned are content to write commentaries and dissertations but which i found to be quite as nice childrens books as any of the others old homer wrote admirably for little folk especially in the odyssey a copy of which in the only true translation extant for judging from its surpassing interest and the wrath of critics such i hold that of pope to be i found in the house of a neighbor next came the iliad not however in a complete copy but represented by four of the six volumes of bernard lintot with what power and at how early an age true genius impresses i saw even at this immature period that no other writer could cast a javelin with half the force of homer the missiles went whizzing athwart his pages and i could see the momentary gleam of the steel ere it buried itself deep in brass and bullhide i next succeeded in discovering for myself a childs book of not less interest than even the iliad which might i was told be read on sabbaths in a magnificent old edition of the pilgrims progress printed on coarse whitybrown paper and charged with numerous woodcuts each of which occupied an entire page which on principles of economy bore letterpress on the other side in process of time i devoured besides these genial works robinson crusoe gullivers travels ambrose on angels the judgment chapter in howies scotch worthies byrons narrative and the adventures of philip quarll with a good many other adventures and voyages real and fictitious part of a very miscellaneous collection of books made by my father it was a melancholy library to which i had fallen heir most of the missing volumes had been with the master aboard his vessel when he perished of an early edition of cooks voyages all the volumes were now absent save the first and a very tantalizing romance in four volumes mrs radcliffes mysteries of udolpho was represented by only the earlier two small as the collection was it contained some rare books among the rest a curious little volume entitled the miracles of nature and art to which we find dr johnson referring in one of the dialogues chronicled by boswell as scarce even in his day and which had been published he said some time in the seventeenth century by a bookseller whose shop hung perched on old london bridge between sky and water it contained too the only copy i ever saw of the memoirs of a protestant condemned to the galleys of france for his religion a work interesting from the circumstance that though it bore another name on its titlepage it had been translated from the french for a few guineas by poor goldsmith in his days of obscure literary drudgery and exhibited the peculiar excellences of his style the collection boasted besides of a curious old book illustrated by very uncouth plates that detailed the perils and sufferings of an english sailor who had spent the best years of his life as a slave in morocco it had its volumes of sound theology too and of stiff controversy flavels works and henrys commentary and hutchinson on the lesser prophets and a very old treatise on the revelations with the titlepage away and blind jamesons volume on the hierarchy with first editions of naphtali the cloud of witnesses and the hind let loose of the works of fact and incident which it contained those of the voyages were my special favorites i perused with avidity the voyages of anson drake raleigh dampier and captain woods rogers and my mind became so filled with conceptions of what was to be seen and done in foreign parts that i wished myself big enough to be a sailor that i might go and see coral islands and burning mountains and hunt wild beasts and fight battles william and robert chambers the founders of the great publishinghouse of w r chambers edinburgh were selfeducated men at little above fourteen years of age writes william i was thrown on my own resources from necessity not less than from choice i resolved at all hazards to make the weekly four shillings serve for everything i cannot remember entertaining the slightest despondency on the subject i made such attempts as were at all practicable while an apprentice to remedy the defects of my education at school nothing in that way could be done in the shop for there reading was proscribed but allowed to take home a book for study i gladly availed myself of the privilege the mornings in summer when light cost nothing were my chief reliance fatigued with trudging about i was not naturally inclined to rise but on this and some other points i overruled the will and forced myself to rise at five oclock and have a spell at reading until it was time to think of moving off my brother when he was with me doing the same in this way i made some progress in french with the pronunciation of which i was already familiar from the speech of the french prisoners of war at peebles i likewise dipped into several books of solid worth such as smiths wealth of nations lockes human understanding paleys moral philosophy and blairs belleslettres fixing the leading facts and theories in my memory by a notebook for the purpose in another book i kept for years an accurate account of my expenses not allowing a single halfpenny to escape record and robert the younger brother confirms the story with even more accurate attention to details my brother william and i he says lived in lodgings together our room and bed cost three shillings a week i used to be in great distress for want of fire i could not afford either that or a candle myself so i have often sat by my landladys kitchen fire if fire it could be called which was only a little heap of embers reading horace and conning my dictionary by a light which required me to hold the books almost close to the grate what a miserable winter that was yet i cannot help feeling proud of my trials at that time my brother and i he then between fifteen and sixteen i between thirteen and fourteen had made a resolution together that we would exercise the last degree of selfdenial my brother actually saved money out of his income i remember seeing him take fiveandtwenty shillings out of a closed box which he kept to receive his savings and that was the spare money of only a twelvemonth rev robert collyer whose name is known and honored by every american scholar says do you want to know how i manage to talk to you in this simple saxon i will tell you i read bunyan crusoe and goldsmith when i was a boy morning noon and night all the rest was task work these were my delight with the stories in the bible and with shakspeare when at last the mighty master came within our doors i took to these as i took to milk and without the least idea what i was doing got the taste for simple words into the very fibre of my nature there was dayschool for me until i was thirteen years old and then i had to turn in and work thirteen hours a day i could not go home for the christmas of and was feeling very sad about it all for i was only a boy and sitting by the fire an old farmer came in and said i notice thous fond o reading so i brought thee summat to read it was irvings sketch book i had never heard of the work i went at it and was as them that dream no such delight had touched me since the old days of crusoe i saw the hudson and the catskills took poor rip at once into my heart as everybody has pitied ichabod while i laughed at him thought the old dutch feast a most admirable thing and long before i was through all regret at my lost christmas had gone down the wind and i had found out there are books and books that vast hunger to read never left me if there was no candle i poked my head down to the fire read while i was eating blowing the bellows or walking from one place to another i could read and walk four miles an hour i remember while i was yet a lad reading macaulays great essay on bacon and i could grasp its wonderful beauty now give a boy a passion like this for anything books or business painting or farming mechanism or music and you give him thereby a lever to lift his world and a patent of nobility if the thing he does is noble it may be questioned whether in these days of opportunities it would be possible to find boys of thirteen and sixteen who would be able to read understandingly much less appreciate and enjoy those masterpieces of english literature so eagerly studied by franklin and hugh miller and the chambers brothers their mental appetites have been treated to a different kind of diet if their minds have not been dwarfed and stunted by indulgence in what has been aptly termed penpoison their tastes have been perverted and the growth of their reasoning powers checked by being fed upon the milkandwater stuff recommended as harmless literature they are inveterate devourers of stories and novels and the worthless material which is recommended as good reading but which in reality is nothing but a discipline of debasement better that children should not read at all than read much of that which passes current nowadays for entertaining reading all children like to read stories the love of the story in some form or other is indeed a characteristic of the human mind and exists everywhere in all conditions of life but stories are the sweets of our mental existence and only a few of the best and greatest have in them the elements which will lead to a strong and vigorous mindgrowth constant feeding upon light literature however good that literature may be in itself will debilitate and corrupt the mental appetite of the child much the same as an unrestrained indulgence in jam and preserves will undermine and destroy his physical health in either case if no result more serious occurs the worst forms of dyspepsia will follow literary dyspepsia is the most common form of mental disease among us and there is no knowing what may be the extent of its influence upon american civilization fifty per cent of the readers who patronize our great public libraries have weak literary stomachs they cannot digest anything stronger than that insipid solution the last society novel or anything purer than the muddy decoctions poured out by the periodical press when of all the reading done in a public library eighty per cent is of books in the different departments of fiction i doubt whether after all that library is a public benefit yet this is but the natural result of the loose habits of reading which we encourage among our children and cultivate in ourselves the habit of reading anything that comes to hand provided only that it is entertaining how then shall we so order the childs reading as to avoid the formation of desultory and aimless habits naturally the earliest reading is the story simple short straightforward recitals of matters of daily occurrence of the doings of children and their parents their friends or their pets the nursery a little magazine published in boston contains an excellent variety of such stories now and then we may pick up a good book too for this class of readers but there are many worthless books here as elsewhere and careful parents will look well into that which they buy the illuminated covers are often the only recommendation of books of this kind numbers of them are made only for the holiday trade the illustrations of many are from secondhand cuts and the text is frequently written to fit the illustrations a pure fresh book for a little child is a treasure to be sought for and appreciated very early in childlife comes the period of a belief in fairies and the reading of fairystories is to children a very proper nay a very necessary thing i pity the boy or girl who must grow up without having made intimate acquaintance with mother goose and the wonderful stories of jack the giantkiller and blue beard and cinderella and those other strange tales as old as the race itself and yet new to every succeeding generation they are a part of the inheritance of the englishspeaking people and belong as a kind of birthright to every intelligent child as your little reader advances in knowledge and readingability he should be treated to stronger food grimms household stories and the delightful wonder stories of hans christian andersen should form a part of the library of every child as he passes through the fairystory period of his life nor can we well omit to give him charles kingsleys water babies and alices adventures in wonderland and now or later as circumstances shall dictate we may introduce him to that prince of all wonderbooks the arabian nights entertainment in an edition carefully adapted to childrens reading the tales related in this book are not ours by birth but they have nevertheless taken their place amongst the similar things of our own which constitute the national literary inheritance altogether it is a glorious book and one to which we cannot well show enough of respect and while your reader lingers in the great world of poetic fancy and childwonder let him revel for a while in those enchanting idyls and myths which delighted mankind when the race was young and this earth was indeed a wonderworld these he may find apparelled in a dress adapted to our modern notions of propriety in hawthornes wonder book and tanglewood tales in kingsleys greek heroes and in a more prosaic form in coxs tales of ancient greece and in the story of siegfried and later in morriss sigurd the volsung he may read the no less charming myths of our own northern ancestors and the worldfamous legend of the nibelungen heroes then by a natural transition you advance into the borderland which lies between the world of pure fancy and the domains of soberhued reality you introduce your reader to some wholesome adaptations of those mediaeval romances which with their one grain of fact to a thousand of fable gave such noble delight to lords and ladies in the days of chivalry these you will find in sidney laniers boys king arthur and boys mabinogion in the story of roland by the author of the present volume and in bulfinchs legends of charlemagne and the age of chivalry do you understand now to what point you have led your young reader you have simply followed the order of nature and of human development and you have gradually almost imperceptibly even to yourself brought him out of the world of childwonder and fairyland through the middle ground of chivalric romance to the very borders of the domains of history he is ready and eager to enter into the realms of soberhued truth but i would not advise undue haste in this matter the mediaeval romances have inspired him with a desire to know more of those days when knightserrant rode over sea and land to do battle in the name of god and for the honor of their king the church and the ladies he wants to know something more nearly the truth than that which the minstrels and storytellers of the middle ages can tell him and yet he is not prepared for a sudden transition from romance to history let him read ivanhoe then give him howard pyles story of robin hood and laniers boys percy and if you care to allow him so much more fiction let him read madame colombs franchise as translated and adapted by davenport adams in his page squire and knight can you withhold history longer from your reader i think not he will demand some authentic knowledge of richard the lionhearted and of king john and of the saxons and normans and of the crusades and of the saracens and of charlemagne and his peers lose not your opportunity but pass over with your pupil into the promised land the transition is easy imperceptible in fact and leaving fiction and the story behind you you enter the fields of truth and history as for books it is difficult now to advise but there are abbotts little histories give him the history of richard i to begin with then get the whole set for him yonges young folks history of england or dickenss childs history will also be in demand the way is easy now the road is open you need no further guidance only keep straight ahead there are other books of course which the young reader will find in his way and which it is altogether proper and necessary that he should read for instance there is robinson crusoe without a knowledge of which the boy loses one of his dearest enjoyments how youth passed long ago when there was no crusoe to waft it away in fancy to the pacific and fix it upon the lonely doings of the shipwrecked mariner is inconceivable but we can readily suppose that it must have been different says robert chambers and no substitute for the original robinson will answer not one of the ten thousand tales of adventure recently published for boys will fill the niche which this book fills or atone in the least for any neglect of its merits the swiss family robinson approaches nearest in excellence to defoes immortal creation and may very profitably form a part of every boys or girls library then among the really unexceptionable books of the healthful hopeful truthful sort i may name tom browns school days at rugby lambs tales from shakspeare mitchells about old storytellers the inimitable bodley books bayard taylors boys of other countries abbotts franconia stories and a few others in the line of history or travels to be mentioned in future chapters these i believe to be in every sense proper wholesome books free from all kinds of mannerisms free from improper language free from sickly sentiment and gush and these if not the most instructive books are the sort of books which the child or youth should read as a kind of relish or supplement to the more methodical course of reading which i have elsewhere indicated in this careful direction of the childs reading and in the cultivation of his literary taste if you have succeeded in bringing him to the point which we have indicated you have done much towards forming his character for life there is little danger that bad books will ever possess any attractions for him he will henceforth be apt to go right of his own accord preferring the wholesome and the true to any of the flashy allurements of the literary slums and grogshops which so abound and flourish in these days but perhaps the fundamental error in determining what books children shall read lies in the very popular notion that to read much and to derive pleasure and profit from our reading many books are necessary and the greatest obstacle in the way of forming and directing a proper taste for good reading is to be found not in the scarcity but in the superabundance of reading matter the great flood of periodical literature for young people is the worst hindrance to the formation of right habits in reading some of these periodicals are simply unadulterated pen poison designed not only to enrich their projectors but to deprave the minds of those who read others are published doubtless from pure motives and with the best intentions but being managed by inexperienced or incapable editors they are at the best but thin dilutions of milkandwater literature leading to mental imbecility and starvation the periodicals fit to be placed in the hands of reading children may be numbered on half your fingers and even these should not be read without due discrimination too great a variety of books or papers placed at the disposal of inexperienced readers offers a premium to desultoriness and fosters and encourages the habit of devouring every species of literary food that comes to hand hence we should beware not only of the bad but of too great plenty of the good the benefit of a right good book says mr hudson all depends upon this that its virtue just soak into the mind and there become a living generative force to be running and rambling over a great many books tasting a little here a little there and tying up with none is good for nothing nay worse than nothing such a process of unceasing change is also a discipline of perpetual emptiness the right method in the culture of the mind is to take a few choice books and weave about them the fixed delights of house and home friendship that will not break and love that cannot roam illustration chapter vi hints on the formation of school libraries what sort of reading are our schools planting an appetite for are they really doing anything to instruct and form the mental taste so that the pupils on leaving them may be safely left to choose their reading for themselves it is clear in evidence that they are far from educating the young to take pleasure in what is intellectually noble and sweet the statistics of our public libraries show that some cause is working mightily to prepare them only for delight in what is both morally and intellectually mean and foul it would not indeed be fair to charge our public schools with positively giving this preparation but it is their business to forestall and prevent such a result if along with the faculty of reading they cannot also impart some safeguards of taste and habit against such a result will the system prove a success henry n hudson much is being said nowadays about the utility of school libraries and in some instances much illdirected if not entirely misdirected labor is being expended in their formation public libraries are not necessarily public benefits and school libraries unless carefully selected and judiciously managed will not prove to be unmixed blessings there are several questions which teachers and school officers should seriously consider before setting themselves to the task of establishing a library and no teacher who is not himself a knower of books and a reader should presume to regulate and direct the reading of others what are the objects of a school library they are twofold first to aid in cultivating a taste for good reading second to supply materials for supplementary study and independent research now neither of these objects can be attained unless your library is composed of books selected especially with reference to the capabilities and needs of your pupils dealing as you do with pupils of various degrees of intellectual strength warped by every variety of moral influence and home training the cultivation of a taste for good reading among them is no small matter to do this your library must contain none but truly good books it is a great mistake to suppose that every collection of books placed in a schoolhouse is a library and yet that is the name which is applied to many very inferior collections it is no uncommon thing to find these socalled libraries composed altogether of the odds and ends of literature of donations entirely worthless to their donors of secondhand schoolbooks of patent office reports and other public documents and of the dilapidated remains of some older and equally worthless collection of books and with these you talk about cultivating a taste for good reading one really good book a single copy of st nicholas is worth more than all this trash get it out of sight at once the value of a library no matter for what purpose it has been founded depends not upon the number of its books but upon their character and so the first rule to be observed in the formation of a school library is buy it at first hand even though you should begin with a single volume and shun all kinds of donations unless they be donations of cash or books of unquestionable value in selecting books for purchase you will have an eye singly to the wants of the students who are to use them a school library should be in no sense a public circulating library you cannot cater to the literary tastes of the public and at the same time serve the best interests of your pupils books relating to history to biography and to travel will form a very large portion of your library these should be chosen with reference to the age and mental capacity of those who are to read them no book should be bought merely because it is a good book but because we know that it can be made useful in the attainment of certain desired ends the courses of reading indicated in the following chapters of this work it is hoped will assist you largely in making a wise selection as well as in directing to a judicious use of books for the selection of a book is only half of your duty the profitable use of it is the other half and this lesson should be early taught to your pupils if through means of your school library or otherwise you succeed in enlisting the interest of a young person in profitable methodical reading you have accomplished a great deal towards the forwarding of his education and the formation of his character it is a great mistake to suppose that a boy of twelve cannot pursue a course of reading in english history if properly directed and encouraged he will enjoy it far better than the perusal of the milkandwater storybooks which under the guise of harmless juvenile literature have been placed in his hands by wellmeaning teachers or parents in a former chapter i have shown you how with a library of only fifty volumes you may have in your possession the very best of all that the worlds masterminds have ever written food as i have said for study and meditation and mind growth enough for a lifetime such a library is worth more than ten thousand volumes of the ordinary popular kind of books so also the reading of a very few books carefully and methodically by your pupils the constant presence of the very best books in our language and the exclusion of the trashy and the vile will give them more real enjoyment and infinitely greater profit than the desultory or hasty reading of many volumes a small library is to be despised only when it contains inferior books illustration illustration chapter vii courses of reading in history history at least in its state of ideal perfection is a compound of poetry and philosophy macaulay let us search more and more into the past let all men explore it as the true fountain of knowledge by whose light alone consciously or unconsciously employed can the present and the future be interpreted or guessed at carlyle history is a voice forever sounding across the centuries the laws of right and wrong opinions alter manners change creeds rise and fall but the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity justice and truth alone endure and live injustice and falsehood may be longlived but doomsday comes at last to them in french revolutions and other terrible ways that is one lesson of history another is that we should draw no horoscopes that we should expect little for what we expect will not come to pass froude the student is to read history actively and not passively to esteem his own life the text and books the commentary thus compelled the muse of history will utter oracles as never to those who do not respect themselves i have no expectation that any man will read history aright who thinks that what was done in a remote age by men whose names have resounded far has any deeper sense than what he is doing today the instinct of the mind the purpose of nature betrays itself in the use we make of the signal narrations of history emerson i venture to propose the following courses of reading in history properly modified with reference to individual needs and capabilities these lists will prove to be safe helps and guides to younger as well as older readers to classes in high schools and colleges as well as private students and specialists to read all the works here mentioned as carefully and critically as the nature of their contents demands would require no inconsiderable portion of ones reading lifetime such a thing is not expected the wise teacher or the judicious scholar will select from the list that which is most proper for him and which best meets his wants or aids him most in the pursuit of his native aim the titles so far as possible are given in chronological order those printed in italics are of books indispensable for purposes of reference those printed in small capitals are of works especially adapted to younger readers i greek history dictionaries no reader can well do without a good classical dictionary the

geography and natural history geography is learned best by the careful reading of books of travel pupils would derive infinitely more knowledge by the use under judicious instructors of a library of this sort than by years of drudging through those masses of inanity known as school geographies the following list is designed chiefly to aid teachers in the selection of books suitable for geographical study at school and to assist private readers in the choice of useful and entertaining works on the various subjects of interest in our own and foreign countries a good atlas is the first desideratum and is an indispensable auxiliary to the course of reading here indicated rand mcnally cos atlas is one of the latest publications and perhaps the most accurate and complete in the market

philosophy and religion a little philosophy inclineth a mans mind to atheism but depth in philosophy bringeth mens minds about to religion bacon the books which help you most are those which make you think the most says theodore parker the hardest way of learning is by easy reading every man that tries it finds it so and apropos of this i present the following list of books recommended by dr john brown as suitable for the reading of young medical students yet not only medical students but students of other special subjects and teachers as well will find it profitable to dig into and through to energize upon and master such books as these arnaulds port royal logic translated by t s baynes thomsons outlines of the necessary laws of thought descartes on the method of rightly conducting the reason and seeking truth in the sciences coleridges essay on method whatelys logic and rhetoric new and cheap edition mills logic new and cheap edition dugald stewarts outlines sir john herschels preliminary dissertation isaac taylors elements of thought sir william hamiltons edition of reid dissertations and lectures professor frasers rational philosophy locke on the conduct of the understanding taking up a book like arnauld and reading a chapter of his lively manly sense says rabs friend is like throwing your manuals and scalpels and microscopes and natural most unnatural orders out of your hand and head and taking a game with the grange club or a run to the top of arthur seat exertion quickens your pulse expands your lungs makes your blood warmer and redder fills your mouth with the pure waters of relish strengthens and supples your legs and though on your way to the top you may encounter rocks and baffling debris and gusts of fierce winds rushing out upon you from behind corners just as you will find in arnauld and all truly serious and honest books of the kind difficulties and puzzles winds of doctrine and deceitful mists still you are rewarded at the top by the wide view you see as from a tower the end of all you look into the perfections and relations of things you see the clouds the bright lights and the everlasting hills on the horizon you come down the hill a happier a better and a hungrier man and of a better mind but as we said you must eat the book you must crush it and cut it with your teeth and swallow it just as you must walk up and not be carried up the hill much less imagine you are there or look upon a picture of what you would see were you up however accurately or artistically done no you yourself must do both the same may be said of all books that are the most truly helpful to us and mindlifting it is the hard reading that profits most provided always that due care be taken to digest that which is read yet i would not recommend the same strong diet or the same severe exercise to every person or even to any considerable proportion of readers one man may be a palm as says dr collyer and another a pine that which is wisdom to the one may be incomprehensible folly to the other but those whose mental constitutions are sufficiently vigorous to digest and assimilate the food which the philosophers offer may find comfort and health not only in the works above recommended but in the following platos works jowetts translation g h lewes a chapter from aristotle lord bacon novum organum butler analogy of religion

antoninus in the wisdom series selections from fenelon burtons anatomy of melancholy sydney smiths sketches of moral philosophy watts on the mind taine on intelligence a course of reading which shall include any number of the works here mentioned will be no childs play it will involve the severest exercise of the thinking powers but it will enable you to look into the perfections and relations of things and to see the clouds the bright lights and the everlasting hills on the horizon the reading of such books is like the training of a gymnast it will lead to the healthy development of the parts most skillfully exercised but the strength of him who exercises should never be too severely tested would you prefer a lighter course of reading but one which will probably lead you into pleasanter paths of contemplation and reflection and finally open up to your view a prospect equally boundless and grand allow me to suggest the following which is neither philosophical nor religious in the strictest acceptation of these terms but which leads us to an acquaintance with that which is best in both we shall begin with the bible and throughout the course we shall make that book our grand rallyingpoint read the bible reverently and attentively says sir matthew hale set your heart upon it and lay it up in your memory and make it the direction of your life it will make you a wise and good man from the reverential reading of the bible which to most of us is rather an act of religious duty than of intellectual effort we turn to the great masterpieces of antiquity in the phaedo and the apology and crito of plato we find the ripest thoughts of the worlds greatest thinker then we turn to aristotles ethics and afterwards we compare the doctrines of the greek philosophers with the teachings of confucius and of mencius if we have supplemented these readings with the proper acquaintance with ancient history we shall now be ready to understand the great poems of antiquity and to read them in a light different from that which we have hitherto known we read the iliad and the odyssey and the greek tragedians then the old indian epics arnolds the light of asia and swamys dialogues and discourses of gotama buddha descending now to more modern times for we would not make this course a long one we turn again to our bible and thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the unsurpassedly simple loving perfect idyls of the life and death of christ as we find them in the new testament after this we shall obtain more exalted ideas of the brotherhood of the human race and the hope of the nations if we spend some time in the study of the majestic expressions of the universal conscience found in such works as the vishnu sarma of the hindoos the gulistan of saadi the sentences of epictetus and the thoughts of marcus aurelius antoninus then to get at the poetic interpretation of the teachings of mohammed we read the pearls of faith or islams rosary and lane pooles selections from the koran returning to the study of christian ethics and poetry we take up the confessions of saint augustine and the discourse of saint bernard and then the imitation of christ by thomas a kempis we read miltons paradise lost again and bunyans pilgrims progress and we enjoy the wealth of imagery in jeremy taylors holy living and holy dying holy george herberts sacred poems and private ejaculations claim our attention for a time and then we take up pascals thoughts and selections from fenelons telemachus and dialogues of the dead finally we read wordsworths excursion and kebles christian year and return after all to a further perusal of the bible and the poems of antiquity you may say that this course is rather fragmentary and so it is but it differs from the other courses which i have indicated in that it is undertaken as a heartwork rather than a headwork unlike the course just preceding it has to do with our emotional and devotional natures rather than with our highest powers of thinking and reasoning with few exceptions only the books here mentioned are voices out of the past speaking to us of the human souls belief and experience in different ages of the world and under different dispensations i suppose says george eliot speaking of the imitation of christ i suppose that is the reason why the small oldfashioned book for which you need only pay sixpence at a bookstall works miracles to this day turning bitter waters into sweetness while expensive sermons and treatises newly issued leave all things as they were before it was written down by a hand that waited for the hearts prompting it is the chronicle of a solitary hidden anguish struggle trust and triumph not written on velvet cushions to teach endurance to those who are treading with bleeding feet on the stones and so it remains to all time a lasting record of human needs and human consolations the voice of a brother who ages ago felt and suffered and renounced in the cloister perhaps with serge gown and tonsured head with much chanting and long fasts and with a fashion of speech different from ours but under the same silent faroff heavens and with the same passionate desires the same strivings the same failures the same weariness writing of works like these emerson says their communications are not to be given or taken with the lips and the end of the tongue but out of the glow of the cheek and with the throbbing heart these are the scriptures which the missionary might well carry over prairie desert and ocean to siberia japan timbuctoo yet he will find that the spirit which is in them journeys faster than he and greets him on his arrival was there long before him the missionary must be carried by it and find it there or he goes in vain is there any geography in these things we call them asiatic we call them primeval but perhaps that is only optical for nature is always equal to herself and there are as good eyes and ears now in the planet as ever were only these ejaculations of the soul are uttered one or a few at a time at long intervals and it takes millenniums to make a bible we are brought now naturally to the subject of theological literature the number of books in this department is very great and there are wide differences of opinion with regard to the merits of many of the bestknown works without attempting to select always the best i shall name only a sufficient number of books necessary for the use of such nonprofessional readers as may desire to acquire a moderate knowledge of the commonly accepted theological doctrines mcclintock and strongs cyclopaedia of biblical theological and ecclesiastical literature vols smiths dictionary of the bible youngs analytical concordance to the bible barrows sacred

yale lectures on preaching dorners system of christian doctrine goulburns thoughts on personal religion richard baxter speaking of this class of books says such books have the advantage in many other respects you may read an able preacher when you have but a mean one to hear every congregation cannot hear the most judicious or powerful preachers but every single person may read the books of the most powerful and judicious preachers may be silenced or banished when books may be at hand books may be kept at a smaller charge than preachers we may choose books which treat of that very subject which we desire to hear of books we may have at hand every day and hour when we can have sermons but seldom and at set times if sermons be forgotten they are gone but a book we may read over and over until we remember it and if we forget it may again peruse it at our pleasure or at our leisure illustration illustration chapter x political economy and the science of government this is that noble science of politics which is equally removed from the barren theories of the utilitarian sophists and from the petty craft so often mistaken for statesmanship by minds grown narrow in habits of intrigue jobbing and official etiquette which of all sciences is the most important to the welfare of nations which of all sciences most tends to expand and invigorate the mind which draws nutriment and ornament from every part of philosophy and literature and dispenses in return nutriment and ornament to all macaulay to the student of political economy and the science of government i offer the

history of prices to rogers history of agriculture and prices in england illustration illustration chapter xi on the practical study of english literature the ocean of literature is without limit how then shall we be able to perform a voyage even to a moderate distance if we waste our time in dalliance on the shore our only hope is in exertion let our only reward be that of industry ringelbergius the student of english literature has indeed embarked upon a limitless ocean a lifetime of study will serve only to make him acquainted with parts of that great expanse which lies open before him he should pursue his explorations earnestly and with the inquiring spirit of a true discoverer his thirst for knowledge should be unquenchable he should long always for that mind food which brings the right kind of mind growth he should not rest satisfied with merely superficial attainments but should strive for that thoroughness of knowledge without which there can be neither excellence nor enjoyment english literature is not to be learned from manuals they are only helps charts buoys lighthouses if you will call them so or they serve to you the purposes of guidebooks what do you think of the wouldbe tourist who stays at home and studies his baedeker with the foolish thought that he is actually seeing the countries which the book describes and yet i have known students and not a few teachers do a thing equally as foolish with a morley or a shaw or even a brooke in their hands and a few names and dates at their tongues ends they imagine themselves viewing the great ocean of literature ploughing its surface and exploring its depths when in reality they are only wasting their time in dalliance on the shore english literature does not consist in a mere array of names and dates and short biographical sketches of men who have written books biography is biography literature is a record of the best thoughts but the former is frequently studied in place of the latter for once that we take down our milton and read a book of that voice as wordsworth says whose sound is like the sea we take up fifty times a magazine with something about milton or about miltons grandmother or a book stuffed with curious facts about the houses in which he lived and the juvenile ailments of his first wife instead of becoming acquainted at first hand with books in which are stored the energies of the past we content ourselves with knowing only something about the men who wrote them instead of admiring with our own eyes the architectural beauties of st pauls cathedral we read a biography of sir christopher wren again it must be borne in mind that literature is one thing and the history of literature is another the study of the latter however important cannot be substituted for that of the former yet it is not desirable to separate the two to acquire any serviceable knowledge of a book you will be greatly aided by knowing under what peculiar conditions it was conceived and produced the history of the country the manners of the people the status of morals and politics at the time it was written between history and literature there is a mutual relationship which should not be overlooked a book is the offspring of the aggregate intellect of humanity and it gives back to humanity in the shape of new ideas and new combinations of old ideas not only all that which it has derived from it but more increased intellectual vitality and springs of action hitherto unknown in the study of literature one should begin with an author and with a subject not too difficult to understand a beginner will be likely to find but little comfort in chaucer or spenser or even in emerson but after he has worked up to them he may study them with unbounded delight for a ready understanding and correct appreciation of the great masterpieces of english literature a knowledge of greek and roman mythology and history is almost indispensable the student will find the courses of historical reading given in a former chapter of this book of much value in supplementing his literary studies the great works of the worlds masterminds should be studied together with reference to the similarity of their subjectmatter for example the reading of shakspeare will give occasion to the study of dramatic literature in all its forms the reading of miltons paradise lost will introduce us to the great epics and to heroic poetry in general sir walter scotts lay of the last minstrel will lead naturally to the romance literature of modern and mediaeval times chaucers canterbury tales fitly illustrate the storytelling phase of poetry the study of lyric poetry may centre around the old ballads the poems of robert burns and the religious hymns of our language bunyans pilgrims progress introduces us to allegory and miltons lycidas to elegiac and pastoral poetry and to know the best specimens of argumentative prose we begin with the speeches of daniel webster and end with the orations of demosthenes the following schemes for the study of different departments of english literature have been tested both with private students and with classes at school of course
