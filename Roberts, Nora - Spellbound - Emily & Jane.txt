prologue love my love let me into your dreams open your heart again and hear me calin i need you so dont turn from me now or all is lost i am lost love my love calin shifted restlessly in sleep turned his face into the pillow felt her there somehow skin soft and dewy hands gentle and soothing then drifted into dreams of cool and quiet mists hills of deep damp green that rolled to forever and the witchy scent of woman the castle rose atop a cliff silver stone spearing into stormy skies its base buried in filmy layers of fog that ran like a river the sound of his mounts bridle jingled battlebright on the air as he rode leaving the green hills behind and climbing high on rock thunder sounded in the west over the sea and echoed in his warriors heart had she waited for him his eyes gray as the stone of the castle shifted scanned searching rock and mist for any hole where a foe could hide even as he urged his mount up the rugged path cleaved into the cliff he knew he carried the stench of war and death that it had seeped into his pores just as the memories of it had seeped into his brain neither body nor mind would ever be fully clean of it his sword hand lay light and ready on the hilt of his weapon in such places a man did not lower his guard here magic stung the air and could embrace or threaten here faeries plotted or danced and witches cast their spells for good or ill atop the lonely cliff towering above the raging sea the castle stood holding its secrets and no man rode this path without hearing the whispers of old ghosts and new spirits had she waited for him the horses hooves rang musically over the rock until at last they traveled to level ground he dismounted at the foot of the keep just as lightning cracked the black sky with a blaze of blinding white light and she was there just there conjured up out of stormwhipped air her hair was a firefall over a dovegray cloak alabaster skin with the faint bloom of rose a generous mouth just curved in knowledge and eyes as blue as a living star and just as filled with power his heart leaped and his blood churned with love lust longing she came to him wading through the kneehigh mists her beauty staggering with his eyes on hers he swung off his horse eager for the woman who was witch and lover caelan of farrell tis far youve traveled in the dark of the night what do you wish of me bryna the wise his hard ridged lips bowed in a smile that answered hers i wish for everything only everything her laugh was low and intimate well thats enough then i waited for you then her arms were around him her mouth lifting to his he pulled her closer desperate for the shape of her wild to have whatever she would offer him and more i waited for you she repeated with a catch in her voice as she pressed her face to his shoulder twas almost too long this time his power grows while mine weakens i cant fight him alone alasdair is too strong his dark forces too greedy oh love my love why did you shut me out of your mind out of your heart he drew her away the castle was gone only ruins remained empty battlescarred they stood in the shadow of what had been before a small house alive with flowers the scent of them was everywhere heady intoxicating the woman was still in his arms and the storm waited to explode the time is short now she told him you must come calin you must come to me destiny cant be denied a spell wont be broken without you with me hell win he shook his head started to speak but she lifted a hand to his face it passed through him as if he were a ghost or she was i have loved you throughout time as she spoke she moved back the mists flowing around her legs i am bound to you throughout time then lifting her arms raising palms to the heavens she closed her eyes the wind roared in like a lion loosed from a cage lifted her flaming hair whipped the cloak around her i have little left she called over the violence of the storm but i can still call up the wind i can still call to your heart dont keep it from me calin come to me soon find me or im lost then she was gone vanished the earth trembled beneath his feet the sky howled and all went silent and still he awoke gasping for breath and reaching out chapter contents prev next calin farrell you need a vacation cal lifted a shoulder sipped his coffee and continued to brood while staring out the kitchen window he wasnt sure why hed come here to listen to his mother nag and worry about him to hear his father whistle as he meticulously tied his fishing flies at the table but hed had a deep driving urge to be in the home of his childhood to grab an hour or two in the tidy house in brooklyn heights to see his parents maybe im thinking about it work too hard his father said eyeing his own work critically could come to montana for a couple of weeks with us best flyfishing in the world bring your camera john farrell glanced up and smiled call it a sabbatical it was tempting hed never been the fishing enthusiast his father was but montana was beautiful and big cal thought he could lose himself there and shake off the restlessness the dreams a couple of weeks in the clean air will do you good sylvia farrell narrowed her eyes as she turned to her son youre looking pale and tired calin you need to get out of that city for a while though shed lived in brooklyn all of her life sylvia still referred to manhattan as that city with light disdain and annoyance ive been thinking about a trip good his mother scrubbed at her countertop they were leaving the next morning and sylvia farrell wouldnt leave a crumb or a mote of dust behind youve been working too hard calin not that we arent proud of you after your exhibit last month your father bragged so much that the neighbors started to hide when they saw him coming not every day a man gets to see his sons photographs in the museum i liked the nudes especially he added with a wink you old fool sylvia muttered but her lips twitched well whod have thought when we bought you that little camera for christmas when you were eight that twentytwo years later youd be rich and famous but wealth and fame carry a price she took her sons face in her hands and studied it with a mothers keen eye his eyes were shadowed she noted his face too thin she worried for the man shed raised and the boy he had been who had always seemed to have something more than the ordinary youre paying it im fine reading the worry in her eyes recognizing it he smiled just not sleeping very well there had been other times sylvia remembered that her son had grown pale and holloweyed from lack of sleep she exchanged a quick glance with her husband over cals shoulder have you ah seen the doctor mom im fine he knew his voice was too sharp too defensive struggled to lighten it im perfectly fine dont nag the boy syl but john studied his son closely also remembering as his wife did the young boy who had talked to shadows had walked in his sleep and had dreamed of witches and blood and battle im not nagging im mothering she made herself smile i dont want you to worry im a little stressedout thats all that was all he thought determined to make it so he wasnt different he wasnt odd hadnt the battalion of doctors his parents had taken him to throughout his childhood diagnosed an overdeveloped imagination and hadnt he finally channeled that into his photography he didnt see things that werent there anymore sylvia nodded told herself to accept that small wonder youve been working yourself day and night for the last five years you need some rest you need some quiet and some pampering montana john said again couple of weeks of fishing clean air and no worries im going to ireland it came out of cals mouth before hed realized the idea was in his head ireland sylvia pursed her lips not to work calin no to to see he said at length just to see she nodded satisfied a vacation after all was a vacation thatll be nice its supposed to be a restful country we always meant to go didnt we john her husband grunted his assent going to look up your ancestors cal i might since the decision seemed to be made cal sipped his coffee again he was going to look up something he realized or someone it was raining when he landed at shannon airport the chilly latespring rain seemed to suit his mood hed slept nearly all the way across the atlantic and the dreams had chased him he went through customs arranged to rent a car changed money all of this was done with the mechanical efficiency of the seasoned traveler and as he completed the tasks he tried not to worry tried not to dwell on the idea that he was having a breakdown of some kind he climbed into the rented car then simply sat in the murky light wondering what to do where to go he was thirty a successful photographer who could name his own price call his own shots he still considered it a wild twist of fate that hed been able to make a living doing something he loved using what he saw in a landscape in a face in light and shadow and texture and translating that into a photograph it was true that the last few years had been hectic and hed worked almost nonstop even now the trunk of the volvo hed rented was loaded with equipment and his favored nikon rested in its case on the seat beside him he couldnt get away from it didnt want to run away from what he loved suddenly an odd chill raced through him and he thought for just a moment that he heard a woman weeping just the rain he told himself and scrubbed his hands over his handsome face it was long narrow with the high strong cheekbones of his celtic forefathers his nose was straight his mouth firm and well formed it smiled often or it had until recently his eyes were gray a deep pure gray without a hint of green or blue the brows over them were strongly arched and tended to draw together in concentration his hair was black and thick and flowed over his collar an artistic touch that a number of women had enjoyed again until recently he brooded over the fact that it had been months since hed been with a woman since hed wanted to overwork again he wondered a byproduct of stress why would he be stressed when his career was advancing by leaps and bounds he was healthy hed had a complete physical only weeks before but you didnt tell the doctor about the dreams did you he reminded himself the dreams you cant quite remember when you wake up the dreams he admitted that had pulled him three thousand miles over the ocean no damn it he hadnt told the doctor he wasnt going that route again there had been enough psychiatrists in his youth poking and prodding into his mind making him feel foolish exposed helpless he was a grown man now and could handle his own dreams if he was having a breakdown it was a perfectly normal one and could be cured by rest relaxation and a change of scene thats what hed come to ireland for only that he started the car and began to drive aimlessly hed had dreams before when he was a boy very clear too realistic dreams castles and witches and a woman with tumbling red hair shed spoken to him with that lilt of ireland in her voice and sometimes shed spoken in a language he didnt know but had understood nonetheless thered been a young girl that same waterfall of hair the same blue eyes theyd laughed together in his dreams played together innocent childhood games he remembered that his parents had been amused when hed spoken of his friend they had passed it off he thought as the natural imagination of a sociable only child but theyd been concerned when he seemed to know things to see things to speak of places and people he couldnt have had knowledge of theyd worried over him when his sleep was disturbed night after night when he began to walk and talk while glazed in dreams so after the doctors the therapists the endless sessions and those quick searching looks that adults thought children couldnt interpret hed stopped speaking of them and as hed grown older the young girl had grown as well tall and slim and lovely young breasts narrow waist long legs feelings and needs for her that werent so innocent had begun to stir it had frightened him and it had angered him until hed blocked out that soft voice that came in the night until hed turned away from the image that haunted his dreams finally it had stopped the dreams stopped the little flickers in his mind that told him where to find lost keys or had him reaching for the phone an instant before it rang ceased he was comfortable with reality cal told himself had chosen it and would choose it again he was here only to prove to himself that he was an ordinary man suffering from overwork he would soak up the atmosphere of ireland take the pictures that pleased him and if necessary take the pills his doctor had prescribed to help him sleep undisturbed he drove along the stormbattered coast where wind roared in over the sea and held encroaching summer at bay with chilly breath rain pattered the windshield and fog slithered over the ground it was hardly a warm welcome yet he felt at home as if something or someone was waiting to take him in from the storm he made himself laugh at that it was just the pleasure of being in a new place he decided it was the anticipation of finding new images to capture on film he felt a lowgrade urge for coffee for food but easily blocked it as he absorbed the scenery later he told himself he would stop later at some pub or inn but just now he had to see more of this haunting landscape so savagely beautiful so timeless and if it was somehow familiar he could put that down to place memory after all his ancestors had roamed these spearing cliffs these rolling green hills they had been warriors he thought had once painted themselves blue and screamed out of the forests to terrorize the enemy had strapped on armor and hefted sword and pike to defend their land and protect their freedom the scene that burst into his mind was viciously clear the flash of sword crashing the screams of battle in full power wheeling horses wildeyed spurting blood from a severed arm and the agonizing cry of pain as a man crumpled the burn as steel pierced flesh looking down as the pain bloomed he saw blood welling on his thigh carrion crows circling in silent patience the stench of roasting flesh as bodies burned on a pyre and the hideous and thin cries of dying men waiting for release cal found himself stopped on the side of the road out of the car dragging air into his lungs as the rain battered him had he blacked out was he losing his mind trembling he reached down and ran his hand over his jeans there was no wound and yet he felt the echoing ache of an old scar he knew wasnt there it was happening again the river of fear that flowed through him froze over and turned his blood to ice he forced himself to calm down to think rationally jet lag he decided jet lag and stress that was all how long since hed driven out of shannon two hours three he needed to find a place to stay he needed to eat he would find some quiet outoftheway bedandbreakfast he thought somewhere he could rest and ease his mind and when the storm had passed he would get his camera and go for a long walk he could stay for weeks or leave in the morning he was free he reminded himself and that was sane that was normal he climbed back into the car steadied himself and drove along the winding coast road the ruined castle came into view as he rounded the curve the keep he supposed it was was nearly intact but walls had been sheared off making him think of an ancient warrior with scars from many battles perched on a stony crag it shouted with power and defiance despite its tumbled rocks out of the boiling sky one lance of lightning speared exploded with light and stung the air with the smell of ozone his blood beat thick and an ache purely sexual began to spread through his belly on the steering wheel his fingers tightened he swung onto the narrow rutted dirt road that led up he needed a picture of the castle he told himself several studies from different angles a quick detour fifteen or twenty minutes then he would be on his way to that b and b it didnt matter that ireland was dotted with ruins and old castles he needed this one mists spread at its base like a river so intent was he on the light and shadows that played on stone on the texture of the weeds and wildflowers that forced their way through crevices that he didnt see the cottage until he was nearly upon it it made him smile though he didnt realize it it was so charming so unexpected there beside the ancient stones inviting welcoming it seemed to bloom like the flowers that surrounded it out of the cliffside as if planted by a loving hand it was painted white with bright blue shutters smoke trailed up out of the stone chimney and a sleek black cat napped beside a wooden rocker on the little covered porch someone made a home here he thought and tended it the light was wrong he told himself but he knew he needed to capture this place this feeling he would ask whoever lived here if he could come back do his work as he stood in the rain the cat uncurled lazily then sat it watched him out of startlingly blue eyes then she was there standing in the lashing rain the mists swirling around her though hed hadnt heard her approach she was halfway between the tidy cottage and the tumbling stones of the old castle one hand was lifted to her heart and her breath was coming fast as if shed been running her hair was wet hanging in deepred ropes over her shoulders framing a face that might have been carved out of ivory by a master her mouth was soft and full and seemed to tremble as it curved into a smile of welcome her eyes were star blue and swimming with emotions as powerful as the storm i knew you would come the cloak she wore flew back as she raced to him i waited for you she said with the musical lilt of ireland before her mouth crushed his chapter contents prev next there was a moment of blinding searing joy another of dark primal lust her taste sharp potent soaked into his system as the rain soaked his skin he was helpless to do anything but absorb it her arms were chained around his neck her slim curvy body pressed intimately to his the heat from it seeping through his sodden shirt and into his bones and her mouth was as wild and edgy as the sky thundering above them it was all terrifyingly familiar he brought his hands to her shoulders torn for a staggering instant as to whether to pull her closer or push her away in the end he eased back held her at arms length she was beautiful she was aroused and she was he assured himself a stranger he angled his head determined to handle the situation well its certainly a friendly country he saw the flicker in her eyes the dimming of disappointment a flash of frustration but he couldnt know just how deeply that disappointment that frustration cut into her heart hes here she told herself hes come thats what matters most now it is yes she gave him a smile let her fingers linger in his hair just another second then dropped them to her sides welcome to ireland and the castle of secrets his gaze shifted toward the ruins is that what its called thats the name it carries now she had to struggle to keep her eyes from devouring him every inch every expression instead she offered a hand as she would have to any wayward traveler youve had a long journey come sit by my fire her lips curved have some whiskey in your tea you dont know me he made it a statement rather than a question had to in answer she looked up at the sky youre wet she said and the winds cold today its enough to have me offer a seat by the hearth she turned away from him stepped up onto the porch where the cat stirred itself to wind through her legs youve come this far her eyes met his again held will you come into my home calin farrell and warm yourself he scooped dripping hair out of his face felt his bones tremble how do you know my name the same way you knew to come here she picked up the cat stroked its silky head both of them watched him with patient unblinking blue eyes i baked scones fresh this morning youll be hungry with this she turned and walked inside leaving him to come or go as he willed part of him wanted to get back in the car drive away pretend hed never seen her or this place but he climbed onto the porch pushed the front door open he needed answers and it seemed she had at least some of them the warmth struck him instantly welcoming warmth redolent with the fragrances of bread recently baked of peat simmering in the hearth of flowers just picked make yourself at home she set the cat on the floor ill see to the tea cal stepped into the tiny parlor and near to the red eye of the fire there were flowers he noted their petals still damp filling vases on the stone mantel pots on the table by the window a sugan chair sat by the hearth but he didnt sit instead he studied the room with the sharp eye of an artist quiet colors he thought not pale but soothing in the choice of deep rose and mossy greens woven rugs on the polished floors mirrorbright woods lovingly cared for and smelling lightly of beeswax candles everywhere in varying lengths standing in holders of glass and silver and stone there by the hearth a spinning wheel surely an antique he mused as he stepped closer to examine it its dark wood gleamed and beside it sat a straw basket heaped with beautifully dyed wools but for the electric lamps and their jewellike shades the small stereo tucked into a stack of books on a shelf he might have convinced himself hed stepped into another century absently he crouched to pet the cat which was rubbing seductively against his legs the fur was warm and damp real he hadnt walked into another century cal assured himself or into a dream he was going to ask his hostess some very pointed questions he decided and he wasnt going anywhere until he was satisfied with the answers as she carried the tray back down the short hallway she berated herself for losing her sense in the storm of emotion for moving too quickly saying too much expecting too much he didnt know her oh that cut through the heart into the soul but it had been foolish of her to expect him to when he had blocked out her thoughts her need for him for more than fifteen years she had continued to steal into his dreams when he was unaware to watch him grow from boy to man as she herself blossomed into womanhood but pride and hurt and love had stopped her from calling to him until there had been no choice shed known it the moment he stepped onto the ground of her own country and her heart had leaped had it been so wrong and so foolish to prepare for him to fill the house with flowers the kitchen with baking to bathe herself in oils of her own making anointing her skin as a bride would on her wedding night no she took a deep breath at the doorway she had needed to prepare herself for him now she must find the right way to prepare him for her and what they must soon face together he was so beautiful she thought as she watched him stroke the cat into ecstasy how many nights had she tossed restlessly in sleep longing for those long narrow hands on her oh just once to feel him touch her how many nights had she burned to see his eyes gray as storm clouds focused on her as he buried himself deep inside her and gave her his seed oh just once to join with him to make those soft secret sounds in the night they were meant to be lovers this much she believed he would accept for a man had needs she knew and this one was already linked with her physically no matter that he refused to remember but without the love in the act of mating there would be no joy and no hope she braced herself and stepped into the room youve made friends with hecate i see his gaze whipped up to hers and her hands trembled lightly whatever power she still held was nothing compared with one long look from him shes shameless around attractive men she set the tray down wont you sit calin and have some tea how do you know who i am ill explain what i can her eyes went dark and turbulent with emotions as they scanned his face do you have no memory of me then none at all a tumble of red hair that shined like wet fire a body that moved in perfect harmony with his a laugh like fog i dont know you he said it sharply defensively i dont know your name her eyes remained dark but her chin lifted here was pride and power still i am bryna torrence descendant of bryna the wise and guardian of this place youre welcome in my home calin farrell as long as you choose to stay she bent to the tray her movements graceful she wore a long dress the color of the mists curling outside the window it draped her body flirted with her ankles columns of carved silver danced from her ears why he laid a hand on her arm as she lifted the first cup why am i welcome in your home perhaps im lonely her lips curved again wistfully i am lonely and its glad i am for your company she sat gestured for him to do the same you need a bit of food calin a bit of rest i can offer you that what i want is an explanation but he did sit and because the hot liquid in his cup smelled glorious he drank you said you knew i would come you knew my name i want to know how either of those things is possible it wasnt permitted to lie to him honesty was part of the pledge but she could evade i might have recognized your face youre a successful and famous man calin your art has found its way even into my corner of the world you have such talent she murmured such vision she arranged scones on a small plate offered it such power inside you he lifted a brow there were women who were willing eager to rock onto their backs for a man who had a hold on fame he shook his head youre no groupie bryna you didnt open the door to me so that you could have a quick bout of sex with a name but others have there was a sting of jealousy in her voice he couldnt have said why but under the circumstances it amused him which is how i know thats not what this is not what you are in any case you didnt have the time to recognize my face from some magazine or talk show the light was bad the rain pouring down his brows drew together he couldnt be dreaming again hallucinating the teacup was warm in his hand the taste of the sweet whiskeylaced brew in his mouth damn it you were waiting for me and i dont understand how ive waited for you all my life she said it quietly setting her cup down untouched and a millennium before it began raising her hands she laid them on his face your face is the first i remember before even my own mothers the ghost of your touch has haunted me every night of my life thats nonsense he brought a hand up curled his fingers around her wrist i cant lie to you its not in my power whatever i say to you will be truth whatever you see in me will be real she tried to touch that part of his mind or his heart that might still be open to her but it was locked away fiercely guarded she took one long breath and accepted for now youre not ready to know to hear to believe her eyes softened a little her fingertips stroking his temples ah calin youre tired and confused its rest youre needing now and ease for your mind i can help you his vision grayed and the room swam he could see nothing but her eyes dark blue utterly focused her scent swam into his senses like a drug stop it rest now love my love he felt her lips brush his before he slid blissfully into the dark cal awoke to silence his mind circled for a moment like a bird looking for a place to perch something in the tea he thought god the woman had drugged him he felt a quick panic as the theme from stephen kings misery played in his head obsessed fan kidnapping with a jolt he sat straight up terrified reaching for his foot still attached the black cat which had been curled on the edge of the bed stretched lazily and seemed to snicker yeah funny cal muttered he let out a long breath that trailed into a weak laugh letting your imagination turn cartwheels again calin he told himself always been a bad habit of yours he ordered himself to calm down take stock of the situation and realized he was buck naked surprise ran a swift race with embarrassment as he imagined bryna undressing him with those lovely teaserving hands and getting him into bed how in the hell had the woman carted him into a bedroom for that was where he was it was a small and charming room with a tiny stone hearth a glossy bureau flowers and candles again books tucked into a recessed nook a dollsize chair sat near a window that was framed in white lace curtains sunlight slipped through them and made lovely and intricate patterns on the dark wood floor at the foot of the bed was an old chest with brass fittings his clothes clean and dry were folded neatly on it at least she didnt expect him to run around in his skin he decided and with some relief reached quickly for his jeans he felt immediately better once they were zipped then realized that he felt not just better he felt wonderful alert rested energized whatever shed given him he concluded had rocked him into the solid restful sleep he hadnt experienced in weeks but he wasnt going to thank her for it cal thought grimly as he tugged on his shirt the woman went way past eccentric he didnt mind a little eccentricity but this lady was deluded and possibly dangerous he was going to see to it that she gave him some satisfactory answers then he was going to leave her to her fairytale cottage and ruined castle and put some miles between them he looked in the mirror over the bureau half expecting to see a beard trailing down to his chest like rip van winkle but the man who stared back at him hadnt aged he looked perplexed annoyed and again rested the damnedest thing cal mused scooping his hair back he found his shoes neatly tucked beside the chest putting them on he found himself studying the patterns the sunlight traced on the floor light it struck him all at once had him jumping to his feet again the rain had stopped for christs sake how long had he been sleeping in two strides he was at the window yanking back those delicate curtains then he stood spellbound the view was stunning he could see the rugged ground where the ruined castle climbed make out the glints of mica in the stone where the sun struck the ground tumbled away toward the road then the road gave way to wave after rolling wave of green fields bisected with stone walls dotted with lolling cattle houses were tucked into valleys and on rises clothes flapped cheerfully on lines trees twisted up bent by the years of resisting the relentless wind off the sea and glossy green with spring he saw quite clearly a young boy pedaling his blue bike along one of the narrow trenches of road a spotted blackandwhite dog racing beside him through thick hedgerows home cal thought home for supper ma doesnt like you to be late he found himself smiling and reached down without thinking to raise the window and let in the cool moist air the light it swelled his artists heart no one could have described the light of ireland to him it had to be seen experienced like the sheen of a fine pearl he thought that makes the air glimmer go luminous and silky the sun filtering through layers of clouds had a softness a majesty hed never seen anywhere else he had to capture it now immediately surely such magic couldnt last he bolted out of the room clattered down the short flight of steps and burst out into the gentle sun with the cat scampering at his heels he grabbed the nikon off the front seat of his car his hands were quick and competent as he changed lenses then swinging his case over his shoulder he picked his position the fairytale cottage he thought the abundance of flowers the light oh that light he framed calculated and framed again chapter contents prev next bryna stepped through the arched doorway of the ruin and watched him such energy such concentration her lips bowed up he was happy in his work in his art he needed this time she thought just as hed needed those hours of deep dreamless sleep soon he would have questions again and she would have to answer she stepped back inside wanting to give him his privacy alone with her thoughts she walked to the center of the castle where flowers grew out of the dirt in a circle thick with blooms lifting her face to the light raising her arms to the sky she began her chant power tingled in her fingertips but it was weak so weak that she wanted to weep in frustration once she had known its full strength now she knew the pain of its decline it was ordained this i know but here on ground where flowers grow i call the wind i call the sun what was done can be undone no harm to him shall come through me as i will so mote it be the wind came fluttering her hair like gentle fingers the sun beat warm on her upturned face i call the faeries i call the wise use what power you can devise hear me speak though my charms are weak cast the circle for my own true love guard him fast from below from above harm to none my vow is free as i will so mote it be the power shimmered brighter warmer she fought to hold it to absorb what gift was given she thrust up a hand the silver of the ring she wore exploding with light as a single narrow beam shot through the layering clouds and struck the heat of it flowed up her arm made her want to weep again this time in gratitude she was not yet defenseless cal clicked the shutter again and again he took nearly a dozen pictures of her she stood still as a statue in a perfect circle of flowers some odd trick of the wind made it blow her hair away from her glowing face some odd trick of the light made it beam down on her in a single perfect diagonal shaft she was beautiful unearthly though his heart stumbled when her fingers appeared to explode with light he continued to circle her and capture her on film then she began to move just a sway of her body rhythmic sensual the wind whipped the thin fabric of her dress then had it clinging to those slim curves the language she spoke now was familiar from his dreams with unsteady hands cal lowered the camera it was unsettling enough that he somehow understood the ancient tongue but he would see beyond the words and into her thoughts as clearly as if they were written on a page protect defend the battle is nearly upon us help me help him there was desperation in her thoughts and fear the fear made him want to reach out soothe her shield her he stepped forward and into the circle the moment he did her body jerked her eyes opened fixed on his she held up a hand quickly before he could touch her not here her voice was raw and thick not now it waits for the moon to fill flowers brushed her knees as she walked out of the circle the wind that had poured through her hair gentled died you rested well she asked him what the hell is going on here his eyes narrowed what the hell did you put in my tea a dollop of irish nothing more she smiled at his camera youve been working i wondered what you would see here and need to show why did you strip me your clothes were damp she blinked once as she saw his thoughts in his eyes then she laughed low and long with a female richness that stirred his blood oh cal you have a most attractive body ill not deny i looked but in truth im after preferring a man awake and participating when it comes to the matters youre thinking of though furious he only angled his head and would you find it so funny if youd awakened naked in a strange bed after taking tea with a strange man her lips pursed then she let out a breath your points taken well taken im sorry for it i promise you i was thinking only of giving you your ease then the humor twinkled again or mostly only of that she spread her arms would you like to strip me pay me back in kind he could imagine it very well peeling that long thin dress away from her finding her beneath i want answers his voice was sharp abrupt i want them now you do i know but are you ready i wonder she turned a slow circle here i suppose is the place for it ill tell you a story calin farrell a story of great love great betrayal one of passion and greed of power and lust one of magic gained and lost i dont want a story i want answers its the same they are one and the other she turned back to him and her voice flowed musically once long ago this castle guarded the coast and its secrets it rose silver and shining above the sea its walls were thick its fires burned bright servants raced up and down the stairways into chambers the rushes were clean and sweet on the floor magic sang in the air she walked toward curving steps lifted her hem and began to climb too curious to argue cal followed her he could see where the floors had been the lintels and stone bracings carved into the walls were small openings too shallow for chambers he imagined storage perhaps he saw too that some of the stones were blackened as if from a great fire laying a hand on one he swore he could still feel heat those who lived here she continued practiced their art and harmed none when someone from the village came here with ails or worries help was offered babies were born here she said as she stepped through a doorway and into the sun again the old died she walked across a wide parapet to a stone rail that stood over the lashing sea years passed in just this way season to season birth to death it came to be that some who lived here went out into the land to make new places over the hills into the forests up into the mountains where the faeries have always lived the view left him thunderstruck awed thrilled but he turned to her cocked a brow faeries she smiled turned and leaned back against the rail one remained a woman who knew her fate was here in this place she gathered her herbs cast her spells spun her wool and waited one day he came riding over the hills on a fine black horse the man shed waited for he was a warrior brave and strong and true of heart standing here just here she saw the sun glint off his armor she prepared for him lighting the candles and torches to show him the way until the castle burned bright as a flame he was wounded gently she traced a fingertip on cals thigh he forced himself not to step back not to think about the hallucination hed had while driving through the hills toward this place the battle he had fought was fierce he was weary in body and heart and in mind she gave him food and ease and the warmth of her fire and her love he took the love she gave offered back his own they were all to each other from that moment his name was caelan caelan of farrell and hers bryna their hearts were linked he stepped back now dipping his hands into his pockets you expect me to buy that what i offer is free and theres more of the story yet the frustration at having him pull back flickered over her face will you hear it or not fine he moved a shoulder go ahead she turned clamped her hands on the stone balustrade let the thunder of the sea pound in her head she stared down at that endless war of water and rock that fought at the base of the cliff they loved each other and pledged one to the other but he was a warrior and there were more battles to fight whenever he would leave her she watched in the fire she made saw him wheel his horse through smoke and death lift his sword for freedom and always he came back to her riding over the hills on a fine black horse she wove him a cloak out of dark gray wool to match his eyes and a charm she put on it for protection in battle so youre saying she was a witch a witch she was yes with the power and art that came down through the blood and the vow shed taken to her heart as close as shed taken the man she loved to harm none her powers she used only to help and to heal but not all with power are true there was one who had chosen a different path one who used his power for gain and found joy in wielding it like a bloody sword she shuddered once violently then continued this man alasdair lusted for her for her body her heart her soul for her power as well for she was strong was bryna the wise he came into her dreams creeping like a thief trying to steal from her what belonged to another trying to take what she refused to give he came into her home but she would not have him he was fair of face his hair gold and his eyes black as the path hed chosen he thought to seduce her but she spurned him her fingers tightened on the stone and her heart began to trip his anger was huge his vanity deep he set to kill the man she loved casting spells weaving charms of the dark but the cloak she had woven and the love she had given protected him from harm but there are more devious ways to destroy alasdair used them again in dreams he planted seeds of doubt hints of betrayal in caelans sleeping mind alasdair gave him visions of bryna with another painted pictures of her wrapped in another mans arms filled with another mans seed and with these images tormenting his mind caelan rode his fine black horse over the hills to this place and finding her he accused her she was proud bryna said after a moment she would not deny such lies they argued bitterly tempers ruling over hearts it was then that he struck alasdair hed waited only for the moment laughing in the shadows while the lovers hurled pain at each other when caelan tore off his cloak hurled it to the ground at her feet alasdair struck him down so that his blood ran through the stones and into the ground tears glinted into her eyes but went unshed as she faced calin her grief blinded her but she cast the circle quickly fighting to save the man she loved his wound was mortal and there was no answer for him but death she knew but refused to accept and turned to meet alasdair she lifted her voice over the roar of the sea it came stronger now this story through her then the walls of this place rang with fury with magic loosed she shielded her love and fought like a warrior gone wild and the sky thundered clouds dark and thick covered the full white moon and blotted out the stars the sea thrashed like men pitched in battle and the ground trembled and heaved in the circle weak and dying caelan reached for his sword but such weapons are useless against witchcraft light and dark unless wielded with strength in his heart he called for her understanding now his betrayal and his own foolish pride her name was on his lips as he died and when he died her heart split in two halves and left her defenseless she sighed closed her eyes briefly she was lost without him you see alasdairs power spread like vultures wings he would have her then willing or not but with the last of her strength she stumbled into the circle where her lovers blood stained the ground there a vow she made and a spell she cast there while the walls rang and the torches burned she swore her abiding love for caelan for a thousand years she would wait she would bide she sent the fire roaring through her home for she would not let alasdair have it and the spell she cast was this she drew a deep breath now kept her eyes on his a thousand years to the night they would come back and face alasdair as one if their hearts were strong they would defeat him in this place but such spells have a price and hers was to vow that if caelan did not believe did not stand with her that night as one her power would wink out and she would belong to alasdair pledging this she knelt beside her love embraced him and vanished them both he waited a moment surprised that hed found her story and the telling of it hypnotic studying her he rocked back on his heels a pretty tale bryna do you still see it as such she shook her head her eyes pleading can you look at me hear me and remember nothing you want me to believe im some sort of reincarnation of a celtic warrior and youre the reincarnation of a witch he let out a short laugh weve waited a millennium and now were going to do battle with the bad witch of the west come on honey do i look that gullible she closed her eyes the telling of the tale the reliving of it had tired her she needed all her resources now he has to believe she murmured pacing away from the wall theres no time for subtle persuading she whirled back to face him you had a vivid imagination as a child she said angrily its a pity you tossed it aside tossed me aside listen sweetheart oh dont use those terms with me havent i heard you croon them to other women as you guided them into bed i didnt expect you to be a monk waiting for this day but did you have to enjoy it so damn much excuse me oh never mind just never mind she gestured impatiently as she paced a pretty tale he says did it take a millennium to make him so stubborn so blind well well see calin farrell what well see she stopped directly in front of him her eyes burning with temper her face flushed with it a reincarnation of a witch perhaps thats true but youll see for yourself one simple fact i am a witch and not without power yet crazy is what you are he started to turn hold she drew in a breath and the wind whipped again wild and wailing his feet were cemented to the spot see she ordered and flung a hand down toward the ground between them it was the first charm learned the last lost though her hand trembled with the effort the fire erupted burning cold and bright he swore and would have leaped back if hed been able there was no wood there was no match just that golden ball of flame shimmering at his feet what the hell is this proof if youll take it over the flames she reached out a hand ive called to you in the night calin but you wouldnt hear me but you know me you know my face my mind my heart can you look at me and deny it no his throat was dustdry his temples throbbing no i cant but i dont want this her hand fell to her side the fire vanished i cant make you want i can only make you see she swayed suddenly surprising them both hey he caught her as her legs buckled im just tired she struggled to find her pride at least to pull back from him just tired thats all shed gone deathly pale he noted and she felt as limp as if every bone in her body had melted this is crazy this whole thing is insane im probably just having another hallucination but he swept her up into his arms and carried her down the circle of stone steps and away from the castle of secrets chapter contents prev next brandy he muttered shouldering open the door to the cottage the cat slipped in like smoke and led the way down the short hall whiskey something no though the weakness still fluttered through her she shook her head im better now truly the hell you are she felt fragile enough to dissolve in his arms have you got a doctor around here i dont need a doctor the idea of it made her chuckle a little i have what i need in the kitchen he turned his head met her eyes potions witchs brews if you like unable to resist she wound her arms around his neck will you carry me in calin though id prefer it if you carried me upstairs took me to bed her mouth was close to his already softly parted in invitation he felt his muscles quiver if he was caught in a dream he mused it involved all of the senses and was more vivid than any hed had in childhood i didnt know irish women were so aggressive i might have visited here sooner ive waited a long time i have needs as anyone deliberately he turned away from the steps and started down the hall so witches like sex that chuckle came again throaty and rich oh aye were fond of it i could give you more than an ordinary woman more than you could dream he remembered the jolt of that staggering kiss of welcome and didnt doubt her word he made a point of dropping her abruptly on one of the two ladderback chairs at a scrubbed wooden table in the tiny kitchen i dream real good he said and she smiled silkily that i know the air hummed between them before she eased back tidily folded her hands on the table theres a blue bottle in the cupboard there over the stove would you mind fetching it for me and a glass as well he opened the door she indicated found the cupboard neatly lined with bottles of all colors and shapes all were filled with liquids and powders and none were labeled which one of these did you put in my tea now she sighed heavily cal i put nothing in your tea but the whiskey i gave you sleep a small spell and a harmless one because you needed it two hours only and did you not wake feeling well and rested he scowled at the bottles refusing to argue the point which blue one the cobalt bottle with the long neck he set the bottle and a short glass on the table drugs are dangerous she poured a careful two fingers of liquid as blue as the bottle that held it tis herbs her eyes flickered up to his laughed and a touch or two of magic this is for energy and strength she sipped with apparent enjoyment will you be sitting down calin you could use a meal and it should be ready by now hed already felt his stomach yearn at the scents filling the room puffing out of the steam from a pot on the stove what is it craibechan she smiled as his brows drew together a kind of soup she explained its hearty and your appetites been off youve lost more than a pound or two in recent weeks and i feel the blame for that wanting to see just what craibechan consisted off and make sure there was no eye of newt or tongue of frog in the mix he had started to reach for the lid on the pot now he drew back faced her he was going to make one vital point perfectly clear i dont believe in witches a glint of amusement was in her eyes as she pushed back from the table well set to working on that soon enough but im willing to consider some sort of i dont know psychic connection thats a beginning then she took out a loaf of brown bread set it in the oven to warm would you have wine with your meal theres a bottle you could open ive chilled it a bit she opened the refrigerator took out a bottle he accepted it studied the label it was his favorite bourdeax a wine that he preferred chilled just a bit considering he took the corkscrew she offered the obsessedfan theory just didnt hold he decided as he set the open bottle on the slategray counter to breathe no matter how much information she might have dug up about him she couldnt have predicted he would come to ireland and certainly not to this place he would accept the oddity of a connection what else could he call it it had been her voice echoing through his dreams her face floating through the mists of his memory and it had been his hands on the wheel of the car hed driven up to this place to her it was time he thought to discover more about her bryna she paused in the act of spooning stew into thick white bowls aye how long have you lived here alone like this the last five years ive been alone it was part of the pattern the wineglasses are to the right of you there how old are you he took down two crystal glasses poured bloodred wine twentysix four years less than you she set the bowls on the table took one of the glasses my first memory of you this time was of you riding a horse made out of a broom around a parlor with blue curtains a little black dog chased you you called him hero she took a sip from her glass set it down then turned to take the warmed bread from the oven and when he died fifteen years later on a hot summer day you buried him in the backyard and your parents helped you plant a rosebush over his grave all of you wept for hed been very dear neither you nor your parents have had a pet since you dont think you have the heart to lose one again he let out a long uneasy breath took a deep gulp of wine none of that information none of it was in his official bio and certainly none of the emotions were public fare where is your family oh here and there she bent to give hecate an affectionate scratch between the ears its difficult for them just now theres nothing they can do to help but i feel them close and thats comfort enough so your parents are witches too she heard the amusement in his voice and bristled im a hereditary witch my power and my gift runs through the blood generation to generation its not an avocation i have calin nor is it a hobby or a game it is my destiny my legacy and my pride and dont be insulting me when youre about to eat my food she tossed her head and sat down he scratched his chin yes maam he sat across from her sniffed at the bowl smells great he spooned up some sampled felt the spicy warmth of it spread through his system tastes even better dont flatter me either youre hungry enough to eat a plate of raw horsemeat got me there he dug in with relish so any eye of newt in here her eyes kindled very funny i thought so it was either take the situation with humor or run screaming he decided anyway what do you do up here alone no he realized he wasnt sure he wanted to know that i mean what do you do for a living it was no use being annoyed with him she told herself no use at all youre meaning to make money well thats a necessary thing she passed him the bread and salt butter i weave and sell my wares sweaters rugs blankets throws and the like its a soothing art and a solitary one it gives me independence the rugs in the other room your work they are yes theyre beautiful color texture workmanship remembering the spinning wheel he blinked are you telling me you spin your own wool its an old and venerable art one i enjoy most of the women he knew couldnt even sew on a button hed never held the lack of domesticity against anyone but he found the surplus of it intriguing in bryna i wouldnt think a witch would well id think shed just you know poof proof her brows arched high saying if i wanted a pot of gold id just whistle up the wind and coins would drop into my hands she leaned forward annoyance spiked her voice tell me why you use that camera with all the buttons and business when they make those tidy little things that all but think for you and snap the picture themselves its hardly worthwhile if you automate the whole process if its to mean anything i have to be involved in control do the planning out see the picture he trailed off catching her slow and smug smile okay i get it if you could just snap your fingers it wouldnt be art it wouldnt and more its a pledge you see not to abuse a gift or take it for granted and most vital never to use power to harm you nearly believe me calin stunned that she was right he jerked back just making conversation he muttered then rose to refill his empty bowl the cat trailing him like a hopeful shadow whens the last time you were in the states ive never been to america she picked up her wine after he topped it off it wasnt permitted for me to contact you facetoface until you came here it wasnt permitted for you to come until one month before the millennium passed cal drummed his fingers on the table she sure knew how to stick to a story so its a month to the anniversary of the spell casting no its on the solstice tomorrow night she picked up her wine again but only turned the stem around and around in her fingers cutting it close arent you you didnt want to hear me and i waited too long it was pride i was wanting you to call to me just once defeated by her own heart she closed her eyes like some foolish teenage girl waiting by the phone for her boy to call her youd hurt me when you turned away from me her eyes opened again pinned him with the sharp edge of her unhappiness why did you turn from me calin why did you stop answering stop hearing he couldnt deny it he was here and so was she hed been pulled to her and no matter how he struggled to refuse it he could remember the soft voice the plea in it and those eyes so incredibly blue with that same deep hurt glowing in them it was he realized accept this or accept insanity because i didnt want to answer and i didnt want to be here his voice roughened as he shoved the bowl aside i wanted to be normal so you rejected me and the gift youd been given for what you see as normality do you know what its like to be different to be odd he tossed back furiously then he hissed through his teeth i suppose you do he muttered but i hated it hated seeing how it worried my parents it wasnt meant to be a burden but a joy it was part of her part of me that was passed to you calin that small gift of sight to protect you not to threaten i didnt want it he shoved back from the table where are my rights in all this wheres my choice she wanted to weep for him for the small boy who hadnt understood that his uniqueness had been a loving gift and for the man who would reject it still the choice has always been yours fine i dont want any of this and me calin she rose as well slowly pride in the set of her shoulders the set of her head do you not want me as well no it was a lie and it burned on his tongue i dont want you he heard the laughter a nasty buzz on the air hecate hissed arched her back then growled out a warning cal saw fear leap into brynas eyes even as she whirled and flung herself in front of him like a shield no her voice boomed power and authority you are not welcome here you have no right here the shadows in the doorway swirled coalesced formed into a man he wore sorcerers black piped with silver on a slender frame a face as handsome as a fairytale prince was framed with golden hair and accented with eyes as black as midnight bryna your time is short his voice was smooth laced with dark amusement there is no need for this war between us i offer you such power such a world youve only to take my hand accept do you think i would that a thousand years or ten thousand would change my heart doomed you are alasdair and the choice was your own the waits nearly at an end alasdair lifted a hand and thunder crashed overhead like swords meeting send him away and i will allow it my word to you bryna send him away and he goes unharmed by me if he stays his end will be as it was before and i will have you bryna unbound or in chains that choice is your own she lifted a hand and light glinted off her ring of carved silver come into my circle now alasdair her lips curved in a sultry dare though her heart was pounding in terror for she was not ready to meet him power to power do you risk it his lips thinned in a sneer his dark eyes glittering with malicious promise on the solstice bryna his gaze flickered to cal amusement shining dark you warrior remember death there was pain bright and sharp and sudden stabbing into cals belly it burned through him like acid cutting off his breath weakening his knees even as he gripped brynas shoulders and shoved her behind him touch her and die he felt the words rise in his throat heard them come through his lips he felt the sweat pearl cold and clammy on his brow as he faced down the image and so it faded leaving only a dark glint like a smudge and an echo of taunting laughter chapter contents prev next cal pressed a hand to his stomach half expecting to find blood and worse dripping through his fingers the pain had dulled to numbness with a slick echo of agony he cant harm you brynas voice registered dimly made him aware that he was still gripping her arm he can only make you remember deceive you with the pain its all tricks and lies with him i saw him dazed cal studied his own fingers i saw it aye hes stronger than id believed and more rash to come here like this gently she put a hand over the one bruising her arm alasdair is sly and full of lies you must remember that calin you must never forget it i saw him cal repeated struggling to absorb the impossible into reality i could see through him the table in the hall the flowers on it he wouldnt dare risk coming here in full form not as yet calin youre hurting my arm his fingers jerked dropped sorry i lost my head seeing ghosts does that to me a ghost he isnt but a witch one who embraced the dark and closed out the light one who broke every oath is he a man he whirled on her so abruptly that she caught her breath then winced as his hands gripped her arms again he looked at you as a man would with desire were not spirits we have our needs our weaknesses he wants me yes he has broken into my dreams and shown me just what he wants from me and rape in dreams is no less a rape she trembled and her eyes went blind for a moment she was only a woman with a womans fears he frightens me is that enough for you is it enough that id rather die than have his hands on me he frightens me she said again and pressed her face into cals shoulder oh calin his hands are cold so cold he wont touch you the need to protect was too strong to deny his arms tightened brought her close he wont touch you bryna his lips brushed over her hair down her temple found hers bryna he said again sweet god she melted into him yielding like wax giving like glory all the confusion the doubt the fear slid away from him here was the woman the only the ever his hands dived into her hair fisted in those soft ropes of red silk pulled her head back so that he could drive the kiss deeper whatever had brought him here he would face whatever else he might continue to deny there was no denying this need could be stronger than reason the sounds humming in her throat were both plea and seduction her heart hammered fast and hard against his and her body shuddered lightly she nipped at his lip urging him on he heard her sigh his name moan it then whisper words ripe with longing the words were in gaelic and that was what stopped him he understood them as if hed been speaking the language all his life love she had said my love is this the answer the fury returned as he pushed her back against the wall is this what you want now his kiss tasted of violence of desperation nearly of punishment her own fears sprang hot to her throat taunting her to fight him to reject the anger but she offered no struggle took the heat the rough hands until he drew back and stared at her out of stormy eyes she took a steadying breath waited until she was sure her voice would be strong and sure its one answer yes i want you slowly she unfastened the buttons running down the front of her dress i want you to touch me to take me parted the material let it slide to the floor so that she stood before him defenseless and naked where you like when you like how you like he kept his eyes on hers you said that to me before once before emotions swirling she closed her eyes then opened them again and smiled i did a thousand years ago more or less he remembered she had stood facing him flowers blooming at her feet and she had undraped herself so that the pearly light had gleamed on her skin she had offered herself without restrictions hed lost himself in her flowers crushed and fragrant under their eager bodies he shook his head and the image faded away memory or imagination it no longer mattered he knew only one vital thing this is now this is you and me nothing else touches it whatever happened or didnt happen before this is for us he scooped her into his arms thats the way i want it he stated she stared at him for she was spellbound now shed thought he would simply take her where they stood seeking release even oblivion shed tasted the sharp edge of his passion felt the violence simmering under his skin instead he carried her in his arms as if she were something he could cherish and when he laid her on the bed stepped back to look at her she felt a flush warm her cheeks she managed a quick smile youll be needing your clothes off she said tried to laugh and sit up but he touched a hand to her shoulder ill do it lie back bryna i want to see you with your hair burning over the pillows and the sun on your skin he would photograph her like this he realized would be compelled to see if he could capture the magic of it of her long limbs slender curves eyes full of needs and nerves he watched her as he undressed and his voice was quiet and serious when he spoke are you afraid of me i wasnt i didnt expect to be but her heart was fluttering like birds wings i suppose i am yes a little because it means everything he tossed his clothes toward the little chair never taking his eyes from hers i dont know what i believe what i can accept except one thing he lowered himself to her kept his mouth a whisper from hers this matters here now you it matters love me she drew his mouth down to hers ive ached for you so long it was slow and testing and sweet sighs and secrets tastes and textures he knew how her mouth would fit against his knew the erotic slide of her tongue the suggestive arch of her hips he swallowed each catchy breath as he took his hands slowly so slowly over her skimming curves warming flesh he filled his hands with her breasts then his mouth teasing her nipples with tongue and teeth until she groaned out his name like a prayer she took her hands over him testing those muscles tracing the small scars not a warriors body but a mans she thought and for now hers her heart beat slow and thick as he used his mouth on her with a patience and concentration she knew now shed been foolish not to expect her heart beat thickly the sun warmed her closed lids as pleasure swamped her and love held so long in her heart bloomed like wild roses calin his name shuddered through her lips when he cupped her he watched her eyes fly open saw the deepblue irises go glassy and blind in speechless arousal he sent her over the edge viciously delighted when she cried out shuddered when her hands fell weakly his was all he could think as he blazed a hot trail down her thigh his his blood thundered in his head as he slipped inside her as she moaned in pleasure arched in welcome now her eyes were open vivid blue and intense now her arms were around him a circle of possession she mated with him their rhythm ancient and sure his strokes went deep deeper and his mouth crushed down on hers in breathless mutual pleasure she flew as she had waited a lifetime to fly as he emptied himself into her she held him close as the tension drained from his body stroked his hair as he rested his head between her breasts its new she said quietly ours i didnt know it could be knowing so much yet this i never knew he shifted lifted his head so that he could see her face her skin was soft dewy her eyes slumberous her mouth rosy and swollen none of this should be possible he cupped a hand under her chin turned her profile just slightly already seeing it in frame in just that light black and white and he would title it aftermath im probably having a breakdown her laugh was a quick silly snort carefree careless well your engine seemed to be running fine calin if youre after asking me his mouth twitched in response were pushing into the twentyfirst century i have a fax built into my car phone a computer in my office that does everything but make my bed and im supposed to believe ive just made love to a witch a witch who makes fire burn out of thin air calls up winds where there isnt a breeze in sight she combed her fingers through his hair as shed dreamed of doing countless times magic and technology arent mutually exclusive its only that the second so rarely takes the first into account normality is only in the perspective she watched his eyes cloud at that you had visions calin as a child you had them and i put away childish things visions childish her eyes snapped once then she closed them on a sigh why must you think so a childs mind and heart are perhaps more open to such matters but you saw and you felt and you knew things that others didnt it was a gift you were given im no witch no that only makes the gift more special calin no he sat up shaking his head its too much let it be for a while i dont know what i feel he scrubbed his hands over his face into his hair all i know is that here was where i had to be and youre who i had to be with let the rest alone for a while they had so little time she nearly said it before she stopped herself if time was so short then what they had was precious if she was damned for taking it for only the two of them then she was damned then let it rest we will she lay back stretched out a hand for his come kiss me again come lie with me he skimmed a hand up her thigh watched her smile bloom slow and the light oh the light stay right there he bounded out of bed grabbing his jeans on the run she blinked what where are you going be right back dont move stay right there she huffed out a breath at the ceiling then her face softened again and she stretched her arms high oh she felt well loved like a cat thoroughly stroked chuckling she glanced over at hecate curled in front of the hearth and watching her aye you know the feeling dont you well i like it the cat only stared unblinking ten seconds twenty bryna closed her eyes i need the time damn it we need it a few hours after so many years why should we be denied it why must there be a price for every joy go then leave me be if the fare comes due ill pay it freely with a swish of her tail the cat rose and padded out of the room calins footsteps sounded on the steps seconds later prepared to smile bryna widened her eyes instead hed snapped two quick pictures before she could push herself up and cross her arms over her breast what do you think youre about taking photographs of me without my clothes put it away you wont be hanging me on some art gallery wall youre beautiful he circled the bed changing angles a masterpiece drop your left shoulder just a little ill do no such thing its outrageous shocked to the core she tugged at the rumpled spread pulled it up and to cals mind succeeded only in looking more alluring and rumpled but he lowered the camera i thought witches were supposed to like to dance naked under the full moon going skyclad isnt an exhibition and theres a time and place for such things no one snaps pictures of private matters nor of rituals bryna using all his charm he stepped closer tugged gently at the sheet shed pulled over her breasts you have a beautiful body your coloring is exquisite and the light in here is perfect unbelievable he skimmed the back of his fingers over her nipple felt her tremble ill show them to you first she barely felt the sheet slip to her waist i know what i look like you dont know how i see you but ill show you lie back for me relax murmuring he spread her hair over the pillows as he wanted it no dont cover yourself just look at me he shot straight down then moved back turn your head just a little im touching you imagine my hands on you moving over you there and there he braced a knee on the foot of the bed working quickly if i had a darkroom handy id develop these tonight and youd see what i see i have one her voice was breathless aroused what i had one put in for you off the kitchen her smile was hesitant when he lowered the camera and stared at her i knew you would come and i wanted you to have what you needed what would make you comfortable so you would stay with me she thought but didnt say it you put in a darkroom here aye i did with a laugh he shook his head amazing absolutely amazing rising he set the camera down on the bureau i think you need to be a little more mussed before i shoot the rest of that roll he climbed onto the bed the things i do for my art he murmured and covered her laughing mouth with his chapter contents prev next later in the breezy evening when the sun gilded the sky and polished the air he walked with her toward the cliffs both his mind and his body were relaxed limber logically he knew he should be racing to the nearest psychiatric ward for a full workup but a lonely cliffside a ruined castle a beautiful woman who claimed to be a witch visions and sex and legends it was a time and place to set logic aside at least for a while its a beautiful country he commented im still trying to adjust that ive only been here since this morning barely twelve hours your hearts been here longer it was so simple to walk with him fingers linked so simple so ordinary so miraculous tell me about new york all the movies the pictures ive seen have only made me wonder more is it like that really so fast and crowded and exciting it can be and at that moment it seemed a world away a thousand years away and your house its an apartment it looks out over the park i wanted a big space so i could have my studio right there its got good light you like to stand on the balcony she began then rolled her eyes when he shot her a quick look ive peeked now and then peeked he caught her chin in his hand before she could turn away at what exactly i wanted to see how you lived how you worked she eased away and walked along the rocks where the water spewed up showered like diamonds in the sunlight then she turned her head tilting it in an eerily feline movement youve had a lot of women calin farrell coming and going at all hours in all manner of dress and undress he hunched his shoulders as if he had an itch he couldnt scratch you watched me with other women i peeked she corrected primly and never watched for long in any case but it seemed to me that you often chose women who were lacking in the area of intelligence he ran his tongue around his teeth did it well a shrug dismissing well so it seemed bending she plucked a wildflower that had forced its way through a split in the rock twirled it gaily under her nose is it worrying you that i know of them he hooked his thumbs in his pockets not particularly thats fine then now if i were the vindictive sort i might turn you into an ass just for a short time an ass just for a short time can you do that sort of thing he realized when he asked it that he was ready to believe anything she laughed the sound carrying rich music over wind and sea if i were the vindictive sort she walked to him handed him the flower then smiled when he tucked it into her hair but i think youd look darling with long ears and a tail id just as soon keep my anatomy as it is what else did you peek at oh this and that here and there she linked her fingers with his and walked again i watched you work in your darkroom the little one in the house where you grew up your parents were so proud of you startled by your talent but very proud i saw your first exhibition at that odd wee gallery where everyone wore black like at a wake soho he murmured christ that was nearly ten years ago youve done brilliant things since i could look through your eyes when i looked at your pictures and felt close to you the thought came abruptly stunning him he turned her quickly to face him stared hard into her eyes you didnt have anything to do with you havent made what i can do oh calin no she lifted her hands to cover the ones on her shoulders no i promise you its yours from you you mustnt doubt it she said sensing that he did i can tell you nothing that isnt true im bound by that on my oath everything youve accomplished is yours alone all right he rubbed his hands up and down her arms absently youre shivering are you cold i was for a moment bonedeep harrowing alasdair she cast it out gripped his hand tightly and led him over the gentle slope of the hill even as a child i would come here and stand and look out content again she leaned her head against his shoulder scanning hill and valley the bright flash of river the dark shadows cast by twisted trees to ireland spread out before me green and gold a dreaming place ireland or this spot both were proud of our dreamers here i would show you ireland calin the bank where the columbine grows the pub where a story is always waiting to be told the narrow lane flanked close with hedges that bloom with red fuchsia the simple ireland tossing her hair back she turned to him and more i would show you more the circle of stones where power sleeps the quiet hillock where the faeries dance of an evening the high cliff where a wizard once ruled i would give it to you if youd take it and what would you take in return bryna thats for you to say she felt the chill again the warning now i have something else to show you calin she glanced uneasily over her shoulder toward the ruins shivered hes close she whispered and watching come into the house he held her back he was beginning to see that he had run from a good many things in his life too many things isnt it better to face him now be done with it you cant choose the time its already set she gripped his hand pulled please into the house reluctantly cal went with her look bryna it seems to me that a bullys a bully whatever else he might be the longer you duck a bully the worse he gets believe me ive dealt with my share oh aye and had a fine bloody nose as i remember from one the two of you pounding on each other on the street corner like hoodlums hey he started it he tried to shake me down once too often so i cal trailed off blew out a long breath whoa too weird i havent thought about henry belinski in twenty years anyway he may have bloodied my nose but i broke his oh and youre proud of that are you now breaking the nose of an eightyearold boy i was eight too he realized that she had maneuvered him neatly into the house turned the subject and gotten her own way very clever bryna i dont see that you need magic when you can twist a conversation around like that just a small talent she smiled and touched his cheek i was glad you broke his nose i wanted to turn him into a toad i had already started the charm when you dealt with it yourself a toad he couldnt help it the grin just popped out really it would have been wrong but i was only four and such things are forgiven in the child then her smile faded and her eyes went dark alasdair is no child calin he wants more than to wound your pride skin your knees dont take him lightly then she stepped back lifting both hands i call the wind around my house to swirl she twisted a wrist and brought the wind howling against the windows fists of fog against my windows curl deafen his ears and blind his eyes come aid me with this disguise help me guard what was trusted to me as i will so mote it be hed stepped back from her gaping fog crawled over the windows the wind howled like wolves the woman before him glowed like a candle shimmering with a power he couldnt understand the fire shed made out of air was nothing compared with this how much am i supposed to believe accept she lowered her hands slowly only what you will the choice will always be yours calin will you come with me and see what i would show you fine he blew out a breath and after if you dont mind id like a glass of that irish of yours straight up she managed a small smile then youll have it come as she started toward the stairs she chose her words carefully we have little time hell work to break the spell his pride will demand it and my powers are more limited than they were why its part of it was all she would say and so is what i have to show you it isnt just me he wants you see he wants everything i have and he wants the most precious treasure of the castle of secrets she stopped in front of a door thick with carving there was no knob no lock just glossy wood and that ornate pattern on it that resembled ancient writing this room is barred to him by power greater than mine she passed a hand over the wood and slowly soundlessly the door crept open open locks cal murmured whoever knocks no only i and now you she stepped inside and after a brief hesitation he crossed the threshold behind her instantly the room filled with the light of a hundred candles their flames burned straight and true illuminating a small windowless chamber the walls were wood thickly carved like the door the ceiling low nearly brushing the top of his head a humble place for such a thing bryna murmured he saw nothing but a simple wooden pedestal standing in a white circle in the center of the room atop the column was a globe clear as glass a crystal ball saying nothing she crossed the room come closer she waited kept her hands at her side until hed walked up and put the globe between them alasdair lusts for me envies you and covets this for all his power for all his trickery he has never gained what he craves the most this has been guarded by a member of my blood since before time believe me calin wizards walked this land while men without vision still huddled in caves fearing the night and this ancient ball was conjured by one of my blood and passed down generation to generation bryna the wise held this in her hands a thousand years past and through her power and her love concealed it from alasdair at the last and so it remained hidden no one outside my blood has cast eyes on it since gently she lifted the globe from its perch raised it high above her head candlelight flickered over it into it seemed to trap itself inside until the ball burned bright when she lowered it it glowed still colors dazzling pulsing beating look my love bryna opened her hand so that the globe rolled to her fingertips clung there in defiance of gravity look and see he couldnt stop his hands from reaching out cupping it its surface was smooth almost silky and warmed in his hands like flesh the pulse of it the life of it seemed to swim up his arms colors shifted the bright clouds they formed parted a magic sea he saw dragons spewing fire and a silver sword cleaving through scales a man bedding a woman in a flowerstrewn meadow under a bright white sun a farmer plowing a rocky field behind swaybacked horses a babe suckling at his mothers breast on and on it went image after image in a blur of life dark oceans wild stars a quiet village as still as a photograph an old womans face ravaged with tears a small boy sleeping under the shade of a chestnut tree and even when the images faded into color and light the power sang it flooded him a river of wine cool and clean it hummed still when the globe was clear again tossing the flames of the candles into his eyes its the world cals voice was soft and thick here in my hands the heart of it the hope for it power gleams there in your hands now why he lifted his gaze to hers why in my hands bryna i am the guardian of this place my heart is in there as well she took a slow breath i am in your hands calin farrell i can refuse aye the choice is yours and if he alasdair claims this she would stop him it would cost her life but she would stop him power can be twisted abused but what is used will turn on the abuser ten times ten and if he claims you i will be bound to him a thousand years of bondage a spell that cannot be broken but with death she thought only with death he is wicked but not without weaknesses she laid her hand on the globe so that they held it together he will not have this calin nor will he bring harm to you that is my oath she stared hard into his eyes murmuring his vision blurred his head spun he lifted a hand as if to push back what he couldnt see no to protect she laid a hand on his cheek as she cast the charm my love he blinked shook his head for a moment his mind remained blank with some faint echo of words im sorry what her lips curved he would remember nothing she knew it was all she could do for him i said we need to go she placed the globe back on the pedestal were not to speak of this outside this room she walked toward the door held out a hand come ill pour you that whiskey chapter contents prev next that night his dreams were restful lovely bryna had seen to that there was a man astride a gleaming black horse riding hard over hills splashing through a bright slash of river his gray cape billowing in a brisk and icy wind there was the witch who waited for him in a silver castle atop a spearing cliff where candles and torches burned gold there was a globe of crystal clear as water where the world swam from decade to decade century past century there was love sweet as honey and need sharp as honed steel and when he turned to her in the night lost in dreams she opened for him took him in bryna didnt sleep nor did she dream she lay in the circle of his arms while the white moon rose and the shudders his hands had caused quieted who had loved her she wondered cal or caelan she turned her face into his shoulder seeking comfort a harbor from fear on this last night before she would face her fate he would be safe she thought laying a hand over his heart she had taken great pains at great risk to assure it and her safety depended on the heart that beat quietly under her palm if he did not choose to give it freely to stand with her linked by love she was lost so it had been ordained in fire and in blood on that terrible night a millennium before for a thousand years we sleep a hundred years times ten but blood stays true and hearts are strong when we are born again and in this place we meet with love our lifted shield in the shortest night the battle will rage and our destiny be revealed my warriors heart his gift to me his sword bright as the moon if he brings both here of his own free will we will bring to alasdair his doom when the dawn breaks that longest day and his love has found a way our lives will then be free of thee as i will so mote it be the words of bryna the wise lifted high the blazing castle walls echoed in her head beat in her heart when the moon rose again it would be settled bryna lay in the circle of cals arms listened to the wind whisper and slept not at all when cal woke he was alone and the sun was streaming for a moment he thought it had all been a dream the woman the witch the ruined castle and tiny cottage the globe that held the world a hallucination brought on he thought by fatigue and stress and the breakdown hed secretly worried about but he recognized the room the flowers still fresh in the vases the scent of them and bryna on the air true then he pressed his fingers to his eyes to rub away sleep all true and all unbelievable and all somehow wonderful he got out of bed walked into the charming little bathroom stepped into the clawfoot tub and twitched the circling curtain into place he adjusted the shower for hot and let the steam rise he hadnt showered with her yet cal thought grinning as he turned his face into the spray hadnt soaped that long lovely body of hers until it was slick and slippery hadnt seen the water run through that glorious mane of flamered hair had yet to ease inside her while the water ran hot and the steam rose in clouds his grin winked off replaced by a look of puzzlement had he turned to her in the night in his dreams seeking that tangle of tongues and limbs that slow satiny slide of bodies why couldnt he remember why couldnt he be sure what did it matter annoyed with himself he flicked off the water snatched a towel from the heating rack whether it had been real or a dream she was there for him as hed wanted no one to be before was it you or another she moved under in the night cals eyes went dark as the voice whispered slyly in his head he toweled off roughly she uses you uses you to gain her own ends spellbinds you until she has what she seeks the room was suddenly airless the steam thick and clogging his lungs he reached blindly for the door found only swirling air she brought you here drew you into her web other men have been trapped in it she seeks to possess you body and soul who will you be when shes done with you cal all but fell into the door panicked for a shuddering instant when he thought it locked but his slippery hands yanked it open and he stumbled into the cool sunwashed air of the bedroom behind him the mists swirled dark shimmered greedily then vanished what the hell he found himself trembling all over like a schoolboy rushing out of a haunted house it had seemed as if there had been something something cold and slick and smelling of death crowded into that room with him hiding in the mists but when cal turned and stepped back to the door he saw only a charming room a fogged mirror and the thinning steam from his shower imagination working overtime he thought then let out half a laugh whose wouldnt under the circumstances but he shut the bathroom door firmly before he dressed and went down to find her she was spinning wool humming along with the quiet rhythmic clacking of spindle and wheel her hands were as graceful as a harpists on strings and her wool was as white as innocence her dress was blue this morning deep as her eyes a thick silver chain carrying an ornately carved pendant hung between her breasts her hair was pinned up leaving that porcelain face unframed cals hands itched for his camera and for her she looked up her hands never faltering and smiled well did you decide to join the living then my body clocks still in the states is it late hmm nearly halften youll be hungry ill wager come have your coffee ill fix your breakfast he caught her hand as she rose you dont have to cook for me she laughed kissed him lightly oh wed have trouble soon enough if you thought i did as it happens its my pleasure to cook for you this morning his eyes gleamed as he nibbled on her knuckles a full irish breakfast the works if you like now that you mention it his voice trailed off as he took a long thorough study of her face her eyes were shadowed her skin paler than it should have been you look tired you didnt sleep well she only smiled and led him into the kitchen maybe you snore i do not he nipped her at the waist spun her around and kissed her take it back i only said maybe her brows shot up when his hands roamed around cupped her bottom are you always so frisky of a morning maybe ill be friskier after ive had that coffee he gave her a quick kiss before turning to pour himself a cup you know i noticed things this morning that i was too distracted to take in yesterday you dont have a phone she put a castiron skillet on a burner i have ways of calling those i need to call ah he rubbed the chin he had neglected to shave your kitchens equipped with very modern appliances if i choose to cook why would i use a campfire she sliced thick irish bacon and put it on to sizzle and snap good point youre out of sugar he said absently when he lifted the lid on the bowl you spin your own wool but you have a stateoftheart stereo music is a comfort she murmured watching him go unerringly to the pantry and fetch the unmarked tin that held her sugar supply you make your own potions but you buy your staples at the market with quick efficiency he filled her sugar bowl the contrast is fascinating i wonder he stopped stood with the sugar scoop in his hand staring i knew where to find this he said quietly i knew the sugar was on the second shelf in the white tin the flours in the blue one beside it i knew that tis a gift youve only forgotten to block it out it shouldnt disturb you shouldnt disturb me he neglected to add the sugar and drank his coffee black and bitter its yours to control cal or to abjure so if i dont want it i can reject it youve done so for half your life already it was her tone bitter as the coffee that had his eyes narrowing that annoys you she cut potatoes into quick slices slid them into hot oil its your choice but it annoys you all right it does you turn your back on it because you find it uncomfortable because it disturbs your sense of normality as i do she kept her back to him as she took the bacon out of the pan set it to drain picked up eggs you shut out your gift and me along with it because we didnt fit into your world a tidy world where magic is only an illusion done with smoke and mirrors where witches wear black hats ride broomsticks and cackle on all hallows eve as the eggs cooked she spooned up porridge plopped the bowl on the table and went back to slice bread a world where i have no place im here arent i cal said evenly did i choose to be bryna or did you will it she uses you shes drawn you into her web will it insulted struck to the bone she whirled around to face him is that what you think after all ive told you after all weve shared if i accept even half of what youve told me if i put aside logic and my own sense of reality and accept that im standing in the kitchen with a witch a stones throw away from an enchanted castle about to do battle of some kind with an evil wizard in a war that has lasted a millennium i think its a remarkably reasonable question reasonable with clenched teeth she swept back to the stove and shoveled eggs onto a platter its reasonable says he have i pulled him in like a spider does a fly lured him across an ocean and into my lair she thumped the laden platter down and glared at him for what might i ask you calin farrell for a fine bout of sex for the amusement of having a man for a night or two well i neednt have gone to such trouble for that theres men enough in ireland eat your breakfast or youll be wearing it on your head like a hat another time he might have smiled but that sly voice was muttering in his ear still he sat picked up his fork tapped it idly against the plate you didnt answer the question if im to believe you cant lie to me isnt it odd that youve circled around the question and avoided a direct answer yes or no bryna did you will me here yes or no her eyes were burningdry though her heart was weeping did he know he was looking at her with such doubt such suspicion such cool dispassion there was no faith in the look and none of the love she needed one night she thought on a stab of despair had not been enough no calin will you here i did not if that had been my purpose or in my power would i have waited so long and so lonely for you i asked you to come begged without pride for i needed you but the choice to come or not was yours she turned away gripping the counter as she looked out the window toward the sea ill give you more she said quietly as time is short she inhaled deeply you broke my heart when you shut me out of yours broke it to pieces and its taken me years to mend it as best i could that choice was yours as well for the knowledge was there in your head and again in your heart if you chose to see it all the answers are there and you have only to look i want to hear them from you she squeezed her eyes tightly shut there are some i cant tell you that you must find for yourself she opened her eyes again lifted her chin and turned back to him her face was still pale he noted her eyes too dark the hair shed bundled up was slipping its pins and her shoulders were stiff and straight but theres something thats mine to tell and ill give you that i was born loving you theres been no other in my heart even when you turned from me everything i am or was or will be is yours i cannot change my heart i was born loving you she said again and i will die loving you there is no choice for me turning she bolted from the room chapter contents prev next shed vanished cat went after her almost immediately but found no trace he rushed through the house flinging open doors calling her then cursing her damn temperamental female he decided the fury spread through him that she would tell him she loved him then leave him before he had even a moment to examine his own heart she expected too much he thought angrily wanted too much assumed too much he hurried out of the house raced for the cliffs but he didnt find her standing out on the rocks staring out to sea with the wind billowing her hair his voice echoed back to him emptily infuriating him then he turned stared at the scarred stone walls of the castle and knew all right damn it he muttered as he strode toward the ruins were going to talk this through straight no magic no legends no bullshit just you and me he stepped toward the arch and bumped into air that had gone solid stunned he reached out felt the shield he couldnt see he could see through it to the stony ground the firescored walls the tumble of rock but the clear wall that blocked him was cold and solid what kind of game is this eyes narrowed he drove his shoulder against it yielded nothing snarling he circled the walls testing each opening finding each blocked bryna he pounded the solidified air with his fists until they ached let me in goddamn it let me pass from the topmost turret bryna faced the sea she heard him call for her curse her and oh she wanted to answer but her pride was scored her power teetering and her decision made perhaps she had made it during the sleepless night curled against him listening to him dream perhaps it had been made for her eons before she had been given only one single day with him one single night she knew accepted that if shed been given more she might have broken her faith let her fears and needs tumble out into his hands she couldnt tell him that her life even her soul was lost if by the hour of midnight his heart remained unsettled toward her unless he vowed his love accepted it without question there was no hope she had done all she could bryna turned her face to the wind let it dry the tears that she was ashamed to have shed her charge would be protected her lover spared and the secrets of this place would die with her for alasdair didnt know how strong was her will didnt know that in the amulet she wore around her neck was a powder of poison if she should fail and her love not triumph then she would end her life before she faced one of bondage with cals voice battering the air she closed her eyes lifted her arms she had only hours now to gather her forces she began the chant hundreds of feet below cal backed away panting what the hell was he doing he asked himself beating his head against a magic wall to get to a witch how had his life become a fairy tale fairy tale or not one thing was solid fact tick a woman off and she sulks go on and sulk then he shouted when youre ready to talk like civilized people let me know his mood black he stalked back to the house he needed to get out he told himself to lose himself in work for a while to let both of them cool off one day he fumed hed had one day and she expected him to turn his life around pledge his undying love the hell with that she wasnt pushing him into anything he wasnt ready for she could take her thousandyearold spell and stuff it he was a normal human being and normal human beings didnt go riding off into the sunset with witches at the drop of a hat he shoved open the bedroom door reached for his camera under it folded neatly was a gray sweater he pulled his hand back and stared that wasnt there an hour ago he muttered damn it that wasnt there gingerly he rubbed the material soft as a cloud the color of storms he remembered vaguely something about a cloak and a charm and wondered if this was brynas modernday equivalent with a shrug he peeled off his shirt and tried the sweater on it fit as though it had been made for him of course it had he realized shed spun the wool dyed it woven it shed known the length of his arms the width of his chest shed known everything about him he was tempted to yank it off toss it aside he was tired of his life and his mind being open to her when so much of hers was closed to him but as he started to remove the sweater he thought he heard her voice whispering a gift only a gift he lifted his head looked into the mirror his face was unshaven his hair wild his eyes reflecting the stormcloud color of the sweater the hell with it he muttered and snatching up his camera and case he left the house he wandered the hills for an hour ran through roll after roll of film mockingbirds sang as he clambered over stone walls into fields where cows grazed on grass as green as emeralds he saw farmers on tractors tending their land under a cloudthickened sky clothes flapping with whip snaps on the line cats dozing in dooryards and sunbeams he wandered down a narrow dirt road where the hedgerows grew tall and thick through small breaks he spotted sumptuous gardens with flowers in rainbows of achingly beautiful colors a woman with a straw hat over her red hair knelt by a flower bed tugging up weeds and singing of a soldier gone to war she smiled at him lifted her hand in a wave as he passed by he wandered near a small wood where leaves unfurled to welcome summer and a brook bubbled busily the sun was straight up the shadows short spending the morning in normal pursuits had settled his mood he thought it was time to go back see if bryna had cooled down perhaps try out the darkroom she had equipped a flash of white caught his eye and he turned then stared awestruck a huge white stag stood at the edge of the leafy shadows its blue eyes proud and wise keeping his movements slow controlled cal raised his camera then swore lightly when the stag lifted his massive head whirled with impossible speed and grace and bounded into the trees no uhuh im not missing that with a quick glance at the ruins which he had kept always just in sight cal dived into the woods he had hunted wildlife with his camera before knew how to move quietly and swiftly he followed the sounds of the stag crashing through brush a bird darted by a black bullet with a ringed neck as cal leaped over the narrow brook skidded on the damp bank and dug in for the chase sun dappled through the leaves dazzling his eyes and sweat rolled down his back annoyed he pushed the arms of the sweater up to his elbows and strained to listen now there was silence complete and absolute no breeze stirred no bird sang frustrated he shoved the hair out of his eyes his breath becoming labored in the sudden stifling heat his throat was parchmentdry and thinking of the cold clear water of the brook he backtracked the sun burned like a furnace through the sheltering leaves now it surprised him that they didnt singe and curl under the onslaught desperate for relief he pulled off the sweater laid it on the ground beside him as he knelt by the brook he reached down to cup water in his hand and pulled back a cup of coffee do you good to get away for a few days change of scene what he stared down at the mug in his hand then looked up into his mothers concerned face honey are you all right youve gone pale come sit down i mom here now he needs some water not caffeine cal saw his father set down his fishing flies and rise quickly water ran out of the kitchen faucet into a glass too much caffeine if you ask me too many late nights in the darkroom youre wearing yourself out cal he sipped water tasted it shuddered i i had a dream thats all right sylvia rubbed his shoulders everybody has dreams dont worry dont think about them we dont want you to think about them no i thought it was it wasnt wasnt like before he thought it was more than before i went to ireland he took a deep breath tried to clear his hazy brain desperately he wanted to turn rest his head against his mothers breast like a child did i go to ireland you havent been out of new york in the last two months slaving to get that exhibition ready his fathers brow creased cal saw the worry in his eyes that old baffled look of concern you need a rest boy im not going crazy of course youre not sylvia murmured it but cal caught the faint uncertainty in her voice youre just imagining things no its too real he took his mothers hand gripped it hard he needed her to believe him to trust him theres a woman bryna youve got a new girl and didnt tell us sylvia clucked her tongue thats what this is about was that relief in her voice cal wondered or doubt bryna thats an odd name isnt it john pretty though and oldfashioned shes a witch john chuckled heartily they all are son each and every one john picked up one of his fishing lures the black fly fluttered in his fingers its wings desperate for freedom dont you worry now i i need to get back you need to sleep john said toying with the fly sleep and dont give her a thought one womans the same as another shes only trying to trap you remember no the fly alive in his fathers fingers no no not his fathers hand too narrow too long his father had workingmans hands calloused honest no cal said again and as he scraped back his chair he saw cold fury light his fathers eyes sit down the hell with you calin dont you speak to your father in that tone his mothers voice was a shriek a hawks call to prey cutting through his head youre not real he was suddenly calm deadly calm i reject you he was running down a narrow road where the hedgerows towered and pressed close he was breathless his heart hammering his eyes were focused on the ruined walls of the castle high on the cliff and too far away bryna she waits for you the woman with the straw hat over her red hair looked up from her weeding and smiled sadly she always has and always will his side burned from cramping muscles gasping for air cal pressed a hand against the pain who are you she has a mother who loves her a father who fears for her do you think that those who hold magic need family less than you have hearts less fragile needs less great with a weary sigh she rose walked toward him and stepped into the break in the hedge her eyes were green he saw and filled with worry but the mouth with its serious smile was brynas you question what she is and what she is bars you from giving your heart freely knowing this and loving you she has sent you away from danger and faces the night alone sent me where how who are you shes my child the woman said and i am helpless the smile curved a little wider almost helpless look to the clearing calin farrell and take what is offered to you my daughter waits without you she dies this night dies terror gripped his belly am i too late she only shook her head and faded back into air he awoke drenched with sweat stretched out on the cool damp grass of the bank and the moon was rising in a dark sky no he stumbled to his feet found the sweater clutched in his hand i wont be too late i cant be too late he dragged the sweater over his head as he ran now the trees lashed whipped by a wind that came from nowhere and howled like a man gone mad they slashed at him twined together like mesh to block his path with gnarled branches armed with thorns he fought his way through ignored the gash that sliced through denim into flesh overhead lighting cut like a broadsword and dimmed the glow of the full white moon alasdair hate roiled up inside him fighting against the love hed only just discovered alasdair would not win if he had to die to prevent it bryna he lifted his head to the sky as it exploded with wild furious rain wait for me i love you the stag stood before him white as bone its patient eyes focused cal rushed forward as it turned and leaped into the shadows with only instinct to trust he plunged into the dark to follow the trail the ground trembled under his feet thorns ripped his clothes to tatters as he raced to keep that flash of white in sight then it was gone as he fell bleeding into a clearing where moonlight fought through the clouds to beam on a jetblack horse without hesitation calin accepted the impossible taking the reins he vaulted into the saddle his knees vising as the stallion reared and trumpeted a battle cry as he rode he heard the snap of a cloak flying and felt the hilt of a sword gripped in his own hand chapter contents prev next the castle of secrets glimmered with the light of a thousand torches its walls glinted silver and speared up toward the moon the stone floor of the great hall was smooth as marble in the center of the charmed circle cast by the ancients bryna stood in a robe of white her hair a fall of fire her eyes the blue of heated steel here she would make her stand do you call the thunder and whistle up the winds alasdair such showmanship in a swirl of smoke a sting of sulphur he appeared before her solid now his flesh as real as hers he wore the robes of crimson of blood and power his golden looks were beautiful an angels face but for the contrast of those dark damning eyes and an impressive if overdone entrance bryna said lightly though her pulse shuddered your trouble my darling is that you fail to appreciate the true delights of power contenting yourself with your womans charms and potions when worlds are at your mercy i take my oath and my gifts to heart alasdair unlike you my only oath is to myself youll belong to me bryna body and soul and you will give me what i want the most he flung up a hand so that the walls shook where is the globe beyond you alasdair where it will remain as i will she gestured sharply shot a bolt of white light into the air to land and burn at his feet a foolish gesture she knew but she needed to impress him he angled his head smiled indulgently pretty tricks the moon is rising to midnight bryna the time of waiting is ending your warrior has deserted you once again he stepped closer careful not to test the edge of the circle and his voice became soft seductive why not accept even embrace what i offer you lifetimes of power and pleasure riches beyond imagination you have only to accept to take my hand and we will rule together i want no part of your kingdom and i would rather be bedded by a snake than have your hands on me murky blue fire gleamed at his fingertips his anger taking form youve felt them on you in your dreams and youll feel them again gentle i can be or punishing but youll never feel anothers hand but mine hes lost to you bryna and you are lost to me hes safe from you she threw up her head so i have already won lifting her hands she loosed a whip of power sent him flying back be gone from this place her voice filled the great hall rang like bells or face the death of mortals he wiped a hand over his mouth furious that shed drawn first blood a battle then at his vicious cry a shadow formed at his feet and the shadow took the shape of a wolf blackpelted redeyed fangs bared with a snarl it sprang leaping toward brynas throat cal pounded up the cliff driving his mount furiously the castle glowed brilliant with light its walls tall and solid again its turrets shafts of silver that nicked the cloudchased moon with a burst of knowledge he thrust a hand inside the cloak and drew out the globe that waited there it swam red as blood fire sparks of light piercing the clouds he willed them to clear willed himself to see as he thundered higher toward the crest of the cliff visions came quickly overlapping rushing bryna weeping as she watched him sleep the dark chamber with the globe held between them and her whispering her spell you will be safe you will be free there is nothing my love you cannot ask of me follow the stag whose pelt is white if your heart is not open come not back in the night this gift and this duty i trust unto you the globe of hope and visions true live and be well and remember me not what cannot be held is best forgot what i do i do free as i will so mote it be and terror struck like a snake its fangs plunging deep into the heart for he knew what she meant to do she meant to die she wanted to live and fought fiercely she sliced the wolf cleaving its head from its body with one stroke of will and its blood was black she sent her lights blazing the burning cold that would scorch the flesh and freeze the bone and knew she would lose when midnight rang alasdairs robes smoked from the violence of her power and still he could not break the circle and claim her he sent the ground heaving under her feet watched her sway then fall to her knees and his smile bloomed dark when her head fell weakly and that fiery curtain of hair rained over the shuddering stones will you ask for pain bryna he stepped closer felt the hot licks when his soft boots skimmed the verge of the circle not yet he warned himself inching back but soon her spell was waning just take my hand spare yourself we will forget this battle and rule give me your hand and give me the globe her breath was short and shallow she whispered words in the old tongue the secrets of magic incantations that flickered weakly as her power slipped like water through her fingers i will not yield you will he inched closer again pleased when he met with only faint resistance you have no choice the charm was cast the time has come you belong to me now he reached down and her shoulder burned where his fingers brushed i belong to calin she gripped the amulet steeling herself then flipped its poison chamber open with her thumb she whipped her head up and with a last show of defiance smiled you will never have what is his she brought the amulet to her lips prepared to take the powder the horse and rider burst into the torchlight in a flurry of black stormgray and bright steel would you rather die than trust me cal demanded furiously the amulet slipped through her fingers the powder sifted onto the stones calin touch her alasdair cal controlled the restless horse as if hed been born astride one and ill cut off your hands at the wrists though there was alarm and there was shock alasdair straightened slowly he would not lose now the woman was already defeated he calculated and the man was after all only a foolish mortal you were a warrior a thousand years ago caelan of farrell you are no warrior tonight cal vaulted from the horse and his sword sang as he pulled it from its scabbard try me unexpected little flicks of fear twisted in alasdairs belly but he circled his opponent already plotting i will bring such fury raining down on your head he crossed his arms over his chest then flung them to the side black balls of lightning shot out hissing trails of snaking sparks instinctively cal raised the sword pain and power shot up his arm as the charges struck careened away and crashed smoking into stone do you think such pitiful weapons can defend against a power such as mine arrogance and rage rang in alasdairs voice as he hurled arrows of flame his cry echoed monstrously as the arrows struck cals cloak and melted into water your power is nothing here bryna was on her feet again her white robe swirling like foam and her face so glowed with beauty that both men stared in wonder i am the guardian of this place her voice was deeper fuller as if a thousand voices joined it i am a witch whose power flows clean i am a woman whose heart is bespoken i am the keeper of all you will never own fear me alasdair and fear the warrior who stands with me he will not stand with you and what you guard i will destroy with fists clenched he called the flames shot the torches from their homes to wheel and burn and scorch the air you will bow yet to my will with lifted arms bryna brought the rain streaming pure and cool through the flames to douse them and felt as the damp air swirled the power pour through her from her as rich and potent as any shed known save this place alasdair warned and lose the man he whirled on cal sneered at the lifted sword remember death like a blade sliced through the belly the agony struck blood flowed through his numbed fingers and the sword clattered onto the wet stone he saw his death leaping like a beast and heard brynas scream of fear and rage you will not harm him its trickery only calin hear me but her terror for him was so blinding that she ran to him leaving the charm of the circle the bolt of energy slapped her like a jagged fist sent her reeling crumbling paralyzed she fought for her strength but found the power that had flowed so pure and true now only an ebbing flicker calin the hand shed flung out to shield him refused to move she could only watch as he knelt on the stones unarmed bleeding beyond her reach you must believe she whispered trust believe or all is lost he loses faith you lose your power robes singed and smoking alasdair stood over her he is weak and blind and you have proven yourself more woman than witch to trade your power for his life reaching down he grabbed her hair and dragged her roughly to her knees you have nothing left he said to her give me the globe come to me freely and i will spare you from pain you will have neither she gripped the amulet despairing that its chamber was empty she bit off a cry as icy fingers squeezed viciously around her heart from this time and this place you are in bondage to me for a hundred years times ten and this pain you feel will be yours to keep until you bend your will to mine he lowered his gaze to her mouth a kiss he said to seal the spell she was wrenched out of his arms her fingers locked with cals even as she whispered his name he stepped in front of her raised the sword in both hands so that it shimmered silver and sharp your day is done cals eyes burned and the pain swirling through him only added to his strength can you bleed wizard he demanded and brought the sword down like fury there was a cry ululating inhuman a stench of sulphur a blinding flash the ground heaved the stones shook and lightning cold and blue speared out of the air and struck the explosion lifted him off his feet even as he grabbed for bryna cal felt the hot greedy hand of it hurl him into the whirling air into the dark chapter contents prev visions played through his head too many to count voices hummed and murmured women wept charms were chanted he swam through them weighed down with weariness someone told him to sleep to be easy but he shook off the words and the phantom hands that stroked his brow he had slept long enough he came to groggy aching in every bone the thin light of predawn filtered the air he thought he heard whispering but decided it was just the beat of the sea and the flow of the wind through grass he could see the last of the stars just winking out and with a moan he turned his head and tried to shake off the dream the cat was watching him sitting patiently her eyes unblinking dazed he pushed himself up on his elbows wincing from the pain and saw that he was lying on the ground outside the ruins gone were the tall silver spears the glowing torches that had lighted the great hall it was as it had been when hed first seen it a remnant of what it once had been a place where the wind wound about and the grass and wildflowers forced their way through stony ground but the scent of smoke and blood still stung the air bryna panicked he heaved himself to his feet and nearly stumbled over her she was sprawled on the ground one arm outflung her face was pale bruised her white robe torn and scorched he fell to his knees terrified that he would find no pulse no spark of life but he found it beating in her throat and shuddering with relief he lowered his lips to hers bryna he said again bryna she stirred her lashes fluttering her lips moving against his calin you came back you fought for me you should have known i would he lifted her so that he could cradle her against him resting a cheek on her hair how could you have kept it from me how could you have sent me away i did what i thought best when it came to facing it i couldnt risk you he hurt you he squeezed his eyes tight as he remembered how shed leaped from safety and been struck down small hurts soon over she turned laid her hands on his face there were bruises there as well cuts and burns here gently she passed her hands over them took them away her face knit in concentration she knelt and stroked her fingers over his body skimming where the cloak hadnt shielded until every wound was gone there no pain she murmured no more youre hurt he lifted her as he rose its a different matter to heal oneself i have what i need in the cupboard in the kitchen we werent alone here after no oh she was so weary so very weary family watches over the white bottle she told him as he carried her through the kitchen door and sat her at the table the square one and the small green one with the round stopper you have explaining to do bryna he set the bottles on the table fetched her a glass when youre stronger yes weve things to discuss with an expert hand an experienced eye she mixed the potions into the glass let them swirl and merge until the liquid went clear as plain water but would you mind calin id like a bath and a change of clothes first conjure it he snapped i want this settled i would do that but i prefer the indulgence ill ask you for an hour she rose cupping the glass in both hands its only an hour calin after all one thing he put a hand on her arm you told me you couldnt lie to me that it was forbidden and never did i lie to you but i came close to the line with omission one hour she said on a sigh that weakened him please he let her go and tried to soothe his impatience by brewing tea his cloak was gone he noted and the sweater shed woven for him stank of smoke and blood he stripped it off tossed it over the back of a chair then glanced down as the cat came slinking into the room so how do i handle her now cal cocked his head studied those bland blue eyes any suggestions youd be her familiar wouldnt you just how familiar are you content with the cat for company he crouched down and stroked the silky black fur are you a shapeshifter too he tilted the cats head up with a finger under the chin those eyes looked at me from out of the face of a white stag letting out a breath he simply sat on the floor let the cat step into his lap and knead let me tell you something hecate if a twoheaded dragon walked up and knocked on the kitchen door i wouldnt blink an eye nothing is ever going to surprise me again but he was wrong about that he was stunned with surprise when bryna came downstairs again she was as hed seen her the night before when her power had glowed in her face striking it with impossible beauty you were beautiful before he managed but now is this real everythings real she smiled took his hand would you walk with me cal im wanting the air and the sun i have questions bryna i know it she said as they stepped outside her body felt light again free of aches her mind was clear youre angry because you feel i deceived you but it wasnt deception you sent the white stag to lure me into the woods away from you i did yes i see now that alasdair knew and he used it against me i wanted you safe knowing you now the man you are now that became more important than she looked at the castle than the rest but he tricked you into removing the protection id given you then sent you into dreams to cloud your mind and make you doubt your reason there was a woman she said she was your mother my mother bryna blinked once then her lips curved was she in her garden wearing a foolish hat of straw yes and she had your mouth and hair clucking her tongue bryna strolled toward the ruins she wasnt meant to interfere but perhaps it was permitted as i bent the rules a bit myself the airs clearing of him she added as she stepped under the arch the flowers still bloom here he saw the circle of flowers untouched unscarred its over then completely completely she thought and fought to keep her smile in place hes destroyed even at the moment of his destruction he tried to take us with him he might have done it if you hadnt been quick if you hadnt been willing to risk wheres the globe now you know where it is and there it stays safe you trusted me with that but you didnt trust me with you no she looked down at the hands shed linked together that was wrong of me you were going to take poison she bit her lip at the raw accusation in his voice i couldnt face what he had in mind for me i couldnt bear it however weak it makes me i couldnt bear it if id been a moment later you would have done it killed yourself killed yourself he repeated jerking her head up you couldnt trust me to help you no i was afraid to i was afraid and hurt and desperate have i not the right to feelings do you think what i am strips me of them her mother had asked almost the same of him he remembered no he said it very calmly very clearly i dont do you think what im not makes me less stunned she shook her head and pressing a hand to her lips turned away it wasnt only he who had questioned she realized not only he who had lacked faith ive been unfair to you and im sorry for it you came here for me and learned to accept the impossible in only one day because part of me accepted it all along burying something doesnt mean it ceases to exist we were born for what happened here he let out an impatient breath why were her shoulders slumped he wondered when the worse of any life was behind them weve done what we were meant to do and maybe it was done as it was meant to be youre right of course her shoulders straightened as she turned and her smile was bright and false he realized as he looked into her eyes he cant come back and touch you now no she shook her head laid a hand briefly on his nor you he was swallowed by his own his kind are always here but alasdair is no more then with a laugh she brought his hand to her cheek oh cal if i could give you a picture as fine and bold as any of your own how you looked when you hefted that sword over your head the light in your eyes the strength rippling in waves around you ill carry that with me always she turned then walked regally to the circle of flowers in the center she turned faced him held out her hands calin farrell you met your fate you came to me when my need was great when my life was imperiled in this place you stood between me and the unbearable fought against magic dark and deadly wielded sword for me youve saved my life and in so doing saved this place and all i guard in it quite a speech he murmured and stepped closer she only smiled youre brave and true of heart and from this hour from this place you are free free understanding was dawning and he angled his head free from you bryna free from all and ever the spell is broken and you have no debt to pay but a debt is owed whatever you ask that is in my power you shall have whatever boon you wish will be yours a boon is it he tucked his tongue in his cheek oh lets say like immortality her eyes flickered disappointment quickly masked such things arent within the power i hold too tough for you huh with a nod he circled around her as if considering but if i decided on say unlimited wealth or incredible sexual powers you could handle that her chin shot up another inch went rigid i could if its what you will but a warning before you choose be wary and sure of what you wish for every gift even given freely has a price yeah yeah ive heard that lets think about it money sex power maybe powers good i could have a nice island in the caribbean be a benign despot i could get into that this offer was not made for your amusement she said stiffly no well it tickles the hell out of me rocking back on his heels he tucked his hands into his pockets all i had to do was knock off an evil wizard and save the girl and i can have whatever i want not a bad deal all in all so just what do i want he narrowed his eyes in consideration then stepped into the circle you eyes widening she jerked back what you i want you to to do what she said stupidly then blinked when he roared with laughter oh youve no need to waste a boon there she lifted her hands to unfasten her dress and found them caught in his that too he said walking her backward out of the circle keeping her arms up her hands locked behind her head yeah in fact i look forward to quite a bit of that the warrior was back she thought dizzily there the glint of battle and triumph in his eyes what are you doing im holding you to your boon you bryna all of you no restrictions for better or worse he continued until he had her backed against the wall for richer or poorer thats the deal she couldnt get her breath couldnt keep her balance you want me im not getting down on one knee when its my boon but youre free the spell is broken i have no hold on you dont you he lowered his mouth buckling her knees with his kiss you cant lie to me he crushed his lips to hers again pulling her closer you were born loving me he swallowed her moan and dived deeper youll die loving me yes powerless she flexed the hands he held above her head look at me he murmured easing back as she trembled and see he gentled his hands lowered them to stoke her shoulders beautiful bryna mine only mine calin her heart wheeled when his lips brushed tenderly over hers you love me after its done after its only you and only me you love me i was born loving you the kiss was deep and sweet ill die loving you he sipped the tears from her cheeks this is real she said in a whisper this is true magic its real whatever came before this is whats real i love you bryna you he repeated the woman who puts whiskey in my tea and the witch who weaves me magic sweaters believe that i do her breath released on a shudder of joy she felt it love trust acceptance i do believe it its time we made a home together bryna weve waited long enough calin farrell she wound her arms around his neck pressed her cheek against his your boon is granted
