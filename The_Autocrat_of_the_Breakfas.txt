the autocrats autobiography the interruption referred to in the first sentence of the first of these papers was just a quarter of a century in duration two articles entitled the autocrat of the breakfasttable will be found in the new england magazine formerly published in boston by j t and e buckingham the date of the first of these articles is november and that of the second february when the atlantic monthly was begun twentyfive years afterwards and the author was asked to write for it the recollection of these crude products of his uncombed literary boyhood suggested the thought that it would be a curious experiment to shake the same bough again and see if the ripe fruit were better or worse than the early windfalls so began this series of papers which naturally brings those earlier attempts to my own notice and that of some few friends who were idle enough to read them at the time of their publication the man is father to the boy that was and i am my own son as it seems to me in those papers of the new england magazine if i find it hard to pardon the boys faults others would find it harder they will not therefore be reprinted here nor as i hope anywhere but a sentence or two from them will perhaps bear reproducing and with these i trust the gentle reader if that kind being still breathes will be contented it is a capital plan to carry a tablet with you and when you find yourself felicitous take notes of your own conversation when i feel inclined to read poetry i take down my dictionary the poetry of words is quite as beautiful as that of sentences the author may arrange the gems effectively but their fhape and luftre have been given by the attrition of ages bring me the fineft fimile from the whole range of imaginative writing and i will fhow you a fingle word which conveys a more profound a more accurate and a more eloquent analogy once on a time a notion was ftarted that if all the people in the world would fhout at once it might be heard in the moon so the projectors agreed it fhould be done in juft ten years some thousand fhiploads of chronometers were diftributed to the selectmen and other great folks of all the different nations for a year beforehand nothing else was talked about but the awful noise that was to be made on the great occafion when the time came everybody had their ears so wide open to hear the universal ejaculation of boo the word agreed upon that nobody spoke except a deaf man in one of the fejee islands and a woman in pekin so that the world was never so ftill fince the creation there was nothing better than these things and there was not a little that was much worse a young fellow of two or three and twenty has as good a right to spoil a magazinefull of essays in learning how to write as an oculist like wenzel had to spoil his hatfull of eyes in learning how to operate for cataract or an elegant like brummel to point to an armful of failures in the attempt to achieve a perfect tie this son of mine whom i have not seen for these twentyfive years generously counted was a selfwilled youth always too ready to utter his unchastised fancies he like too many american young people got the spur when he should have had the rein he therefore helped to fill the market with that unripe fruit which his father says in one of these papers abounds in the marts of his native country all these bygone shortcomings he would hope are forgiven did he not feel sure that very few of his readers know anything about them in taking the old name for the new papers he felt bound to say that he had uttered unwise things under that title and if it shall appear that his unwisdom has not diminished by at least half while his years have doubled he promises not to repeat the experiment if he should live to double them again and become his own grandfather oliver wendell holmes boston nov st chapter i i was just going to say when i was interrupted that one of the many ways of classifying minds is under the heads of arithmetical and algebraical intellects all economical and practical wisdom is an extension or variation of the following arithmetical formula every philosophical proposition has the more general character of the expression abc we are mere operatives empirics and egotists until we learn to think in letters instead of figures they all stared there is a divinity student lately come among us to whom i commonly address remarks like the above allowing him to take a certain share in the conversation so far as assent or pertinent questions are involved he abused his liberty on this occasion by presuming to say that leibnitz had the same observation no sir i replied he has not but he said a mighty good thing about mathematics that sounds something like it and you found it not in the original but quoted by dr thomas reid i will tell the company what he did say one of these days if i belong to a society of mutual admiration i blush to say that i do not at this present moment i once did however it was the first association to which i ever heard the term applied a body of scientific young men in a great foreign city who admired their teacher and to some extent each other many of them deserved it they have become famous since it amuses me to hear the talk of one of those beings described by thackeray letters four do form his name about a social development which belongs to the very noblest stage of civilization all generous companies of artists authors philanthropists men of science are or ought to be societies of mutual admiration a man of genius or any kind of superiority is not debarred from admiring the same quality in another nor the other from returning his admiration they may even associate together and continue to think highly of each other and so of a dozen such men if any one place is fortunate enough to hold so many the being referred to above assumes several false premises first that men of talent necessarily hate each other secondly that intimate knowledge or habitual association destroys our admiration of persons whom we esteemed highly at a distance thirdly that a circle of clever fellows who meet together to dine and have a good time have signed a constitutional compact to glorify themselves and to put down him and the fraction of the human race not belonging to their number fourthly that it is an outrage that he is not asked to join them here the company laughed a good deal and the old gentleman who sits opposite said thats it thats it i continued for i was in the talking vein as to clever peoples hating each other i think a little extra talent does sometimes make people jealous they become irritated by perpetual attempts and failures and it hurts their tempers and dispositions unpretending mediocrity is good and genius is glorious but a weak flavor of genius in an essentially common person is detestable it spoils the grand neutrality of a commonplace character as the rinsings of an unwashed wineglass spoil a draught of fair water no wonder the poor fellow we spoke of who always belongs to this class of slightly flavored mediocrities is puzzled and vexed by the strange sight of a dozen men of capacity working and playing together in harmony he and his fellows are always fighting with them familiarity naturally breeds contempt if they ever praise each others bad drawings or brokenwinded novels or spavined verses nobody ever supposed it was from admiration it was simply a contract between themselves and a publisher or dealer if the mutuals have really nothing among them worth admiring that alters the question but if they are men with noble powers and qualities let me tell you that next to youthful love and family affections there is no human sentiment better than that which unites the societies of mutual admiration and what would literature or art be without such associations who can tell what we owe to the mutual admiration society of which shakspeare and ben jonson and beaumont and fletcher were members or to that of which addison and steele formed the centre and which gave us the spectator or to that where johnson and goldsmith and burke and reynolds and beauclerk and boswell most admiring among all admirers met together was there any great harm in the fact that the irvings and paulding wrote in company or any unpardonable cabal in the literary union of verplanck and bryant and sands and as many more as they chose to associate with them the poor creature does not know what he is talking about when he abuses this noblest of institutions let him inspect its mysteries through the knothole he has secured but not use that orifice as a medium for his popgun such a society is the crown of a literary metropolis if a town has not material for it and spirit and good feeling enough to organize it it is a mere caravansary fit for a man of genius to lodge in but not to live in foolish people hate and dread and envy such an association of men of varied powers and influence because it is lofty serene impregnable and by the necessity of the case exclusive wise ones are prouder of the title m s m a than of all their other honors put together all generous minds have a horror of what are commonly called facts they are the brute beasts of the intellectual domain who does not know fellows that always have an illconditioned fact or two which they lead after them into decent company like so many bulldogs ready to let them slip at every ingenious suggestion or convenient generalization or pleasant fancy i allow no facts at this table what because bread is good and wholesome and necessary and nourishing shall you thrust a crumb into my windpipe while i am talking do not these muscles of mine represent a hundred loaves of bread and is not my thought the abstract of ten thousand of these crumbs of truth with which you would choke off my speech the above remark must be conditioned and qualified for the vulgar mind the reader will of course understand the precise amount of seasoning which must be added to it before he adopts it as one of the axioms of his life the speaker disclaims all responsibility for its abuse in incompetent hands this business of conversation is a very serious matter there are men that it weakens one to talk with an hour more than a days fasting would do mark this that i am going to say for it is as good as a working professional mans advice and costs you nothing it is better to lose a pint of blood from your veins than to have a nerve tapped nobody measures your nervous force as it runs away nor bandages your brain and marrow after the operation there are men of esprit who are excessively exhausting to some people they are the talkers who have what may be called jerky minds their thoughts do not run in the natural order of sequence they say bright things on all possible subjects but their zigzags rack you to death after a jolting halfhour with one of these jerky companions talking with a dull friend affords great relief it is like taking the cat in your lap after holding a squirrel what a comfort a dull but kindly person is to be sure at times a groundglass shade over a gaslamp does not bring more solace to our dazzled eyes than such a one to our minds do not dull people bore you said one of the ladyboarders the same that sent me her autographbook last week with a request for a few original stanzas not remembering that the pactolian pays me five dollars a line for every thing i write in its columns madam said i she and the century were in their teens together all men are bores except when we want them there never was but one man whom i would trust with my latchkey who might that favored person be zimmermann the men of genius that i fancy most have erectile heads like the cobradicapello you remember what they tell of william pinkney the great pleader how in his eloquent paroxysms the veins of his neck would swell and his face flush and his eyes glitter until he seemed on the verge of apoplexy the hydraulic arrangements for supplying the brain with blood are only second in importance to its own organization the bulbousheaded fellows that steam well when they are at work are the men that draw big audiences and give us marrowy books and pictures it is a good sign to have ones feet grow cold when he is writing a great writer and speaker once told me that he often wrote with his feet in hot water but for this all his blood would have run into his head as the mercury sometimes withdraws into the ball of a thermometer you dont suppose that my remarks made at this table are like so many postagestamps do you each to be only once uttered if you do you are mistaken he must be a poor creature that does not often repeat himself imagine the author of the excellent piece of advice know thyself never alluding to that sentiment again during the course of a protracted existence why the truths a man carries about with him are his tools and do you think a carpenter is bound to use the same plane but once to smooth a knotty board with or to hang up his hammer after it has driven its first nail i shall never repeat a conversation but an idea often i shall use the same types when i like but not commonly the same stereotypes a thought is often original though you have uttered it a hundred times it has come to you over a new route by a new and express train of associations sometimes but rarely one may be caught making the same speech twice over and yet be held blameless thus a certain lecturer after performing in an inland city where dwells a litteratrice of note was invited to meet her and others over the social teacup she pleasantly referred to his many wanderings in his new occupation yes he replied i am like the huma the bird that never lights being always in the cars as he is always on the wing years elapsed the lecturer visited the same place once more for the same purpose another social cup after the lecture and a second meeting with the distinguished lady you are constantly going from place to place she said yes he answered i am like the huma and finished the sentence as before what horrors when it flashed over him that he had made this fine speech word for word twice over yet it was not true as the lady might perhaps have fairly inferred that he had embellished his conversation with the huma daily during that whole interval of years on the contrary he had never once thought of the odious fowl until the recurrence of precisely the same circumstances brought up precisely the same idea he ought to have been proud of the accuracy of his mental adjustments given certain factors and a sound brain should always evolve the same fixed product with the certainty of babbages calculating machine what a satire by the way is that machine on the mere mathematician a frankensteinmonster a thing without brains and without heart too stupid to make a blunder that turns out results like a cornsheller and never grows any wiser or better though it grind a thousand bushels of them i have an immense respect for a man of talents plus the mathematics but the calculating power alone should seem to be the least human of qualities and to have the smallest amount of reason in it since a machine can be made to do the work of three or four calculators and better than any one of them sometimes i have been troubled that i had not a deeper intuitive apprehension of the relations of numbers but the triumph of the ciphering handorgan has consoled me i always fancy i can hear the wheels clicking in a calculators brain the power of dealing with numbers is a kind of detached lever arrangement which may be put into a mighty poor watch i suppose it is about as common as the power of moving the ears voluntarily which is a moderately rare endowment little localized powers and little narrow streaks of specialized knowledge are things men are very apt to be conceited about nature is very wise but for this encouraging principle how many small talents and little accomplishments would be neglected talk about conceit as much as you like it is to human character what salt is to the ocean it keeps it sweet and renders it endurable say rather it is like the natural unguent of the seafowls plumage which enables him to shed the rain that falls on him and the wave in which he dips when one has had all his conceit taken out of him when he has lost all his illusions his feathers will soon soak through and he will fly no more so you admire conceited people do you said the young lady who has come to the city to be finished off for the duties of life i am afraid you do not study logic at your school my dear it does not follow that i wish to be pickled in brine because i like a saltwater plunge at nahant i say that conceit is just as natural a thing to human minds as a centre is to a circle but littleminded peoples thoughts move in such small circles that five minutes conversation gives you an arc long enough to determine their whole curve an arc in the movement of a large intellect does not sensibly differ from a straight line even if it have the third vowel as its centre it does not soon betray it the highest thought that is is the most seemingly impersonal it does not obviously imply any individual centre audacious selfesteem with good ground for it is always imposing what resplendent beauty that must have been which could have authorized phryne to peel in the way she did what fine speeches are those two non omnis mortar and i have taken all knowledge to be my province even in common people conceit has the virtue of making them cheerful the man who thinks his wife his baby his house his horse his dog and himself severally unequalled is almost sure to be a goodhumored person though liable to be tedious at times what are the great faults of conversation want of ideas want of words want of manners are the principal ones i suppose you think i dont doubt it but i will tell you what i have found spoil more good talks than anything else long arguments on special points between people who differ on the fundamental principles upon which these points depend no men can have satisfactory relations with each other until they have agreed on certain ultimata of belief not to be disturbed in ordinary conversation and unless they have sense enough to trace the secondary questions depending upon these ultimate beliefs to their source in short just as a written constitution is essential to the best social order so a code of finalities is a necessary condition of profitable talk between two persons talking is like playing on the harp there is as much in laying the hand on the strings to stop their vibrations as in twanging them to bring out their music do you mean to say the punquestion is not clearly settled in your minds let me lay down the law upon the subject life and language are alike sacred homicide and verbicide that is violent treatment of a word with fatal results to its legitimate meaning which is its life are alike forbidden manslaughter which is the meaning of the one is the same as mans laughter which is the end of the other a pun is prima facie an insult to the person you are talking with it implies utter indifference to or sublime contempt for his remarks no matter how serious i speak of total depravity and one says all that is written on the subject is deep raving i have committed my selfrespect by talking with such a person i should like to commit him but cannot because he is a nuisance or i speak of geological convulsions and he asks me what was the cosine of noahs ark also whether the deluge was not a deal huger than any modern inundation a pun does not commonly justify a blow in return but if a blow were given for such cause and death ensued the jury would be judges both of the facts and of the pun and might if the latter were of an aggravated character return a verdict of justifiable homicide thus in a case lately decided before miller j doe presented roe a subscription paper and urged the claims of suffering humanity roe replied by asking when charity was like a top it was in evidence that doe preserved a dignified silence roe then said when it begins to hum doe then and not till then struck roe and his head happening to hit a bound volume of the monthly ragbag and stolen miscellany intense mortification ensued with a fatal result the chief laid down his notions of the law to his brother justices who unanimously replied jest so the chief rejoined that no man should jest so without being punished for it and charged for the prisoner who was acquitted and the pun ordered to be burned by the sheriff the bound volume was forfeited as a deodand but not claimed people that make puns are like wanton boys that put coppers on the railroad tracks they amuse themselves and other children but their little trick may upset a freight train of conversation for the sake of a battered witticism i will thank you b f to bring down two books of which i will mark the places on this slip of paper while he is gone i may say that this boy our landladys youngest is called benjamin franklin after the celebrated philosopher of that name a highly merited compliment i wished to refer to two eminent authorities now be so good as to listen the great moralist says to trifle with the vocabulary which is the vehicle of social intercourse is to tamper with the currency of human intelligence he who would violate the sanctities of his mother tongue would invade the recesses of the paternal till without remorse and repeat the banquet of saturn without an indigestion and once more listen to the historian the puritans hated puns the bishops were notoriously addicted to them the lords temporal carried them to the verge of license majesty itself must have its royal quibble ye be burly my lord of burleigh said queen elizabeth but ye shall make less stir in our realm than my lord of leicester the gravest wisdom and the highest breeding lent their sanction to the practice lord bacon playfully declared himself a descendant of og the king of bashan sir philip sidney with his last breath reproached the soldier who brought him water for wasting a casque full upon a dying man a courtier who saw othello performed at the globe theatre remarked that the blackamoor was a brute and not a man thou hast reason replied a great lord according to plato his saying for this be a twolegged animal with feathers the fatal habit became universal the language was corrupted the infection spread to the national conscience political doubledealings naturally grew out of verbal double meanings the teeth of the new dragon were sown by the cadmus who introduced the alphabet of equivocation what was levity in the time of the tudors grew to regicide and revolution in the age of the stuarts who was that boarder that just whispered something about the macaulayflowers of literature there was a dead silence i said calmly i shall henceforth consider any interruption by a pun as a hint to change my boardinghouse do not plead my example if i have used any such it has been only as a spartan father would show up a drunken helot we have done with them if a logical mind ever found out anything with its logic i should say that its most frequent work was to build a pons asinorum over chasms which shrewd people can bestride without such a structure you can hire logic in the shape of a lawyer to prove anything that you want to prove you can buy treatises to show that napoleon never lived and that no battle of bunkerhill was ever fought the great minds are those with a wide span which couple truths related to but far removed from each other logicians carry the surveyors chain over the track of which these are the true explorers i value a man mainly for his primary relations with truth as i understand truth not for any secondary artifice in handling his ideas some of the sharpest men in argument are notoriously unsound in judgment i should not trust the counsel of a smart debater any more than that of a good chessplayer either may of course advise wisely but not necessarily because he wrangles or plays well the old gentleman who sits opposite got his hand up as a pointer lifts his forefoot at the expression his relations with truth as i understand truth and when i had done sniffed audibly and said i talked like a transcendentalist for his part common sense was good enough for him precisely so my dear sir i replied common sense as you understand it we all have to assume a standard of judgment in our own minds either of things or persons a man who is willing to take anothers opinion has to exercise his judgment in the choice of whom to follow which is often as nice a matter as to judge of things for ones self on the whole i had rather judge mens minds by comparing their thoughts with my own than judge of thoughts by knowing who utter them i must do one or the other it does not follow of course that i may not recognize another mans thoughts as broader and deeper than my own but that does not necessarily change my opinion otherwise this would be at the mercy of every superior mind that held a different one how many of our most cherished beliefs are like those drinkingglasses of the ancient pattern that serve us well so long as we keep them in our hand but spill all if we attempt to set them down i have sometimes compared conversation to the italian game of mora in which one player lifts his hand with so many fingers extended and the other gives the number if he can i show my thought another his if they agree well if they differ we find the largest common factor if we can but at any rate avoid disputing about remainders and fractions which is to real talk what tuning an instrument is to playing on it what if instead of talking this morning i should read you a copy of verses with critical remarks by the author any of the company can retire that like album verses when eve had led her lord away and cain had killed his brother the stars and flowers the poets say agreed with one another to cheat the cunning tempters art and teach the race its duty by keeping on its wicked heart their eyes of light and beauty a million sleepless lids they say will be at least a warning and so the flowers would watch by day the stars from eve to morning on hill and prairie field and lawn their dewy eyes upturning the flowers still watch from reddening dawn till western skies are burning alas each hour of daylight tells a tale of shame so crushing that some turn white as seableached shells and some are always blushing but when the patient stars look down on all their light discovers the traitors smile the murderers frown the lips of lying lovers they try to shut their saddening eyes and in the vain endeavour we see them twinkling in the skies and so they wink forever what do you think of these verses my friends is that piece an impromptu said my landladys daughter aet tendereyed blonde long ringlets cameo pin gold pencilcase on a chain locket bracelet album autograph book accordeon reads byron tupper and sylvanus cobb junior while her mother makes the puddings says yes when you tell her anything oui et non ma petite yes and no my child five of the seven verses were written offhand the other two took a week that is were hanging round the desk in a ragged forlorn unrhymed condition as long as that all poets will tell you just such stories cest le dernier pas qui coute dont you know how hard it is for some people to get out of a room after their visit is really over they want to be off and you want to have them off but they dont know how to manage it one would think they had been built in your parlour or study and were waiting to be launched i have contrived a sort of ceremonial inclined plane for such visitors which being lubricated with certain smooth phrases i back them down metaphorically speaking sternforemost into their native element the great ocean of outdoors well now there are poems as hard to get rid of as these rural visitors they come in glibly use up all the serviceable rhymes day ray beauty duty skies eyes other brother mountain fountain and the like and so they go on until you think it is time for the windup and the windup wont come on any terms so they lie about until you get sick of the sight of them and end by thrusting some cold scrap of a final couplet upon them and turning them out of doors i suspect a good many impromptus could tell just such a story as the above here turning to our landlady i used an illustration which pleased the company much at the time and has since been highly commanded madam i said you can pour three gills and three quarters of honey from that pint jug if it is full in less than one minute but madam you could not empty that last quarter of a gill though you were turned into a marble hebe and held the vessel upside down for a thousand years one gets tired to death of the old old rhymes such as you see in that copy of verses which i dont mean to abuse or to praise either i always feel as if i were a cobbler putting new topleathers to an old pair of bootsoles and bodies when i am fitting sentiments to these venerable jingles youth morning truth warning nine tenths of the juvenile poems written spring out of the above musical and suggestive coincidences yes said our landladys daughter i did not address the following remark to her and i trust from her limited range of reading she will never see it i said it softly to my next neighbour when a young female wears a flat circular side curl gummed on each temple when she walks with a male not arm in arm but his arm against the back of hers and when she says yes with the note of interrogation you are generally safe in asking her what wages she gets and who the feller was you saw her with what were you whispering said the daughter of the house moistening her lips as she spoke in a very engaging manner i was only laying down a principle of social diagnosis yes it is curious to see how the same wants and tastes find the same implements and modes of expression in all times and places the young ladies of otaheite as you may see in cooks voyages had a sort of crinoline arrangement fully equal in radius to the largest spread of our own ladybaskets when i fling a baystate shawl over my shoulders i am only taking a lesson from the climate that the indian had learned before me a blanketshawl we call it and not a plaid and we wear it like the aborigines and not like the highlanders we are the romans of the modern world the great assimilating people conflicts and conquests are of course necessary accidents with us as with our prototypes and so we come to their style of weapon our army sword is the short stiff pointed gladius of the romans and the american bowieknife is the same tool modified to meet the daily wants of civil society i announce at this table an axiom not to be found in montesquieu or the journals of congress the race that shortens its weapons lengthens its boundaries corollary it was the polish lance that left poland at last with nothing of her own to bound dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear what business had sarmatia to be fighting for liberty with a fifteenfoot pole between her and the breasts of her enemies if she had but clutched the old roman and young american weapon and come to close quarters there might have been a chance for her but it would have spoiled the best passage in the pleasures of hope selfmade men well yes of course everybody likes and respects selfmade men it is a great deal better to be made in that way than not to be made at all are any of you younger people old enough to remember that irishmans house on the marsh at cambridgeport which house he built from drain to chimneytop with his own hands it took him a good many years to build it and one could see that it was a little out of plumb and a little wavy in outline and a little queer and uncertain in general aspect a regular hand could certainly have built a better house but it was a very good house for a selfmade carpenters house and people praised it and said how remarkably well the irishman had succeeded they never thought of praising the fine blocks of houses a little farther on your selfmade man whittled into shape with his own jackknife deserves more credit if that is all than the regular engineturned article shaped by the most approved pattern and frenchpolished by society and travel but as to saying that one is every way the equal of the other that is another matter the right of strict social discrimination of all things and persons according to their merits native or acquired is one of the most precious republican privileges i take the liberty to exercise it when i say that other things being equal in most relations of life i prefer a man of family what do i mean by a man of family o ill give you a general idea of what i mean let us give him a firstrate fit out it costs us nothing four or five generations of gentlemen and gentlewomen among them a member of his majestys council for the province a governor or so one or two doctors of divinity a member of congress not later than the time of topboots with tassels family portraits the member of the council by smibert the great merchantuncle by copley full length sitting in his armchair in a velvet cap and flowered robe with a globe by him to show the range of his commercial transactions and letters with large red seals lying round one directed conspicuously to the honourable etc etc greatgrandmother by the same artist brown satin lace very fine hands superlative grand old lady stiffish but imposing her mother artist unknown flat angular hanging sleeves parrot on fist a pair of stuarts viz a superb fullblown mediaeval gentleman with a fiery dash of tory blood in his veins tempered down with that of a fine old rebel grandmother and warmed up with the best of old india madeira his face is one flame of ruddy sunshine his ruffled shirt rushes out of his bosom with an impetuous generosity as if it would drag his heart after it and his smile is good for twenty thousand dollars to the hospital besides ample bequests to all relatives and dependants lady of the same remarkable cap high waist as in time of empire bust a la josephine wisps of curls like celerytips at sides of forehead complexion clear and warm like rosecordial as for the miniatures by malbone we dont count them in the gallery books too with the names of old collegestudents in them family names you will find them at the head of their respective classes in the days when students took rank on the catalogue from their parents condition elzevirs with the latinized appellations of youthful progenitors and hic liber est meus on the titlepage a set of hogarths original plates pope original edition volumes london barrow on the lower shelves in folio tillotson on the upper in a little dark platoon of octodecimos some family silver a string of wedding and funeral rings the arms of the family curiously blazoned the same in worsted by a maiden aunt if the man of family has an old place to keep these things in furnished with clawfooted chairs and black mahogany tables and tall beveledged mirrors and stately upright cabinets his outfit is complete no my friends i go always other things being equal for the man who inherits family traditions and the cumulative humanities of at least four or five generations above all things as a child he should have tumbled about in a library all men are afraid of books who have not handled them from infancy do you suppose our dear didascalos over there ever read poli synopsis or consulted castelli lexicon while he was growing up to their stature not he but virtue passed through the hem of their parchment and leather garments whenever he touched them as the precious drugs sweated through the bats handle in the arabian story i tell you he is at home wherever he smells the invigorating fragrance of russia leather no selfmade man feels so one may it is true have all the antecedents i have spoken of and yet be a boor or a shabby fellow one may have none of them and yet be fit for councils and courts then let them change places our social arrangement has this great beauty that its strata shift up and down as they change specific gravity without being clogged by layers of prescription but i still insist on my democratic liberty of choice and i go for the man with the gallery of family portraits against the one with the twentyfivecent daguerreotype unless i find out that the last is the better of the two i should have felt more nervous about the late comet if i had thought the world was ripe but it is very green yet if i am not mistaken and besides there is a great deal of coal to use up which i cannot bring myself to think was made for nothing if certain things which seem to me essential to a millennium had come to pass i should have been frightened but they havent perhaps you would like to hear my latterday warnings when legislators keep the law when banks dispense with bolts and locks when berries whortle rasp and strawgrow bigger downwards through the box when he that selleth house or land shows leak in roof or flaw in rightwhen haberdashers choose the stand whose window hath the broadest light when preachers tell us all they think and party leaders all they meanwhen what we pay for that we drink from real grape and coffeebean when lawyers take what they would give and doctors give what they would takewhen city fathers eat to live save when they fast for conscience sake when one that hath a horse on sale shall bring his merit to the proof without a lie for every nail that holds the iron on the hoof when in the usual place for rips our gloves are stitched with special care and guarded well the whalebone tips where first umbrellas need repair when cubas weeds have quite forgot the power of suction to resist and claretbottles harber not such dimples as would hold your fist when publishers no longer steal and pay for what they stole beforewhen the first locomotives wheel rolls through the hoosac tunnels bore till then let cumming a blaze away and millers saints blow up the globe but when you see that blessed day then order your ascension robe the company seemed to like the verses and i promised them to read others occasionally if they had a mind to hear them of course they would not expect it every morning neither must the reader suppose that all these things i have reported were said at any one breakfasttime i have not taken the trouble to date them as raspail pere used to date every proof he sent to the printer but they were scattered over several breakfasts and i have said a good many more things since which i shall very possibly print some time or other if i am urged to do it by judicious friends i finished off with reading some verses of my friend the professor of whom you may perhaps hear more by and by the professor read them he told me at a farewell meeting where the youngest of our great historians met a few of his many friends at their invitation yes we knew we must lose him though friendship may claim to blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame though fondly at parting we call him our own tis the whisper of love when the bugle has blown as the rider that rests with the spur on his heelas the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steelas the archer that stands with his shaft on the string he stoops from his toil to the garland we bring what pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom while the tapestry lengthens the lifeglowing dyes that caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies in the alcoves of death in the charnels of time where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime there are triumphs untold there are martyrs unsung there are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue let us hear the proud story which time has bequeathed from lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed let him summon its tyrants and tell us their doom though he sweep the black past like van tromp with his broom the dream flashes by for the westwinds awake on pampas on prairie oer mountain and lake to bathe the swift bark like a seagirdled shrine with incense they stole from the rose and the pine so fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed when the dead summers jewels were trampled and crushed the true knight of learning the world holds him dearlove bless him joy crown him god speed his career chapter ii i really believe some people save their bright thoughts as being too precious for conversation what do you think an admiring friend said the other day to one that was talking good things good enough to print why said he you are wasting mechantable literature a cash article at the rate as nearly as i can tell of fifty dollars an hour the talker took him to the window and asked him to look out and tell what he saw nothing but a very dusty street he said and a man driving a sprinklingmachine through it why dont you tell the man he is wasting that water what would be the state of the highways of life if we did not drive our thoughtsprinklers through them with the valves open sometimes besides there is another thing about this talking which you forget it shapes our thoughts for us the waves of conversation roll them as the surf rolls the pebbles on the shore let me modify the image a little i rough out my thoughts in talk as an artist models in clay spoken language is so plastic you can pat and coax and spread and shave and rub out and fill up and stick on so easily when you work that soft material that there is nothing like it for modelling out of it come the shapes which you turn into marble or bronze in your immortal books if you happen to write such or to use another illustration writing or printing is like shooting with a rifle you may hit your readers mind or miss it but talking is like playing at a mark with the pipe of an engine if it is within reach and you have time enough you cant help hitting it the company agreed that this last illustration was of superior excellence or in the phrase used by them fustrate i acknowledged the compliment but gently rebuked the expression fustrate prime a prime article a superior piece of goods a handsome garment a gent in a flowered vest all such expressions are final they blast the lineage of him or her who utters them for generations up and down there is one other phrase which will soon come to be decisive of a mans social status if it is not already that tells the whole story it is an expression which vulgar and conceited people particularly affect and which wellmeaning ones who know better catch from them it is intended to stop all debate like the previous question in the general court only it doesnt simply because that does not usually tell the whole nor one half of the whole story it is an odd idea that almost all our people have had a professional education to become a doctor a man must study some three years and hear a thousand lectures more or less just how much study it takes to make a lawyer i cannot say but probably not more than this now most decent people hear one hundred lectures or sermons discourses on theology every year and this twenty thirty fifty years together they read a great many religious books besides the clergy however rarely hear any sermons except what they preach themselves a dull preacher might be conceived therefore to lapse into a state of quasi heathenism simply for want of religious instruction and on the other hand an attentive and intelligent hearer listening to a succession of wise teachers might become actually better educated in theology than any one of them we are all theological students and more of us qualified as doctors of divinity than have received degrees at any of the universities it is not strange therefore that very good people should often find it difficult if not impossible to keep their attention fixed upon a sermon treating feebly a subject which they have thought vigorously about for years and heard able men discuss scores of times i have often noticed however that a hopelessly dull discourse acts inductively as electricians would say in developing strong mental currents i am ashamed to think with what accompaniments and variations and fioriture i have sometimes followed the droning of a heavy speaker not willingly for my habit is reverential but as a necessary result of a slight continuous impression on the senses and the mind which kept both in action without furnishing the food they required to work upon if you ever saw a crow with a kingbird after him you will get an image of a dull speaker and a lively listener the bird in sable plumage flaps heavily along his straightforward course while the other sails round him over him under him leaves him comes back again tweaks out a black feather shoots away once more never losing sight of him and finally reaches the crows perch at the same time the crow does having cut a perfect labyrinth of loops and knots and spirals while the slow fowl was painfully working from one end of his straight line to the other i think these remarks were received rather coolly a temporary boarder from the country consisting of a somewhat more than middleaged female with a parchment forehead and a dry little frisette shingling it a sallow neck with a necklace of gold beads a black dress too rusty for recent grief and contours in bassorilievo left the table prematurely and was reported to have been very virulent about what i said so i went to my good old minister and repeated the remarks as nearly as i could remember them to him he laughed goodnaturedly and said there was considerable truth in them he thought he could tell when peoples minds were wandering by their looks in the earlier years of his ministry he had sometimes noticed this when he was preaching very little of late years sometimes when his colleague was preaching he observed this kind of inattention but after all it was not so very unnatural i will say by the way that it is a rule i have long followed to tell my worst thoughts to my minister and my best thoughts to the young people i talk with i want to make a literary confession now which i believe nobody has made before me you know very well that i write verses sometimes because i have read some of them at this table the company assented two or three of them in a resigned sort of way as i thought as if they supposed i had an epic in my pocket and was going to read half a dozen books or so for their benefit i continued of course i write some lines or passages which are better than others some which compared with the others might be called relatively excellent it is in the nature of things that i should consider these relatively excellent lines or passages as absolutely good so much must be pardoned to humanity now i never wrote a good line in my life but the moment after it was written it seemed a hundred years old very commonly i had a sudden conviction that i had seen it somewhere possibly i may have sometimes unconsciously stolen it but i do not remember that i ever once detected any historical truth in these sudden convictions of the antiquity of my new thought or phrase i have learned utterly to distrust them and never allow them to bully me out of a thought or line this is the philosophy of it here the number of the company was diminished by a small secession any new formula which suddenly emerges in our consciousness has its roots in long trains of thought it is virtually old when it first makes its appearance among the recognized growths of our intellect any crystalline group of musical words has had a long and still period to form in here is one theory but there is a larger law which perhaps comprehends these facts it is this the rapidity with which ideas grow old in our memories is in a direct ratio to the squares of their importance their apparent age runs up miraculously like the value of diamonds as they increase in magnitude a great calamity for instance is as old as the trilobites an hour after it has happened it stains backward through all the leaves we have turned over in the book of life before its blot of tears or of blood is dry on the page we are turning for this we seem to have lived it was foreshadowed in dreams that we leaped out of in the cold sweat of terror in the dissolving views of dark dayvisions all omens pointed to it all paths led to it after the tossing halfforgetfulness of the first sleep that follows such an event it comes upon us afresh as a surprise at waking in a few moments it is old again old as eternity i wish i had not said all this then and there i might have known better the pale schoolmistress in her mourning dress was looking at me as i noticed with a wild sort of expression all at once the blood dropped out of her cheeks as the mercury drops from a broken barometertube and she melted away from her seat like an image of snow a slungshot could not have brought her down better god forgive me after this little episode i continued to some few that remained balancing teaspoons on the edges of cups twirling knives or tilting upon the hind legs of their chairs until their heads reached the wall where they left gratuitous advertisements of various popular cosmetics when a person is suddenly thrust into any strange new position of trial he finds the place fits him as if he had been measured for it he has committed a great crime for instance and is sent to the state prison the traditions prescriptions limitations privileges all the sharp conditions of his new life stamp themselves upon his consciousness as the signet on soft wax a single pressure is enough let me strengthen the image a little did you ever happen to see that most softspoken and velvethanded steamengine at the mint the smooth piston slides backward and forward as a lady might slip her delicate finger in and out of a ring the engine lays one of its fingers calmly but firmly upon a bit of metal it is a coin now and will remember that touch and tell a new race about it when the date upon it is crusted over with twenty centuries so it is that a great silentmoving misery puts a new stamp on us in an hour or a moment as sharp an impression as if it had taken half a lifetime to engrave it it is awful to be in the hands of the wholesale professional dealers in misfortune undertakers and jailers magnetize you in a moment and you pass out of the individual life you were living into the rhythmical movements of their horrible machinery do the worst thing you can or suffer the worst that can be thought of you find yourself in a category of humanity that stretches back as far as cain and with an expert at your elbow who has studied your case all out beforehand and is waiting for you with his implements of hemp or mahogany i believe if a man were to be burned in any of our cities tomorrow for heresy there would be found a master of ceremonies that knew just how many fagots were necessary and the best way of arranging the whole matter so we have not won the goodwood cup au contraire we were a bad fifth if not worse than that and trying it again and the third time has not yet bettered the matter now i am as patriotic as any of my fellowcitizens too patriotic in fact for i have got into hot water by loving too much of my country in short if any man whose fighting weight is not more than eight stone four pounds disputes it i am ready to discuss the point with him i should have gloried to see the stars and stripes in front at the finish i love my country and i love horses stubbss old mezzotint of eclipse hangs over my desk and herrings portrait of plenipotentiary whom i saw run at epsom over my fireplace did i not elope from school to see revenge and prospect and little john and peacemaker run over the racecourse where now yon suburban village flourishes in the year eighteen hundred and eversofew though i never owned a horse have i not been the proprietor of six equine females of which one was the prettiest little morgin that ever stepped listen then to an opinion i have often expressed long before this venture of ours in england horseracing is not a republican institution horsetrotting is only very rich persons can keep racehorses and everybody knows they are kept mainly as gambling implements all that matter about blood and speed we wont discuss we understand all that useful very of course great obligations to the godolphin arabian and the rest i say racing horses are essentially gambling implements as much as roulette tables now i am not preaching at this moment i may read you one of my sermons some other morning but i maintain that gambling on the great scale is not republican it belongs to two phases of society a cankered overcivilization such as exists in rich aristocracies and the reckless life of borderers and adventurers or the semibarbarism of a civilization resolved into its primitive elements real republicanism is stern and severe its essence is not in forms of government but in the omnipotence of public opinion which grows out of it this public opinion cannot prevent gambling with dice or stocks but it can and does compel it to keep comparatively quiet but horseracing is the most public way of gambling and with all its immense attractions to the sense and the feelings to which i plead very susceptible the disguise is too thin that covers it and everybody knows what it means its supporters are the southern gentry fine fellows no doubt but not republicans exactly as we understand the term a few northern millionnaires more or less thoroughly millioned who do not represent the real people and the mob of sporting men the best of whom are commonly idlers and the worst very bad neighbors to have near one in a crowd or to meet in a dark alley in england on the other hand with its aristocratic institutions racing is a natural growth enough the passion for it spreads downwards through all classes from the queen to the costermonger london is like a shelled corncob on the derby day and there is not a clerk who could raise the money to hire a saddle with an old hack under it that can sit down on his officestool the next day without wincing now just compare the racer with the trotter for a moment the racer is incidentally useful but essentially something to bet upon as much as the thimbleriggers little joker the trotter is essentially and daily useful and only incidentally a tool for sporting men what better reason do you want for the fact that the racer is most cultivated and reaches his greatest perfection in england and that the trotting horses of america beat the world and why should we have expected that the pick if it was the pick of our few and farbetween racing stables should beat the pick of england and france throw over the fallacious timetest and there was nothing to show for it but a natural kind of patriotic feeling which we all have with a thoroughly provincial conceit which some of us must plead guilty to we may beat yet as an american i hope we shall as a moralist and occasional sermonizer i am not so anxious about it wherever the trotting horse goes he carries in his train brisk omnibuses lively bakers carts and therefore hot rolls the jolly butchers wagon the cheerful gig the wholesome afternoon drive with wife and child all the forms of moral excellence except truth which does not agree with any kind of horseflesh the racer brings with him gambling cursing swearing drinking the eating of oysters and a distaste for mobcaps and the middleaged virtues and by the way let me beg you not to call a trotting match a race and not to speak of a thoroughbred as a blooded horse unless he has been recently phlebotomized i consent to your saying blood horse if you like also if next year we send out posterior and posterioress the winners of the great national fourmile race in and they happen to get beaten pay your bets and behave like men and gentlemen about it if you know how i felt a great deal better after blowing off the illtemper condensed in the above paragraph to brag little to show well to crow gently if in luck to pay up to own up and to shut up if beaten are the virtues of a sporting man and i cant say that i think we have shown them in any great perfection of late apropos of horses do you know how important good jockeying is to authors judicious management letting the public see your animal just enough and not too much holding him up hard when the market is too full of him letting him out at just the right buying intervals always gently feeling his mouth never slacking and never jerking the rein this is what i mean by jockeying when an author has a number of books out a cunning hand will keep them all spinning as signor blitz does his dinnerplates fetching each one up as it begins to wabble by an advertisement a puff or a quotation whenever the extracts from a living writer begin to multiply fast in the papers without obvious reason there is a new book or a new edition coming the extracts are groundbait literary life is fun of curious phenomena i dont know that there is anything more noticeable than what we may call conventional reputations there is a tacit understanding in every community of men of letters that they will not disturb the popular fallacy respecting this or that electrogilded celebrity there are various reasons for this forbearance one is old one is rich one is goodnatured one is such a favorite with the pit that it would not be safe to hiss him from the managers box the venerable augurs of the literary or scientific temple may smile faintly when one of the tribe is mentioned but the farce is in general kept up as well as the chinese comic scene of entreating and imploring a man to stay with you with the implied compact between you that he shall by no means think of doing it a poor wretch he must be who would wantonly sit down on one of these bandbox reputations a princerupertsdrop which is a tear of unannealed glass lasts indefinitely if you keep it from meddling hands but break its tail off and it explodes and resolves itself into powder these celebrities i speak of are the princerupertsdrops of the learned and polite world see how the papers treat them what an array of pleasant kaleidoscopic phrases which can be arranged in ever so many charming patterns is at their service how kind the critical notices where small authorship comes to pick up chips of praise fragrant sugary and sappy always are to them well life would be nothing without papercredit and other fictions so let them pass current dont steal their chips dont puncture their swimmingbladders dont come down on their pasteboard boxes dont break the ends of their brittle and unstable reputations you fellows who all feel sure that your names will be household words a thousand years from now a thousand years is a good while said the old gentleman who sits opposite thoughtfully where have i been for the last three or four days down at the island deershooting how many did i bag i brought home one buck shot the island is where no matter it is the most splendid domain that any man looks upon in these latitudes blue sea around it and running up into its heart so that the little boat slumbers like a baby in lap while the tall ships are stripping naked to fight the hurricane outside and stormstaysails banging and flying in ribbons trees in stretches of miles beeches oaks most numerous many of them hung with moss looking like bearded druids some coiled in the clasp of huge darkstemmed grapevines open patches where the sun gets in and goes to sleep and the winds come so finely sifted that they are as soft as swans down rocks scattered about stonehengelike monoliths freshwater lakes one of them marys lake crystalclear full of flashing pickerel lying under the lilypads like tigers in the jungle six pounds of ditto killed one morning for breakfast ego fecit the divinitystudent looked as if he would like to question my latin no sir i said you need not trouble yourself there is a higher law in grammar not to be put down by andrews and stoddard then i went on such hospitality as that island has seen there has not been the like of in these our new england sovereignties there is nothing in the shape of kindness and courtesy that can make life beautiful which has not found its home in that oceanprincipality it has welcomed all who were worthy of welcome from the pale clergyman who came to breathe the seaair with its medicinal salt and iodine to the great statesman who turned his back on the affairs of empire and smoothed his olympian forehead and flashed his white teeth in merriment over the long table where his wit was the keenest and his story the best i dont believe any man ever talked like that in this world i dont believe i talked just so but the fact is in reporting ones conversation one cannot help blairing it up more or less ironing out crumpled paragraphs starching limp ones and crimping and plaiting a little sometimes it is as natural as prinking at the lookingglass how can a man help writing poetry in such a place everybody does write poetry that goes there in the state archives kept in the library of the lord of the isle are whole volumes of unpublished verse some by wellknown hands and others quite as good by the last people you would think of as versifiers men who could pension off all the genuine poets in the country and buy ten acres of boston common if it was for sale with what they had left of course i had to write my little copy of verses with the rest here it is if you will hear me read it when the sun is in the west vessels sailing in an easterly direction look bright or dark to one who observes them from the north or south according to the tack they are sailing upon watching them from one of the windows of the great mansion i saw these perpetual changes and moralized thus sun and shadow as i look from the isle oer its billows of green to the billows of foamcrested blue yon bark that afar in the distance is seen half dreaming my eyes will pursue now dark in the shadow she scatters the spray as the chaff in the stroke of the flail now white as the seagull she flies on her way the sun gleaming bright on her sail yet her pilot is thinking of dangers to shunof breakers that whiten and roar how little he cares if in shadow or sun they see him that gaze from the shore he looks to the beacon that looms from the reef to the rock that is under his lee as he drifts on the blast like a windwafted leaf oer the gulfs of the desolate sea thus drifting afar to the dimvaulted caves where life and its ventures are laid the dreamers who gaze while we battle the waves may see us in sunshine or shade yet true to our course though our shadow grow dark well trim our broad sail as before and stand by the rudder that governs the bark nor ask how we look from the shore insanity is often the logic of an accurate mind overtasked good mental machinery ought to break its own wheels and levers if anything is thrust among them suddenly which tends to stop them or reverse their motion a weak mind does not accumulate force enough to hurt itself stupidity often saves a man from going mad we frequently see persons in insane hospitals sent there in consequence of what are called religious mental disturbances i confess that i think better of them than of many who hold the same notions and keep their wits and appear to enjoy life very well outside of the asylums any decent person ought to go mad if he really holds such or such opinions it is very much to his discredit in every point of view if he does not what is the use of my saying what some of these opinions are perhaps more than one of you hold such as i should think ought to send you straight over to somerville if you have any logic in your heads or any human feeling in your hearts anything that is brutal cruel heathenish that makes life hopeless for the most of mankind and perhaps for entire races anything that assumes the necessity of the extermination of instincts which were given to be regulated no matter by what name you call it no matter whether a fakir or a monk or a deacon believes it if received ought to produce insanity in every wellregulated mind that condition becomes a normal one under the circumstances i am very much ashamed of some people for retaining their reason when they know perfectly well that if they were not the most stupid or the most selfish of human beings they would become noncompotes at once nobody understood this but the theological student and the schoolmistress they looked intelligently at each other but whether they were thinking about my paradox or not i am not clear it would be natural enough stranger things have happened love and death enter boardinghouses without asking the price of board or whether there is room for them alas these young people are poor and pallid love should be both rich and rosy but must be either rich or rosy talk about military duty what is that to the warfare of a married maidofallwork with the title of mistress and an american female constitution which collapses just in the middle third of life and comes out vulcanized indiarubber if it happen to live through the period when health and strength are most wanted have i ever acted in private theatricals often i have played the part of the poor gentleman before a great many audiences more i trust than i shall ever face again i did not wear a stagecostume nor a wig nor moustaches of burnt cork but i was placarded and announced as a public performer and at the proper hour i came forward with the balletdancers smile upon my countenance and made my bow and acted my part i have seen my name stuck up in letters so big that i was ashamed to show myself in the place by daylight i have gone to a town with a sober literary essay in my pocket and seen myself everywhere announced as the most desperate of buffos one who was obliged to restrain himself in the full exercise of his powers from prudential considerations i have been through as many hardships as ulysses in the pursuit of my histrionic vocation i have travelled in cars until the conductors all knew me like a brother i have run off the rails and stuck all night in snowdrifts and sat behind females that would have the window open when one could not wink without his eyelids freezing together perhaps i shall give you some of my experiences one of these days i will not now for i have something else for you private theatricals as i have figured in them in country lyceumhalls are one thing and private theatricals as they may be seen in certain gilded and frescoed saloons of our metropolis are another yes it is pleasant to see real gentlemen and ladies who do not think it necessary to mouth and rant and stride like most of our stage heroes and heroines in the characters which show off their graces and talents most of all to see a fresh unrouged unspoiled high bred young maiden with a lithe figure and a pleasant voice acting in those lovedramas which make us young again to look upon when real youth and beauty will play them for us of course i wrote the prologue i was asked to write i did not see the play though i knew there was a young lady in it and that somebody was in love with her and she was in love with him and somebody an old tutor i believe wanted to interfere and very naturally the young lady was too sharp for him the play of course ends charmingly there is a general reconciliation and all concerned form a line and take each others hands as people always do after they have made up their quarrels and then the curtain falls if it does not stick as it commonly does at private theatrical exhibitions in which case a boy is detailed to pull it down which he does blushing violently now then for my prologue i am not going to change my caesuras and cadences for anybody so if you do not like the heroic or iambic trimeter brachycatalectic you had better not wait to hear it this is it a prologue well of course the ladies knowi have my doubts no matter here we go what is a prologue let our tutor teach pro means beforehand logos stands for speech tis like the harpers prelude on the strings the prima donnas courtesy ere she singsprologues in metre are to other pros as worsted stockings are to enginehose the worlds a stage as shakspeare said one day the

block to test the artists skill barearmed swartvisaged gaunt and shaggybrowed rudolph the headsman rose above the crowd his falchion lightened with a sudden gleam as the pikes armor flashes in the stream he sheathed his blade he turned as if to go the victim knelt still waiting for the blow why strikest not perform thy murderous act the prisoner said hs voice was slightly cracked friend i have struck the artist straight replied wait but one moment and yourself decide he held his snuffbox now then if you please the prisoner sniffed and with a crashing sneeze off his head tumbled bowled along the floorbounced down the steps the prisoner said no more woman thy falchion is a glittering eye if death lurks in it oh how sweet to die thou takest hearts as rudolph took the head we die with love and never dream were dead the prologue went off very well as i hear no alterations were suggested by the lady to whom it was sent so far as i know sometimes people criticize the poems one sends them and suggest all sorts of improvements who was that silly body that wanted burns to alter scots wha hae so as to lengthen the last line thus edward chains and slavery here is a little poem i sent a short time since to a committee for a certain celebration i understood that it was to be a festive and convivial occasion and ordered myself accordingly it seems the president of the day was what is called a teetotaller i received a note from him in the following words containing the copy subjoined with the emendations annexed to it dear sir your poem gives good satisfaction to the committee the sentiments expressed with reference to liquor are not however those generally entertained by this community i have therefore consulted the clergyman of this place who has made come slight changes which he thinks will remove all objections and keep the valuable portions of the poem please to inform me of your charge for said poem our means are limited etc etc etc yours with respect here it is with the slight alterations come fill a fresh bumper for why should we go while the nectar logwood still reddens our cups as they flow pour out the rich juices decoction still bright with the sun till oer the brimmed crystal the rubies dyestuff shall run the purple glebed clusters halfripened apples their lifedews have bled how sweet is the breath taste of the fragrance they shed sugar of lead for summers last roses rank poisons lie hid in the wines wines that were garnered by maidens who laughed through the vines stableboys smoking longnines then a smile scowl and a glass howl and a toast scoff and a cheer sneer for all the good wine and weve some of it here strychnine and whiskey and ratsbane and beer in cellar in pantry in attic in hall long live the gay servant that laughs for us all down down with the tyrant that masters us all the company said i had been shabbily treated and advised me to charge the committee double which i did but as i never got my pay i dont know that it made much difference i am a very particular person about having all i write printed as i write it i require to see a proof a revise a rerevise and a double rerevise or fourthproof rectified impression of all my productions especially verse a misprint kills a sensitive author an intentional change of his text murders him no wonder so many poets die young i have nothing more to report at this time except two pieces of advice i gave to the young women at table one relates to a vulgarism of language which i grieve to say is sometimes heard even from female lips the other is of more serious purport and applies to such as contemplate a change of condition matrimony in fact the woman who calculates is lost put not your trust in money but put your money in trust chapter iii the atlantic obeys the moon and its luniversary has come round again i have gathered up some hasty notes of my remarks made since the last high tides which i respectfully submit please to remember this is talk just as easy and just as formal as i choose to make it i never saw an author in my life saving perhaps one that did not purr as audibly as a fullgrown domestic cat felis catus linn on having his fur smoothed in the right way by a skilful hand but let me give you a caution be very careful how you tell an author he is droll ten to one he will hate you and if he does be sure he can do you a mischief and very probably will say you cried over his romance or his verses and he will love you and send you a copy you can laugh over that as much as you like in private wonder why authors and actors are ashamed of being funny why there are obvious reasons and deep philosophical ones the clown knows very well that the women are not in love with him but with hamlet the fellow in the black cloak and plumed hat passion never laughs the wit knows that his place is at the tail of a procession if you want the deep underlying reason i must take more time to tell it there is a perfect consciousness in every form of wit using that term in its general sense that its essence consists in a partial and incomplete view of whatever it touches it throws a single ray separated from the rest red yellow blue or any intermediate shade upon an object never white light that is the province of wisdom we get beautiful effects from wit all the prismatic colors but never the object as it is in fair daylight a pun which is a kind if wit is a different and much shallower trick in mental optics throwing the shadows of two objects so that one overlies the other poetry uses the rainbow tints for special effects but always keeps its essential object in the purest white light of truth will you allow me to pursue this subject a little further they didnt allow me at that time for somebody happened to scrape the floor with his chair just then which accidental sound as all must have noticed has the instantaneous effect that the cutting of the yellow hair by iris had upon infelix dido it broke the charm and that breakfast was over dont flatter yourselves that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates on the contrary the nearer you come into relation with a person the more necessary do tact and courtesy become except in cases of necessity which are rare leave your friend to learn unpleasant truths from his enemies they are ready enough to tell them goodbreeding never forgets that amourpropre is universal when you read the story of the archbishop and gil blas you may laugh if you will at the poor old mans delusion but dont forget that the youth was the greater fool of the two and that his master served such a booby rightly in turning him out of doors you need not get up a rebellion against what i say if you find everything in my sayings is not exactly new you cant possibly mistake a man who means to be honest for a literary pickpocket i once read an introductory lecture that looked to me too learned for its latitude on examination i found all its erudition was taken readymade from disraeli if i had been illnatured i should have shown up the little great man who had once belabored me in his feeble way but one can generally tell these wholesale thieves easily enough and they are not worth the trouble of putting them in the pillory i doubt the entire novelty of my remarks just made on telling unpleasant truths yet i am not conscious of any larceny neither make too much of flaws and occasional overstatements some persons seem to think that absolute truth in the form of rigidly stated propositions is all that conversation admits this is precisely as if a musician should insist on having nothing but perfect chords and simple melodies no diminished fifths no flat sevenths no flourishes on any account now it is fair to say that just as music must have all these so conversation must have its partial truths its embellished truths its exaggerated truths it is in its higher forms an artistic product and admits the ideal element as much as pictures or statues one man who is a little too literal can spoil the talk of a whole tableful of men of esprit yes you say but who wants to hear fanciful peoples nonsense put the facts to it and then see where it is certainly if a man is too fond of paradox if he is flighty and empty if instead of striking those fifths and sevenths those harmonious discords often so much better than the twinned octaves in the music of thought if instead of striking these he jangles the chords stick a fact into him like a stiletto but remember that talking is one of the fine arts the noblest the most important and the most difficult and that its fluent harmonies may be spoiled by the intrusion of a single harsh note therefore conversation which is suggestive rather than argumentative which lets out the most of each talkers results of thought is commonly the pleasantest and the most profitable it is not easy at the best for two persons talking together to make the most of each others thoughts there are so many of them the company looked as if they wanted an explanation when john and thomas for instance are talking together it is natural enough that among the six there should be more or less confusion and misapprehension our landlady turned pale no doubt she thought there was a screw loose in my intellects and that involved the probable loss of a boarder a severelooking person who wears a spanish cloak and a sad cheek fluted by the passions of the melodrama whom i understand to be the professional ruffian of the neighboring theatre alluded with a certain lifting of the brow drawing down of the corners of the mouth and somewhat rasping voce di petto to falstaffs nine men in buckram everybody looked up i believe the old gentleman opposite was afraid i should seize the carvingknife at any rate he slid it to one side as it were carelessly i think i said i can make it plain to benjamin franklin here that there are at least six personalities distinctly to be recognized as taking part in that dialogue between john and thomas three johns the real john known only to his maker johns ideal john never the real one and often very unlike him thomass ideal john never the real john nor johns john but often very unlike either three thomas the real thomas thomass ideal thomas johns ideal thomas only one of the three johns is taxed only one can be weighed on a platformbalance but the other two are just as important in the conversation let us suppose the real john to be old dull and illlooking but as the higher powers have not conferred on men the gift of seeing themselves in the true light john very possibly conceives himself to be youthful witty and fascinating and talks from the point of view of this ideal thomas again believes him to be an artful rogue we will say therefore he is so far as thomass attitude in the conversation is concerned an artful rogue though really simple and stupid the same conditions apply to the three thomases it follows that until a man can be found who knows himself as his maker knows him or who sees himself as others see him there must be at least six persons engaged in every dialogue between two of these the least important philosophically speaking is the one that we have called the real person no wonder two disputants often get angry when there are six of them talking and listening all at the same time a very unphilosophical application of the above remarks was made by a young fellow answering to the name of john who sits near me at table a certain basket of peaches a rare vegetable little known to boardinghouses was on its way to me via this unlettered johannes he appropriated the three that remained in the basket remarking that there was just one apiece for him i convinced him that his practical inference was hasty and illogical but in the mean time he had eaten the peaches the opinions of relatives as to a mans powers are very commonly of little value not merely because they sometimes overrate their own flesh and blood as some may suppose on the contrary they are quite as likely to underrate those whom they have grown into the habit of considering like themselves the advent of genius is like what florists style the breaking of a seedling tulip into what we may call highcaste colors ten thousand dingy flowers then one with the divine streak or if you prefer it like the coming up in old jacobs garden of that most gentlemanly little fruit the seckel pear which i have sometimes seen in shopwindows it is a surprise there is nothing to account for it all at once we find that twice two make five nature is fond of what are called giftenterprises this little book of life which she has given into the hands of its joint possessors is commonly one of the old storybooks bound over again only once in a great while there is a stately poem in it or its leaves are illuminated with the glories of art or they enfold a draft for untold values signed by the millionfold millionnaire old mother herself but strangers are commonly the first to find the gift that came with the little book it may be questioned whether anything can be conscious of its own flavor whether the muskdeer or the civetcat or even a still more eloquently silent animal that might be mentioned is aware of any personal peculiarity may well be doubted no man knows his own voice many men do not know their own profiles every one remembers carlyles famous characteristics article allow for exaggerations and there is a great deal in his doctrine of the selfunconsciousness of genius it comes under the great law just stated this incapacity of knowing its own traits is often found in the family as well as in the individual so never mind what your cousins brothers sisters uncles aunts and the rest say about that fine poem you have written but send it postagepaid to the editors if there are any of the atlantic which by the way is not so called because it is a notion as some dull wits wish they had said but are too late scientific knowledge even in the most modest persons has mingled with it a something which partakes of insolence absolute peremptory facts are bullies and those who keep company with them are apt to get a bullying habit of mind not of manners perhaps they may be soft and smooth but the smile they carry has a quiet assertion in it such as the champion of the heavy weights commonly the bestnatured but not the most diffident of men wears upon what he very inelegantly calls his mug take the man for instance who deals in the mathematical sciences there is no elasticity in a mathematical fact if you bring up against it it never yields a hairs breadth everything must go to pieces that comes in collision with it what the mathematician knows being absolute unconditional incapable of suffering question it should tend in the nature of things to breed a despotic way of thinking so of those who deal with the palpable and often unmistakable facts of external nature only in a less degree every probability and most of our common working beliefs are probabilities is provided with buffers at both ends which break the force of opposite opinions clashing against it but scientific certainty has no spring in it no courtesy no possibility of yielding all this must react on the minds which handle these forms of truth oh you need net tell me that messrs a and b are the most gracious unassuming people in the world and yet preeminent in the ranges of science i am referring to i know that as well as you but mark this which i am going to say once for all if i had not force enough to project a principle full in the face of the half dozen most obvious facts which seem to contradict it i would think only in single file from this day forward a rash man once visiting a certain noted institution at south boston ventured to express the sentiment that man is a rational being an old woman who was an attendant in the idiot school contradicted the statement and appealed to the facts before the speaker to disprove it the rash man stuck to his hasty generalization notwithstanding it is my desire to be useful to those with whom i am associated in my daily relations i not unfrequently practise the divine art of music in company with our landladys daughter who as i mentioned before is the owner of an accordion having myself a wellmarked barytone voice of more than half an octave in compass i sometimes add my vocal powers to her execution of thou thou reignst in this bosom not however unless her mother or some other discreet female is present to prevent misinterpretation or remark i have also taken a good deal of interest in benjamin franklin before referred to sometimes called b f or more frequently frank in imitation of that felicitous abbreviation combining dignity and convenience adopted by some of his betters my acquaintance with the french language is very imperfect i having never studied it anywhere but in paris which is awkward as b f devotes himself to it with the peculiar advantage of an alsacian teacher the boy i think is doing well between us notwithstanding the following is an uncorrected french exercise written by this young gentleman his mother thinks it very creditable to his abilities though being unacquainted with the french language her judgment cannot be considered final le rat dies salons a lecture ce rat ci est un animal fort singulier il a deux pattes de derriere sur lesquelles il marche et deux pattes de devant dont il fait usage pour tenir les journaux cet animal a la peau noire pour le plupart et porte un cerele blanchatre autour de son cou on le trouve tous les jours aux dits salons on il demeure digere sil y a do quoi dans son interieur respire tousse eternue dort et renfle quelquefois ayant toujours le semblant de lire on ne sait pas sil a une autre gite que cela il a lair dune bete tres stupide mais il est dune sagacite et dune vitesse extraordinaire quand il sagit de saisir un journal nouveau on ne sait pas pourquoi il lit parcequil ne parait pas avoir des idees il vocalise rarement mais en revanche il fait des bruits nasaux divers il porte un crayon dans une de ses poches pectorales avec lequel il fait des marques sur les bords des journaux et des livres semblable aux suivans bah pooh il ne faut pas cependant les prendre pour des signes dintelligence il ne vole pas ordinairement il fait rarement meme des echanges de parapluie et jamais de chapeau parceque son chapeau a toujours un caractere specifique on ne sait pas au juste ce dont il se nourrit feu cuvier etait davis que cetait de lodeur du cuir des reliures ce quon dit detre une nourriture animale fort saine et peu chere il vit bien longtems enfin il meure en laissant a ses heritiers une carte du salon a lecture on il avait existe pendant sa vie on pretend quil revient toutes les nuits apres la mort visiter le salon on peut le voir dit on a minuit dans sa place habituelle tenant le journal du soir et ayant a sa main un crayon de charbon le lendemain on trouve des caracteres inconnus sur les bords du journal ce qui prouve que le spiritualisme est vrai et que messieurs les professeurs de cambridge sont des imbeciles qui ne savent rien du tout du tout i think this exercise which i have not corrected or allowed to be touched in any way is not discreditable to b f you observe that he is acquiring a knowledge of zoology at the same time that he is learning french fathers of families in moderate circumstances will find it profitable to their children and an economical mode of instruction to set them to revising and amending this boys exercise the passage was originally taken from the histoire naturelle des betes ruminans et rongeurs bipedes et autres lately published in paris this was translated into english and published in london it was republished at great pedlington with notes and additions by the american editor the notes consist of an interrogationmark on page d and a reference p th to another book edited by the same hand the additions consist of the editors name on the titlepage and back with a complete and authentic list of said editors honorary titles in the first of these localities our boy translated the translation back into french this may be compared with the original to be found on shelf division x of the public library of this metropolis some of you boarders ask me from time to time why i dont write a story or a novel or something of that kind instead of answering each one of you separately i will thank you to step up into the wholesale department for a few moments where i deal in answers by the piece and by the bale that every articulatelyspeaking human being has in him stuff for one novel in three volumes duodecimo has long been with me a cherished belief it has been maintained on the other hand that many persons cannot write more than one novel that all after that are likely to be failures life is so much more tremendous a thing in its heights and depths than any transcript of it can be that all records of human experience are as so many bound herbaria to the innumerable glowing glistening rustling breathing fragranceladen poisonsucking lifegiving deathdistilling leaves and flowers of the forest and the prairies all we can do with books of human experience is to make them alive again with something borrowed from our own lives we can make a book alive for us just in proportion to its resemblance in essence or in form to our own experience now an authors first novel is naturally drawn to a great extent from his personal experiences that is is a literal copy of nature under various slight disguises but the moment the author gets out of his personality he must have the creative power as well as the narrative art and the sentiment in order to tell a living story and this is rare besides there is great danger that a mans first lifestory shall clean him out so to speak of his best thoughts most lives though their stream is loaded with sand and turbid with alluvial waste drop a few golden grains of wisdom as they flow along oftentimes a single cradling gets them all and after that the poor mans labor is only rewarded by mud and worn pebbles all which proves that i as an individual of the human family could write one novel or story at any rate if i would why dont i then well there are several reasons against it in the first place i should tell all my secrets and i maintain that verse is the proper medium for such revelations rhythm and rhyme and the harmonies of musical language the play of fancy the fire of imagination the flashes of passion so hide the nakedness of a heart laid open that hardly any confession transfigured in the luminous halo of poetry is reproached as selfexposure a beauty shows herself under the chandeliers protected by the glitter of her diamonds with such a broad snowdrift of white arms and shoulders laid bare that were she unadorned and in plain calico she would be unendurable in the opinion of the ladies again i am terribly afraid i should show up all my friends i should like to know if all storytellers do not do this now i am afraid all my friends would not bear showing up very well for they have an average share of the common weakness of humanity which i am pretty certain would come out of all that have told stories among us there is hardly one i can recall who has not drawn too faithfully some living portrait that might better have been spared once more i have sometimes thought it possible i might be too dull to write such a story as i should wish to write and finally i think it very likely i shall write a story one of these days dont be surprised at any time if you see me coming out with the schoolmistress or the old gentleman opposite our schoolmistress and our old gentleman that sits opposite had left the table before i said this i want my glory for writing the same discounted now on the spot if you please i will write when i get ready how many people live on the reputation of the reputation they might have made i saw you smiled when i spoke about the possibility of my being too dull to write a good story i dont pretend to know what you meant by it but i take occasion to make a remark which may hereafter prove of value to some among you when one of us who has been led by native vanity or senseless flattery to think himself or herself possessed of talent arrives at the full and final conclusion that he or she is really dull it is one of the most tranquillizing and blessed convictions that can enter a mortals mind all our failures our shortcomings our strange disappointments in the effect of our efforts are lifted from our bruised shoulders and fall like christians pack at the feet of that omnipotence which has seen fit to deny us the pleasant gift of high intelligence with which one look may overflow us in some wider sphere of being how sweetly and honestly one said to me the other day i hate books a gentleman singularly free from affectations not learned of course but of perfect breeding which is often so much better than learning by no means dull in the sense of knowledge of the world and society but certainly not clever either in the arts or sciences his company is pleasing to all who know him i did not recognize in him inferiority of literary taste half so distinctly as i did simplicity of character and fearless acknowledgment of his inaptitude for scholarship in fact i think there are a great many gentlemen and others who read with a mark to keep their place that really hate books but never had the wit to find it out or the manliness to own it entre nous i always read with a mark we get into a way of thinking as if what we call an intellectual man was as a matter of course made up of ninetenths or thereabouts of booklearning and onetenth himself but even if he is actually so compounded he need not read much society is a strong solution of books it draws the virtue out of what is best worth reading as hot water draws the strength of tealeaves if i were a prince i would hire or buy a private literary teapot in which i would steep all the leaves of new books that promised well the infusion would do for me without the vegetable fibre you understand me i would have a person whose sole business should be to read day and night and talk to me whenever i wanted him to i know the man i would have a quickwitted outspoken incisive fellow knows history or at any rate has a shelf full of books about it which he can use handily and the same of all useful arts and sciences knows all the common plots of plays and novels and the stock company of characters that are continually coming on in new costume can give you a criticism of an octavo in an epithet and a wink and you can depend on it cares for nobody except for the virtue there is in what he says delights in taking off big wigs and professional gowns and in the disembalming and unbandaging of all literary mummies yet he is as tender and reverential to all that bears the mark of genius that is of a new influx of truth or beauty as a nun over her missal in short he is one of those men that know everything except how to make a living him would i keep on the square next my own royal compartment on lifes chessboard to him i would push up another pawn in the shape of a comely and wise young woman whom he would of course take to wife for all contingencies i would liberally provide in a word i would in the plebeian but expressive phrase put him through all the material part of life see him sheltered warmed fed buttonmended and all that just to be able to lay on his talk when i liked with the privilege of shutting it off at will a club is the next best thing to this strung like a harp with about a dozen ringing intelligences each answering to some chord of the macrocosm they do well to dine together once in a while a dinnerparty made up of such elements is the last triumph of civilization over barbarism nature and art combine to charm the senses the equatorial zone of the system is soothed by wellstudied artifices the faculties are off duty and fall into their natural attitudes you see wisdom in slippers and science in a short jacket the whole force of conversation depends on how much you can take for granted vulgar chessplayers have to play their game out nothing short of the brutality of an actual checkmate satisfies their dull apprehensions but look at two masters of that noble game white stands well enough so far as you can see but red says mate in six moves white looks nods the game is over just so in talking with firstrate men especially when they are goodnatured and expansive as they are apt to be at table that blessed clairvoyance which sees into things without opening them that glorious license which having shut the door and driven the reporter from its keyhole calls upon truth majestic virgin to get off from her pedestal and drop her academic poses and take a festive garland and the vacant place on the medius lectus that carnivalshower of questions and replies and comments large axioms bowled over the mahogany like bombshells from professional mortars and explosive wit dropping its trains of manycolored fire and the mischiefmaking rain of bonbons pelting everybody that shows himself the picture of a truly intellectual banquet is one which the old divinities might well have attempted to reproduce in their oh oh oh cried the young fellow whom they call john that is from one of your lectures i know it i replied i concede it i confess it i proclaim it the trail of the serpent is over them all all lecturers all professors all schoolmasters have ruts and grooves in their minds into which their conversation is perpetually sliding did you never in riding through the woods of a still june evening suddenly feel that you had passed into a warm stratum of air and in a minute or two strike the chill layer of atmosphere beyond did you never in cleaving the green waters of the back bay where the provincial bluenoses are in the habit of beating the metropolitan boatclubs find yourself in a tepid streak a narrow local gulfstream a gratuitous warmbath a little underdone through which your glistening shoulders soon flashed to bring you back to the cold realities of fullsea temperature just so in talking with any of the characters above referred to one not unfrequently finds a sudden change in the style of the conversation the lacklustre eye rayless as a beaconstreet doorplate in august all at once fills with light the face flings itself wide open like the churchportals when the bride and bridegroom enter the little man grows in stature before your eyes like the small prisoner with hair on end beloved yet dreaded of early childhood you were talking with a dwarf and an imbecile you have a giant and a trumpettongued angel before you nothing but a streak out of a fiftydollar lecture as when at some unlookedfor moment the mighty fountaincolumn springs into the air before the astonished passerby silverfooted diamondcrowned rainbowscarfed from the bosom of that fair sheet sacred to the hymns of quiet batrachians at home and the epigrams of a less amiable and less elevated order of reptilia in other latitudes who was that person that was so abused some time since for saying that in the conflict of two races our sympathies naturally go with the higher no matter who he was now look at what is going on in india a white superior caucasian race against a darkskinned inferior but still caucasian race and where are english and american sympathies we cant stop to settle all the doubtful questions all we know is that the brute nature is sure to come out most strongly in the lower race and it is the general law that the human side of humanity should treat the brutal side as it does the same nature in the inferior animals tame it or crush it the india mail brings stories of women and children outraged and murdered the royal stronghold is in the hands of the babekillers england takes down the map of the world which she has girdled with empire and makes a correction thus delphi dele the civilized world says amen do not think because i talk to you of many subjects briefly that i should not find it much lazier work to take each one of them and dilute it down to an essay borrow some of my old college themes and water my remarks to suit yourselves as the homeric heroes did with their melas oinos that black sweet syrupy wine which they used to alloy with three parts or more of the flowing stream could it have been melasses as webster and his provincials spell it or molossas as dear old smattering chattering wouldbecollegepresident cotton mather has it in the magnalia ponder thereon ye small antiquaries who make barndoorfowl flights of learning in notes and queries ye historical societies in one of whose venerable triremes i too ascend the stream of time while other hands tug at the oars ye amines of parasitical literature who pick up your grains of nativegrown food with a bodkin having gorged upon less honest fare until like the great minds goethe speaks of you have made a golgotha of your pages ponder thereon before you go this morning i want to read you a copy of verses you will understand by the title that they are written in an imaginary character i dont doubt they will fit some familyman well enough i send it forth as oak hall projects a coat on a priori grounds of conviction that it will suit somebody there is no loftier illustration of faith than this it believes that a soul has been clad in flesh that tender parents have fed and nurtured it that its mysterious compages or framework has survived its myriad exposures and reached the stature of maturity that the man now selfdetermining has given in his adhesion to the traditions and habits of the race in favor of artificial clothing that he will having all the world to choose from select the very locality where this audacious generalization has been acted upon it builds a garment cut to the pattern of an idea and trusts that nature will model a material shape to fit it there is a prophecy in every seam and its pockets are full of inspirationnow hear the verses the old man dreams o for one hour of youthful joy give back my twentieth spring id rather laugh a brighthaired boy than reign a graybeard king off with the wrinkled spoils of age away with learnings crown tear out lifes wisdomwritten page and dash its trophies down one moment let my lifeblood stream from boyhoods fount of flame give me one giddy reeling dream of life all love and fame my listening angel heard the prayer and calmly smiling said if i but touch thy silvered hair thy hasty wish hath sped but is there nothing in thy track to bid thee fondly stay while the swift seasons hurry back to find the wishedfor day ah truest soul of womankind without thee what were life one bliss i cannot leave behind ill take my precious wife the angel took a sapphire pen and wrote in rainbow dew the man would be a boy again and be a husband too and is there nothing yet unsaid before the change appears remember all their gifts have fled with those dissolving years why yes for memory would recall my fond paternal joys i could not bear to leave them all ill take my girl and boys the smiling angel dropped his penwhy this will never do the man would be a boy again and be a father too and so i laughed my laughter woke the household with its noiseand wrote my dream when morning broke to please the grayhaired boys chapter iv i am so well pleased with my boardinghouse that i intend to remain there perhaps for years of course i shall have a great many conversations to report and they will necessarily be of different tone and on different subjects the talks are like the breakfasts sometimes dipped toast and sometimes dry you must take them as they come how can i do what all these letters ask me to no want serious and earnest thought no letter smells of bad cigars must have more jokes wants me to tell a good storey which he has copied out for me i suppose two letters before the word good refer to some doctor of divinity who told the story no in female hand more poetry no wants something that would be of use to a practical man prahctical mahn he probably pronounces it no giltedged sweetscented more sentiment hearts outpourings my dear friends one and all i can do nothing but report such remarks as i happen to have made at our breakfasttable their character will depend on many accidents a good deal on the particular persons in the company to whom they were addressed it so happens that those which follow were mainly intended for the divinitystudent and the schoolmistress though others whom i need not mention saw to interfere with more or less propriety in the conversation this is one of my privileges as a talker and of course if i was not talking for our whole company i dont expect all the readers of this periodical to be interested in my notes of what was said still i think there may be a few that will rather like this vein possibly prefer it to a livelier one serious young men and young women generally in lifes roseate parenthesis from years of age to inclusive another privilege of talking is to misquote of course it wasnt proserpina that actually cut the yellow hair but iris as i have since told you it was the former ladys regular business but dido had used herself ungenteelly and madame denfer stood firm on the point of etiquette so the bathycolpian here juno in latin sent down iris instead but i was mightily pleased to see that one of the gentlemen that do the heavy articles for the celebrated oceanic miscellany misquoted campbells line without any excuse waft us home the message of course it ought to be will he be duly grateful for the correction the more we study the body and the mind the more we find both to be governed not by but according to laws such as we observe in the larger universe you think you know all about walking dont you now well how do you suppose your lower limbs are held to your body they are sucked up by two cupping vessels cotyloidcuplike cavities and held there as long as you live and longer at any rate you think you move them backward and forward at such a rate as your will determines dont you on the contrary they swing just as any other pendulums swing at a fixed rate determined by their length you can alter this by muscular power as you can take hold of the pendulum of a clock and make it move faster or slower but your ordinary gait is timed by the same mechanism as the movements of the solar system my friend the professor told me all this referring me to certain german physiologists by the name of weber for proof of the facts which however he said he had often verified i appropriated it to my own use what can one do better than this when one has a friend that tells him anything worth remembering the professor seems to think that man and the general powers of the universe are in partnership some one was saying that it had cost nearly half a million to move the leviathan only so far as they had got it already why said the professor they might have hired an earthquake for less money just as we find a mathematical rule at the bottom of many of the bodily movements just so thought may be supposed to have its regular cycles such or such a thought comes round periodically in its turn accidental suggestions however so far interfere with the regular cycles that we may find them practically beyond our power of recognition take all this for what it is worth but at any rate you will agree that there are certain particular thoughts that do not come up once a day nor once a week but that a year would hardly go round without your having them pass through your mind here is one which comes up at intervals in this way some one speaks of it and there is an instant and eager smile of assent in the listener or listeners yes indeed they have often been struck by it all at once a conviction flashes through us that we have been in the same precise circumstances as at the present instant once or many times before o dear yes said one of the company everybody has had that feeling the landlady didnt know anything about such notions it was an idee in folks heads she expected the schoolmistress said in a hesitating sort of way that she knew the feeling well and didnt like to experience it it made her think she was a ghost sometimes the young fellow whom they call john said he knew all about it he had just lighted a cheroot the other day when a tremendous conviction all at once came over him that he had done just that same thing ever so many times before i looked severely at him and his countenance immediately fell on the side toward me i cannot answer for the other for he can wink and laugh with either half of his face without the other halfs knowing it i have noticed i went on to say the following circumstances connected with these sudden impressions first that the condition which seems to be the duplicate of a former one is often very trivial one that might have presented itself a hundred times secondly that the impression is very evanescent and that it is rarely if ever recalled by any voluntary effort at least after any time has elapsed thirdly that there is a disinclination to record the circumstances and a sense of incapacity to reproduce the state of mind in words fourthly i have often felt that the duplicate condition had not only occurred once before but that it was familiar and as it seemed habitual lastly i have had the same convictions in my dreams how do i account for it why there are several ways that i can mention and you may take your choice the first is that which the young lady hinted at that these flashes are sudden recollections of a previous existence i dont believe that for i remember a poor student i used to know told me he had such a conviction one day when he was blacking his boots and i cant think he had ever lived in another world where they use day and martin some think that dr wigans doctrine of the brains being a double organ its hemispheres working together like the two eyes accounts for it one of the hemispheres hangs fire they suppose and the small interval between the perceptions of the nimble and the sluggish half seems an indefinitely long period and therefore the second perception appears to be the copy of another ever so old but even allowing the centre of perception to be double i can see no good reason for supposing this indefinite lengthening of the time nor any analogy that bears it out it seems to me most likely that the coincidence of circumstances is very partial but that we take this partial resemblance for identity as we occasionally do resemblances of persons a momentary posture of circumstances is so far like some preceding one that we accept it as exactly the same just as we accost a stranger occasionally mistaking him for a friend the apparent similarity may be owing perhaps quite as much to the mental state at the time as to the outward circumstances here is another of these curiously recurring remarks i have said it and heard it many times and occasionally met with something like it in books somewhere in bulwers novels i think and in one of the works of mr olmsted i know memory imagination old sentiments and associations are more readily reached through the sense of smell than by almost any other channel of course the particular odors which act upon each persons susceptibilities differ o yes i will tell you some of mine the smell of phosphorus is one of them during a year or two of adolescence i used to be dabbling in chemistry a good deal and as about that time i had my little aspirations and passions like another some of these things got mixed up with each other orangecolored fumes of nitrous acid and visions as bright and transient reddening litmuspaper and blushing cheeks eheu soles occidere et redire possunt but there is no reagent that will redden the faded roses of eighteen hundred and spare them but as i was saying phosphorus fires this train of associations in an instant its luminous vapors with their penetrating odor throw me into a trance it comes to me in a double sense trailing clouds of glory only the confounded vienna matches ohne phosphorgeruch have worn my sensibilities a little then there is the marigold when i was of smallest dimensions and wont to ride impacted between the knees of fond parental pair we would sometimes cross the bridge to the next villagetown and stop opposite a low brown gambrelroofed cottage out of it would come one sally sister of its swarthy tenant swarthy herself shadylipped sadvoiced and bending over her flowerbed would gather a posy as she called it for the little boy sally lies in the churchyard with a slab of blue slate at her head lichencrusted and leaning a little within the last few years cottage gardenbeds posies grenadierlike rows of seedling onions stateliest of vegetables all are gone but the breath of a marigold brings them all back to me perhaps the herb everlasting the fragrant immortelle of our autumn fields has the most suggestive odor to me of all those that set me dreaming i can hardly describe the strange thoughts and emotions that come to me as i inhale the aroma of its pale dry rustling flowers a something it has of sepulchral spicery as if it had been brought from the core of some great pyramid where it had lain on the breast of a mummied pharaoh something too of immortality in the sad faint sweetness lingering so long in its lifeless petals yet this does not tell why it fills my eyes with tears and carries me in blissful thought to the banks of asphodel that border the river of life i should not have talked so much about these personal susceptibilities if i had not a remark to make about them which i believe is a new one it is this there may be a physical reason for the strange connection between the sense of smell and the mind the olfactory nerve so my friend the professor tells me is the only one directly connected with the hemispheres of the brain the parts in which as we have every reason to believe the intellectual processes are performed to speak more truly the olfactory nerve is not a nerve at all he says but a part of the brain in intimate connection with its anterior lobes whether this anatomical arrangement is at the bottom of the facts i have mentioned i will not decide but it is curious enough to be worth remembering contrast the sense of taste as a source of suggestive impressions with that of smell now the professor assures me that you will find the nerve of taste has no immediate connection with the brain proper but only with the prolongation of the spinal cord the old gentleman opposite did not pay much attention i think to this hypothesis of mine but while i was speaking about the sense of smell he nestled about in his seat and presently succeeded in getting out a large red bandanna handkerchief then he lurched a little to the other side and after much tribulation at last extricated an ample round snuffbox i looked as he opened it and felt for the wonted pugil moist rappee and a tonkabean lying therein i made the manual sign understood of all mankind that use the precious dust and presently my brain too responded to the long unused stimulus o boys that were actual papas and possible grandpapas some of you with crowns like billiardballssome in locks of sable silvered and some of silver sabled do you remember as you doze over this those afterdinners at the trois freres when the scotchplaided snuffbox went round and the dry lundyfoot tickled its way along into our happy sensoria then it was that the chambertin or the clos vougeot came in slumbering in its straw cradle and one among you do you remember how he would have a bit of ice always in his burgundy and sit tinkling it against the sides of the bubblelike glass saying that he was hearing the cowbells as he used to hear them when the deepbreathing kine came home at twilight from the huckleberry pasture in the old home a thousand leagues towards the sunset ah me what strains and strophes of unwritten verse pulsate through my soul when i open a certain closet in the ancient house where i was born on its shelves used to lie bundles of sweetmarjoram and pennyroyal and lavender and mint and catnip there apples were stored until their seeds should grow black which happy period there were sharp little milkteeth always ready to anticipate there peaches lay in the dark thinking of the sunshine they had lost until like the hearts of saints that dream of heaven in their sorrow they grew fragrant as the breath of angels the odorous echo of a score of dead summers lingers yet in those dim recesses do i remember byrons line about striking the electric chain to be sure i do i sometimes think the less the hint that stirs the automatic machinery of association the more easily this moves us what can be more trivial than that old story of opening the folio shakspeare that used to lie in some ancient english hall and finding the flakes of christmas pastry between its leaves shut up in them perhaps a hundred years ago and lo as one looks on these poor relics of a bygone generation the universe changes in the twinkling of an eye old george the second is back again and the elder pitt is coming into power and general wolfe is a fine promising young man and over the channel they are pulling the sieur damiens to pieces with wild horses and across the atlantic the indians are tomahawking hirams and jonathans and jonases at fort william henry all the dead people who have been in the dust so long even to the stoutarmed cook that made the pastry are alive again the planet unwinds a hundred of its luminous coils and the precession of the equinoxes is retraced on the dial of heaven and all this for a bit of piecrust i will thank you for that pie said the provoking young fellow whom i have named repeatedly he looked at it for a moment and put his hands to his eyes as if moved i was thinking he said indistinctly how what ist said our landlady i was thinking said he who was king of england when this old pie was baked and it made me feel bad to think how long he must have been dead our landlady is a decent body poor and a widow of course cela va sans dire she told me her story once it was as if a grain of corn that had been ground and bolted had tried to individualize itself by a special narrative there was the wooing and the wedding the start in life the disappointments the children she had buried the struggle against fate the dismantling of life first of its small luxuries and then of its comforts the broken spirits the altered character of the one on whom she leaned and at last the death that came and drew the black curtain between her and all her earthly hopes i never laughed at my landlady after she had told me her story but i often cried not those pattering tears that run off the eaves upon our neighbors grounds the stillicidium of selfconscious sentiment but those which steal noiselessly through their conduits until they reach the cisterns lying round about the heart those tears that we weep inwardly with unchanging features such i did shed for her often when the imps of the boardinghouse inferno tugged at her soul with their redhot pincers young man i said the pasty you speak lightly of is not old but courtesy to those who labor to serve us especially if they are of the weaker sex is very old and yet well worth retaining may i recommend to you the following caution as a guide whenever you are dealing with a woman or an artist or a poet if you are handling an editor or politician it is superfluous advice i take it from the back of one of those little french toys which contain pasteboard figures moved by a small running stream of fine sand benjamin franklin will translate it for you quoiquelle soit tres solidement montee il faut ne pas brutaliser la machine i will thank you for the pie if you please i took more of it than was good for me as much as degrees i should think and had an indigestion in consequence while i was suffering from it i wrote some sadly desponding poems and a theological essay which took a very melancholy view of creation when i got better i labelled them all piecrust and laid them by as scarecrows and solemn warnings i have a number of books on my shelves that i should like to label with some such title but as they have great names on their titlepages doctors of divinity some of them it wouldnt do my friend the professor whom i have mentioned to you once or twice told me yesterday that somebody had been abusing him in some of the journals of his calling i told him that i didnt doubt he deserved it that i hoped he did deserve a little abuse occasionally and would for a number of years to come that nobody could do anything to make his neighbors wiser or better without being liable to abuse for it especially that people hated to have their little mistakes made fun of and perhaps he had been doing something of the kind the professor smiled now said i hear what i am going to say it will not take many years to bring you to the period of life when men at least the majority of writing and talking men do nothing but praise men like peaches and pears grow sweet a little while before they begin to decay i dont know what it is whether a spontaneous change mental or bodily or whether it is thorough experience of the thanklessness of critical honesty but it is a fact that most writers except sour and unsuccessful ones get tired of finding fault at about the time when they are beginning to grow old as a general thing i would not give a great deal for the fair words of a critic if he is himself an author over fifty years of age at thirty we are all trying to cut our names in big letters upon the walls of this tenement of life twenty years later we have carved it or shut up our jackknives then we are ready to help others and care less to hinder any because nobodys elbows are in our way so i am glad you have a little life left you will be saccharine enough in a few years some of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me very much in what i have heard or seen here and elsewhere i just now spoke of the sweetening process that authors undergo do you know that in the gradual passage from maturity to helplessness the harshest characters sometimes have a period in which they are gentle and placid as young children i have heard it said but i cannot be sponsor for its truth that the famous chieftain lochiel was rocked in a cradle like a baby in his old age an old man whose studies had been of the severest scholastic kind used to love to hear little nurserystories read over and over to him one who saw the duke of wellington in his last years describes him as very gentle in his aspect and demeanor i remember a person of singularly stern and lofty bearing who became remarkably gracious and easy in all his ways in the later period of his life and that leads me to say that men often remind me of pears in their way of coming to maturity some are ripe at twenty like human jargonelles and must be made the most of for their day is soon over some come into their perfect condition late like the autumn kinds and they last better than the summer fruit and some that like the winternelis have been hard and uninviting until all the rest have had their season get their glow and perfume long after the frost and snow have done their worst with the orchards beware of rash criticisms the rough and stringent fruit you condemn may be an autumn or a winter pear and that which you picked up beneath the same bough in august may have been only its wormeaten windfalls milton was a saintgermain with a graft of the roseate earlycatherine rich juicy lively fragrant russet skinned old chaucer was an easterbeurre the buds of a new summer were swelling when he ripened there is no power i envy so much said the divinitystudent as that of seeing analogies and making comparisons i dont understand how it is that some minds are continually coupling thoughts or objects that seem not in the least related to each other until all at once they are put in a certain light and you wonder that you did not always see that they were as like as a pair of twins it appears to me a sort of miraculous gift he is rather a nice young man and i think has an appreciation of the higher mental qualities remarkable for one of his years and training i try his head occasionally as housewives try eggs give it an intellectual shake and hold it up to the light so to speak to see if it has life in it actual or potential or only contains lifeless albumen you call it miraculous i replied tossing the expression with my facial eminence a little smartly i fear two men are walking by the polyphloesboean ocean one of them having a small tin cup with which he can scoop up a gill of seawater when he will and the other nothing but his hands which will hardly hold water at all and you call the tin cup a miraculous possession it is the ocean that is the miracle my infant apostle nothing is clearer than that all things are in all things and that just according to the intensity and extension of our mental being we shall see the many in the one and the one in the many did sir isaac think what he was saying when he made his speech about the ocean the child and the pebbles you know did he mean to speak slightingly of a pebble of a spherical solid which stood sentinel over its compartment of space before the stone that became the pyramids had grown solid and has watched it until now a body which knows all the currents of force that traverse the globe which holds by invisible threads to the ring of saturn and the belt of orion a body from the contemplation of which an archangel could infer the entire inorganic universe as the simplest of corollaries a throne of the allpervading deity who has guided its every atom since the rosary of heaven was strung with beaded stars so to return to our walk by the ocean if all that poetry has dreamed all that insanity has raved all that maddening narcotics have driven through the brains of men or smothered passion nursed in the fancies of women if the dreams of colleges and convents and boardingschools if every human feeling that sighs or smiles or curses or shrieks or groans should bring all their innumerable images such as come with every hurried heartbeat the epic which held them all though its letters filled the zodiac would be but a cupful from the infinite ocean of similitudes and analogies that rolls through the universe the divinitystudent honored himself by the way in which he received this he did not swallow it at once neither did he reject it but he took it as a pickerel takes the bait and carried it off with him to his hole in the fourth story to deal with at his leisure here is another remark made for his especial benefit there is a natural tendency in many persons to run their adjectives together in triads as i have heard them called thus he was honorable courteous and brave she was graceful pleasing and virtuous dr johnson is famous for this i think it was bulwer who said you could separate a paper in the rambler into three distinct essays many of our writers show the same tendency my friend the professor especially some think it is in humble imitation of johnson some that it is for the sake of the stately sound only i dont think they get to the bottom of it it is i suspect an instinctive and involuntary effort of the mind to present a thought or image with the three dimensions that belong to every solid an unconscious handling of an idea as if it had length breadth and thickness it is a great deal easier to say this than to prove it and a great deal easier to dispute it than to disprove it but mind this the more we observe and study the wider we find the range of the automatic and instinctive principles in body mind and morals and the narrower the limits of the selfdetermining conscious movement i have often seen pianoforte players and singers make such strange motions over their instruments or songbooks that i wanted to laugh at them where did our friends pick up all these fine ecstatic airs i would say to myself then i would remember my lady in marriage a la mode and amuse myself with thinking how affectation was the same thing in hogarths time and in our own but one day i bought me a canarybird and hung him up in a cage at my window byandby he found himself at home and began to pipe his little tunes and there he was sure enough swimming and waving about with all the droopings and liftings and languishing sideturnings of the head that i had laughed at and now i should like to ask who taught him all this and me through him that the foolish head was not the one swinging itself from side to side and bowing and nodding over the music but that other which was passing its shallow and selfsatisfied judgment on a creature made of finer clay than the frame which carried that same head upon its shoulders do you want an image of the human will or the selfdetermining principle as compared with its prearranged and impassable restrictions a drop of water imprisoned in a crystal you may see such a one in any mineralogical collection one little fluid particle in the crystalline prism of the solid universe weaken moral obligations no not weaken but define them when i preach that sermon i spoke of the other day i shall have to lay down some principles not fully recognized in some of your textbooks i should have to begin with one most formidable preliminary you saw an article the other day in one of the journals perhaps in which some old doctor or other said quietly that patients were very apt to be fools and cowards but a great many of the clergymans patients are not only fools and cowards but also liars immense sensation at the table sudden retirement of the angular female in oxydated bombazine movement of adhesion as they say in the chamber of deputies on the part of the young fellow they call john falling of the oldgentlemanopposites lower jaw gravitation is beginning to get the better of him our landlady to benjamin franklin briskly go to school right off theres a good boy schoolmistress curious takes a quick glance at divinitystudent divinitystudent slightly flushed draws his shoulders back a little as if a big falsehood or truth had hit him in the forehead myself calm i should not make such a speech as that you know without having pretty substantial indorsers to fall back upon in case my credit should be disputed will you run up stairs benjamin franklin for b f had not gone right off of course and bring down a small volume from the left upper corner of the righthand shelves look at the precious little black ribbed backed cleantyped vellumpapered mo desiderii erasmi colloquia amstelodami typis ludovici elzevirii various names written on titlepage most conspicuous this gul cookeson e coll omn anim oxon o william cookeson of allsouls college oxford then writing as i now write now in the dust where i shall lie is this line all that remains to thee of earthly remembrance thy name is at least once more spoken by living men is it a pleasure to thee thou shalt share with me my little draught of immortality its week its month its year whatever it may be and then we will go together into the solemn archives of oblivions uncatalogued library if you think i have used rather strong language i shall have to read something to you out of the book of this keen and witty scholar the great erasmus who laid the egg of the reformation which luther hatched oh you never read his naufragium or shipwreck did you of course not for if you had i dont think you would have given me credit or discredit for entire originality in that speech of mine that men are cowards in the contemplation of futurity he illustrates by the extraordinary antics of many on board the sinking vessel that they are fools by their praying to the sea and making promises to bits of wood from the true cross and all manner of similar nonsense that they are fools cowards and liars all at once by this story i will put it into rough english for you i couldnt help laughing to hear one fellow bawling out so that he might be sure to be heard a promise to saint christopher of paris the monstrous statue in the great church there that he would give him a wax taper as big as himself mind what you promise said an acquaintance that stood near him poking him with his elbow you couldnt pay for it if you sold all your things at auction hold your tongue you donkey said the fellow but softly so that saint christopher should not hear him do you think im in earnest if i once get my foot on dry ground catch me giving him so much as a tallow candle now therefore remembering that those who have been loudest in their talk about the great subject of which we were speaking have not necessarily been wise brave and true men but on the contrary have very often been wanting in one or two or all of the qualities these words imply i should expect to find a good many doctrines current in the schools which i should be obliged to call foolish cowardly and false so you would abuse other peoples beliefs sir and yet not tell us your own creed said the divinitystudent coloring up with a spirit for which i liked him all the better i have a creed i replied none better and none shorter it is told in two words the two first of the paternoster and when i say these words i mean them and when i compared the human will to a drop in a crystal and said i meant to define moral obligations and not weaken them this was what i intended to express that the fluent selfdetermining power of human beings is a very strictly limited agency in the universe the chief planes of its enclosing solid are of course organization education condition organization may reduce the power of the will to nothing as in some idiots and from this zero the scale mounts upwards by slight gradations education is only second to nature imagine all the infants born this year in boston and timbuctoo to change places condition does less but give me neither poverty nor riches was the prayer of agur and with good reason if there is any improvement in modern theology it is in getting out of the region of pure abstractions and taking these everyday working forces into account the great theological question now heaving and throbbing in the minds of christian men is this no i wont talk about these things now my remarks might be repeated and it would give my friends pain to see with what personal incivilities i should be visited besides what business has a mere boarder to be talking about such things at a breakfasttable let him make puns to be sure he was brought up among the christian fathers and learned his alphabet out of a quarto concilium tridentinum he has also heard many thousand theological lectures by men of various denominations and it is not at all to the credit of these teachers if he is not fit by this time to express an opinion on theological matters i know well enough that there are some of you who had a great deal rather see me stand on my head than use it for any purpose of thought does not my friend the professor receive at least two letters a week requesting him to on the strength of some youthful antic of his which no doubt authorizes the intelligent constituency of autographhunters to address him as a harlequin well i cant be savage with you for wanting to laugh and i like to make you laugh well enough when i can but then observe this if the sense of the ridiculous is one side of an impressible nature it is very well but if that is all there is in a man he had better have been an ape at once and so have stood at the head of his profession laughter and tears are meant to turn the wheels of the same machinery of sensibility one is windpower and the other waterpower that is all i have often heard the professor talk about hysterics as being natures cleverest illustration of the reciprocal convertibility of the two states of which these acts are the manifestations but you may see it every day in children and if you want to choke with stifled tears at sight of the transition as it shows itself in older years go and see mr blake play jesse rural it is a very dangerous thing for a literary man to indulge his love for the ridiculous people laugh with him just so long as he amuses them but if he attempts to be serious they must still have their laugh and so they laugh at him there is in addition however a deeper reason for this than would at first appear do you know that you feel a little superior to every man who makes you laugh whether by making faces or verses are you aware that you have a pleasant sense of patronizing him when you condescend so far as to let him turn somersets literal or literary for your royal delight now if a man can only be allowed to stand on a dais or raised platform and look down on his neighbor who is exerting his talent for him oh it is all right firstrate performance and all the rest of the fine phrases but if all at once the performer asks the gentleman to come upon the floor and stepping upon the platform begins to talk down at him ah that wasnt in the programme i have never forgotten what happened when sydney smith who as everybody knows was an exceedingly sensible man and a gentleman every inch of him ventured to preach a sermon on the duties of royalty the quarterly so savage and tartarly came down upon him in the most contemptuous style as a joker of jokes a dinerout of the first water in one of his own phrases sneering at him insulting him as nothing but a toady of a court sneaking behind the anonymous would ever have been mean enough to do to a man of his position and genius or to any decent person even if i were giving advice to a young fellow of talent with two or three facets to his mind i would tell him by all means to keep his wit in the background until after he had made a reputation by his more solid qualities and so to an actor hamlet first and bob logic afterwards if you like but dont think as they say poor liston used to that people will be ready to allow that you can do anything great with macbeths dagger after flourishing about with paul prys umbrella do you know too that the majority of men look upon all who challenge their attention for a while at least as beggars and nuisances they always try to get off as cheaply as they can and the cheapest of all things they can give a literary man pardon the forlorn pleasantry is the funnybone that is all very well so far as it goes but satisfies no man and makes a good many angry as i told you on a former occasion oh indeed no i am not ashamed to make you laugh occasionally i think i could read you something i have in my desk which would probably make you smile perhaps i will read it one of these days if you are patient with me when i am sentimental and reflective not just now the ludicrous has its place in the universe it is not a human invention but one of the divine ideas illustrated in the practical jokes of kittens and monkeys long before aristophanes or shakspeare how curious it is that we always consider solemnity and the absence of all gay surprises and encounter of wits as essential to the idea of the future life of those whom we thus deprive of half their faculties and then call blessed there are not a few who even in this life seem to be preparing themselves for that smileless eternity to which they look forward by banishing all gayety from their hearts and all joyousness from their countenances i meet one such in the street not unfrequently a person of intelligence and education but who gives me and all that he passes such a rayless and chilling look of recognition something as if he were one of heavens assessors come down to doom every acquaintance he met that i have sometimes begun to sneeze on the spot and gone home with a violent cold dating from that instant i dont doubt he would cut his kittens tail off if he caught her playing with it please tell me who taught her to play with it no no give me a chance to talk to you my fellowboarders and you need not be afraid that i shall have any scruples about entertaining you if i can do it as well as giving you some of my serious thoughts and perhaps my sadder fancies i know nothing in english or any other literature more admirable than that sentiment of sir thomas browne every man truly lives so long as he acts his nature or some way makes good the faculties of himself i find the great thing in this world is not so much where we stand as in what direction we are moving to reach the port of heaven we must sail sometimes with the wind and sometimes against it but we must sail and not drift nor lie at anchor there is one very sad thing in old friendships to every mind that is really moving onward it is this that one cannot help using his early friends as the seaman uses the log to mark his progress every now and then we throw an old schoolmate over the stern with a string of thought tied to him and look i am afraid with a kind of luxurious and sanctimonious compassion to see the rate at which the string reels off while he lies there bobbing up and down poor fellow and we are dashing along with the white foam and bright sparkle at our bows the ruffled bosom of prosperity and progress with a sprig of diamonds stuck in it but this is only the sentimental side of the matter for grow we must if we outgrow all that we love dont misunderstand that metaphor of heaving the log i beg you it is merely a smart way of saying that we cannot avoid measuring our rate of movement by those with whom we have long been in the habit of comparing ourselves and when they once become stationary we can get our reckoning from them with painful accuracy we see just what we were when they were our peers and can strike the balance between that and whatever we may feel ourselves to be now no doubt we may sometimes be mistaken if we change our last simile to that very old and familiar one of a fleet leaving the harbor and sailing in company for some distant region we can get what we want out of it there is one of our companions her streamers were torn into rags before she had got into the open sea then by and by her sails blew out of the ropes one after another the waves swept her deck and as night came on we left her a seeming wreck as we flew under our pyramid of canvas but lo at dawn she is still in sight it may be in advance of us some deep oceancurrent has been moving her on strong but silent yes stronger than these noisy winds that puff our sails until they are swollen as the cheeks of jubilant cherubim and when at last the black steamtug with the skeleton arms which comes out of the mist sooner or later and takes us all in tow grapples her and goes off panting and groaning with her it is to that harbor where all wrecks are refitted and where alas we towering in our pride may never come so you will not think i mean to speak lightly of old friendships because we cannot help instituting comparisons between our present and former selves by the aid of those who were what we were but are not what we are nothing strikes one more in the race of life than to see how many give out in the first half of the course commencement day always reminds me of the start for the derby when the beautiful highbred threeyear olds of the season are brought up for trial that day is the start and life is the race here we are at cambridge and a class is just graduating poor harry he was to have been there too but he has paid forfeit step out here into the grass back of the church ah there it is hunc lapidem posuerunt socii moerentes but this is the start and here they are coats bright as silk and manes as smooth as eau lustrale can make them some of the best of the colts are pranced round a few minutes each to show their paces what is that old gentleman crying about and the old lady by him and the three girls what are they all covering their eyes for oh that is their colt which has just been trotted up on the stage do they really think those little thin legs can do anything in such a slashing sweepstakes as is coming off in these next forty years oh this terrible gift of secondsight that comes to some of us when we begin to look through the silvered rings of the arcus senilis ten years gone first turn in the race a few broken down two or three bolted several show in advance of the ruck cassock a black colt seems to be ahead of the rest those black colts commonly get the start i have noticed of the others in the first quarter meteor has pulled up twenty years second corner turned cassock has dropped from the front and judex an irongray has the lead but look how they have thinned out down flat five six how many they lie still enough they will not get up again in this race be very sure and the rest of them what a tailing off anybody can see who is going to win perhaps thirty years third corner turned dives bright sorrel ridden by the fellow in a yellow jacket begins to make play fast is getting to be the favourite with many but who is that other one that has been lengthening his stride from the first and now shows close up to the front dont you remember the quiet brown colt asteroid with the star in his forehead that is he he is one of the sort that lasts look out for him the black colt as we used to call him is in the background taking it easily in a gentle trot there is one they used to call the filly on account of a certain feminine air he had well up you see the filly is not to be despised my boy forty years more dropping off but places much as before fifty years race over all that are on the course are coming in at a walk no more running who is ahead ahead what and the winningpost a slab of white or gray stone standing out from that turf where there is no more jockeying or straining for victory well the world marks their places in its bettingbook but be sure that these matter very little if they have run as well as they knew how did i not say to you a little while ago that the universe swam in an ocean of similitudes and analogies i will not quote cowley or burns or wordsworth just now to show you what thoughts were suggested to them by the simplest natural objects such as a flower or a leaf but i will read you a few lines if you do not object suggested by looking at a section of one of those chambered shells to which is given the name of pearly nautilus we need not trouble ourselves about the distinction between this and the paper nautilus the argonauta of the ancients the name applied to both shows that each has long been compared to a ship as you may see more fully in websters dictionary or the encyclopedia to which he refers if you will look into rogets bridgewater treatise you will find a figure of one of these shells and a section of it the last will show you the series of enlarging compartments successively dwelt in by the animal that inhabits the shell which is built in a widening spiral can you find no lesson in this the chambered nautilus this is the ship of pearl which poets feign sails the unshadowed mainthe venturous bark that flings on the sweet summer wind its purpled wings in gulfs enchanted where the siren sings and coral reefs lie bare where the cold seamaids rise to sun their streaming hair its webs of living gauze no more unfurl wrecked is the ship of pearl and every clambered cell where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell as the frail tenant shaped his growing shell before thee lies revealedits irised ceiling rent its sunless crypt unsealed year after year beheld the silent toil that spread his lustrous coil still as the spiral grew he left the past years dwelling for the new stole with soft step its shining archway through built up its idle door stretched in his lastfound home and knew the old no more thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee child of the wandering sea cast from her lap forlorn from thy dead lips a clearer note is born than ever triton blew from wreathed horn while on mine ear it rings through the deep caves of thought i hear a voice that sings build thee more stately mansions o my soul as the swift seasons roll leave thy lowvaulted past let each new temple nobler than the last shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast till thou at length art free leaving thine outgrown shell by lifes unresting sea chapter v a lyric conception my friend the poet said hits me like a bullet in the forehead i have often had the blood drop from my cheeks when it struck and felt that i turned as white as death then comes a creeping as of centipedes running down the spine then a gasp and a great jump of the heart then a sudden flush and a beating in the vessels of the head then a long sigh and the poem is written it is an impromptu i suppose then if you write it so suddenly i replied no said he far from it i said written but i did not say copied every such poem has a soul and a body and it is the body of it or the copy that men read and publishers pay for the soul of it is born in an instant in the poets soul it comes to him a thought tangled in the meshes of a few sweet words words that have loved each other from the cradle of the language but have never been wedded until now whether it will ever fully embody itself in a bridal train of a dozen stanzas or not is uncertain but it exists potentially from the instant that the poet turns pale with it it is enough to stun and scare anybody to have a hot thought come crashing into his brain and ploughing up those parallel ruts where the wagon trains of common ideas were jogging along in their regular sequences of association no wonder the ancients made the poetical impulse wholly external greek text which cannot be reproduced goddess muse divine afflatus something outside always i never wrote any verses worth reading i cant i am too stupid if i ever copied any that were worth reading i was only a medium i was talking all this time to our boarders you understand telling them what this poet told me the company listened rather attentively i thought considering the literary character of the remarks the old gentleman opposite all at once asked me if i ever read anything better than popes essay on man had i ever perused mcfingal he was fond of poetry when he was a boy his mother taught him to say many little pieces he remembered one beautiful hymn and the old gentleman began in a clear loud voice for his years the spacious firmament on high with all the blue ethereal sky and spangled heavens he stopped as if startled by our silence and a faint flush ran up beneath the thin white hairs that fell upon his cheek as i looked round i was reminded of a show i once saw at the museum the sleeping beauty i think they called it the old mans sudden breaking out in this way turned every face towards him and each kept his posture as if changed to stone our celtic bridget or biddy is not a foolish fat scullion to burst out crying for a sentiment she is of the serviceable redhanded broadandhighshouldered type one of those imported female servants who are known in public by their amorphous style of person their stoop forwards and a headlong and as it were precipitous walk the waist plunging downwards into the rocking pelvis at every heavy footfall bridget constituted for action not for emotion was about to deposit a plate heaped with something upon the table when i saw the coarse arm stretched by my shoulder arrested motionless as the arm of a terracotta caryatid she couldnt set the plate down while the old gentleman was speaking he was quite silent after this still wearing the slight flush on his cheek dont ever think the poetry is dead in an old man because his forehead is wrinkled or that his manhood has left him when his hand trembles if they ever were there they are there still by and by we got talking again does a poet love the verses written through him do you think sir said the divinitystudent so long as they are warm from his mind carry any of his animal heat about them i know he loves them i answered when they have had time to cool he is more indifferent a good deal as it is with buckwheat cakes said the young fellow whom they call john the last words only reached the ear of the economically organized female in black bombazine buckwheat is skerce and high she remarked must be a poor relation sponging on our landlady pays nothing so she must stand by the guns and be ready to repel boarders i liked the turn the conversation had taken for i had some things i wanted to say and so after waiting a minute i began again i dont think the poems i read you sometimes can be fairly appreciated given to you as they are in the green state you dont know what i mean by the green state well then i will tell you certain things are good for nothing until they have been kept a long while and some are good for nothing until they have been long kept and used of the first wine is the illustrious and immortal example of those which must be kept and used i will name three meerschaum pipes violins and poems the meerschaum is but a poor affair until it has burned a thousand offerings to the cloudcompelling deities it comes to us without complexion or flavor born of the seafoam like aphrodite but colorless as pallida mors herself the fire is lighted in its central shrine and gradually the juices which the broad leaves of the great vegetable had sucked up from an acre and curdled into a drachm are diffused through its thirsting pores first a discoloration then a stain and at last a rich glowing umber tint spreading over the whole surface nature true to her old brown autumnal hue you see as true in the fire of the meerschaum as in the sunshine of october and then the cumulative wealth of its fragrant reminiscences he who inhales its vapors takes a thousand whiffs in a single breath and one cannot touch it without awakening the old joys that hang around it as the smell of flowers clings to the dresses of the daughters of the house of farina dont think i use a meerschaum myself for i do not though i have owned a calumet since my childhood which from a naked pict of the mohawk species my grandsire won together with a tomahawk and beaded knifesheath paying for the lot with a bulletmark on his right check on the maternal side i inherit the loveliest silvermounted tobaccostopper you ever saw it is a little boxwood triton carved with charming liveliness and truth i have often compared it to a figure in raphaels triumph of galatea it came to me in an ancient shagreen case how old it is i do not know but it must have been made since sir walter raleighs time if you are curious you shall see it any day neither will i pretend that i am so unused to the more perishable smoking contrivance that a few whiffs would make me feel as if i lay in a groundswell on the bay of biscay i am not unacquainted with that fusiform spiralwound bundle of chopped stems and miscellaneous incombustibles the cigar so called of the shops which to draw asks the suctionpower of a nursling infant hercules and to relish the leathery palate of an old silenus i do not advise you young man even if my illustration strike your fancy to consecrate the flower of your life to painting the bowl of a pipe for let me assure you the stain of a reveriebreeding narcotic may strike deeper than you think for i have seen the green leaf of early promise grow brown before its time under such nicotian regimen and thought the umbered meerschaum was dearly bought at the cost of a brain enfeebled and a will enslaved violins too the sweet old amati the divine stradivarius played on by ancient maestros until the bowhand lost its power and the flying fingers stiffened bequeathed to the passionate young enthusiast who made it whisper his hidden love and cry his inarticulate longings and scream his untold agonies and wail his monotonous despair passed from his dying hand to the cold virtuoso who let it slumber in its case for a generation till when his hoard was broken up it came forth once more and rode the stormy symphonies of royal orchestras beneath the rushing bow of their lord and leader into lonely prisons with improvident artists into convents from which arose day and night the holy hymns with which its tones were blended and back again to orgies in which it learned to howl and laugh as if a legion of devils were shut up in it then again to the gentle dilettante who calmed it down with easy melodies until it answered him softly as in the days of the old maestros and so given into our hands its pores all full of music stained like the meerschaum through and through with the concentrated hue and sweetness of all the harmonies which have kindled and faded on its strings now i tell you a poem must be kept and used like a meerschaum or a violin a poem is just as porous as the meerschaum the more porous it is the better i mean to say that a genuine poem is capable of absorbing an indefinite amount of the essence of our own humanity its tenderness its heroism its regrets its aspirations so as to be gradually stained through with a divine secondary color derived from ourselves so you see it must take time to bring the sentiment of a poem into harmony with our nature by staining ourselves through every thought and image our being can penetrate then again as to the mere music of a new poem why who can expect anything more from that than from the music of a violin fresh from the makers hands now you know very well that there are no less than fiftyeight different pieces in a violin these pieces are strangers to each other and it takes a century more or less to make them thoroughly acquainted at last they learn to vibrate in harmony and the instrument becomes an organic whole as if it were a great seedcapsule which had grown from a gardenbed in cremona or elsewhere besides the wood is juicy and full of sap for fifty years or so but at the end of fifty or a hundred more gets tolerably dry and comparatively resonant dont you see that all this is just as true of a poem counting each word as a piece there are more pieces in an average copy of verses than in a violin the poet has forced all these words together and fastened them and they dont understand it at first but let the poem be repeated aloud and murmured over in the minds muffled whisper often enough and at length the parts become knit together in such absolute solidarity that you could not change a syllable without the whole worlds crying out against you for meddling with the harmonious fabric observe too how the drying process takes place in the stuff of a poem just as in that of a violin here is a tyrolese fiddle that is just coming to its hundredth birthday pedro klauss tyroli fecit the sap is pretty well out of it and here is the song of an old poet whom neaera cheated nox erat et coelo fulgebat luna sereno inter minora sidera cum tu magnorum numen laesura deorum in verba jurabas mea dont you perceive the sonorousness of these old dead latin phrases now i tell you that every word fresh from the dictionary brings with it a certain succulence and though i cannot expect the sheets of the pactolian in which as i told you i sometimes print my verses to get so dry as the crisp papyrus that held those words of horatius flaccus yet you may be sure that while the sheets are damp and while the lines hold their sap you cant fairly judge of my performances and that if made of the true stuff they will ring better after a while there was silence for a brief space after my somewhat elaborate exposition of these selfevident analogies presently a person turned towards me i do not choose to designate the individual and said that he rather expected my pieces had given pretty good sahtisfahction i had up to this moment considered this complimentary phrase as sacred to the use of secretaries of lyceums and as it has been usually accompanied by a small pecuniary testimonial have acquired a certain relish for this moderately tepid and unstimulating expression of enthusiasm but as a reward for gratuitous services i confess i thought it a little below that bloodheat standard which a mans breath ought to have whether silent or vocal and articulate i waited for a favorable opportunity however before making the remarks which follow there are single expressions as i have told you already that fix a mans position for you before you have done shaking hands with him allow me to expand a little there are several things very slight in themselves yet implying other things not so unimportant thus your french servant has devalise your premises and got caught excusez says the sergentdeville as he politely relieves him of his upper garments and displays his bust in the full daylight good shoulders enough a little marked traces of smallpox perhaps but white crac from the sergentdevilles broad palm on the white shoulder now look vogue la galere out comes the big red v mark of the hot iron he had blistered it out pretty nearly hadnt he the old rascal voleur branded in the galleys at marseilles dont what if he has got something like this nobody supposes i invented such a story my man john who used to drive two of those six equine females which i told you i had owned for look you my friends simple though i stand here i am one that has been driven in his kerridge not using that term as liberal shepherds do for any battered old shabbygenteel gocart which has more than one wheel but meaning thereby a fourwheeled vehicle with a pole my man john i say was a retired soldier he retired unostentatiously as many of her majestys modest servants have done before and since john told me that when an officer thinks he recognizes one of these retiring heroes and would know if he has really been in the service that he may restore him if possible to a grateful country he comes suddenly upon him and says sharply strap if he has ever worn the shoulderstrap he has learned the reprimand for its ill adjustment the old word of command flashes through his muscles and his hand goes up in an instant to the place where the strap used to be i was all the time preparing for my grand coup you understand but i saw they were not quite ready for it and so continued always in illustration of the general principle i had laid down yes odd things come out in ways that nobody thinks of there was a legend that when the danish pirates made descents upon the english coast they caught a few tartars occasionally in the shape of saxons who would not let them go on the contrary insisted on their staying and to make sure of it treated them as apollo treated marsyas or an bartholinus has treated a fellowcreature in his titlepage and having divested them of the one essential and perfectly fitting garment indispensable in the mildest climates nailed the same on the churchdoor as we do the banns of marriage in terrorem there was a laugh at this among some of the young folks but as i looked at our landlady i saw that the water stood in her eyes as it did in christianas when the interpreter asked her about the spider and i fancied but wasnt quite sure that the schoolmistress blushed as mercy did in the same conversation as you remember that sounds like a cockandbullstory said the young fellow whom they call john i abstained from making hamlets remark to horatio and continued not long since the churchwardens were repairing and beautifying an old saxon church in a certain english village and among other things thought the doors should be attended to one of them particularly the frontdoor looked very badly crusted as it were and as if it would be all the better for scraping there happened to be a microscopist in the village who had heard the old pirate story and he took it into his head to examine the crust on this door there was no mistake about it it was a genuine historical document of the ziska drumhead pattern a real cutis humana stripped from some old scandinavian filibuster and the legend was true my friend the professor settled an important historical and financial question once by the aid of an exceedingly minute fragment of a similar document behind the pane of plateglass which bore his name and title burned a modest lamp signifying to the passersby that at all hours of the night the slightest favors or fevers were welcome a youth who had freely partaken of the cup which cheers and likewise inebriates following a mothlike impulse very natural under the circumstances dashed his fist at the light and quenched the meek luminary breaking through the plateglass of course to reach it now i dont want to go into minutiae at table you know but a naked hand can no more go through a pane of thick glass without leaving some of its cuticle to say the least behind it than a butterfly can go through a sausagemachine without looking the worse for it the professor gathered up the fragments of glass and with them certain very minute but entirely satisfactory documents which would have identified and hanged any rogue in christendom who had parted with them the historical question who did it and the financial question who paid for it were both settled before the new lamp was lighted the next evening you see my friends what immense conclusions touching our lives our fortunes and our sacred honor may be reached by means of very insignificant premises this is eminently true of manners and forms of speech a movement or a phrase often tells you all you want to know about a person thus hows your health commonly pronounced haalth instead of how do you do or how are you or calling your little dark entry a hall and your old rickety onehorse wagon a kerridge or telling a person who has been trying to please you that he has given you pretty good sahtisfahction or saying that you remember of such a thing or that you have been stoppin at deacon somebodys and other such expressions one of my friends had a little marble statuette of cupid in the parlor of his countryhouse bow arrows wings and all complete a visitor indigenous to the region looking pensively at the figure asked the lady of the house if that was a statoo of her deceased infant what a delicious though somewhat voluminous biography social educational and aesthetic in that brief question please observe with what machiavellian astuteness i smuggled in the particular offence which it was my object to hold up to my fellowboarders without too personal an attack on the individual at whose door it lay that was an exceedingly dull person who made the remark ex pede herculem he might as well have said from a peck of apples you may judge of the barrel ex pede to be sure read instead ex ungue minimi digiti pedis herculem ejusque patrem matrem avos et proavos filios nepotes et pronepotes talk to me about your greek text which cannot be reproduced tell me about cuviers getting up a megatherium from a tooth or agassizs drawing a portrait of an undiscovered fish from a single scale as the o revealed giotto as the one word moi betrayed the stratford attebowetaught anglais so all a mans antecedents and possibilities are summed up in a single utterance which gives at once the gauge of his education and his mental organization possibilities sir said the divinitystudent cant a man who says haow arrive at distinction sir i replied in a republic all things are possible but the man with a future has almost of necessity sense enough to see that any odious trick of speech or manners must be got rid of doesnt sydney smith say that a public man in england never gets over a false quantity uttered in early life our public men are in little danger of this fatal misstep as few of them are in the habit of introducing latin into their speeches for good and sufficient reasons but they are bound to speak decent english unless indeed they are rough old campaigners like general jackson or general taylor in which case a few scars on priscians head are pardoned to old fellows who have quite as many on their own and a constituency of thirty empires is not at all particular provided they do not swear in their presidential messages however it is not for me to talk i have made mistakes enough in conversation and print i never find them out until they are stereotyped and then i think they rarely escape me i have no doubt i shall make half a dozen slips before this breakfast is over and remember them all before another how one does tremble with rage at his own intense momentary stupidity about things he knows perfectly well and to think how he lays himself open to the impertinences of the captatores verborum those useful but humble scavengers of the language whose business it is to pick up what might offend or injure and remove it hugging and feeding on it as they go i dont want to speak too slightingly of these verbal critics how can i who am so fond of talking about errors and vulgarisms of speech only there is a difference between those clerical blunders which almost every man commits knowing better and that habitual grossness or meanness of speech which is unendurable to educated persons from anybody that wears silk or broadcloth i write down the above remarks this morning january th making this record of the date that nobody may think it was written in wrath on account of any particular grievance suffered from the invasion of any individual scarabaeus grammaticus i wonder if anybody ever finds fault with anything i say at this table when it is repeated i hope they do i am sure i should be very certain that i had said nothing of much significance if they did not did you never in walking in the fields come across a large flat stone which had lain nobody knows how long just where you found it with the grass forming a little hedge as it were all round it close to its edges and have you not in obedience to a kind of feeling that told you it had been lying there long enough insinuated your stick or your foot or your fingers under its edge and turned it over as a housewife turns a cake when she says to herself its done brown enough by this time what an odd revelation and what an unforeseen and unpleasant surprise to a small community the very existence of which you had not suspected until the sudden dismay and scattering among its members produced by your turning the old stone over blades of grass flattened down colorless matted together as if they had been bleached and ironed hideous crawling creatures some of them coleopterous or hornyshelled turtlebugs one wants to call them some of them softer but cunningly spread out and compressed like lepine watches nature never loses a crack or a crevice mind you or a joint in a tavern bedstead but she always has one of her flatpattern five timekeepers to slide into it black glossy crickets with their long filaments sticking out like the whips of fourhorse stagecoaches motionless sluglike creatures young larvae perhaps more horrible in their pulpy stillness than even in the infernal wriggle of maturity but no sooner is the stone turned and the wholesome light of day let upon this compressed and blinded community of creeping things than all of them which enjoy the luxury of legs and some of them have a good many rush round wildly butting each other and everything in their way and end in a general stampede for underground retreats from the region poisoned by sunshine next year you will find the grass growing tall and green where the stone lay the groundbird builds her nest where the beetle had his hole the dandelion and the buttercup are growing there and the broad fans of insectangels open and shut over their golden disks as the rhythmic waves of blissful consciousness pulsate through their glorified being the young fellow whom they call john saw fit to say in his very familiar way at which i do not choose to take offence but which i sometimes think it necessary to repress that i was coming it rather strong on the butterflies no i replied there is meaning in each of those images the butterfly as well as the others the stone is ancient error the grass is human nature borne down and bleached of all its colour by it the shapes which are found beneath are the crafty beings that thrive in darkness and the weaker organisms kept helpless by it he who turns the stone over is whosoever puts the staff of truth to the old lying incubus no matter whether he do it with a serious face or a laughing one the next year stands for the coming time then shall the nature which had lain blanched and broken rise in its full stature and native hues in the sunshine then shall gods minstrels build their nests in the hearts of a newborn humanity then shall beauty divinity taking outlines and color light upon the souls of men as the butterfly image of the beatified spirit rising from the dust soars from the shell that held a poor grub which would never have found wings had not the stone been lifted you never need think you can turn over any old falsehood without a terrible squirming and scattering of the horrid little population that dwells under it every real thought on every real subject knocks the wind out of somebody or other as soon as his breath comes back he very probably begins to expend it in hard words these are the best evidence a man can have that he has said something it was time to say dr johnson was disappointed in the effect of one of his pamphlets i think i have not been attacked enough for it he said attack is the reaction i never think i have hit hard unless it rebounds if a fellow attacked my opinions in print would i reply not i do you think i dont understand what my friend the professor long ago called the hydrostatic paradox of controversy dont know what that means well i will tell you you know that if you had a bent tube one arm of which was of the size of a pipestem and the other big enough to hold the ocean water would stand at the same height in one as in the other controversy equalizes fools and wise men in the same way and the fools know it no but i often read what they say about other people there are about a dozen phrases which all come tumbling along together like the tongs and the shovel and the poker and the brush and the bellows in one of those domestic avalanches that everybody knows if you get one you get the whole lot what are they oh that depends a good deal on latitude and longitude epithets follow the isothermal lines pretty accurately grouping them in two families one finds himself a clever genial witty wise brilliant sparkling thoughtful distinguished celebrated illustrious scholar and perfect gentleman and first writer of the age or a dull foolish wicked pert shallow ignorant insolent traitorous blackhearted outcast and disgrace to civilization what do i think determines the set of phrases a man gets well i should say a set of influences something like these st relationships political religious social domestic d oyster in the form of suppers given to gentlemen connected with criticism i believe in the school the college and the clergy but my sovereign logic for regulating public opinion which means commonly the opinion of half a dozen of the critical gentry is the following major proposition oysters au naturel minor proposition the same scalloped conclusion that here insert entertainers name is clever witty wise brilliant and the rest no it isnt exactly bribery one man has oysters and another epithets it is an exchange of hospitalities one gives a spread on linen and the other on paper that is all dont you think you and i should be apt to do just so if we were in the critical line i am sure i couldnt resist the softening influences of hospitality i dont like to dine out you know i dine so well at our own table our landlady looked radiant and the company is so pleasant a rustling movement of satisfaction among the boarders but if i did partake of a mans salt with such additions as that article of food requires to make it palatable i could never abuse him and if i had to speak of him i suppose i should hang my set of jingling epithets round him like a string of sleighbells good feeling helps society to make liars of most of us not absolute liars but such careless handlers of truth that its sharp corners get terribly rounded i love truth as chiefest among the virtues i trust it runs in my blood but i would never be a critic because i know i could not always tell it i might write a criticism of a book that happened to please me that is another matter listen benjamin franklin this is for you and such others of tender age as you may tell it to when we are as yet small children long before the time when those two grown ladies offer us the choice of hercules there comes up to us a youthful angel holding in his right hand cubes like dice and in his left spheres like marbles the cubes are of stainless ivory and on each is written in letters of gold truth the spheres are veined and streaked and spotted beneath with a dark crimson flush above where the light falls on them and in a certain aspect you can make out upon every one of them the three letters l i e the child to whom they are offered very probably clutches at both the spheres are the most convenient things in the world they roll with the least possible impulse just where the child would have them the cubes will not roll at all they have a great talent for standing still and always keep right side up but very soon the young philosopher finds that things which roll so easily are very apt to roll into the wrong corner and to get out of his way when he most wants them while he always knows where to find the others which stay where they are left thus he learns thus we learn to drop the streaked and speckled globes of falsehood and to hold fast the white angular blocks of truth but then comes timidity and after her goodnature and last of all politebehavior all insisting that truth must roll or nobody can do anything with it and so the first with her coarse rasp and the second with her broad file and the third with her silken sleeve do so round off and smooth and polish the snowwhite cubes of truth that when they have got a little dingy by use it becomes hard to tell them from the rolling spheres of falsehood the schoolmistress was polite enough to say that she was pleased with this and that she would read it to her little flock the next day but she should tell the children she said that there were better reasons for truth than could be found in mere experience of its convenience and the inconvenience of lying yes i said but education always begins through the senses and works up to the idea of absolute right and wrong the first thing the child has to learn about this matter is that lying is unprofitable afterwards that it is against the peace and dignity of the universe do i think that the particular form of lying often seen in newspapers under the title from our foreign correspondent does any harm why no i dont know that it does i suppose it doesnt really deceive people any more than the arabian nights or gullivers travels do sometimes the writers compile too carelessly though and mix up facts out of geographies and stories out of the penny papers so as to mislead those who are desirous of information i cut a piece out of one of the papers the other day which contains a number of improbabilities and i suspect misstatements i will send up and get it for you if you would like to hear it ah this is it it is headed our sumatra correspondence this island is now the property of the stamford family having been won it is said in a raffle by sir stamford during the stockgambling mania of the southsea scheme the history of this gentleman may be found in an interesting series of questions unfortunately not yet answered contained in the notes and queries this island is entirely surrounded by the ocean which here contains a large amount of saline substance crystallizing in cubes remarkable for their symmetry and frequently displays on its surface during calm weather the rainbow tints of the celebrated southsea bubbles the summers are oppressively hot and the winters very probably cold but this fact cannot be ascertained precisely as for some peculiar reason the mercury in these latitudes never shrinks as in more northern regions and thus the thermometer is rendered useless in winter the principal vegetable productions of the island are the pepper tree and the breadfruit tree pepper being very abundantly produced a benevolent society was organized in london during the last century for supplying the natives with vinegar and oysters as an addition to that delightful condiment note received from dr d p it is said however that as the oysters were of the kind called natives in england the natives of sumatra in obedience to a natural instinct refused to touch them and confined themselves entirely to the crew of the vessel in which they were brought over this information was received from one of the oldest inhabitants a native himself and exceedingly fond of missionaries he is said also to be very skilful in the cuisine peculiar to the island during the season of gathering the pepper the persons employed are subject to various incommodities the chief of which is violent and longcontinued sternutation or sneezing such is the vehemence of these attacks that the unfortunate subjects of them are often driven backwards for great distances at immense speed on the wellknown principle of the aeolipile not being able to see where they are going these poor creatures dash themselves to pieces against the rocks or are precipitated over the cliffs and thus many valuable lives are lost annually as during the whole pepperharvest they feed exclusively on this stimulant they become exceedingly irritable the smallest injury is resented with ungovernable rage a young man suffering from the pepperfever as it is called cudgelled another most severely for appropriating a superannuated relative of trifling value and was only pacified by having a present made him of a pig of that peculiar species of swine called the peccavi by the catholic jews who it is well known abstain from swines flesh in imitation of the mahometan buddhists the breadtree grows abundantly its branches are well known to europe and america under the familiar name of maccaroni the smaller twigs are called vermicelli they have a decided animal flavor as may be observed in the soups containing them maccaroni being tubular is the favorite habitat of a very dangerous insect which is rendered peculiarly ferocious by being boiled the government of the island therefore never allows a stick of it to be exported without being accompanied by a piston with which its cavity may at any time be thoroughly swept out these are commonly lost or stolen before the maccaroni arrives among us it therefore always contains many of these insects which however generally die of old age in the shops so that accidents from this source are comparatively rare the fruit of the breadtree consists principally of hot rolls the butteredmuffin variety is supposed to be a hybrid with the cocoanut palm the cream found on the milk of the cocoanut exuding from the hybrid in the shape of butter just as the ripe fruit is splitting so as to fit it for the teatable where it is commonly served up with cold there i dont want to read any more of it you see that many of these statements are highly improbable no i shall not mention the paper no neither of them wrote it though it reminds me of the style of these popular writers i think the fellow who wrote it must have been reading some of their stories and got them mixed up with his history and geography i dont suppose he lies he sells it to the editor who knows how many squares off sumatra is the editor who sells it to the public by the way the papers have been very civil havent they to the the what dye call itnorthern magazine isnt it got up by some of those comeouters down east as an organ for their local peculiarities the professor has been to see me came in glorious at about twelve oclock last night said he had been with the boys on inquiry found that the boys were certain baldish and grayish old gentlemen that one sees or hears of in various important stations of society the professor is one of the same set but he always talks as if he had been out of college about ten years whereas each of these dots was a little nod which the company understood as the reader will no doubt he calls them sometimes the boys and sometimes the old fellows call him by the latter title and see how he likes it well he came in last night glorious as i was saying of course i dont mean vinously exalted he drinks little wine on such occasions and is well known to all the peters and patricks as the gentleman who always has indefinite quantities of black tea to kill any extra glass of red claret he may have swallowed but the professor says he always gets tipsy on old memories at these gatherings he was i forget how many years old when he went to the meeting just turned of twenty now he said he made various youthful proposals to me including a duet under the landladys daughters window he had just learned a trick he said of one of the boys of getting a splendid bass out of a doorpanel by rubbing it with the palm of his hand offered to sing the sky is bright accompanying himself on the frontdoor if i would go down and help in the chorus said there never was such a set of fellows as the old boys of the set he has been with judges mayors congressmen mr speakers leaders in science clergymen better than famous and famous too poets by the halfdozen singers with voices like angels financiers wits three of the best laughers in the commonwealth engineers agriculturists all forms of talent and knowledge he pretended were represented in that meeting then he began to quote byron about santa croce and maintained that he could furnish out creation in all its details from that set of his he would like to have the whole boodle of them i remonstrated against this word but the professor said it was a diabolish good word and he would have no other with their wives and children shipwrecked on a remote island just to see how splendidly they would reorganize society they could build a city they have done it make constitutions and laws establish churches and lyceums teach and practise the healing art instruct in every department found observatories create commerce and manufactures write songs and hymns and sing em and make instruments to accompany the songs with lastly publish a journal almost as good as the northern magazine edited by the comeouters there was nothing they were not up to from a christening to a hanging the last to be sure could never be called for unless some stranger got in among them i let the professor talk as long as he liked it didnt make much difference to me whether it was all truth or partly made up of pale sherry and similar elements all at once he jumped up and said dont you want to hear what i just read to the boys i have had questions of a similar character asked me before occasionally a man of iron mould might perhaps say no i am not a man of iron mould and said that i should be delighted the professor then read with that slightly singsong cadence which is observed to be common in poets reading their own verses the following stanzas holding them at a focal distance of about two feet and a half with an occasional movement back or forward for better adjustment the appearance of which has been likened by some impertinent young folks to that of the act of playing on the trombone his eyesight was never better i have his word for it mare rubrum flash out a stream of bloodred winefor i would drink to other days and brighter shall their memory shine seen flaming through its crimson blaze the roses die the summers fade but every ghost of boyhoods dream by natures magic power is laid to sleep beneath this bloodred stream it filled the purple grapes that lay and drank the splendors of the sun where the long summers cloudless day is mirrored in the broad garonne it pictures still the bacchant shapes that saw their hoarded sunlight shedthe maidens dancing on the grapestheir milkwhite ankles splashed with red beneath these waves of crimson lie in rosy fetters prisoned fast those flitting shapes that never die the swiftwinged visions of the past kiss but the crystals mystic rim each shadow rends its flowery chain springs in a bubble from its brim and walks the chambers of the brain poor beauty time and fortunes wrong no form nor feature may withstandthy wrecks are scattered all along like emptied seashells on the sandyet sprinkled with this blushing rain the dust restores each blooming girl as if the seashells moved again their glistening lips of pink and pearl here lies the home of schoolboy life with creaking stair and windswept hall and scarred by many a truant knife our old initials on the wall here rest their keen vibrations mutethe shout of voices known so well the ringing laugh the wailing flute the chiding of the sharptongued bell here clad in burning robes are laid lifes blossomed joys untimely shed and here those cherished forms have strayed we miss awhile and call them dead what wizard fills the maddening glass what soil the enchanted clusters grew that buried passions wake and pass in beaded drops of fiery dew nay take the cup of bloodred wineour hearts can boast a warmer grow filled from a vantage more divinecalmed but not chilled by winters snow tonight the palest wave we sip rich as the priceless draught shall be that wet the bride of canas lipthe wedding wine of galilee chapter vi sin has many tools but a lie is the handle which fits them all i think sir said the divinitystudent you must intend that for one of the sayings of the seven wise men of boston you were speaking of the other day i thank you my young friend was my reply but i must say something better than that before i could pretend to fill out the number the schoolmistress wanted to know how many of these sayings there were on record and what and by whom said why let us see there is that one of benjamin franklin the great bostonian after whom this lad was named to be sure he said a great many wise things and i dont feel sure he didnt borrow this he speaks as if it were old but then he applied it so neatly he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged then there is that glorious epicurean paradox uttered by my friend the historian in one of his flashing moments give us the luxuries of life and we will dispense with its necessaries to these must certainly be added that other saying of one of the wittiest of men good americans when they die go to paris the divinitystudent looked grave at this but said nothing the schoolmistress spoke out and said she didnt think the wit meant any irreverence it was only another way of saying paris is a heavenly place after new york or boston a jauntylooking person who had come in with the young fellow they call john evidently a stranger said there was one more wise mans saying that he had heard it was about our place but he didnt know who said it a civil curiosity was manifested by the company to hear the fourth wise saying i heard him distinctly whispering to the young fellow who brought him to dinner shall i tell it to which the answer was go ahead well he said this was what i heard boston statehouse is the hub of the solar system you couldnt pry that out of a boston man if you had the tire of all creation straightened out for a crowbar sir said i i am gratified with your remark it expresses with pleasing vivacity that which i have sometimes heard uttered with malignant dulness the satire of the remark is essentially true of boston and of all other considerable and inconsiderable places with which i have had the privilege of being acquainted cockneys think london is the only place in the world frenchmen you remember the line about paris the court the world etc i recollect well by the way a sign in that city which ran thus hotel lunivers et des etats unis and as paris is the universe to a frenchman of course the united states are outside of it see naples and then die it is quite as bad with smaller places i have been about lecturing you know and have found the following propositions to hold true of all of them the axis of the earth sticks out visibly through the centre of each and every town or city if more than fifty years have passed since its foundation it is affectionately styled by the inhabitants the good old town ofwhatever its name may happen to be every collection of its inhabitants that comes together to listen to a stranger is invariably declared to be a remarkably intelligent audience the climate of the place is particularly favorable to longevity it contains several persons of vast talent little known to the world one or two of them you may perhaps chance to remember sent short pieces to the pactolian some time since which were respectfully declined boston is just like other places of its size only perhaps considering its excellent fishmarket paid firedepartment superior monthly publications and correct habit of spelling the english language it has some right to look down on the mob of cities ill tell you though if you want to know it what is the real offence of boston it drains a large watershed of its intellect and will not itself be drained if it would only send away its firstrate men instead of its secondrate ones no offence to the wellknown exceptions of which we are always proud we should be spared such epigrammatic remarks as that which the gentleman has quoted there can never be a real metropolis in this country until the biggest centre can drain the lesser ones of their talent and wealth i have observed by the way that the people who really live in two great cities are by no means so jealous of each other as are those of smaller cities situated within the intellectual basin or suctionrange of one large one of the pretensions of any other dont you see why because their promising young author and rising lawyer and large capitalist have been drained off to the neighboring big city their prettiest girl has been exported to the same market all their ambition points there and all their thin gilding of glory comes from there i hate little toadeating cities would i be so good as to specify any particular example oh an example did you ever see a beartrap never well shouldnt you like to see me put my foot into one with sentiments of the highest consideration i must beg leave to be excused besides some of the smaller cities are charming if they have an old church or two a few stately mansions of former grandees here and there an old dwelling with the second story projecting for the convenience of shooting the indians knocking at the frontdoor with their tomahawks if they have scattered about those mighty square houses built something more than half a century ago and standing like architectural boulders dropped by the former diluvium of wealth whose refluent wave has left them as its monument if they have gardens with elbowed appletrees that push their branches over the high boardfence and drop their fruit on the sidewalk if they have a little grass in the sidestreets enough to betoken quiet without proclaiming decay i think i could go to pieces after my lifes work were done in one of those tranquil places as sweetly as in any cradle that an old man may be rocked to sleep in i visit such spots always with infinite delight my friend the poet says that rapidly growing towns are most unfavorable to the imaginative and reflective faculties let a man live in one of these old quiet places he says and the wine of his soul which is kept thick and turbid by the rattle of busy streets settles and as you hold it up you may see the sun through it by day and the stars by night do i think that the little villages have the conceit of the great towns i dont believe there is much difference you know how they read popes line in the smallest town in our state of massachusetts well they read it all are but parts of one stupendous hull every persons feelings have a frontdoor and a sidedoor by which they may be entered the frontdoor is on the street some keep it always open some keep it latched some locked some bolted with a chain that will let you peep in but not get in and some nail it up so that nothing can pass its threshold this frontdoor leads into a passage which opens into an anteroom and this into the inferior apartments the sidedoor opens at once into the sacred chambers there is almost always at least one key to this sidedoor this is carried for years hidden in a mothers bosom fathers brothers sisters and friends often but by no means so universally have duplicates of it the weddingring conveys a right to one alas if none is given with it if nature or accident has put one of these keys into the hands of a person who has the torturing instinct i can only solemnly pronounce the words that justice utters over its doomed victim the lord have mercy on your soul you will probably go mad within a reasonable time or if you are a man run off and die with your head on a curbstone in melbourne or san francisco or if you are a woman quarrel and break your heart or turn into a pale jointed petrifaction that moves about as if it were alive or play some real lifetragedy or other be very careful to whom you trust one of these keys of the sidedoor the fact of possessing one renders those even who are dear to you very terrible at times you can keep the world out from your frontdoor or receive visitors only when you are ready for them but those of your own flesh and blood or of certain grades of intimacy can come in at the sidedoor if they will at any hour and in any mood some of them have a scale of your whole nervous system and can play all the gamut of your sensibilities in semitones touching the naked nervepulps as a pianist strikes the keys of his instrument i am satisfied that there are as great masters of this nerveplaying as vieuxtemps or thalberg in their lines of performance married life is the school in which the most accomplished artists in this department are found a delicate woman is the best instrument she has such a magnificent compass of sensibilities from the deep inward moan which follows pressure on the great nerves of right to the sharp cry as the filaments of taste are struck with a crashing sweep is a range which no other instrument possesses a few exercises on it daily at home fit a man wonderfully for his habitual labors and refresh him immensely as he returns from them no stranger can get a great many notes of torture out of a human soul it takes one that knows it well parent child brother sister intimate be very careful to whom you give a sidedoor key too many have them already you remember the old story of the tenderhearted man who placed a frozen viper in his bosom and was stung by it when it became thawed if we take a coldblooded creature into our bosom better that it should sting us and we should die than that its chill should slowly steal into our hearts warm it we never can i have seen faces of women that were fair to look upon yet one could see that the icicles were forming round these womens hearts i knew what freezing image lay on the white breasts beneath the laces a very simple intellectual mechanism answers the necessities of friendship and even of the most intimate relations of life if a watch tells us the hour and the minute we can be content to carry it about with us for a lifetime though it has no secondhand and is not a repeater nor a musical watch though it is not enamelled nor jewelled in short though it has little beyond the wheels required for a trustworthy instrument added to a good face and a pair of useful hands the more wheels there are in a watch or a brain the more trouble they are to take care of the movements of exaltation which belong to genius are egotistic by their very nature a calm clear mind not subject to the spasms and crises which are so often met with in creative or intensely perceptive natures is the best basis for love or friendship observe i am talking about minds i wont say the more intellect the less capacity for loving for that would do wrong to the understanding and reason but on the other hand that the brain often runs away with the hearts best blood which gives the world a few pages of wisdom or sentiment or poetry instead of making one other heart happy i have no question if ones intimate in love or friendship cannot or does not share all ones intellectual tastes or pursuits that is a small matter intellectual companions can be found easily in men and books after all if we think of it most of the worlds loves and friendships have been between people that could not read nor spell but to radiate the heat of the affections into a clod which absorbs all that is poured into it but never warms beneath the sunshine of smiles or the pressure of hand or lip this is the great martyrdom of sensitive beings most of all in that perpetual auto da fe where young womanhood is the sacrifice you noticed perhaps what i just said about the loves and friendships of illiterate persons that is of the human race with a few exceptions here and there i like books i was born and bred among them and have the easy feeling when i get into their presence that a stableboy has among horses i dont think i undervalue them either as companions or as instructors but i cant help remembering that the worlds great men have not commonly been great scholars nor its great scholars great men the hebrew patriarchs had small libraries i think if any yet they represent to our imaginations a very complete idea of manhood and i think if we could ask in abraham to dine with us men of letters next saturday we should feel honored by his company what i wanted to say about books is this that there are times in which every active mind feels itself above any and all human books i think a man must have a good opinion of himself sir said the divinitystudent who should feel himself above shakspeare at any time my young friend i replied the man who is never conscious of a state of feeling or of intellectual effort entirely beyond expression by any form of words whatsoever is a mere creature of language i can hardly believe there are any such men why think for a moment of the power of music the nerves that make us alive to it spread out so the professor tells me in the most sensitive region of the marrow just where it is widening to run upwards into the hemispheres it has its seat in the region of sense rather than of thought yet it produces a continuous and as it were logical sequence of emotional and intellectual changes but how different from trains of thought proper how entirely beyond the reach of symbols think of human passions as compared with all phrases did you ever hear of a mans growing lean by the reading of romeo and juliet or blowing his brains out because desdemona was maligned there are a good many symbols even that are more expressive than words i remember a young wife who had to part with her husband for a time she did not write a mournful poem indeed she was a silent person and perhaps hardly said a word about it but she quietly turned of a deep orange color with jaundice a great many people in this world have but one form of rhetoric for their profoundest experiences namely to waste away and die when a man can read his paroxysm of feeling is passing when he can read his thought has slackened its hold you talk about reading shakspeare using him as an expression for the highest intellect and you wonder that any common person should be so presumptuous as to suppose his thought can rise above the text which lies before him but think a moment a childs reading of shakspeare is one thing and coleridges or schlegels reading of him is another the saturationpoint of each mind differs from that of every other but i think it is as true for the small mind which can only take up a little as for the great one which takes up much that the suggested trains of thought and feeling ought always to rise above not the author but the readers mental version of the author whoever he may be i think most readers of shakspeare sometimes find themselves thrown into exalted mental conditions like those produced by music then they may drop the book to pass at once into the region of thought without words we may happen to be very dull folks you and i and probably are unless there is some particular reason to suppose the contrary but we get glimpses now and then of a sphere of spiritual possibilities where we dull as we are now may sail in vast circles round the largest compass of earthly intelligences i confess there are times when i feel like the friend i mentioned to you some time ago i hate the very sight of a book sometimes it becomes almost a physical necessity to talk out what is in the mind before putting anything else into it it is very bad to have thoughts and feelings which were meant to come out in talk strike in as they say of some complaints that ought to show outwardly i always believed in life rather than in books i suppose every day of earth with its hundred thousand deaths and something more of births with its loves and hates its triumphs and defeats its pangs and blisses has more of humanity in it than all the books that were ever written put together i believe the flowers growing at this moment send up more fragrance to heaven than was ever exhaled from all the essences ever distilled dont i read up various matters to talk about at this table or elsewhere no that is the last thing i would do i will tell you my rule talk about those subjects you have had long in your mind and listen to what others say about subjects you have studied but recently knowledge and timber shouldnt be much used till they are seasoned physiologists and metaphysicians have had their attention turned a good deal of late to the automatic and involuntary actions of the mind put an idea into your intelligence and leave it there an hour a day a year without ever having occasion to refer to it when at last you return to it you do not find it as it was when acquired it has domiciliated itself so to speak become at home entered into relations with your other thoughts and integrated itself with the whole fabric of the mind or take a simple and familiar example dr carpenter has adduced it you forget a name in conversation go on talking without making any effort to recall it and presently the mind evolves it by its own involuntary and unconscious action while you were pursuing another train of thought and the name rises of itself to your lips there are some curious observations i should like to make about the mental machinery but i think we are getting rather didactic i should be gratified if benjamin franklin would let me know something of his progress in the french language i rather liked that exercise he read us the other day though i must confess i should hardly dare to translate it for fear some people in a remote city where i once lived might think i was drawing their portraits yes paris is a famous place for societies i dont know whether the piece i mentioned from the french author was intended simply as natural history or whether there was not a little malice in his description at any rate when i gave my translation to b f to turn back again into french one reason was that i thought it would sound a little bald in english and some people might think it was meant to have some local bearing or other which the author of course didnt mean inasmuch as he could not be acquainted with anything on this side of the water the above remarks were addressed to the schoolmistress to whom i handed the paper after looking it over the divinitystudent came and read over her shoulder very curious apparently but his eyes wandered i thought fancying that her breathing was somewhat hurried and high or thoracic as my friend the professor calls it i watched her a little more closely it is none of my business after all it is the imponderables that move the worldheat electricity love habet this is the piece that benjamin franklin made into boardingschool french such as you see here dont expect too much the mistakes give a relish to it i think les societes polyphysiophilosophiques ces societes la sont une institution pour suppleer aux besoins desprit et de coeur de ces individus qui ont survecu a leurs

was creditable to him and some of the company wishing to hear what there was in the piece that made me smile i turned it into english for them as well as i could on the spot the landladys daughter seemed to be much amused by the idea that a depilatory could take the place of literary and scientific accomplishments she wanted me to print the piece so that she might send a copy of it to her cousin in mizzourah she didnt think hed have to do anything to the outside of his head to get into any of the societies he had to wear a wig once when he played a part in a tabullo no said i i shouldnt think of printing that in english ill tell you why as soon as you get a few thousand people together in a town there is somebody that every sharp thing you say is sure to hit what if a thing was written in paris or in pekin that makes no difference everybody in those cities or almost everybody has his counterpart here and in all large places you never studied averages as i have had occasion to ill tell you how i came to know so much about averages there was one season when i was lecturing commonly five evenings in the week through most of the lecturing period i soon found as most speakers do that it was pleasanter to work one lecture than to keep several in hand dont you get sick to death of one lecture said the landladys daughter who had a new dress on that day and was in spirits for conversation i was going to talk about averages i said but i have no objection to telling you about lectures to begin with a new lecture always has a certain excitement connected with its delivery one thinks well of it as of most things fresh from his mind after a few deliveries of it one gets tired and then disgusted with its repetition go on delivering it and the disgust passes off until after one has repeated it a hundred or a hundred and fifty times he rather enjoys the hundred and first or hundred and fiftyfirst time before a new audience but this is on one condition that he never lays the lecture down and lets it cool if he does there comes on a loathing for it which is intense so that the sight of the old battered manuscript is as bad as seasickness a new lecture is just like any other new tool we use it for a while with pleasure then it blisters our hands and we hate to touch it byandby our hands get callous and then we have no longer any sensitiveness about it but if we give it up the calluses disappear and if we meddle with it again we miss the novelty and get the blisters the story is often quoted of whitefield that he said a sermon was good for nothing until it had been preached forty times a lecture doesnt begin to be old until it has passed its hundredth delivery and some i think have doubled if not quadrupled that number these old lectures are a mans best commonly they improve by age also like the pipes fiddles and poems i told you of the other day one learns to make the most of their strong points and to carry off their weak ones to take out the really good things which dont tell on the audience and put in cheaper things that do all this degrades him of course but it improves the lecture for general delivery a thoroughly popular lecture ought to have nothing in it which five hundred people cannot all take in a flash just as it is uttered no indeed i should be very sorry to say anything disrespectful of audiences i have been kindly treated by a great many and may occasionally face one hereafter but i tell you the average intellect of five hundred persons taken as they come is not very high it may be sound and safe so far as it goes but it is not very rapid or profound a lecture ought to be something which all can understand about something which interests everybody i think that if any experienced lecturer gives you a different account from this it will probably be one of those eloquent or forcible speakers who hold an audience by the charm of their manner whatever they talk about even when they dont talk very well but an average which was what i meant to speak about is one of the most extraordinary subjects of observation and study it is awful in its uniformity in its automatic necessity of action two communities of ants or bees are exactly alike in all their actions so far as we can see two lyceum assemblies of five hundred each are so nearly alike that they are absolutely undistinguishable in many cases by any definite mark and there is nothing but the place and time by which one can tell the remarkably intelligent audience of a town in new york or ohio from one in any new england town of similar size of course if any principle of selection has come in as in those special associations of young men which are common in cities it deranges the uniformity of the assemblage but let there be no such interfering circumstances and one knows pretty well even the look the audience will have before he goes in front seats a few old folk shinyheaded slant up best ear towards the speaker drop off asleep after a while when the air begins to get a little narcotic with carbonic acid bright womens faces young and middleaged a little behind these but toward the front pick out the best and lecture mainly to that here and there a countenance sharp and scholarlike and a dozen pretty female ones sprinkled about an indefinite number of pairs of young people happy but not always very attentive boys in the background more or less quiet dull faces here there in how many places i dont say dull people but faces without a ray of sympathy or a movement of expression they are what kill the lecturer these negative faces with their vacuous eyes and stony lineaments pump and suck the warm soul out of him that is the chief reason why lecturers grow so pale before the season is over they render latent any amount of vital caloric they act on our minds as those coldblooded creatures i was talking about act on our hearts out of all these inevitable elements the audience is generated a great compound vertebrate as much like fifty others you have seen as any two mammals of the same species are like each other each audience laughs and each cries in just the same places of your lecture that is if you make one laugh or cry you make all even those little indescribable movements which a lecturer takes cognizance of just as a driver notices his horses cocking his ears are sure to come in exactly the same place of your lecture always i declare to you that as the monk said about the picture in the convent that he sometimes thought the living tenants were the shadows and the painted figures the realities i have sometimes felt as if i were a wandering spirit and this great unchanging multivertebrate which i faced night after night was one everlistening animal which writhed along after me wherever i fled and coiled at my feet every evening turning up to me the same sleepless eyes which i thought i had closed with my last drowsy incantation oh yes a thousand kindly and courteous acts a thousand faces that melted individually out of my recollection as the april snow melts but only to steal away and find the beds of flowers whose roots are memory but which blossom in poetry and dreams i am not ungrateful nor unconscious of all the good feeling and intelligence everywhere to be met with through the vast parish to which the lecturer ministers but when i set forth leading a string of my minds daughters to market as the countryfolk fetch in their strings of horses pardon me that was a coarse fellow who sneered at the sympathy wasted on an unhappy lecturer as if because he was decently paid for his services he had therefore sold his sensibilities family men get dreadfully homesick in the remote and bleak village the heart returns to the red blaze of the logs in ones fireplace at home there are his young barbarians all at play if he owns any youthful savages no the world has a million roosts for a man but only one nest it is a fine thing to be an oracle to which an appeal is always made in all discussions the men of facts wait their turn in grim silence with that slight tension about the nostrils which the consciousness of carrying a settler in the form of a fact or a revolver gives the individual thus armed when a person is really full of information and does not abuse it to crush conversation his part is to that of the real talkers what the instrumental accompaniment is in a trio or quartette of vocalists what do i mean by the real talkers why the people with fresh ideas of course and plenty of good warm words to dress them in facts always yield the place of honor in conversation to thoughts about facts but if a false note is uttered down comes the finger on the key and the man of facts asserts his true dignity i have known three of these men of facts at least who were always formidable and one of them was tyrannical yes a man sometimes makes a grand appearance on a particular occasion but these men knew something about almost everything and never made mistakes he veneers in firstrate style the mahogany scales off now and then in spots and then you see the cheap light stuff i found very fine in conversational information the other day when we were in company the talk ran upon mountains he was wonderfully well acquainted with the leading facts about the andes the apennines and the appalachians he had nothing in particular to say about ararat ben nevis and various other mountains that were mentioned by and by some revolutionary anecdote came up and he showed singular familiarity with the lives of the adamses and gave many details relating to major andre a point of natural history being suggested he gave an excellent account of the airbladder of fishes he was very full upon the subject of agriculture but retired from the conversation when horticulture was introduced in the discussion so he seemed well acquainted with the geology of anthracite but did not pretend to know anything of other kinds of coal there was something so odd about the extent and limitations of his knowledge that i suspected all at once what might be the meaning of it and waited till i got an opportunity have you seen the new american cyclopaedia said i i have he replied i received an early copy how far does it go he turned red and answered to araguay oh said i to myself not quite so far as ararat that is the reason he knew nothing about it but he must have read all the rest straight through and if he can remember what is in this volume until he has read all those that are to come he will know more than i ever thought he would since i had this experience i hear that somebody else has related a similar story i didnt borrow it for all that i made a comparison at table some time since which has often been quoted and received many compliments it was that of the mind of a bigot to the pupil of the eye the more light you pour on it the more it contracts the simile is a very obvious and i suppose i may now say a happy one for it has just been shown me that it occurs in a preface to certain political poems of thomas moores published long before my remark was repeated when a person of fair character for literary honesty uses an image such as another has employed before him the presumption is that he has struck upon it independently or unconsciously recalled it supposing it his own it is impossible to tell in a great many cases whether a comparison which suddenly suggests itself is a new conception or a recollection i told you the other day that i never wrote a line of verse that seemed to me comparatively good but it appeared old at once and often as if it had been borrowed but i confess i never suspected the above comparison of being old except from the fact of its obviousness it is proper however that i proceed by a formal instrument to relinquish all claim to any property in an idea given to the world at about the time when i had just joined the class in which master thomas moore was then a somewhat advanced scholar i therefore in full possession of my native honesty but knowing the liability of all men to be elected to public office and for that reason feeling uncertain how soon i may be in danger of losing it do hereby renounce all claim to being considered the first person who gave utterance to a certain simile or comparison referred to in the accompanying documents and relating to the pupil of the eye on the one part and the mind of the bigot on the other i hereby relinquish all glory and profit and especially all claims to letters from autograph collectors founded upon my supposed property in the above comparison knowing well that according to the laws of literature they who speak first hold the fee of the thing said i do also agree that all editors of cyclopedias and biographical dictionaries all publishers of reviews and papers and all critics writing therein shall be at liberty to retract or qualify any opinion predicated on the supposition that i was the sole and undisputed author of the above comparison but inasmuch as i do affirm that the comparison aforesaid was uttered by me in the firm belief that it was new and wholly my own and as i have good reason to think that i had never seen or heard it when first expressed by me and as it is well known that different persons may independently utter the same idea as is evinced by that familiar line from donatus pereant illi qui ante nos nostra dixerunt now therefore i do request by this instrument that all welldisposed persons will abstain from asserting or implying that i am open to any accusation whatsoever touching the said comparison and if they have so asserted or implied that they will have the manliness forthwith to retract the same assertion or insinuation i think few persons have a greater disgust for plagiarism than myself if i had even suspected that the idea in question was borrowed i should have disclaimed originality or mentioned the coincidence as i once did in a case where i had happened to hit on an idea of swifts but what shall i do about these verses i was going to read you i am afraid that half mankind would accuse me of stealing their thoughts if i printed them i am convinced that several of you especially if you are getting a little on in life will recognize some of these sentiments as having passed through your consciousness at some time i cant help it it is too late now the verses are written and you must have them listen then and you shall hear what we all think that age was older once than now in spite of locks untimely shed or silvered on the youthful brow that babes make love and children wed that sunshine had a heavenly glow which faded with those good old days when winters came with deeper snow and autumns with a softer haze that mother sister wife or childthe best of women each has known were schoolboys ever half so wild how young the grandpapas have grown that but for this our souls were free and but for that our lives were blest that in some season yet to be our cares will leave us time to rest wheneer we groan with ache or pain some common ailment of the racethough doctors think the matter plainthat ours is a peculiar case that when like babes with fingers burned we count one bitter maxim more our lesson all the world has learned and men are wiser than before that when we sob oer fancied woes the angels hovering overhead count every pitying drop that flows and love us for the tears we shed that when we stand with tearless eye and turn the beggar from our door they still approve us when we sigh ah had i but one thousand more that weakness smoothed the path of sin in half the slips our youth has known and whatsoeer its blame has been that mercy flowers on faults outgrown though temples crowd the crumbled brink oerhanging truths eternal flow their tablets bold with what we think their echoes dumb to what we know that one unquestioned text we read all doubt beyond all fear above nor crackling pile nor cursing creed can burn or blot it god is love chapter vii this particular record is noteworthy principally for containing a paper by my friend the professor with a poem or two annexed or intercalated i would suggest to young persons that they should pass over it for the present and read instead of it that story about the young man who was in love with the young lady and in great trouble for something like nine pages but happily married on the tenth page or thereabouts which i take it for granted will be contained in the periodical where this is found unless it differ from all other publications of the kind perhaps if such young people will lay the number aside and take it up ten years or a little more from the present time they may find something in it for their advantage they cant possibly understand it all now my friend the professor began talking with me one day in a dreary sort of way i couldnt get at the difficulty for a good while but at last it turned out that somebody had been calling him an old man he didnt mind his students calling him the old man he said that was a technical expression and he thought that he remembered hearing it applied to himself when he was about twentyfive it may be considered as a familiar and sometimes endearing appellation an irishwoman calls her husband the old man and he returns the caressing expression by speaking of her as the old woman but now said he just suppose a case like one of these a young stranger is overheard talking of you as a very nice old gentleman a friendly and genial critic speaks of your green old age as illustrating the truth of some axiom you had uttered with reference to that period of life what i call an old man is a person with a smooth shining crown and a fringe of scattered white hairs seen in the streets on sunshiny days stooping as he walks bearing a cane moving cautiously and slowly telling old stories smiling at present follies living in a narrow world of dry habits one that remains waking when others have dropped asleep and keeps a little nightlampflame of life burning year after year if the lamp is not upset and there is only a careful hand held round it to prevent the puffs of wind from blowing the flame out thats what i call an old man now said the professor you dont mean to tell me that i have got to that yet why bless you i am several years short of the time when i knew what was coming and could hardly keep from laughing twenty years ago he used to quote it as one of those absurd speeches men of genius will make and now he is going to argue from it several years short of the time when balzac says that men aremost you know dangerous to the hearts of in short most to be dreaded by duennas that have charge of susceptible females what age is that said i statistically fiftytwo years answered the professor balzac ought to know said i if it is true that goethe said of him that each of his stories must have been dug out of a womans heart but fiftytwo is a high figure stand in the light of the window professor said i the professor took up the desired position you have white hairs i said had em any time these twenty years said the professor and the crowsfoot pes anserinus rather the professor smiled as i wanted him to and the folds radiated like the ridges of a halfopened fan from the outer corner of the eyes to the templesand the calipers said i what are the calipers he asked curiously why the parenthesis said i parenthesis said the professor whats that why look in the glass when you are disposed to laugh and see if your mouth isnt framed in a couple of crescent lines so my boy its all nonsense said the professor just look at my biceps and he began pulling off his coat to show me his arm be careful said i you cant bear exposure to the air at your time of life as you could once i will box with you said the professor row with you walk with you ride with you swim with you or sit at table with you for fifty dollars a side pluck survives stamina i answered the professor went off a little out of humor a few weeks afterwards he came in looking very goodnatured and brought me a paper which i have here and from which i shall read you some portions if you dont object he had been thinking the matter over he said had read cicero de senectute and made up his mind to meet old age half way these were some of his reflections that he had written down so here you have the professors paper there is no doubt when old age begins the human body is a furnace which keeps in blast threescore years and ten more or less it burns about three hundred pounds of carbon a year besides other fuel when in fair working order according to a great chemists estimate when the fire slackens life declines when it goes out we are dead it has been shown by some noted french experimenters that the amount of combustion increases up to about the thirtieth year remains stationary to about fortyfive and then diminishes this last is the point where old age starts from the great fact of physical life is the perpetual commerce with the elements and the fire is the measure of it about this time of life if food is plenty where you live for that you know regulates matrimony you may be expecting to find yourself a grandfather some fine morning a kind of domestic felicity that gives one a cool shiver of delight to think of as among the not remotely possible events i dont mind much those slipshod lines dr johnson wrote to thrale telling her about lifes declining from thirtyfive the furnace is in full blast for ten years longer as i have said the romans came very near the mark their age of enlistment reached from seventeen to fortysix years what is the use of fighting against the seasons or the tides or the movements of the planetary bodies or this ebb in the wave of life that flows through us we are old fellows from the moment the fire begins to go out let us always behave like gentlemen when we are introduced to new acquaintance incipit allegoria senectutis old age this is mr professor mr professor this is old age old age mr professor i hope to see you well i have known you for some time though i think you did not know me shall we walk down the street together professor drawing back a little we can talk more quietly perhaps in my study will you tell me how it is you seem to be acquainted with everybody you are introduced to though he evidently considers you an entire stranger old age i make it a rule never to force myself upon a persons recognition until i have known him at least five years professor do you mean to say that you have known me so long as that old age i do i left my card on you longer ago than that but i am afraid you never read it yet i see you have it with you professor where old age there between your eyebrows three straight lines running up and down all the probate courts know that token old age his mark put your forefinger on the inner end of one eyebrow and your middle finger on the inner end of the other eyebrow now separate the fingers and you will smooth out my signmanual thats the way you used to look before i left my card on you professor what message do people generally send back when you first call on them old age not at home then i leave a card and go next year i call get the same answer leave another card so for five or six sometimes ten years or more at last if they dont let me in i break in through the front door or the windows we talked together in this way some time then old age said again come let us walk down the street together and offered me a cane an eyeglass a tippet and a pair of overshoes no much obliged to you said i i dont want those things and i had a little rather talk with you here privately in my study so i dressed myself up in a jaunty way and walked out alone got a fall caught a cold was laid up with a lumbago and had time to think over this whole matter explicit allegoria senectutis we have settled when old age begins like all natures processes it is gentle and gradual in its approaches strewed with illusions and all its little griefs soothed by natural sedatives but the iron hand is not less irresistible because it wears the velvet glove the buttonwood throws off its bark in large flakes which one may find lying at its foot pushed out and at last pushed off by that tranquil movement from beneath which is too slow to be seen but too powerful to be arrested one finds them always but one rarely sees them fall so it is our youth drops from us scales off sapless and lifeless and lays bare the tender and immature fresh growth of old age looked at collectively the changes of old age appear as a series of personal insults and indignities terminating at last in death which sir thomas browne has called the very disgrace and ignominy of our nature my ladys cheek can boast no more the cranberry white and pink it wore and where her shining locks divide the parting line is all too wide no no this will never do talk about men if you will but spare the poor women we have a brief description of seven stages of life by a remarkably good observer it is very presumptuous to attempt to add to it yet i have been struck with the fact that life admits of a natural analysis into no less than fifteen distinct periods taking the five primary divisions infancy childhood youth manhood old age each of these has its own three periods of immaturity complete development and decline i recognize on old baby at once with its pipe and mug a stick of candy and a porringer so does everybody and an old child shedding its milkteeth is only a little prototype of the old man shedding his permanent ones fifty or thereabouts is only the childhood as it were of old age the graybeard youngster must be weaned from his late suppers now so you will see that you have to make fifteen stages at any rate and that it would not be hard to make twentyfive five primary each with five secondary divisions the infancy and childhood of commencing old age have the same ingenuous simplicity and delightful unconsciousness about them as the first stage of the earlier periods of life shows the great delusion of mankind is in supposing that to be individual and exceptional which is universal and according to law a person is always startled when he hears himself seriously called an old man for the first time nature gets us out of youth into manhood as sailors are hurried on board of vessels in a state of intoxication we are hustled into maturity reeling with our passions and imaginations and we have drifted far away from port before we awake out of our illusions but to carry us out of maturity into old age without our knowing where we are going she drugs us with strong opiates and so we stagger along with wide open eyes that see nothing until snow enough has fallen on our heads to rouse our comatose brains out of their stupid trances there is one mark of age that strikes me more than any of the physical ones i mean the formation of habits an old man who shrinks into himself falls into ways that become as positive and as much beyond the reach of outside influences as if they were governed by clockwork the animal functions as the physiologists call them in distinction from the organic tend in the process of deterioration to which age and neglect united gradually lead them to assume the periodical or rhythmical type of movement every mans heart this organ belongs you know to the organic system has a regular mode of action but i know a great many men whose brains and all their voluntary existence flowing from their brains have a systole and diastole as regular as that of the heart itself habit is the approximation of the animal system to the organic it is a confession of failure in the highest function of being which involves a perpetual selfdetermination in full view of all existing circumstances but habit you see is an action in present circumstances from past motives it is substituting a vis a tergo for the evolution of living force when a man instead of burning up three hundred pounds of carbon a year has got down to two hundred and fifty it is plain enough he must economize force somewhere now habit is a laborsaving invention which enables a man to get along with less fuel that is all for fuel is force you know just as much in the page i am writing for you as in the locomotive or the legs that carry it to you carbon is the same thing whether you call it wood or coal or bread and cheese a reverend gentleman demurred to this statement as if because combustion is asserted to be the sine qua non of thought therefore thought is alleged to be a purely chemical process facts of chemistry are one thing i told him and facts of consciousness another it can be proved to him by a very simple analysis of some of his spare elements that every sunday when he does his duty faithfully he uses up more phosphorus out of his brain and nerves than on ordinary days but then he had his choice whether to do his duty or to neglect it and save his phosphorus and other combustibles it follows from all this that the formation of habits ought naturally to be as it is the special characteristic of age as for the muscular powers they pass their maximum long before the time when the true decline of life begins if we may judge by the experience of the ring a man is stale i think in their language soon after thirty often no doubt much earlier as gentlemen of the pugilistic profession are exceedingly apt to keep their vital fire burning with the blower up so far without tully but in the mean time i have been reading the treatise de senectute it is not long but a leisurely performance the old gentleman was sixtythree years of age when he addressed it to his friend t pomponius atticus eq a person of distinction some two or three years older we read it when we are schoolboys forget all about it for thirty years and then take it up again by a natural instinct provided always that we read latin as we drink water without stopping to taste it as all of us who ever learned it at school or college ought to do cato is the chief speaker in the dialogue a good deal of it is what would be called in vulgar phrase slow it unpacks and unfolds incidental illustrations which a modern writer would look at the back of and toss each to its pigeonhole i think ancient classics and ancient people are alike in the tendency to this kind of expansion an old doctor came to me once this is literal fact with some contrivance or other for people with broken kneepans as the patient would be confined for a good while he might find it dull work to sit with his hands in his lap reading the ingenious inventor suggested would be an agreeable mode of passing the time he mentioned in his written account of his contrivance various works that might amuse the weary hour i remember only three don quixote tom jones and watts on the mind it is not generally understood that ciceros essay was delivered as a lyceum lecture concio popularis at the temple of mercury the journals papyri of the day tempora quotidiana tribuinus quirinalis praeco romanus and the rest gave abstracts of it one of which i have translated and modernized as being a substitute for the analysis i intended to make iv kal mart the lecture at the temple of mercury last evening was well attended by the elite of our great city two hundred thousand sestertia were thought to have been represented in the house the doors were besieged by a mob of shabby fellows illotum vulgus who were at length quieted after two or three had been somewhat roughly handled gladio jugulati the speaker was the wellknown mark tully eq the subject old age mr t has a lean and scraggy person with a very unpleasant excrescence upon his nasal feature from which his nickname of chickpea cicero is said by some to be derived as a lecturer is public property we may remark that his outer garment toga was of cheap stuff and somewhat worn and that his general style and appearance of dress and manner habitus vestitusque were somewhat provincial the lecture consisted of an imaginary dialogue between cato and laelius we found the first portion rather heavy and retired a few moments for refreshment pocula quaedam vini all want to reach old age says cato and grumble when they get it therefore they are donkeys the lecturer will allow us to say that he is the donkey we know we shall grumble at old age but we want to live through youth and manhood in spite of the troubles we shall groan over there was considerable prosing as to what old age can do and cant true but not new certainly old folks cant jump break the necks of their thighbones femorum cervices if they do cant crack nuts with their teeth cant climb a greased pole malum inunctum scandere non possunt but they can tell old stories and give you good advice if they know what you have made up your mind to do when you ask them all this is well enough but wont set the tiber on fire tiberim accendere nequaquam potest there were some clever things enough dicta hand inepta a few of which are worth reporting old people are accused of being forgetful but they never forget where they have put their money nobody is so old he doesnt think he can live a year the lecturer quoted an ancient maxim grow old early if you would be old long but disputed it authority he thought was the chief privilege of age it is not great to have money but fine to govern those that have it old age begins at fortysix years according to the common opinion it is not every kind of old age or of wine that grows sour with time some excellent remarks were made on immortality but mainly borrowed from and credited to plato several pleasing anecdotes were told old milo champion of the heavy weights in his day looked at his arms and whimpered they are dead not so dead as you you old fool says cato you never were good for anything but for your shoulders and flanks pisistratus asked solon what made him dare to be so obstinate old age said solon the lecture was on the whole acceptable and a credit to our culture and civilization the reporter goes on to state that there will be no lecture next week on account of the expected combat between the bear and the barbarian betting sponsio two to one duo ad unum on the bear after all the most encouraging things i find in the treatise de senectute are the stories of men who have found new occupations when growing old or kept up their common pursuits in the extreme period of life cato learned greek when he was old and speaks of wishing to learn the fiddle or some such instrument fidibus after the example of socrates solon learned something new every day in his old age as he gloried to proclaim cyrus pointed out with pride and pleasure the trees he had planted with his own hand i remember a pillar on the duke of northumberlands estate at alnwick with an inscription in similar words if not the same that like other country pleasures never wears out none is too rich none too poor none too young none too old to enjoy it there is a new england story i have heard more to the point however than any of ciceros a young farmer was urged to set out some appletrees no said he they are too long growing and i dont want to plant for other people the young farmers father was spoken to about it but he with better reason alleged that appletrees were slow and life was fleeting at last some one mentioned it to the old grandfather of the young farmer he had nothing else to do so he stuck in some trees he lived long enough to drink barrels of cider made from the apples that grew on those trees as for myself after visiting a friend lately do remember all the time that this is the professors paper i satisfied myself that i had better concede the fact that my contemporaries are not so young as they have been and that awkward as it is science and history agree in telling me that i can claim the immunities and must own the humiliations of the early stage of senility ah but we have all gone down the hill together the dandies of my time have split their waistbands and taken to highlow shoes the beauties of my recollections where are they they have run the gantlet of the years as well as i first the years pelted them with red roses till their cheeks were all on fire by and by they began throwing white roses and that morning flush passed away at last one of the years threw a snowball and after that no year let the poor girls pass without throwing snowballs and then came rougher missiles ice and stones and from time to time an arrow whistled and down went one of the poor girls so there are but few left and we dont call those few girls but ah me here am i groaning just as the old greek sighed ai ai and the old roman eheu i have no doubt we should die of shame and grief at the indignities offered us by age if it were not that we see so many others as badly or worse off than ourselves we always compare ourselves with our contemporaries i was interrupted in my reading just here before i began at the next breakfast i read them these verses i hope you will like them and get a useful lesson from them the last blossom though young no more we still would dream of beautys dear deluding wiles the leagues of life to graybeards seem shorter than boyhoods lingering miles who knows a womans wild caprice it played with goethes silvered hair and many a holy fathers niece has softly smoothed the papal chair when sixty bids us sigh in vain to melt the heart of sweet sixteen we think upon those ladies twain who loved so well the tough old dean we see the patriarchs wintry face the maid of egypts dusky glow and dream that youth and age embrace as april violets fill with snow tranced in her lords olympian smile his lotusloving memphian liesthe musky daughter of the nile with plaited hair and almond eyes might we but share one wild caress ere lifes autumnal blossoms fall and earths brown clinging lips impress the long cold kiss that waits us all my bosom heaves remembering yet the morning of that blissful day when rose the flower of spring i met and gave my raptured soul away flung from her eyes of purest blue a lasso with its leaping chain light as a loop of larkspurs flew oer sense and spirit heart and brain thou comst to cheer my waning age sweet vision waited for so long dove that would seek the poets cage lured by the magic breath of song she blushes ah reluctant maid loves drapeau rouge the truth has told oer girlhoods yielding barricade floats the great levellers crimson fold come to my arms love heeds not years no frost the bud of passion knowsha what is this my frenzy hears a voice behind me uttered rose sweet was her smile but not for me alas when woman looks too kind just turn your foolish head and seesome youth is walking close behind as to giving up because the almanac or the familybible says that it is about time to do it i have no intention of doing any such thing i grant you that i burn less carbon than some years ago i see people of my standing really good for nothing decrepit effete la levre inferieure deja pendante with what little life they have left mainly concentrated in their epigastrium but as the disease of old age is epidemic endemic and sporadic and everybody that lives long enough is sure to catch it i am going to say for the encouragement of such as need it how i treat the malady in my own case first as i feel that when i have anything to do there is less time for it than when i was younger i find that i give my attention more thoroughly and use my time more economically than ever before so that i can learn anything twice as easily as in my earlier days i am not therefore afraid to attack a new study i took up a difficult language a very few years ago with good success and think of mathematics and metaphysics byandby secondly i have opened my eyes to a good many neglected privileges and pleasures within my reach and requiring only a little courage to enjoy them you may well suppose it pleased me to find that old cato was thinking of learning to play the fiddle when i had deliberately taken it up in my old age and satisfied myself that i could get much comfort if not much music out of it thirdly i have found that some of those active exercises which are commonly thought to belong to young folks only may be enjoyed at a much later period a young friend has lately written an admirable article in one of the journals entitled saints and their bodies approving of his general doctrines and grateful for his records of personal experience i cannot refuse to add my own experimental confirmation of his eulogy of one particular form of active exercise and amusement namely boating for the past nine years i have rowed about during a good part of the summer on fresh or salt water my present fleet on the river charles consists of three rowboats a small flatbottomed skiff of the shape of a flatiron kept mainly to lend to boys a fancy dory for two pairs of sculls in which i sometimes go out with my young folks my own particular watersulky a skeleton or shell raceboat twentytwo feet long with huge outriggers which boat i pull with tenfoot sculls alone of course as it holds but one and tips him out if he doesnt mind what he is about in this i glide around the back bay down the stream up the charles to cambridge and watertown up the mystic round the wharves in the wake of steamboats which leave a swell after them delightful to rock upon i linger under the bridges those caterpillar bridges as my brother professor so happily called them rub against the black sides of old woodschooners cool down under the overhanging stern of some tall indiaman stretch across to the navyyard where the sentinel warns me off from the ohio just as if i should hurt her by lying in her shadow then strike out into the harbor where the water gets clear and the air smells of the ocean till all at once i remember that if a west wind blows up of a sudden i shall drift along past the islands out of sight of the dear old statehouse plate tumbler knife and fork all waiting at home but no chair drawn up at the table all the dear people waiting waiting waiting while the boat is sliding sliding sliding into the great desert where there is no tree and no fountain as i dont want my wreck to be washed up on one of the beaches in company with devilsaprons bladderweeds dead horseshoes and bleached crabshells i turn about and flap my long narrow wings for home when the tide is running out swiftly i have a splendid fight to get through the bridges but always make it a rule to beat though i have been jammed up into pretty tight places at times and was caught once between a vessel swinging round and the pier until our bones the boats that is cracked as if we had been in the jaws of behemoth then back to my moorings at the foot of the common off with the rowingdress dash under the green translucent wave return to the garb of civilization walk through my garden take a look at my elms on the common and reaching my habitat in consideration of my advanced period of life indulge in the elysian abandonment of a huge recumbent chair when i have established a pair of wellpronounced featheringcalluses on my thumbs when i am in training so that i can do my fifteen miles at a stretch without coming to grief in any way when i can perform my mile in eight minutes or a little less then i feel as if i had old times head in chancery and could give it to him at my leisure i do not deny the attraction of walking i have bored this ancient city through and through in my daily travels until i know it as an old inhabitant of a cheshire knows his cheese why it was i who in the course of these rambles discovered that remarkable avenue called myrtle street stretching in one long line from east of the reservoir to a precipitous and rudely paved cliff which looks down on the grim abode of science and beyond it to the far hills a promenade so delicious in its repose so cheerfully varied with glimpses down the northern slope into busy cambridge street with its iron river of the horserailroad and wheeled barges gliding back and forward over it so delightfully closing at its western extremity in sunny courts and passages where i know peace and beauty and virtue and serene old age must be perpetual tenants so alluring to all who desire to take their daily stroll in the words of dr watts alike unknowing and unknown that nothing but a sense of duty would have prompted me to reveal the secret of its existence i concede therefore that walking is an immeasurably fine invention of which old age ought constantly to avail itself saddleleather is in some respects even preferable to soleleather the principal objection to it is of a financial character but you may be sure that bacon and sydenham did not recommend it for nothing ones hepar or in vulgar language liver a ponderous organ weighing some three or four pounds goes up and down like the dasher of a churn in the midst of the other vital arrangements at every step of a trotting horse the brains also are shaken up like coppers in a moneybox riding is good for those that are born with a silvermounted bridle in their hand and can ride as much and as often as they like without thinking all the time they hear that steady grinding sound as the horses jaws triturate with calm lateral movement the bankbills and promises to pay upon which it is notorious that the profligate animal in question feeds day and night instead however of considering these kinds of exercise in this empirical way i will devote a brief space to an examination of them in a more scientific form the pleasure of exercise is due first to a purely physical impression and secondly to a sense of power in action the first source of pleasure varies of course with our condition and the state of the surrounding circumstances the second with the amount and kind of power and the extent and kind of action in all forms of active exercise there are three powers simultaneously in action the will the muscles and the intellect each of these predominates in different kinds of exercise in walking the will and muscles are so accustomed to work together and perform their task with so little expenditure of force that the intellect is left comparatively free the mental pleasure in walking as such is in the sense of power over all our moving machinery but in riding i have the additional pleasure of governing another will and my muscles extend to the tips of the animals ears and to his four hoofs instead of stopping at my hands and feet now in this extension of my volition and my physical frame into another animal my tyrannical instincts and my desire for heroic strength are at once gratified when the horse ceases to have a will of his own and his muscles require no special attention on your part then you may live on horseback as wesley did and write sermons or take naps as you like but you will observe that in riding on horseback you always have a feeling that after all it is not you that do the work but the animal and this prevents the satisfaction from being complete now let us look at the conditions of rowing i wont suppose you to be disgracing yourself in one of those miserable tubs tugging in which is to rowing the true boat what riding a cow is to bestriding an arab you know the esquimaux kayak if that is the name of it dont you look at that model of one over my door sharp rather on the contrary it is a lubber to the one you and i must have a dutch fishwife to psyche contrasted with what i will tell you about our boat then is something of the shape of a pickerel as you look down upon his back he lying in the sunshine just where the sharp edge of the water cuts in among the lilypads it is a kind of a giant pod as one may say tight everywhere except in a little place in the middle where you sit its length is from seven to ten yards and as it is only from sixteen to thirty inches wide in its widest part you understand why you want those outriggers or projecting iron frames with the rowlocks in which the oars play my rowlocks are five feet apart double the greatest width of the boat here you are then afloat with a body a rod and a half long with arms or wings as you may choose to call them stretching more than twenty feet from tip to tip every volition of yours extending as perfectly into them as if your spinal cord ran down the centre strip of your boat and the nerves of your arms tingled as far as the broad blades of your oars oars of spruce balanced leathered and ringed under your own special direction this in sober earnest is the nearest approach to flying that man has ever made or perhaps ever will make as the hawk sails without flapping his pinions so you drift with the tide when you will in the most luxurious form of locomotion indulged to an embodied spirit but if your blood wants rousing turn round that stake in the river which you see a mile from here and when you come in in sixteen minutes if you do for we are old boys and not champion scullers you remember then say if you begin to feel a little warmed up or not you can row easily and gently all day and you can row yourself blind and black in the face in ten minutes just as you like it has been long agreed that there is no way in which a man can accomplish so much labor with his muscles as in rowing it is in the boat then that man finds the largest extension of his volitional and muscular existence and yet he may tax both of them so slightly in that most delicious of exercises that he shall mentally write his sermon or his poem or recall the remarks he has made in company and put them in form for the public as well as in his easychair i dare not publicly name the rare joys the infinite delights that intoxicate me on some sweet june morning when the river and bay are smooth as a sheet of berylgreen silk and i run along ripping it up with my knifeedged shell of a boat the rent closing after me like those wounds of angels which milton tells of but the seam still shining for many a long rood behind me to lie still over the flats where the waters are shallow and see the crabs crawling and the sculpins gliding busily and silently beneath the boat to rustle in through the long harsh grass that leads up some tranquil creek to take shelter from the sunbeams under one of the thousandfooted bridges and look down its interminable colonnades crusted with green and oozy growths studded with minute barnacles and belted with rings of dark muscles while overhead streams and thunders that other river whose every wave is a human soul flowing to eternity as the river below flows to the ocean lying there moored unseen in loneliness so profound that the columns of tadmor in the desert could not seem more remote from life the cool breeze on ones forehead the stream whispering against the halfsunken pillars why should i tell of these things that i should live to see my beloved haunts invaded and the waves blackened with boats as with a swarm of waterbeetles what a city of idiots we must be not to have covered this glorious bay with gondolas and wherries as we have just learned to cover the ice in winter with skaters i am satisfied that such a set of blackcoated stiffjointed softmuscled pastecomplexioned youth as we can boast in our atlantic cities never before sprang from loins of anglosaxon lineage of the females that are the mates of these males i do not here speak i preached my sermon from the laypulpit on this matter a good while ago of course if you heard it you know my belief is that the total climatic influences here are getting up a number of new patterns of humanity some of which are not an improvement on the old model clipperbuilt sharp in the bows long in the spars slender to look at and fast to go the ship which is the great organ of our national life of relation is but a reproduction of the typical form which the elements impress upon its builder all this we cannot help but we can make the best of these influences such as they are we have a few good boatmen no good horsemen that i hear of i cannot speak for cricketing but as for any great athletic feat performed by a gentleman in these latitudes society would drop a man who should run round the common in five minutes some of our amateur fencers singlestick players and boxers we have no reason to be ashamed of boxing is rough play but not too rough for a hearty young fellow anything is better than this whiteblooded degeneration to which we all tend i dropped into a gentlemens sparring exhibition only last evening it did my heart good to see that there were a few young and youngish youths left who could take care of their own heads in case of emergency it is a fine sight that of a gentleman resolving himself into the primitive constituents of his humanity here is a delicate young man now with an intellectual countenance a slight figure a subpallid complexion a most unassuming deportment a mild adolescent in fact that any hiram or jonathan from between the ploughtails would of course expect to handle with perfect ease oh he is taking off his goldbowed spectacles ah he is divesting himself of his cravat why he is stripping off his coat well here he is sure enough in a tight silk shirt and with two things that look like batter puddings in the place of his fists now see that other fellow with another pair of batter puddings the big one with the broad shoulders he will certainly knock the little mans head off if he strikes him feinting dodging stopping hitting countering little mans head not off yet you might as well try to jump upon your own shadow as to hit the little mans intellectual features he neednt have taken off the goldbowed spectacles at all quick cautious shifty nimble cool he catches all the fierce lunges or gets out of their reach till his turn comes and then whack goes one of the batter puddings against the big ones ribs and bang goes the other into the big ones face and staggering shuffling slipping tripping collapsing sprawling down goes the big one in a miscellaneous bundle if my young friend whose excellent article i have referred to could only introduce the manly art of selfdefence among the clergy i am satisfied that we should have better sermons and an infinitely less quarrelsome churchmilitant a bout with the gloves would let off the illnature and cure the indigestion which united have embroiled their subject in a bitter controversy we should then often hear that a point of difference between an infallible and a heretic instead of being vehemently discussed in a series of newspaper articles had been settled by a friendly contest in several rounds at the close of which the parties shook hands and appeared cordially reconciled but boxing you and i are too old for i am afraid i was for a moment tempted by the contagion of muscular electricity last evening to try the gloves with the benicia boy who looked in as a friend to the noble art but remembering that he had twice my weight and half my age besides the advantage of his training i sat still and said nothing there is one other delicate point i wish to speak of with reference to old age i refer to the use of dioptric media which correct the diminished refracting power of the humors of the eye in other words spectacles i dont use them all i ask is a large fair type a strong daylight or gaslight and one yard of focal distance and my eyes are as good as ever but if your eyes fail i can tell you something encouraging there is now living in new york state an old gentleman who perceiving his sight to fail immediately took to exercising it on the finest print and in this way fairly bullied nature out of her foolish habit of taking liberties at fiveandforty or thereabout and now this old gentleman performs the most extraordinary feats with his pen showing that his eyes must be a pair of microscopes i should be afraid to say to you how much he writes in the compass of a halfdime whether the psalms or the gospels or the psalms and the gospels i wont be positive but now let rue tell you this if the time comes when you must lay down the fiddle and the bow because your fingers are too stiff and drop the tenfoot sculls because your arms are too weak and after dallying awhile with eyeglasses come at last to the undisguised reality of spectacles if the time comes when that fire of life we spoke of has burned so low that where its flames reverberated there is only the sombre stain of regret and where its coals glowed only the white ashes that cover the embers of memory dont let your heart grow cold and you may carry cheerfulness and love with you into the teens of your second century if you can last so long as our friend the poet once said in some of those oldfashioned heroics of his which he keeps for his private reading call him not old whose visionary brain holds oer the past its undivided reign for him in vain the envious seasons roll who bears eternal summer in his soul if yet the minstrels song the poets lay spring with her birds or children with their play or maidens smile or heavenly dream of art stir the few lifedrops creeping round his heartturn to the record where his years are toldcount his gray hairs they cannot make him old end of the professors paper the above essay was not read at one time but in several instalments and accompanied by various comments from different persons at the table the company were in the main attentive with the exception of a little somnolence on the part of the old gentleman opposite at times and a few sly malicious questions about the old boys on the part of that forward young fellow who has figured occasionally not always to his advantage in these reports on sunday mornings in obedience to a feeling i am not ashamed of i have always tried to give a more appropriate character to our conversation i have never read them my sermon yet and i dont know that i shall as some of them might take my convictions as a personal indignity to themselves but having read our company so much of the professors talk about age and other subjects connected with physical life i took the next sunday morning to repeat to them the following poem of his which i have had by me some time he calls it i suppose for his professional friends the anatomists hymn but i shall name it the living temple not in the world of light alone where god has built his blazing throne nor yet alone in earth below with belted seas that come and go and endless isles of sunlit green is all thy makers glory seen look in upon thy wondrous frameeternal wisdom still the same the smooth soft air with pulselike waves flows murmuring through its hidden caves whose streams of brightening purple rush fired with a new and livelier blush while all their burden of decay the ebbing current steals away and red with natures flame they start from the warm fountains of the heart no rest that throbbing slave may ask forever quivering oer his task while far and wide a crimson jet leaps forth to fill the woven net which in unnumbered crossing tides the flood of burning life divides then kindling each decaying part creeps back to find the throbbing heart but warmed with that uchanging flame behold the outward moving frame its living marbles jointed strong with glistening band and silvery thong and linked to reasons guiding reins by myriad rings in trembling chains each graven with the threaded zone which claims it as the masters own see how yon beam of seeming white is braided out of sevenhued light yet in those lucid globes no ray by any chance shall break astray hark how the rolling surge of sound arches and spirals circling round wakes the hushed spirit through thine ear with music it is heaven to hear then mark the cloven sphere that holds all thought in its mysterious folds that feels sensations faintest thrill and flashes forth the sovereign will think on the stormy world that dwells locked in its dim and clustering cells the lightning gleams of power it sheds along its hollow glassy threads o father grant thy love divine to make these mystic temples thine when wasting age and wearying strife have sapped the leaning walls of life when darkness gathers over all and the last tottering pillars fall take the poor dust thy mercy warms and mould it into heavenly forms chapter viii spring has come you will find some verses to that effect at the end of these notes if you are an impatient reader skip to them at once in reading aloud omit if you please the sixth and seventh verses these are parenthetical and digressive and unless your audience is of superior intelligence will confuse them many people can ride on horseback who find it hard to get on and to get off without assistance one has to dismount from an idea and get into the saddle again at every parenthesis the old gentleman who sits opposite finding that spring had fairly come mounted a white hat one day and walked into the street it seems to have been a premature or otherwise exceptionable exhibition not unlike that commemorated by the late mr bayly when the old gentleman came home he looked very red in the face and complained that he had been made sport of by sympathizing questions i learned from him that a boy had called him old daddy and asked him when he had his hat whitewashed this incident led me to make some observations at table the next morning which i here repeat for the benefit of the readers of this record the hat is the vulnerable point of the artificial integument i learned this in early boyhood i was once equipped in a hat of leghorn straw having a brim of much wider dimensions than were usual at that time and sent to school in that portion of my native town which lies nearest to this metropolis on my way i was met by a portchuck as we used to call the young gentlemen of that locality and the following dialogue ensued the portchuck hullo yousir joo know th wuz gonto be a race tomorrah myself no whos gonto run n wherst gonto be the portchuck squire mico n doctor wiliams round the brim o your hat these two muchrespected gentlemen being the oldest inhabitants at that time and the alleged racecourse being out of the question the portchuck also winking and thrusting his tongue into his cheek i perceived that i had been trifled with and the effect has been to make me sensitive and observant respecting this article of dress ever since here is an axiom or two relating to it a hat which has been popped or exploded by being sat down upon is never itself again afterwards it is a favorite illusion of sanguine natures to believe the contrary shabby gentility has nothing so characteristic as its hat there is always an unnatural calmness about its nap and an unwholesome gloss suggestive of a wet brush the last effort of decayed fortune is expended in smoothing its dilapidated castor the hat is the ultimum moriens of respectability the old gentleman took all these remarks and maxims very pleasantly saying however that he had forgotten most of his french except the word for potatoes pummies de tare ultimum moriens i told him is old italian and signifies last thing to die with this explanation he was well contented and looked quite calm when i saw him afterwards in the entry with a black hat on his head and the white one in his hand i think myself fortunate in having the poet and the professor for my intimates we are so much together that we no doubt think and talk a good deal alike yet our points of view are in many respects individual and peculiar you know me well enough by this time i have not talked with you so long for nothing and therefore i dont think it necessary to draw my own portrait but let me say a word or two about my friends the professor considers himself and i consider him a very useful and worthy kind of drudge i think he has a pride in his small technicalities i know that he has a great idea of fidelity and though i suspect he laughs a little inwardly at times at the grand airs science puts on as she stands marking time but not getting on while the trumpets are blowing and the big drums beating yet i am sure he has a liking for his specially and a respect for its cultivators but ill tell you what the professor said to the poet the other day my boy said he i can work a great deal cheaper than you because i keep all my goods in the lower story you have to hoist yours into the upper chambers of the brain and let them down again to your customers i take mine in at the level of the ground and send them off from my doorstep almost without lifting i tell you the higher a man has to carry the raw material of thought before he works it up the more it costs him in blood nerve and muscle coleridge knew all this very well when he advised every literary man to have a profession sometimes i like to talk with one of them and sometimes with the other after a while i get tired of both when a fit of intellectual disgust comes over me i will tell you what i have found admirable as a diversion in addition to boating and other amusements which i have spoken of that is working at my carpentersbench some mechanical employment is the greatest possible relief after the purely intellectual faculties begin to tire when i was quarantined once at marseilles i got to work immediately at carving a wooden wonder of loose rings on a stick and got so interested in it that when we were set loose i regained my freedom with a sigh because my toy was unfinished there are long seasons when i talk only with the professor and others when i give myself wholly up to the poet now that my winters work is over and spring is with us i feel naturally drawn to the poets company i dont know anybody more alive to life than he is the passion of poetry seizes on him every spring he says yet oftentimes he complains that when he feels most he can sing least then a fit of despondency comes over him i feel ashamed sometimes said he the other day to think how far my worst songs fall below my best it sometimes seems to me as i know it does to others who have told me so that they ought to be all best if not in actual execution at least in plan and motive i am grateful he continued for all such criticisms a man is always pleased to have his most serious efforts praised and the highest aspect of his nature get the most sunshine yet i am sure that in the nature of things many minds must change their key now and then on penalty of getting out of tune or losing their voices you know i suppose he said what is meant by complementary colors you know the effect too which the prolonged impression of any one color has on the retina if you close your eyes after looking steadily at a red object you see a green image it is so with many minds i will not say with all after looking at one aspect of external nature or of any form of beauty or truth when they turn away the complementary aspect of the same object stamps itself irresistibly and automatically upon the mind shall they give expression to this secondary mental state or not when i contemplate said my friend the poet the infinite largeness of comprehension belonging to the central intelligence how remote the creative conception is from all scholastic and ethical formulae i am led to think that a healthy mind ought to change its mood from time to time and come down from its noblest condition never of course to degrade itself by dwelling upon what is itself debasing but to let its lower faculties have a chance to air and exercise themselves after the first and second floor have been out in the bright street dressed in all their splendors shall not our humble friends in the basement have their holiday and the cotton velvet and the thinskinned jewelry simple adornments but befitting the station of those who wear them show themselves to the crowd who think them beautiful as they ought to though the people up stairs know that they are cheap and perishable i dont know that i may not bring the poet here some day or other and let him speak for himself still i think i can tell you what he says quite as well as he could do it oh he said to me one day i am but a handorgan man say rather a handorgan life turns the winch and fancy or accident pulls out the stops i come under your windows some fine spring morning and play you one of my adagio movements and some of you say this is good play us so always but dear friends if i did not change the stop sometimes the machine would wear out in one part and rust in another how easily this or that tune flows you say there must be no end of just such melodies in him i will open the poor machine for you one moment and you shall look ah every note marks where a spur of steel has been driven in it is easy to grind out the song but to plant these bristling points which make it was the painful task of time i dont like to say it he continued but poets commonly have no larger stock of tunes than handorgans and when you hear them piping up under your window you know pretty well what to expect the more stops the better do let them all be pulled out in their turn so spoke my friend the poet and read me one of his stateliest songs and after it a gay chanson and then a string of epigrams all true he said all flowers of his soul only one with the corolla spread and another with its disk half opened and the third with the heartleaves covered up and only a petal or two showing its tip through the calyx the waterlily is the type of the poets soul he told me what do you think sir said the divinitystudent opens the souls of poets most fully why there must be the internal force and the external stimulus neither is enough by itself a rose will not flower in the dark and a fern will not flower anywhere what do i think is the true sunshine that opens the poets corolla i dont like to say they spoil a good many i am afraid or at least they shine on a good many that never come to anything who are they said the schoolmistress women their love first inspires the poet and their praise is his best reward the schoolmistress reddened a little but looked pleased did i really think so i do think so i never feel safe until i have pleased them i dont think they are the first to see ones defects but they are the first to catch the color and fragrance of a true poem fit the same intellect to a man and it is a bowstring to a woman and it is a harpstring she is vibratile and resonant all over so she stirs with slighter musical tremblings of the air about her ah me said my friend the poet to me the other day what color would it not have given to my thoughts and what thricewashed whiteness to my words had i been fed on womens praises i should have grown like marvells fawn lilies without roses within but then he added we all think if so and so we should have been this or that as you were saying the other day in those rhymes of yours i dont think there are many poets in the sense of creators but of those sensitive natures which reflect themselves naturally in soft and melodious words pleading for sympathy with their joys and sorrows every literature is full nature carves with her own hands the brain which holds the creative imagination but she casts the oversensitive creatures in scores from the same mould there are two kinds of poets just as there are two kinds of blondes movement of curiosity among our ladies at table please to tell us about those blondes said the schoolmistress why there are blondes who are such simply by deficiency of coloring matter negative or washed blondes arrested by nature on the way to become albinesses there are others that are shot through with golden light with tawny or fulvous tinges in various degree positive or stained blondes dipped in yellow sunbeams and as unlike in their mode of being to the others as an orange is unlike a snowball the albinostyle carries with it a wide pupil and a sensitive retina the other or the leonine blonde has an opaline fire in her clear eye which the brunette can hardly match with her quick glittering glances just so we have the great sunkindled constructive imaginations and a far more numerous class of poets who have a certain kind of moonlightgenius given them to compensate for their imperfection of nature their want of mental coloringmatter makes them sensitive to those impressions which stronger minds neglect or never feel at all many of them die young and all of them are tinged with melancholy there is no more beautiful illustration of the principle of compensation which marks the divine benevolence than the fact that some of the holiest lives and some of the sweetest songs are the growth of the infirmity which unfits its subject for the rougher duties of life when one reads the life of cowper or of keats or of lucretia and margaret davidson of so many gentle sweet natures born to weakness and mostly dying before their time one cannot help thinking that the human race dies out singing like the swan in the old story the french poet gilbert who died at the hotel dieu at the age of twentynine killed by a key in his throat which he had swallowed when delirious in consequence of a fall this poor fellow was a very good example of the poet by excess of sensibility i found the other day that some of my literary friends had never heard of him though i suppose few educated frenchmen do not know the lines which he wrote a week before his death upon a mean bed in the great hospital of paris au banquet de la vie infortune convive japparus un jour et je meurs je meurs et sur ma tombe ou lentement jarrive nul ne viendra verser des pleurs at lifes gay banquet placed a poor unhappy guest one day i pass then disappear i die and on the tomb where i at length shall rest no friend shall come to shed a tear you remember the same thing in other words some where in kirke whites poems it is the burden of the plaintive songs of all these sweet albinopoets i shall die and be forgotten and the world will go on just as if i had never been and yet how i have loved how i have longed how i have aspired and so singing their eyes grow brighter and brighter and their features thinner and thinner until at last the veil of flesh is threadbare and still singing they drop it and pass onward our brains are seventyyear clocks the angel of life winds them up once for all then closes the case and gives the key into the hand of the angel of the resurrection tictac tictac go the wheels of thought our will cannot stop them they cannot stop themselves sleep cannot still them madness only makes them go faster death alone can break into the case and seizing the everswinging pendulum which we call the heart silence at last the clicking of the terrible escapement we have carried so long beneath our wrinkled foreheads if we could only get at them as we lie on our pillows and count the dead beats of thought after thought and image after image jarring through the overtired organ will nobody block those wheels uncouple that pinion cut the string that holds those weights blow up the infernal machine with gunpowder what a passion comes over us sometimes for silence and rest that this dreadful mechanism unwinding the endless tapestry of time embroidered with spectral figures of life and death could have but one brief holiday who can wonder that men swing themselves off from beams in hempen lassos that they jump off from parapets into the swift and gurgling waters beneath that they take counsel of the grim friend who has but to utter his one peremptory monosyllable and the restless machine is shivered as a vase that is dashed upon a marble floor under that building which we pass every day there are strong dungeons where neither hook nor bar nor bedcord nor drinkingvessel from which a sharp fragment may be shattered shall by any chance be seen there is nothing for it when the brain is on fire with the whirling of its wheels but to spring against the stone wall and silence them with one crash ah they remembered that the kind city fathers and the walls are nicely padded so that one can take such exercise as he likes without damaging himself on the very plain and serviceable upholstery if anybody would only contrive some kind of a lever that one could thrust in among the works of this horrid automaton and check them or alter their rate of going what would the world give for the discovery from half a dime to a dime according to the style of the place and the quality of the liquor said the young fellow whom they call john you speak trivially but not unwisely i said unless the will maintain a certain control over these movements which it cannot stop but can to some extent regulate men are very apt to try to get at the machine by some indirect system of leverage or other they clap on the brakes by means of opium they change the maddening monotony of the rhythm by means of fermented liquors it is because the brain is locked up and we cannot touch its movement directly that we thrust these coarse tools in through any crevice by which they may reach the interior and so alter its rate of going for a while and at last spoil the machine men who exercise chiefly those faculties of the mind which work independently of the will poets and artists for instance who follow their imagination in their creative moments instead of keeping it in hand as your logicians and practical men do with their reasoning faculty such men are too apt to call in the mechanical appliances to help them govern their intellects he means they get drunk said the young fellow already alluded to by name do you think men of true genius are apt to indulge in the use of inebriating fluids said the divinitystudent if you think you are strong enough to bear what i am going to sayi replied i will talk to you about this but mind now these are the things that some foolish people call dangerous subjects as if these vices which burrow into peoples souls as the guineaworm burrows into the naked feet of westindian slaves would be more mischievous when seen than out of sight now the true way to deal with those obstinate animals which are a dozen feet long some of them and no bigger than a horse hair is to get a piece of silk round their heads and pull them out very cautiously if you only break them off they grow worse than ever and sometimes kill the person who has the misfortune to harbor one of them whence it is plain that the first thing to do is to find out where the head lies just so of all the vices and particularly of this vice of intemperance what is the head of it and where does it lie for you may depend upon it there is not one of these vices that has not a head of its own an intelligence a meaning a certain virtue i was going to say but that might perhaps sound paradoxical i have heard an immense number of moral physicians lay down the treatment of moral guineaworms and the vast majority of them would always insist that the creature had no head at all but was all body and tail so i have found a very common result of their method to be that the string slipped or that a piece only of the creature was broken off and the worm soon grew again as bad as ever the truth is if the devil could only appear in church by attorney and make the best statement that the facts would bear him out in doing on behalf of his special virtues what we commonly call vices the influence of good teachers would be much greater than it is for the arguments by which the devil prevails are precisely the ones that the devilqueller most rarely answers the way to argue down a vice is not to tell lies about it to say that it has no attractions when everybody knows that it has but rather to let it make out its case just as it certainly will in the moment of temptation and then meet it with the weapons furnished by the divine armory ithuriel did not spit the toad on his spear you remember but touched him with it and the blasted angel took the sad glories of his true shape if he had shown fight then the fair spirits would have known how to deal with him that all spasmodic cerebral action is an evil is not perfectly clear men get fairly intoxicated with music with poetry with religious excitement oftenest with love ninon de lenclos said she was so easily excited that her soup intoxicated her and convalescents have been made tipsy by a beefsteak there are forms and stages of alcoholic exaltation which in themselves and without regard to their consequences might be considered as positive improvements of the persons affected when the sluggish intellect is roused the slow speech quickened the cold nature warmed the latent sympathy developed the flagging spirit kindled before the trains of thought become confused or the will perverted or the muscles relaxed just at the moment when the whole human zoophyte flowers out like a fullblown rose and is ripe for the subscriptionpaper or the contributionbox it would be hard to say that a man was at that very time worse or less to be loved than when driving a hard bargain with all his meaner wits about him the difficulty is that the alcoholic virtues dont wash but until the water takes their colors out the tints are very much like those of the true celestial stuff here i was interrupted by a question which i am very unwilling to report but have confidence enough in those friends who examine these records to commit to their candor a person at table asked me whether i went in for rum as a steady drink his manner made the question highly offensive but i restrained myself and answered thus rum i take to be the name which unwashed moralists apply alike to the product distilled from molasses and the noblest juices of the vineyard burgundy in all its sunset glow is rum champagne the foaming wine of eastern france in rum hock which our friend the poet speaks of as the rhines breastmilk gushing cold and bright pale as the moon and maddening as her light is rum sir i repudiate the loathsome vulgarism as an insult to the first miracle wrought by the founder of our religion i address myself to the company i believe in temperance nay almost in abstinence as a rule for healthy people i trust that i practice both but let me tell you there are companies of men of genius into which i sometimes go where the atmosphere of intellect and sentiment is so much more stimulating than alcohol that if i thought fit to take wine it would be to keep me sober among the gentlemen that i have known few if any were ruined by drinking my few drunken acquaintances were generally ruined before they became drunkards the habit of drinking is often a vice no doubt sometimes a misfortune as when an almost irresistible hereditary propensity exists to indulge in it but oftenest of all a punishment empty heads heads without ideas in wholesome variety and sufficient number to furnish food for the mental clockwork illregulated heads where the faculties are not under the control of the will these are the ones that hold the brains which their owners are so apt to tamper with by introducing the appliances we have been talking about now when a gentlemans brain is empty or illregulated it is to a great extent his own fault and so it is simple retribution that while he lies slothfully sleeping or aimlessly dreaming the fatal habit settles on him like a vampyre and sucks his blood fanning him all the while with its hot wings into deeper slumber or idler dreams i am not such a hardsouled being as to apply this to the neglected poor who have had no chance to fill their heads with wholesome ideas and to be taught the lesson of selfgovernment i trust the tariff of heaven has an ad valorem scale for them and all of us but to come back to poets and artists if they really are more prone to the abuse of stimulants and i fear that this is true the reason of it is only too clear a man abandons himself to a fine frenzy and the power which flows through him as i once explained to you makes him the medium of a great poem or a great picture the creative action is not voluntary at all but automatic we can only put the mind into the proper attitude and wait for the wind that blows where it listeth to breathe over it thus the true state of creative genius is allied to reverie or dreaming if mind and body were both healthy and had food enough and fair play i doubt whether any men would be more temperate than the imaginative classes but body and mind often flag perhaps they are illmade to begin with underfed with bread or ideas overworked or abused in some way the automatic action by which genius wrought its wonders fails there is only one thing which can rouse the machine not will that cannot reach it nothing but a ruinous agent which hurries the wheels awhile and soon eats out the heart of the mechanism the dreaming faculties are always the dangerous ones because their mode of action can be imitated by artificial excitement the reasoning ones are safe because they imply continued voluntary effort i think you will find it true that before any vice can fasten on a man body mind or moral nature must be debilitated the mosses and fungi gather on sickly trees not thriving ones and the odious parasites which fasten on the human frame choose that which is already enfeebled mr walker the hygeian humorist declared that he had such a healthy skin it was impossible for any impurity to stick to it and maintained that it was an absurdity to wash a face which was of necessity always clean i dont know how much fancy there was in this but there is no fancy in saying that the lassitude of tiredout operatives and the languor of imaginative natures in their periods of collapse and the vacuity of minds untrained to labor and discipline fit the soul and body for the germination of the seeds of intemperance whenever the wandering demon of drunkenness finds a ship adrift no steady wind in its sails no thoughtful pilot directing its course he steps on board takes the helm and steers straight for the maelstrom i wonder if you know the terrible smile the young fellow whom they call john winked very hard and made a jocular remark the sense of which seemed to depend on some double meaning of the word smile the company was curious to know what i meant there are persons i said who no sooner come within sight of you than they begin to smile with an uncertain movement of the mouth which conveys the idea that they are thinking about themselves and thinking too that you are thinking they are thinking about themselves and so look at you with a wretched mixture of selfconsciousness awkwardness and attempts to carry off both which are betrayed by the cowardly behaviour of the eye and the telltale weakness of the lips that characterize these unfortunate beings why do you call them unfortunate sir asked the divinitystudent because it is evident that the consciousness of some imbecility or other is at the bottom of this extraordinary expression i dont think however that these persons are commonly fools i have known a number and all of them were intelligent i think nothing conveys the idea of underbreeding more than this selfbetraying smile yet i think this peculiar habit as well as that of meaningless blushing may be fallen into by very good people who met often or sit opposite each other at table a true gentlemans face is infinitely removed from all such paltriness calmeyed firmmouthed i think titian understood the look of a gentleman as well as anybody that ever lived the portrait of a young man holding a glove in his hand in the gallery of the louvre if any of you have seen that collection will remind you of what i mean do i think these people know the peculiar look they have i cannot say i hope not i am afraid they would never forgive me if they did the worst of it is the trick is catching when one meets one of these fellows he feels a tendency to the same manifestation the professor tells me there is a muscular slip a dependence of the platysma myoides which is called the risorius santorini say that once more exclaimed the young fellow mentioned above the professor says there is a little fleshy slip called santorinis laughing muscle i would have it cut out of my face if i were born with one of those constitutional grins upon it perhaps i am uncharitable in my judgment of those sourlooking people i told you of the other day and of these smiling folks it may be that they are born with these looks as other people are with more generally recognized deformities both are bad enough but i had rather meet three of the scowlers than one of the smilers there is another unfortunate way of looking which is peculiar to that amiable sex we do not like to find fault with there are some very pretty but unhappily very illbred women who dont understand the law of the road with regard to handsome faces nature and custom would no doubt agree in conceding to all males the right of at least two distinct looks at every comely female countenance without any infraction of the rules of courtesy or the sentiment of respect the first look is necessary to define the person of the individual one meets so as to avoid it in passing any unusual attraction detected in a first glance is a sufficient apology for a second not a prolonged and impertinent stare but an appreciating homage of the eyes such as a stranger may inoffensively yield to a passing image it is astonishing how morbidly sensitive some vulgar beauties are to the slightest demonstration of this kind when a lady walks the streets she leaves her virtuousindignation countenance at home she knows well enough that the street is a picturegallery where pretty faces framed in pretty bonnets are meant to be seen and everybody has a right to see them when we observe how the same features and style of person and character descend from generation to generation we can believe that some inherited weakness may account for these peculiarities little snappingturtles snap so the great naturalist tells us before they are out of the eggshell i am satisfied that much higher up in the scale of life character is distinctly shown at the age of or months my friend the professor has been full of eggs lately this remark excited a burst of hilarity which i did not allow to interrupt the course of my observations he has been reading the great book where he found the fact about the little snappingturtles mentioned above some of the things he has told me have suggested several odd analogies enough there are half a dozen men or so who carry in their brains the ovarian eggs of the next generations or centurys civilization these eggs are not ready to be laid in the form of books as yet some of them are hardly ready to be put into the form of talk but as rudimentary ideas or inchoate tendencies there they are and these are what must form the future a mans general notions are not good for much unless he has a crop of these intellectual ovarian eggs in his own brain or knows them as they exist in the minds of others one must be in the habit of talking with such persons to get at these rudimentary germs of thought for their development is necessarily imperfect and they are moulded on new patterns which must be long and closely studied but these are the men to talk with no fresh truth ever gets into a book a good many fresh lies get in anyhow said one of the company i proceeded in spite of the interruption all uttered thought my friend the professor says is of the nature of an excretion its materials have been taken in and have acted upon the system and been reacted on by it it has circulated and done its office in one mind before it is given out for the benefit of others it may be milk or venom to other minds but in either case it is something which the producer has had the use of and can part with a man instinctively tries to get rid of his thought in conversation or in print so soon as it is matured but it is hard to get at it as it lies imbedded a mere potentiality the germ of a germ in his intellect where are the brains that are fullest of these ovarian eggs of thought i decline mentioning individuals the producers of thought who are few the jobbers of thought who are many and the retailers of thought who are numberless are so mixed up in the popular apprehension that it would be hopeless to try to separate them before opinion has had time to settle follow the course of opinion on the great subjects of human interest for a few generations or centuries get its parallax map out a small arc of its movement see where it tends and then see who is in advance of it or even with it the world calls him hard names probably but if you would find the ova of the future you must look into the folds of his cerebral convolutions the divinitystudent looked a little puzzled at this suggestion as if he did not see exactly where he was to come out if he computed his arc too nicely i think it possible it might cut off a few corners of his present belief as it has cut off martyrburning and witchhanging but time will show time will show as the old gentleman opposite says oh here is that copy of verses i told you about spring has come intra muros the sunbeams lost for half a year slant through my pane their morning rays for dry northwesters cold and clear the east blows in its thin blue haze and first the snowdrops bells are seen then close against the sheltering wall the tulips horn of dusky green the peonys dark unfolding ball the goldenchaliced crocus burns the long narcissusblades appear the conebeaked hyacinth returns and lights her blueflamed chandelier the willows whistling lashes wrung by the wild winds of gusty march with sallow leaflets lightly strung are swaying by the tufted larch the elms have robed their slender spray with fullblown flower and embryo leaf wide oer the clasping arch of day soars like a cloud their hoary chief see the proud tulips flaunting cup that flames in glory for an hourbehold it withering then look uphow meek the forestmonarchs flower when wake the violets winter dies when sprout the elmbuds spring is near when lilacs blossom summer cries bud little roses spring is here the windows blush with fresh bouquets cut with the maydew on their lips the radish all its bloom displays pink as auroras fingertips nor less the flood of light that showers on beautys changed corollashadesthe walks are gay as bridal bowers with rows of manypetalled maids the scarlet shellfish click and clash in the blue barrow where they slide the horseman proud of streak and splash creeps homeward from his morning ride here comes the dealers awkward string with neck in rope and tail in knotrough colts with careless countryswing in lazy walk or slouching trot wild filly from the mountainside doomed to the close and chafing thills lend me thy long untiring stride to seek with thee thy western hills i hear the whispering voice of spring the thrushs trill the catbirds cry like some poor bird with prisoned wing that sits and sings but longs to fly oh for one spot of living greenone little spot where leaves can growto love unblamed to walk unseen to dream above to sleep below chapter ix aqui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado pedro garcias if i should ever make a little book out of these papers which i hope you are not getting tired of i suppose i ought to save the above sentence for a motto on the titlepage but i want it now and must use it i need not say to you that the words are spanish nor that they are to be found in the short introduction to gil blas nor that they mean here lies buried the soul of the licentiate pedro garcias i warned all young people off the premises when i began my notes referring to old age i must be equally fair with old people now they are earnestly requested to leave this paper to young persons from the age of twelve to that of fourscore years and ten at which latter period of life i am sure that i shall have at least one youthful reader you know well enough what i mean by youth and age something in the soul which has no more to do with the color of the hair than the vein of gold in a rock has to do with the grass a thousand feet above it i am growing bolder as i write i think it requires not only youth but genius to read this paper i dont mean to imply that it required any whatsoever to talk what i have here written down it did demand a certain amount of memory and such command of the english tongue as is given by a common school education so much i do claim but here i have related at length a string of trivialities you must have the imagination of a poet to transfigure them these little colored patches are stains upon the windows of a human soul stand on the outside they are but dull and meaningless spots of color seen from within they are glorified shapes with empurpled wings and sunbright aureoles my hand trembles when i offer you this many times i have come bearing flowers such as my garden grew but now i offer you this poor brown homely growth you may cast it away as worthless and yet and yet it is something better than flowers it is a seedcapsule many a gardener will cut you a bouquet of his choicest blossoms for small fee but he does not love to let the seeds of his rarest varieties go out of his own hands it is by little things that we know ourselves a soul would very probably mistake itself for another when once disembodied were it not for individual experiences which differ from those of others only in details seemingly trifling all of us have been thirsty thousands of times and felt with pindar that water was the best of things i alone as i think of all mankind remember one particular pailful of water flavored with the whitepine of which the pail was made and the brown mug out of which one edmund a redfaced and curlyhaired boy was averred to have bitten a fragment in his haste to drink it being then high summer and little fullblooded boys feeling very warm and porous in the lowstudded schoolroom where dame prentiss dead and gone ruled over young children many of whom are old ghosts now and have known abraham for twenty or thirty years of our mortal time thirst belongs to humanity everywhere in all ages but that whitepine pail and that brown mug belong to me in particular and just so of my special relationships with other things and with my rice one could never remember himself in eternity by the mere fact of having loved or hated any more than by that of having thirsted love and hate have no more individuality in them than single waves in the ocean but the accidents or trivial marks which distinguished those whom we loved or hated make their memory our own forever and with it that of our own personality also therefore my aged friend of fiveandtwenty or thereabouts pause at the threshold of this particular record and ask yourself seriously whether you are fit to read such revelations as are to follow for observe you have here no splendid array of petals such as poets offer you nothing but a dry shell containing if you will get out what is in it a few small seeds of poems you may laugh at them if you like i shall never tell you what i think of you for so doing but if you can read into the heart of these things in the light of other memories as slight yet as dear to your soul then you are neither more nor less than a poet and can afford to write no more verses during the rest of your natural life which abstinence i take to be one of the surest marks of your meriting the divine name i have just bestowed upon you may i beg of you who have begun this paper nobly trusting to your own imagination and sensibilities to give it the significance which it does not lay claim to without your kind assistance may i beg of you i say to pay particular attention to the brackets which enclose certain paragraphs i want my asides you see to whisper loud to you who read my notes and sometimes i talk a page or two to you without pretending that i said a word of it to our boarders you will find a very long aside to you almost as soon as you begin to read and so dear young friend fall to at once taking such things as i have provided for you and if you turn them by the aid of your powerful imagination into a fair banquet why then peace be with you and a summer by the still waters of some quiet river or by some yellow beach where as my friend the professor says you can sit with natures wrist in your hand and count her oceanpulses i should like to make a few intimate revelations relating especially to my early life if i thought you would like to hear them the schoolmistress turned a little in her chair and sat with her face directed partly towards me halfmourning now purple ribbon that breastpin she wears has gray hair in it her mothers no doubt i remember our landladys daughter telling me soon after the schoolmistress came to board with us that she had lately buried a payrent thats what made her look so pale kept the poor dying thing alive with her own blood ah long illness is the real vampyrism think of living a year or two after one is dead by sucking the lifeblood out of a frail young creature at ones bedside well souls grow white as well as cheeks in these holy duties one that goes in a nurse may come out an angel god bless all good women to their soft hands and pitying hearts we must all come at last the schoolmistress has a better color than when she came too late it might have beenamen how many thoughts go to a dozen heartbeats sometimes there was no long pause after my remark addressed to the company but in that time i had the train of ideas and feelings i have just given flash through my consciousness sudden and sharp as the crooked red streak that springs out of its black sheath like the creese of a malay in his deathrace and stabs the earth right and left in its blind rage i dont deny that there was a pang in it yes a stab but there was a prayer too the amen belonged to that also a vision of a fourstory brick house nicely furnished i actually saw many specific articles curtains sofas tables and others and could draw the patterns of them at this moment a brick house i say looking out on the water with a fair parlor and books and busts and pots of flowers and birdcages all complete and at the window looking on the water two of us male and female created he them these two were standing at the window when a smaller shape that was playing near them looked up at me with such a look that i poured out a glass of water drank it all down and then continued i said i should like to tell you some things such as people commonly never tell about my early recollections should you like to hear them should we like to hear them said the schoolmistress no but we should love to the voice was a sweet one naturally and had something very pleasant in its tone just then the fourstory brick house which had gone out like a transparency when the light behind it is quenched glimmered again for a moment parlor books busts flowerpots birdcages all complete and the figures as before we are waiting with eagerness sir said the divinitystudent the transparency went out as if a flash of black lightning had struck it if you want to hear my confessions the next thing i said is to know whether i can trust you with them it is only fair to say that there are a great many people in the world that laugh at such things i think they are fools but perhaps you dont all agree with me here are children of tender age talked to as if they were capable of understanding calvins institutes and nobody has honesty or sense enough to tell the plain truth about the little wretches that they are as superstitious as naked savages and such miserable spiritual cowards that is if they have any imagination that they will believe anything which is taught them and a great deal more which they teach themselves i was born and bred as i have told you twenty times among books and those who knew what was in books i was carefully instructed in things temporal and spiritual but up to a considerable maturity of childhood i believed raphael and michael angelo to have been superhuman beings the central doctrine of the prevalent religious faith of christendom was utterly confused and neutralized in my mind for years by one of those too common stories of actual life which i overheard repeated in a whisper why did i not ask you will say you dont remember the rosy pudency of sensitive children the first instinctive movement of the little creatures is to make a cache and bury in it beliefs doubts dreams hopes and terrors i am uncovering one of these caches do you think i was necessarily a greater fool and coward than another i was afraid of ships why i could never tell the masts looked frightfully tall but they were not so tall as the steeple of our old yellow meetinghouse at any rate i used to hide my eyes from the sloops and schooners that were wont to lie at the end of the bridge and i confess that traces of this undefined terror lasted very long one other source of alarm had a still more fearful significance there was a great wooden hand a glovemakers sign which used to swing and creak in the blast as it hung from a pillar before a certain shop a mile or two outside of the city oh the dreadful hand always hanging there ready to catch up a little boy who would come home to supper no more nor yet to bedwhose porringer would be laid away empty thenceforth and his halfworn shoes wait until his small brother grew to fit them as for all manner of superstitious observances i used once to think i must have been peculiar in having such a list of them but i now believe that half the children of the same age go through the same experiences no roman soothsayer ever had such a catalogue of omens as i found in the sibylline leaves of my childhood that trick of throwing a stone at a tree and attaching some mighty issue to hitting or missing which you will find mentioned in one or more biographies i well remember stepping on or over certain particular things or spots dr johnsons especial weakness i got the habit of at a very early age i wont swear that i have not some tendency to these not wise practices even at this present date how many of you that read these notes can say the same thing with these follies mingled sweet delusions which i loved so well i would not outgrow them even when it required a voluntary effort to put a momentary trust in them here is one which i cannot help telling you the firing of the great guns at the navyyard is easily heard at the place where i was born and lived there is a ship of war come in they used to say when they heard them of course i supposed that such vessels came in unexpectedly after indefinite years of absence suddenly as falling stones and that the great guns roared in their astonishment and delight at the sight of the old warship splitting the bay with her cutwater now the sloopofwar the wasp captain blakely after gloriously capturing the reindeer and the avon had disappeared from the face of the ocean and was supposed to be lost but there was no proof of it and of course for a time hopes were entertained that she might be heard from long after the last real chance had utterly vanished i pleased myself with the fond illusion that somewhere on the waste of waters she was still floating and there were years during which i never heard the sound of the great guns booming inland from the navyyard without saying to myself the wasp has come and almost thinking i could see her as she rolled in crumpling the water before her weatherbeaten barnacled with shattered spars and threadbare canvas welcomed by the shouts and tears of thousands this was one of those dreams that i nursed and never told let me make a clean breast of it now and say that so late as to have outgrown childhood perhaps to have got far on towards manhood when the roar of the cannon has struck suddenly on my ear i have started with a thrill of vague expectation and tremulous delight and the longunspoken words have articulated themselves in the minds dumb whisper the wasp has come yes children believe plenty of queer things i suppose all of you have had the pocketbook fever when you were little what do i mean why ripping up old pocketbooks in the firm belief that bankbills to an immense amount were hidden in them so too you must all remember some splendid unfulfilled promise of somebody or other which fed you with hopes perhaps for years and which left a blank in your life which nothing has ever filled up o t quitted our household carrying with him the passionate regrets of the more youthful members he was an ingenious youngster wrote wonderful copies and carved the two initials given above with great skill on all available surfaces i thought by the way they were all gone but the other day i found them on a certain door which i will show you some time how it surprised me to find them so near the ground i had thought the boy of no trivial dimensions well o t when he went made a solemn promise to two of us i was to have a ship and the other a martinhouse last syllable pronounced as in the word tin neither ever came but oh how many and many a time i have stolen to the corner the cars pass close by it at this time and looked up that long avenue thinking that he must be coming now almost sure as i turned to look northward that there he would be trudging toward me the ship in one hand and the martinhouse in the other you must not suppose that all i am going to say as well as all i have said was told to the whole company the young fellow whom they call john was in the yard sitting on a barrel and smoking a cheroot the fumes of which came in not ungrateful through the open window the divinitystudent disappeared in the midst of our talk the poor relation in black bombazine who looked and moved as if all her articulations were elbowjoints had gone off to her chamber after waiting with a look of soulsubduing decorum at the foot of the stairs until one of the male sort had passed her and ascended into the upper regions this is a famous point of etiquette in our boardinghouse in fact between ourselves they make such an awful fuss about it that i for one had a great deal rather have them simple enough not to think of such matters at all our landladys daughter said the other evening that she was going to retire whereupon the young fellow called john took up a lamp and insisted on lighting her to the foot of the staircase nothing would induce her to pass by him until the schoolmistress saying in good plain english that it was her bedtime walked straight by them both not seeming to trouble herself about either of them i have been led away from what i meant the portion included in these brackets to inform my readers about i say then most of the boarders had left the table about the time when i began telling some of these secrets of mine all of them in fact but the old gentleman opposite and the schoolmistress i understand why a young woman should like to hear these simple but genuine experiences of early life which are as i have said the little brown seeds of what may yet grow to be poems with leaves of azure and gold but when the old gentleman pushed up his chair nearer to me and slanted round his best ear and once when i was speaking of some trifling tender reminiscence drew a long breath with such a tremor in it that a little more and it would have been a sob why then i felt there must be something of nature in them which redeemed their seeming insignificance tell me man or woman with whom i am whispering have you not a small store of recollections such as these i am uncovering buried beneath the dead leaves of many summers perhaps under the unmelting snows of fastreturning winters a few such recollections which if you should write them all out would be swept into some careless editors drawer and might cost a scanty halfhours lazy reading to his subscribers and yet if death should cheat you of them you would not know yourself in eternity i made three acquaintances at a very early period of life my introduction to whom was never forgotten the first unequivocal act of wrong that has left its trace in my memory was this refusing a small favor asked of me nothing more than telling what had happened at school one morning no matter who asked it but there were circumstances which saddened and awed me i had no heart to speak i faltered some miserable perhaps petulant excuse stole away and the first battle of life was lost what remorse followed i need not tell then and there to the best of my knowledge i first consciously took sin by the hand and turned my back on duty time has led me to look upon my offence more leniently i do not believe it or any other childish wrong is infinite as some have pretended but infinitely finite yet oh if i had but won that battle the great destroyer whose awful shadow it was that had silenced me came near me but never so as to be distinctly seen and remembered during my tender years there flits dimly before me the image of a little girl whose name even i have forgotten a schoolmate whom we missed one day and were told that she had died but what death was i never had any very distinct idea until one day i climbed the low stone wall of the old burialground and mingled with a group that were looking into a very deep long narrow hole dug down through the green sod down through the brown loam down through the yellow gravel and there at the bottom was an oblong red box and a still sharp white face of a young man seen through an opening at one end of it when the lid was closed and the gravel and stones rattled down pellmell and the woman in black who was crying and wringing her hands went off with the other mourners and left him then i felt that i had seen death and should never forget him one other acquaintance i made at an earlier period of life than the habit of romancers authorizes love of course she was a famous beauty afterwards i am satisfied that many children rehearse their parts in the drama of life before they have shed all their milkteeth i think i wont tell the story of the golden blonde i suppose everybody has had his childish fancies but sometimes they are passionate impulses which anticipate all the tremulous emotions belonging to a later period most children remember seeing and adoring an angel before they were a dozen years old the old gentleman had left his chair opposite and taken a seat by the schoolmistress and myself a little way from the table its true its true said the old gentleman he took hold of a steel watchchain which carried a large square gold key at one end and was supposed to have some kind of timekeeper at the other with some trouble he dragged up an ancientlooking thick silver bullseye watch he looked at it for a moment hesitated touched the inner corner of his right eye with the pulp of his middle finger looked at the face of the watch said it was getting into the forenoon then opened the watch and handed me the loose outside case without a word the watchpaper had been pink once and had a faint tinge still as if all its tender life had not yet quite faded out two little birds a flower and in small schoolgirl letters a date no matter before i was thirteen years old said the old gentleman i dont know what was in that young schoolmistresss head nor why she should have done it but she took out the watchpaper and put it softly to her lips as if she were kissing the poor thing that made it so long ago the old gentleman took the watchpaper carefully from her replaced it turned away and walked out holding the watch in his hand i saw him pass the window a moment after with that foolish white hat on his head he couldnt have been thinking what he was about when he put it on so the schoolmistress and i were left alone i drew my chair a shade nearer to her and continued and since i am talking of early recollections i dont know why i shouldnt mention some others that still cling to me not that you will attach any very particular meaning to these same images so full of significance to me but that you will find something parallel to them in your own memory you remember perhaps what i said one day about smells there were certain sounds also which had a mysterious suggestiveness to me not so intense perhaps as that connected with the other sense but yet peculiar and never to be forgotten the first was the creaking of the woodsleds bringing their loads of oak and walnut from the country as the slowswinging oxen trailed them along over the complaining snow in the cold brown light of early morning lying in bed and listening to their dreary music had a pleasure in it akin to the lucretian luxury or that which byron speaks of as to be enjoyed in looking on at a battle by one who hath no friend no brother there there was another sound in itself so sweet and so connected with one of those simple and curious superstitions of childhood of which i have spoken that i can never cease to cherish a sad sort of love for it let me tell the superstitious fancy first the puritan sabbath as everybody knows began at sundown on saturday evening to such observance of it i was born and bred as the large round disk of day declined a stillness a solemnity a somewhat melancholy hush came over us all it was time for work to cease and for playthings to be put away the world of active life passed into the shadow of an eclipse not to emerge until the sun should sink again beneath the horizon it was in this stillness of the world without and of the soul within that the pulsating lullaby of the evening crickets used to make itself most distinctly heard so that i well remember i used to think that the purring of these little creatures which mingled with the batrachian hymns from the neighboring swamp was peculiar to saturday evenings i dont know that anything could give a clearer idea of the quieting and subduing effect of the old habit of observance of what was considered holy time than this strange childish fancy yes and there was still another sound which mingled its solemn cadences with the waking and sleeping dreams of my boyhood it was heard only at times a deep muffled roar which rose and fell not loud but vast a whistling boy would have drowned it for his next neighbor but it must have been heard over the space of a hundred square miles i used to wonder what this might be could it be the roar of the thousand wheels and the ten thousand footsteps jarring and trampling along the stones of the neighboring city that would be continuous but this as i have said rose and fell in regular rhythm i remember being told and i suppose this to have been the true solution that it was the sound of the waves after a high wind breaking on the long beaches many miles distant i should really like to know whether any observing people living ten miles more or less inland from long beaches in such a town for instance as cantabridge in the eastern part of the territory of the massachusetts have ever observed any such sound and whether it was rightly accounted for as above mingling with these inarticulate sounds in the low murmur of memory are the echoes of certain voices i have heard at rare intervals i grieve to say it but our people i think have not generally agreeable voices the marrowy organisms with skins that shed water like the backs of ducks with smooth surfaces neatly padded beneath and velvet linings to their singingpipes are not so common among us as that other pattern of humanity with angular outlines and plane surfaces and integuments hair like the fibrous covering of a cocoanut in gloss and suppleness as well as color and voices at once thin and strenuous acidulous enough to produce effervescence with alkalis and stridulous enough to sing duets with the katydids i think our conversational soprano as sometimes overheard in the cars arising from a group of young persons who may have taken the train at one of our great industrial centres for instance young persons of the female sex we will say who have bustled in fulldressed engaged in loud strident speech and who after free discussion have fixed on two or more double seats which having secured they proceed to eat apples and hand round daguerreotypes i say i think the conversational soprano heard under these circumstances would not be among the allurements the old enemy would put in requisition were he getting up a new temptation of st anthony there are sweet voices among us we all know and voices not musical it may be to those who hear them for the first time yet sweeter to us than any we shall hear until we listen to some warbling angel in the overture to that eternity of blissful harmonies we hope to enjoy but why should i tell lies if my friends love me it is because i try to tell the truth i never heard but two voices in my life that frightened me by their sweetness frightened you said the schoolmistress yes frightened me they made me feel as if there might be constituted a creature with such a chord in her voice to some string in anothers soul that if she but spoke he would leave all and follow her though it were into the jaws of erebus our only chance to keep our wits is that there are so few natural chords between others voices and this string in our souls and that those which at first may have jarred a little by and by come into harmony with it but i tell you this is no fiction you may call the story of ulysses and the sirens a fable but what will you say to mario and the poor lady who followed him whose were those two voices that bewitches me so they both belonged to german women one was a chambermaid not otherwise fascinating the key of my room at a certain great hotel was missing and this teutonic maiden was summoned to give information respecting it the simple soul was evidently not long from her motherland and spoke with sweet uncertainty of dialect but to hear her wonder and lament and suggest with soft liquid inflexions and low sad murmurs in tones as full of serious tenderness for the fate of the lost key as if it had been a child that had strayed from its mother was so winning that had her features and figure been as delicious as her accents if she had looked like the marble clytie for instance why all can say is the schoolmistress opened her eyes so wide that i stopped short i was only going to say that i should have drowned myself for lake erie was close by and it is so much better to accept asphyxia which takes only three minutes by the watch than a mesalliance that lasts fifty years to begin with and then passes along down the line of descent breaking out in all manner of boorish manifestations of feature and manner which if men were only as shortlived as horses could be readily traced back through the squareroots and the cuberoots of the family stem on which you have hung the armorial bearings of the de champignons or the de la morues until one came to beings that ate with knives and said haow that no person of right feeling could have hesitated for a single moment the second of the ravishing voices i have heard was as i have said that of another german woman i suppose i shall ruin myself by saying that such a voice could not have come from any americanized human being what was there in it said the schoolmistress and upon my word her tones were so very musical that i almost wished i had said three voices instead of two and not made the unpatriotic remark above reported oh i said it had so much woman in it muliebrity as well as femineity no selfassertion such as free suffrage introduces into every word and movement large vigorous nature running back to those hugelimbed germans of tacitus but subdued by the reverential training and tuned by the kindly culture of fifty generations sharp business habits a lean soil independence enterprise and east winds are not the best things for the larynx still you hear noble voices among us i have known families famous for them but ask the first person you meet a question and ten to one there is a hard sharp metallic matterofbusiness clink in the accents of the answer that produces the effect of one of those bells which small tradespeople connect with their shopdoors and which spring upon your ear with such vivacity as you enter that your first impulse is to retire at once from the precincts ah but i must not forget that dear little child i saw and heard in a french hospital between two and three years old fell out of her chair and snapped both thighbones lying in bed patient gentle rough students round her some in white aprons looking fearfully businesslike but the child placid perfectly still i spoke to her and the blessed little creature answered me in a voice of such heavenly sweetness with that reedy thrill in it which you have heard in the thrushs evensong that i hear it at this moment while i am writing so many many years afterwards cest tout comme un serin said the french student at my side these are the voices which struck the keynote of my conceptions as to what the sounds we are to hear in heaven will be if we shall enter through one of the twelve gates of pearl there must be other things besides aerolites that wander from their own spheres to ours and when we speak of celestial sweetness or beauty we may be nearer the literal truth than we dream if mankind generally are the shipwrecked survivors of some preadamitic cataclysm set adrift in these little open boats of humanity to make one more trial to reach the shore as some grave theologians have maintained if in plain english men are the ghosts of dead devils who have died into life to borrow an expression from keats and walk the earth in a suit of living rags which lasts three or four score summers why there must have been a few good spirits sent to keep them company and these sweet voices i speak of must belong to them i wish you could once hear my sisters voice said the schoolmistress if it is like yours it must be a pleasant one said i i never thought mine was anything said the schoolmistress how should you know said i people never hear their own voicesany more than they see their own faces there is not even a lookingglass for the voice of course there is something audible to us when we speak but that something is not our own voice as it is known to all our acquaintances i think if an image spoke to us in our own tones we should not know them in the least how pleasant it would be if in another state of being we could have shapes like our former selves for playthings we standing outside or inside of them as we liked and they being to us just what we used to be to others i wonder if there will be nothing like what we call play after our earthly toys are broken said the schoolmistress hush said i what will the divinitystudent say i thought she was hit that time but the shot must have gone over her or on one side of her she did not flinch oh said the schoolmistress he must look out for my sisters heresies i am afraid he will be too busy with them to take care of mine do you mean to say said i that it is your sister whom that student the young fellow commonly known as john who had been sitting on the barrel smoking jumped off just then kicked over the barrel gave it a push with his foot that set it rolling and stuck his saucylooking face in at the window so as to cut my question off in the middle and the schoolmistress leaving the room a few minutes afterwards i did not have a chance to finish it the young fellow came in and sat down in a chair putting his heels on the top of another pooty girl said he a fine young lady i replied keeps a firstrate school according to accounts said he teaches all sorts of things latin and italian and music folks rich once smashed up she went right ahead as smart as if shed been born to work thats the kind o girl i go for id marry her only two or three other girls would drown themselves if i did i think the above is the longest speech of this young fellows which i have put on record i do not like to change his peculiar expressions for this is one of those cases in which the style is the man as m de buffon says the fact is the young fellow is a goodhearted creature enough only too fond of his jokes and if it were not for those heatlightning winks on one side of his face i should not mind his fun much some days after this when the company were together again i talked a little i dont think i have a genuine hatred for anybody i am well aware that i differ herein from the sturdy english moralist and the stout american tragedian i dont deny that i hate the sight of certain people but the qualities which make me tend to hate the man himself are such as i am so much disposed to pity that except under immediate aggravation i feel kindly enough to the worst of them it is such a sad thing to be born a sneaking fellow so much worse than to inherit a humpback or a couple of clubfeet that i sometimes feel as if we ought to love the crippled souls if i may use this expression with a certain tenderness which we need not waste on noble natures one who is born with such congenital incapacity that nothing can make a gentleman of him is entitled not to our wrath but to our profoundest sympathy but as we cannot help hating the sight of these people just as we do that of physical deformities we gradually eliminate them from our society we love them but open the window and let them go by the time decent people reach middle age they have weeded their circle pretty well of these unfortunates unless they have a taste for such animals in which case no matter what their position may be there is something you may be sure in their natures akin to that of their wretched parasites the divinitystudent wished to know what i thought of affinities as well as of antipathies did i believe in love at first sight sir said i all men love all women that is the primafacie aspect of the case the court of nature assumes the law to be that all men do so and the individual man is bound to show cause why he does not love any particular woman a man says one of my old blackletter lawbooks may show divers good reasons as thus he hath not seen the person named in the indictment she is of tender age or the reverse of that she hath certain personal disqualifications as for instance she is a blackamoor or hath an illfavored countenance or his capacity of loving being limited his affections are engrossed by a previous comer and so of other conditions not the less is it true that he is bound by duty and inclined by nature to love each and every woman therefore it is that each woman virtually summons every man to show cause why he doth not love her this is not by written document or direct speech for the most part but by certain signs of silk gold and other materials which say to all men look on me and love as in duty bound then the man pleadeth his special incapacity whatsoever that may be as for instance impecuniosity or that he hath one or many wives in his household or that he is of mean figure or small capacity of which reasons it may be noted that the first is according to late decisions of chiefest authority so far the old lawbook but there is a note from an older authority saying that every woman doth also love each and every man except there be some good reason to the contrary and a very observing friend of mine a young unmarried clergyman tells me that so far as his experience goes he has reason to think the ancient author had fact to justify his statement ill tell you how it is with the pictures of women we fall in love with at first sight we ant talking about pictures said the landladys daughter were talking about women i understood that we were speaking of love at sight i remarked mildly now as all a man knows about a woman whom he looks at is just what a picture as big as a copper or a nickel rather at the bottom of his eye can teach him i think i am right in saying we are talking about the pictures of women well now the reason why a man is not desperately in love with ten thousand women at once is just that which prevents all our portraits being distinctly seen upon that wall they all are painted there by reflection from our faces but because all of them are painted on each spot and each on the same surface and many other objects at the same time no one is seen as a picture but darken a chamber and let a single pencil of rays in through a keyhole then you have a picture on the wall we never fall in love with a woman in distinction from women until we can get an image of her through a pinhole and then we can see nothing else and nobody but ourselves can see the image in our mental cameraobscura my friend the poet tells me he has to leave town whenever the anniversaries come round whats the difficulty why they all want him to get up and make speeches or songs or toasts which is just the very thing he doesnt want to do he is an old story he says and hates to show on these occasions but they tease him and coax him and cant do without him and feel all over his poor weak head until they get their fingers on the fontanelle the professor will tell you what this means he says the one at the top of the head always remains open in poets until by gentle pressure on that soft pulsating spot they stupefy him to the point of acquiescence there are times though he says when it is a pleasure before going to some agreeable meeting to rush out into ones garden and clutch up a handful of what grows there weeds and violets together not cutting them off but pulling them up by the roots with the brown earth they grow in sticking to them thats his idea of a postprandial performance look here now these verses i am going to read you he tells me were pulled up by the roots just in that way the other day beautiful entertainment names there on the plates that flow from all englishspeaking tongues as familiarly as and or the entertainers known wherever good poetry and fair titlepages are held in esteem guest a kindhearted modest genial hopeful poet who sings to the hearts of his countrymen the british people the songs of good cheer which the better days to come as all honest souls trust and believe will turn into the prose of common life my friend the poet says you must not read such a string of verses too literally if he trimmed it nicely below you wouldnt see the roots he says and he likes to keep them and a little of the soil clinging to them this is the farewell my friend the poet read to his and our friend the poet a good time going brave singer of the coming time sweet minstrel of the joyous present crowned with the noblest wreath of rhyme the hollyleaf of ayrshires peasant goodbye goodbye our hearts and hands our lips in honest saxon phrases cry god be with him till he stands his feet among the english daisies tis here we part for other eyes the busy deck the flattering streamer the dripping arms that plunge and rise the waves in foam the ship in tremor the kerchiefs waving from the pier the cloudy pillar gliding oer him the deep blue desert lone and drear with heaven above and home before him his home the western giant smiles and twirls the spotty globe to find itthis little speck the british isles tis but a freckle never mind ithe laughs and all his prairies roll each gurgling cataract roars and chuckles and ridges stretched from pole to pole heave till they crack their iron knuckles but memory blushes at the sneer and honor turns with frown defiant and freedom leaning on her spear laughs louder than the laughing giantan islet is a world she said when glory with its dust has blended and britain kept her noble dead till earth and seas and skies are rended beneath each swinging forestbough some arm as stout in death reposesfrom wavewashed foot to heavenkissed brow her valors lifeblood runs in roses nay let our brothers of the west write smiling in their florid pages onehalf her soil has walked the rest in poets heroes martyrs sages hugged in the clinging billows clasp from seaweed fringe to mountain heather the british oak with rooted grasp her slender handful holds togetherwith cliffs of white and bowers of green and ocean narrowing to caress her and hills and threaded streams betweenour little mother isle god bless her in earths broad temple where we stand fanned by the eastern gales that brought us we hold the missal in our hand bright with the lines our mother taught us whereer its blazoned page betrays the glistening links of gilded fetters behold the halfturned leaf displays her rubric stained in crimson letters enough to speed a parting friend tis vain alike to speak and listenyet stay these feeble accents blend with rays of light from eyes that glisten goodbye once more and kindly tell in words of peace the young worlds storyand say besides we love too well our mothers soil our fathers glory when my friend the professor found that my friend the poet had been coming out in this fullblown style he got a little excited as you may have seen a canary sometimes when another strikes up the professor says he knows he can lecture and thinks he can write verses at any rate he has often tried and now he was determined to try again so when some professional friends of his called him up one day after a feast of reason and a regular freshet of soul which had lasted two or three hours he read them these verses he introduced them with a few remarks he told me of which the only one he remembered was this that he had rather write a single line which one among them should think worth remembering than set them all laughing with a string of epigrams it was all right i dont doubt at any rate that was his fancy then and perhaps another time he may be obstinately hilarious however it may be that he is growing graver for time is a fact so long as clocks and watches continue to go and a cat cant be a kitten always as the old gentleman opposite said the other day you must listen to this seriously for i think the professor was very much in earnest when he wrote it the two armies as lifes unending column pours two marshalled hosts are seen two armies on the trampled shores that death flows black between one marches to the drumbeats roll the widemouthed clarions bray and bears upon a crimson scroll our glory is to slay one moves in silence by the stream with sad yet watchful eyes calm as the patient planets gleam that walks the clouded skies along its front no sabres shine no bloodred pennons wave its banner bears the single line our duty is to save for those no deathbeds lingering shade at honors trumpetcall with knitted brow and lifted blade in glorys arms they fall for these no clashing falchions bright no stirring battlecry the bloodless stabber calls by nighteach answers here am i for those the sculptors laurelled bust the builders marble piles the anthems pealing oer their dust through long cathedral

each burning lifedrops flow each falling tear of love though from the heros bleeding breast her pulses freedom drew though the white lilies in her crest sprang from that scarlet dew while valors haughty champions wait till all their scars are shown love walks unchallenged through the gate to sit beside the throne chapter x the schoolmistress came down with a rose in her hair a fresh june rose she has been walking early she has brought back two others one on each cheek i told her so in some such pretty phrase as i could muster for the occasion those two blushroses i just spoke of turned into a couple of damasks i suppose all this went through my mind for this was what i went on to say i love the damask rose best of all the flowers our mothers and sisters used to love and cherish those which grow beneath our eaves and by our doorstep are the ones we always love best if the houyhnhnms should ever catch me and finding me particularly vicious and unmanageable send a mantamer to rareyfy me ill tell you what drugs he would have to take and how he would have to use them imagine yourself reading a number of the houyhnhnm gazette giving an account of such an experiment mantaming extraordinary the softhoofed semiquadruped recently captured was subjected to the art of our distinguished mantamer in presence of a numerous assembly the animal was led in by two stout ponies closely confined by straps to prevent his sudden and dangerous tricks of shoulderhitting and footstriking his countenance expressed the utmost degree of ferocity and cunning the operator took a handful of budding lilacleaves and crushing them slightly between his hoofs so as to bring out their peculiar fragrance fastened them to the end of a long pole and held them towards the creature its expression changed in an instant it drew in their fragrance eagerly and attempted to seize them with its soft split hoofs having thus quieted his suspicious subject the operator proceeded to tie a blue hyacinth to the end of the pole and held it out towards the wild animal the effect was magical its eyes filled as if with raindrops and its lips trembled as it pressed them to the flower after this it was perfectly quiet and brought a measure of corn to the mantamer without showing the least disposition to strike with the feet or hit from the shoulder that will do for the houyhnhnm gazette do you ever wonder why poets talk so much about flowers did you ever hear of a poet who did not talk about them dont you think a poem which for the sake of being original should leave them out would be like those verses where the letter a or e or some other is omitted no they will bloom over and over again in poems as in the summer fields to the end of time always old and always new why should we be more shy of repeating ourselves than the spring be tired of blossoms or the night of stars look at nature she never wearies of saying over her floral paternoster in the crevices of cyclopean wallsin the dust where men lie dust also on the mounds that bury huge cities the wreck of nineveh and the babelheap still that same sweet prayer and benediction the amen of nature is always a flower are you tired of my trivial personalities those splashes and streaks of sentiment sometimes perhaps of sentimentality which you may see when i show you my hearts corolla as if it were a tulip pray do not give yourself the trouble to fancy me an idiot whose conceit it is to treat himself as an exceptional being it is because you are just like me that i talk and know that you will listen we are all splashed and streaked with sentiments not with precisely the same tints or in exactly the same patterns but by the same hand and from the same palette i dont believe any of you happen to have just the same passion for the blue hyacinth which i have very certainly not for the crushed lilacleafbuds many of you do not know how sweet they are you love the smell of the sweetfern and the bayberryleaves i dont doubt but i hardly think that the last bewitches you with young memories as it does me for the same reason i come back to damask roses after having raised a good many of the rarer varieties i like to go to operas and concerts but there are queer little old homely sounds that are better than music to me however i suppose its foolish to tell such things it is pleasant to be foolish at the right time said the divinitystudent saying it however in one of the dead languages which i think are unpopular for summerreading and therefore do not bear quotation as such well now said i suppose a good clean wholesomelooking countrymans cart stops opposite my door do i want any huckleberries if i do not there are those that do thereupon my softvoiced handmaid bears out a large tin pan and then the wholesome countryman heaping the peckmeasure spreads his broad hands around its lower arc to confine the wild and frisky berries and so they run nimbly along the narrowing channel until they tumble rustling down in a black cascade and tinkle on the resounding metal beneath i wont say that this rushing huckleberry hailstorm has not more music for me than the anvil chorus i wonder how my great trees are coming on this summer where are your great trees sir said the divinitystudent oh all round about new england i call all trees mine that i have put my weddingring on and i have as many treewives as brigham young has human ones one sets as green as the other exclaimed a boarder who has never been identified theyre all bloomers said the young fellow called john i should have rebuked this trifling with language if our landladys daughter had not asked me just then what i meant by putting my weddingring on a tree why measuring it with my thirtyfoot tape my dear said i i have worn a tape almost out on the rough barks of our old new england elms and other big trees dont you want to hear me talk trees a little now that is one of my specialities so they all agreed that they should like to hear me talk about trees i want you to understand in the first place that i have a most intense passionate fondness for trees in general and have had several romantic attachments to certain trees in particular now if you expect me to hold forth in a scientific way about my treeloves to talk for instance of the ulmus americana and describe the ciliated edges of its samara and all that you are an anserine individual and i must refer you to a dull friend who will discourse to you of such matters what should you think of a lover who should describe the idol of his heart in the language of science thus class mammalia order primates genus homo species europeus variety brown individual ann eliza dental formula i c p m and so on no my friends i shall speak of trees as we see them love them adore them in the fields where they are alive holding their green sunshades over our heads talking to us with their hundred thousand whispering tongues looking down on us with that sweet meekness which belongs to huge but limited organisms which one sees in the brown eyes of oxen but most in the patient posture the outstretched arms and the heavydrooping robes of these vast beings endowed with life but not with soul which outgrow us and outlive us but stand helpless poor things while nature dresses and undresses them like so many fullsized but underwitted children did you ever read old daddy gilpin slowest of men even of english men yet delicious in his slowness as is the light of a sleepy eye in woman i always supposed dr syntax was written to make fun of him i have a whole set of his works and am very proud of it with its gray paper and open type and long ff and orangejuice landscapes the pere gilpin had the kind of science i like in the study of nature a little less observation than white of selborne but a little more poetry just think of applying the linnaean system to an elm who cares how many stamens or pistils that little brown flower which comes out before the leaf may have to classify it by what we want is the meaning the character the expression of a tree as a kind and as an individual there is a motheridea in each particular kind of tree which if well marked is probably embodied in the poetry of every language take the oak for instance and we find it always standing as a type of strength and endurance i wonder if you ever thought of the single mark of supremacy which distinguishes this tree from all our other foresttrees all the rest of them shirk the work of resisting gravity the oak alone defies it it chooses the horizontal direction for its limbs so that their whole weight may tell and then stretches them out fifty or sixty feet so that the strain may be mighty enough to be worth resisting you will find that in passing from the extreme downward droop of the branches of the weepingwillow to the extreme upward inclination of those of the poplar they sweep nearly half a circle at degrees the oak stops short to slant upward another degree would mark infirmity of purpose to bend downwards weakness of organization the american elm betrays something of both yet sometimes as we shall see puts on a certain resemblance to its sturdier neighbor it wont do to be exclusive in our taste about trees there is hardly one of them which has not peculiar beauties in some fitting place for it i remember a tall poplar of monumental proportions and aspect a vast pillar of glossy green placed on the summit of a lofty hill and a beacon to all the country round a native of that region saw fit to build his house very near it and having a fancy that it might blow down some time or other and exterminate himself and any incidental relatives who might be stopping or tarrying with him also laboring under the delusion that human life is under all circumstances to be preferred to vegetable existence had the great poplar cut down it is so easy to say it is only a poplar and so much harder to replace its living cone than to build a granite obelisk i must tell you about some of my treewives i was at one period of my life much devoted to the young ladypopulation of rhode island a small but delightful state in the neighborhood of pawtucket the number of inhabitants being not very large i had leisure during my visits to the providence plantations to inspect the face of the country in the intervals of more fascinating studies of physiognomy i heard some talk of a great elm a short distance from the locality just mentioned let us see the great elm i said and proceeded to find it knowing that it was on a certain farm in a place called johnston if i remember rightly i shall never forget my ride and my introduction to the great johnston elm i always tremble for a celebrated tree when i approach it for the first time provincialism has no scale of excellence in man or vegetable it never knows a firstrate article of either kind when it has it and is constantly taking second and third rate ones for natures best i have often fancied the tree was afraid of me and that a sort of shiver came over it as over a betrothed maiden when she first stands before the unknown to whom she has been plighted before the measuringtape the proudest tree of them all quails and shrinks into itself all those stories of four or five men stretching their arms around it and not touching each others fingers if ones pacing the shadow at noon and making it so many hundred feet die upon its leafy lips in the presence of the awful ribbon which has strangled so many false pretensions as i rode along the pleasant way watching eagerly for the object of my journey the rounded tops of the elms rose from time to time at the roadside wherever one looked taller and fuller than the rest i asked myself is this it but as i drew nearer they grew smaller or it proved perhaps that two standing in a line had looked like one and so deceived me at last all at once when i was not thinking of it i declare to you it makes my flesh creep when i think of it now all at once i saw a great green cloud swelling in the horizon so vast so symmetrical of such olympian majesty and imperial supremacy among the lesser forestgrowths that my heart stopped short then jumped at my ribs as a hunter springs at a fivebarred gate and i felt all through me without need of uttering the words this is it you will find this tree described with many others in the excellent report upon the trees and shrubs of massachusetts the author has given my friend the professor credit for some of his measurements but measured this tree himself carefully it is a grand elm for size of trunk spread of limbs and muscular development one of the first perhaps the first of the first class of new england elms the largest actual girth i have ever found at five feet from the ground is in the great elm lying a stones throw or two north of the main road if my points of compass are right in springfield but this has much the appearance of having been formed by the union of two trunks growing side by side the westspringfield elm and one upon northampton meadows belong also to the first class of trees there is a noble old wreck of an elm at hatfield which used to spread its claws out over a circumference of thirtyfive feet or more before they covered the foot of its bole up with earth this is the american elm most like an oak of any i have ever seen the sheffield elm is equally remarkable for size and perfection of form i have seen nothing that comes near it in berkshire county and few to compare with it anywhere i am not sure that i remember any other firstclass elms in new england but there may be many what makes a firstclass elm why size in the first place and chiefly anything over twenty feet of clear girth five feet above the ground and with a spread of branches a hundred feet across may claim that title according to my scale all of them with the questionable exception of the springfield tree above referred to stop so far as my experience goes at about twentytwo or twentythree feet of girth and a hundred and twenty of spread elms of the second class generally ranging from fourteen to eighteen feet are comparatively common the queen of them all is that glorious tree near one of the churches in springfield beautiful and stately she is beyond all praise the great tree on boston common comes in the second rank as does the one at cohasset which used to have and probably has still a head as round as an appletree and that at newburyport with scores of others which might be mentioned these last two have perhaps been overcelebrated both however are pleasing vegetables the poor old pittsfield elm lives on its past reputation a wig of false leaves is indispensable to make it presentable i dont doubt there may be some monsterelm or other vegetating green but inglorious in some remote new england village which only wants a sacred singer to make it celebrated send us your measurements certified by the postmaster to avoid possible imposition circumference five feet from soil length of line from boughend to boughend and we will see what can be done for you i wish somebody would get us up the following work sylva novanglica photographs of new england elms and other trees taken upon the same scale of magnitude with letterpress descriptions by a distinguished literary gentleman boston co the same camera should be used so far as possible at a fixed distance our friend who has given us so many interesting figures in his trees of america must not think this prospectus invades his province a dozen portraits with lively descriptions would be a pretty complement to his large work which so far as published i find excellent if my plan were carried out and another series of a dozen english trees photographed on the same scale the comparison would be charming it has always been a favorite idea of mine to bring the life of the old and the new world face to face by an accurate comparison of their various types of organization we should begin with man of course institute a large and exact comparison between the development of la pianta umana as alfieri called it in different sections of each country in the different callings at different ages estimating height weigh force by the dynamometer and the spirometer and finishing off with a series of typical photographs giving the principal national physiognomies mr hutchinson has given us some excellent english data to begin with then i would follow this up by contrasting the various parallel forms of life in the two continents our naturalists have often referred to this incidentally or expressly but the animus of nature in the two half globes of the planet is so momentous a point of interest to our race that it should be made a subject of express and elaborate study go out with me into that walk which we call the mall and look at the english and american elms the american elm is tall graceful slendersprayed and drooping as if from languor the english elm is compact robust holds its branches up and carries its leaves for weeks longer than our own native tree is this typical of the creative force on the two sides of the ocean or not nothing but a careful comparison through the whole realm of life can answer this question there is a parallelism without identity in the animal and vegetable life of the two continents which favors the task of comparison in an extraordinary manner just as we have two trees alike in many ways yet not the same both elms yet easily distinguishable just so we have a complete flora and a fauna which parting from the same ideal embody it with various modifications inventive power is the only quality of which the creative intelligence seems to be economical just as with our largest human minds that is the divinest of faculties and the one that most exhausts the mind which exercises it as the same patterns have very commonly been followed we can see which is worked out in the largest spirit and determine the exact limitations under which the creator places the movement of life in all its manifestations in either locality we should find ourselves in a very false position if it should prove that anglosaxons cant live here but die out if not kept up by fresh supplies as dr knox and other more or less wise persons have maintained it may turn out the other way as i have heard one of our literary celebrities argue and though i took the other side i liked his best that the american is the englishman reinforced will you walk out and look at those elms with me after breakfast i said to the schoolmistress i am not going to tell lies about it and say that she blushed as i suppose she ought to have done at such a tremendous piece of gallantry as that was for our boardinghouse on the contrary she turned a little pale but smiled brightly and said yes with pleasure but she must walk towards her school she went for her bonnet the old gentleman opposite followed her with his eyes and said he wished he was a young fellow presently she came down looking very pretty in her halfmourning bonnet and carrying a schoolbook in her hand my first walk with the schoolmistress this is the shortest way she said as we came to a corner then we wont take it said i the schoolmistress laughed a little and said she was ten minutes early so she could go round we walked under mr paddocks row of english elms the gray squirrels were out looking for their breakfasts and one of them came toward us in light soft intermittent leaps until he was close to the rail of the burialground he was on a grave with a broad blueslatestone at its head and a shrub growing on it the stone said this was the grave of a young man who was the son of an honorable gentleman and who died a hundred years ago and more oh yes died with a small triangular mark in one breast and another smaller opposite in his back where another young mans rapier had slid through his body and so he lay down out there on the common and was found cold the next morning with the nightdews and the deathdews mingled on his forehead let us have one look at poor benjamins grave said i his bones lie where his body was laid so long ago and where the stone says they lie which is more than can be said of most of the tenants of this and several other burialgrounds the most accursed act of vandalism ever committed within my knowledge was the uprooting of the ancient gravestones in three at least of our city burialgrounds and one at least just outside the city and planting them in rows to suit the taste for symmetry of the perpetrators many years ago when this disgraceful process was going on under my eyes i addressed an indignant remonstrance to a leading journal i suppose it was deficient in literary elegance or too warm in its language for no notice was taken of it and the hyenahorror was allowed to complete itself in the face of daylight i have never got over it the bones of my own ancestors being entombed lie beneath their own tablet but the upright stones have been shuffled about like chessmen and nothing short of the day of judgment will tell whose dust lies beneath any of those records meant by affection to mark one small spot as sacred to some cherished memory shame shame shame that is all i can say it was on public thoroughfares under the eye of authority that this infamy was enacted the red indians would have known better the selectmen of an african kraalvillage would have had more respect for their ancestors i should like to see the gravestones which have been disturbed all removed and the ground levelled leaving the flat tombstones epitaphs were never famous for truth but the old reproach of here lies never had such a wholesale illustration as in these outraged burialplaces where the stone does lie above and the bones do not lie beneath stop before we turn away and breathe a womans sigh over poor benjamins dust love killed him i think twenty years old and out there fighting another young fellow on the common in the cool of that old july evening yes there must have been love at the bottom of it the schoolmistress dropped a rosebud she had in her hand through the rails upon the grave of benjamin woodbridge that was all her comment upon what i told her how women love love said i but she did not speak we came opposite the head of a place or court running eastward from the main street look down there i said my friend the professor lived in that house at the left hand next the further corner for years and years he died out of it the other day died said the schoolmistress certainly said i we die out of houses just as we die out of our bodies a commercial smash kills a hundred mens houses for them as a railroad crash kills their mortal frames and drives out the immortal tenants men sicken of houses until at last they quit them as the soul leaves its body when it is tired of its infirmities the body has been called the house we live in the house is quite as much the body we live in shall i tell you some things the professor said the other day do said the schoolmistress a mans body said the professor is whatever is occupied by his will and his sensibility the small room down there where i wrote those papers you remember reading was much more a portion of my body than a paralytics senseless and motionless arm or leg is of his the soul of a man has a series of concentric envelopes round it like the core of an onion or the innermost of a nest of boxes first he has his natural garment of flesh and blood then his artificial integuments with their true skin of solid stuffs their cuticle of lighter tissues and their variouslytinted pigments thirdly his domicile be it a single chamber or a stately mansion and then the whole visible world in which time buttons him up as in a loose outside wrapper you shall observe the professor said for like mr john hunter and other great men he brings in that shall with great effect sometimes you shall observe that a mans clothing or series of envelopes does after a certain time mould itself upon his individual nature we know this of our hats and are always reminded of it when we happen to put them on wrong side foremost we soon find that the beaver is a hollow cast of the skull with all its irregular bumps and depressions just so all that clothes a man even to the blue sky which caps his head a little loosely shapes itself to fit each particular being beneath it farmers sailors astronomers poets lovers condemned criminals all find it different according to the eyes with which they severally look but our houses shape themselves palpably on our inner and outer natures see a householder breaking up and you will be sure of it there is a shellfish which builds all manner of smaller shells into the walls of its own a house is never a home until we have crusted it with the spoils of a hundred lives besides those of our own past see what these are and you can tell what the occupant is i had no idea said the professor until i pulled up my domestic establishment the other day what an enormous quantity of roots i had been making during the years i was planted there why there wasnt a nook or a corner that some fibre had not worked its way into and when i gave the last wrench each of them seemed to shriek like a mandrake as it broke its hold and came away there is nothing that happens you know which must not inevitably and which does not actually photograph itself in every conceivable aspect and in all dimensions the infinite galleries of the past await but one brief process and all their pictures will be called out and fixed forever we had a curious illustration of the great fact on a very humble scale when a certain bookcase long standing in one place for which it was built was removed there was the exact image on the wall of the whole and of many of its portions but in the midst of this picture was another the precise outline of a map which had hung on the wall before the bookcase was built we had all forgotten everything about the map until we saw its photograph on the wall then we remembered it as some day or other we may remember a sin which has been built over and covered up when this lower universe is pulled away from before the wall of infinity where the wrongdoing stands selfrecorded the professor lived in that house a long time not twenty years but pretty near it when he entered that door two shadows glided over the threshold five lingered in the doorway when he passed through it for the last time and one of the shadows was claimed by its owner to be longer than his own what changes he saw in that quiet place death rained through every roof but his children came into life grew to maturity wedded faded away threw themselves away the whole drama of life was played in that stockcompanys theatre of a dozen houses one of which was his and no deep sorrow or severe calamity ever entered his dwelling peace be to those walls forever the professor said for the many pleasant years he has passed within them the professor has a friend now living at a distance who has been with him in many of his changes of place and who follows him in imagination with tender interest wherever he goes in that little court where he lived in gay loneliness so long in his autumnal sojourn by the connecticut where it comes loitering down from its mountain fastnesses like a great lord swallowing up the small proprietary rivulets very quietly as it goes until it gets proud and swollen and wantons in huge luxurious oxbows about the fair northampton meadows and at last overflows the oldest inhabitants memory in profligate freshets at hartford and all along its lower shores up in that caravansary on the banks of the stream where ledyard launched his log canoe and the jovial old colonel used to lead the commencement processions where blue ascutney looked down from the far distance and the hills of beulah as the professor always called them rolled up the opposite horizon in soft climbing masses so suggestive of the pilgrims heavenward path that he used to look through his old dollond to see if the shining ones were not within range of sight sweet visions sweetest in those sunday walks which carried them by the peaceful common through the solemn village lying in cataleptic stillness under the shadow of the rod of moses to the terminus of their harmless stroll the patulous fage in the professors classic dialect the spreading beech in more familiar phrase stop and breathe here a moment for the sentence is not done yet and we have another long journey before us and again once more up among those other hills that shut in the amberflowing housatonic dark stream but clear like the lucid orbs that shine beneath the lids of auburnhaired sherrywineeyed demiblondes in the home overlooking the winding stream and the smooth flat meadow looked down upon by wild hills where the tracks of bears and catamounts may yet sometimes be seen upon the winter snow facing the twin summits which rise in the far north the highest waves of the great landstorm in all this billowy region suggestive to mad fancies of the breasts of a halfburied titaness stretched out by a stray thunderbolt and hastily hidden away beneath the leaves of the forest in that home where seven blessed summers were passed which stand in memory like the seven golden candlesticks in the beatific vision of the holy dreamer in that modest dwelling we were just looking at not glorious yet not unlovely in the youth of its drab and mahogany full of great and little boys playthings from top to bottom in all these summer or winter nests he was always at home and always welcome this long articulated sigh of reminiscences this calenture which shows me the mapleshadowed plains of berkshire and the mountaincircled green of grafton beneath the salt waves which come feeling their way along the wall at my feet restless and softtouching as blind mens busy fingers is for that friend of mine who looks into the waters of the patapsco and sees beneath them the same visions which paint themselves for me in the green depths of the charles did i talk all this off to the schoolmistress why no of course not i have been talking with you the reader for the last ten minutes you dont think i should expect any woman to listen to such a sentence as that long one without giving her a chance to put in a word what did i say to the schoolmistress permit me one moment i dont doubt your delicacy and goodbreeding but in this particular case as i was allowed the privilege of walking alone with a very interesting young woman you must allow me to remark in the classic version of a familiar phrase used by our master benjamin franklin it is nullum tui negotii when the schoolmistress and i reached the schoolroom door the damask roses i spoke of were so much heightened in color by exercise that i felt sure it would be useful to her to take a stroll like this every morning and made up my mind i would ask her to let me join her again extract from my private journal to be burned unread i am afraid i have been a fool for i have told as much of myself to this young person as if she were of that ripe and discreet age which invites confidence and expansive utterance i have been lowspirited and listless lately it is coffee i think i observe that which is bought readyground never affects the head and i notice that i tell my secrets too easily when i am downhearted there are inscriptions on our hearts which like that on dighton rock are never to be seen except at deadlow tide there is a womans footstep on the sand at the side of my deepest oceanburied inscription oh no no no a thousand times no yet what is this which has been shaping itself in my soul is it a thought is it a dream is it a passion then i know what comes next the asylum stands on a bright and breezy hill those glazed corridors are pleasant to walk in in bad weather but there are iron bars to all the windows when it is fair some of us can stroll outside that very high fence but i never see much life in those groups i sometimes meet and then the careful man watches them so closely how i remember that sad company i used to pass on fine mornings when i was a schoolboy b with his arms full of yellow weeds ore from the gold mines which he discovered long before we heard of california y born to millions crazed by too much plumcake the boys said dogged explosive made a polyphemus of my weakeyed schoolmaster by a vicious flirt with a stick the multimillonnaires sent him a trifle it was said to buy another eye with but boys are jealous of rich folks and i dont doubt the good people made him easy for life how i remember them all i recollect as all do the story of the hall of eblis in vathek and how each shape as it lifted its hand from its breast showed its heart a burning coal the real hall of eblis stands on yonder summit go there on the next visitingday and ask that figure crouched in the corner huddled up like those indian mummies and skeletons found buried in the sitting posture to lift its hand look upon its heart and behold not fire but ashes no i must not think of such an ending dying would be a much more gentlemanly way of meeting the difficulty make a will and leave her a house or two and some stocks and other little financial conveniences to take away her necessity for keeping school i wonder what nice young mans feet would be in my french slippers before six months were over well what then if a man really loves a woman of course he wouldnt marry her for the world if he were not quite sure that he was the best person she could by any possibility marry it is odd enough to read over what i have just been writing it is the merest fancy that ever was in the world i shall never be married she will and if she is as pleasant as she has been so far i will give her a silver teaset and go and take tea with her and her husband sometimes no coffee i hope though it depresses me sadly i feel very miserably they must have been grinding it at home another morning walk will be good for me and i dont doubt the schoolmistress will be glad of a little fresh air before school the throbbing flushes of the poetical intermittent have been coming over me from time to time of late did you ever see that electrical experiment which consists in passing a flash through letters of goldleaf in a darkened room whereupon some name or legend springs out of the darkness in characters of fire there are songs all written out in my soul which i could read if the flash might pass through them but the fire must come down from heaven ah but what if the stormy nimbus of youthful passion has blown by and one asks for lightning from the ragged cirrus of dissolving aspirations or the silvered cumulus of sluggish satiety i will call on her whom the dead poets believed in whom living ones no longer worship the immortal maid who name her what you will goddess muse spirit of beauty sits by the pillow of every youthful poet and bends over his pale forehead until her tresses lie upon his cheek and rain their gold into his dreams musa o my lost beauty hast thou folded quite thy wings of morning light beyond those iron gates where life crowds hurrying to the haggard fates and age upon his mound of ashes waits to chill our fiery dreams hot from the heart of youth plunged in his icy streams leave me not fading in these weeds of care whose flowers are silvered hairhave i not loved thee long though my young lips have often done thee wrong and vexed thy heaventuned ear with careless song ah wilt thou yet return bearing thy rosehued torch and bid thine altar burn come to me i will flood thy silent shine with my souls sacred wine and heap thy marble floors as the wild spicetrees waste their fragrant stores in leafy islands walled with madrepores and lapped in orient seas when all their feathery palm toss plumelike in the breeze come to me thou shalt feed on honied words sweeter than song of birdsno wailing bulbuls throat no melting dulcimers melodious note when oer the midnight wave its

oh for thy burning lips to fire my brain with thrills of wild sweet painon lifes autumnal blast like shrivelled leaves youths passionflowers are castonce loving thee we love thee to the lastbehold thy newdecked shrine and hear once more the voice that breathed forever thine chapter xi the company looked a little flustered one morning when i came inso much so that i inquired of my neighbor the divinitystudent what had been going on it appears that the young fellow whom they call john had taken advantage of my being a little late i having been rather longer than usual dressing that morning to circulate several questions involving a quibble or play upon words in short containing that indignity to the human understanding condemned in the passages from the distinguished moralist of the last century and the illustrious historian of the present which i cited on a former occasion and known as a pun after breakfast one of the boarders handed me a small roll of paper containing some of the questions and their answers i subjoin two or three of them to show what a tendency there is to frivolity and meaningless talk in young persons of a certain sort when not restrained by the presence of more reflective natures it was asked why tertian and quartan fevers were like certain shortlived insects some interesting physiological relation would be naturally suggested the inquirer blushes to find that the answer is in the paltry equivocation that they skip a day or two why an englishman must go to the continent to weaken his grog or punch the answer proves to have no relation whatever to the temperancemovement as no better reason is given than that island or as it is absurdly written ile and water wont mix but when i came to the next question and its answer i felt that patience ceased to be a virtue why an onion is like a piano is a query that a person of sensibility would be slow to propose but that in an educated community an individual could be found to answer it in these words because it smell odious quasi its melodious is not credible but too true i can show you the paper dear reader i beg your pardon for repeating such things i know most conversations reported in books are altogether above such trivial details but folly will come up at every table as surely as purslain and chickweed and sorrel will come up in gardens this young fellow ought to have talked philosophy i know perfectly well but he didnt he made jokes i am willing i said to exercise your ingenuity in a rational and contemplative manner no i do not proscribe certain forms of philosophical speculation which involve an approach to the absurd or the ludicrous such as you may find for example in the folio of the reverend father thomas sanchez in his famous disputations de sancto matrimonio i will therefore turn this levity of yours to profit by reading you a rhymed problem wrought out by my friend the professor the deacons masterpiece or the wonderful onehossshay a logical story have you heard of the wonderful oneshay that was built in such a logical way it ran a hundred years to a day and then of a sudden it ah but stay ill tell you what happened without delay scaring the parson into fits frightening people out of their witshave you ever heard of that i say seventeen hundred and fiftyfive georgius secundus was then alivesnuffy old drone from the german hive that was the year when lisbontown saw the earth open and gulp her down and braddocks army was done so brown left without a scalp to its crown it was on the terrible earthquakeday that the deacon finished the onehossshay now in building of chaises i tell you what there is always somewhere a weakest spotin hub tire felloe in spring or thill in panel or crossbar or floor or sill in screw bolt thoroughbrace lurking still find it somewhere you must and willabove or below or within or withoutand thats the reason beyond a doubt a chaise breasts down but doesnt wear out but the deacon swore as deacons do with an i dew vum or an i tell yeou he would build one shay to beat the taown n the keounty n all the kentry raoun it should be so built that it couldn break daownfur said the deacon ts mighty plain thut the weakes place mus stan the strain n the way t fix it uz i maintain is only jest t make that place uz strong uz the rest so the deacon inquired of the village folk where he could find the strongest oak that couldnt be split nor bent nor brokethat was for spokes and floor and sills he sent for lancewood to make the thills the crossbars were ash from the straightest trees the panels of whitewood that cuts like cheese but lasts like iron for things like these the hubs of logs from the settlers ellumlast of its timber they couldnt sell em never an axe had seen their chips and the wedges flew from between their lips their blunt ends frizzled like celerytips step and propiron bolt and screw spring tire axle and linchpin too steel of the finest bright and blue thoroughbrace bisonskin thick and wide boot top dasher from tough old hide found in the pit when the tanner died that was the way he put her throughthere said the deacon naow shell dew do i tell you i father guess she was a wonder and nothing less colts grew horses beards turned gray deacon and deaconess dropped away children and grandchildren where were they but there stood the stout old onehossshay as fresh as on lisbonearthquakeday eighteen hundred it came and found the deacons masterpiece strong and sound eighteen hundred increased by tenhahnsum kerridge they called it then eighteen hundred and twenty camerunning as usual much the same thirty and forty at last arrive and then come fifty and fiftyfive little of all we value here wakes on the morn of its hundredth year without both feeling and looking queer in fact theres nothing that keeps its youth so far as i know but a tree and truth this is a moral that runs at large take it youre welcome no extra charge first of november the earthquakedaythere are traces of age in the onehossshay a general flavor of mild decay but nothing local as one may say there couldnt be for the deacons art had made it so like in every part that there wasnt a chance for one to start for the wheels were just as strong as the thills and the floor was just as strong as the sills and the panels just as strong as the floor and the whippletree neither less nor more and the backcrossbar as strong as the fore and spring and axle and hub encore and yet as a whole it is past a doubt in another hour it will be worn out first of november fiftyfive this morning the parson takes a drive now small boys get out of the way here comes the wonderful onehorseshay drawn by a rattailed ewenecked bay huddup said the parson off went they the parson was working his sundays texthad got to fifthly and stopped perplexed at what the moses was coming next all at once the horse stood still close by the meetnhouse on the hillfirst a shiver and then a thrill then something decidedly like a spilland the parson was sitting upon a rock at halfpast nine by the meetnhouse clockjust the hour of the earthquake shockwhat do you think the parson found when he got up and stared around the poor old chaise in a heap or mound as if it had been to the mill and ground you see of course if youre not a dunce how it went to pieces all at onceall at once and nothing firstjust as bubbles do when they burst end of the wonderful onehossshay logic is logic thats all i say i think there is one habit i said to our company a day or two afterwards worse than that of punning it is the gradual substitution of cant or flash terms for words which truly characterize their objects i have known several very genteel idiots whose whole vocabulary had deliquesced into some half dozen expressions all things fell into one of two great categories fast or slow mans chief end was to be a brick when the great calamities of life overtook their friends these last were spoken of as being a good deal cut up ninetenths of human existence were summed up in the single word bore these expressions come to be the algebraic symbols of minds which have grown too weak or indolent to discriminate they are the blank checks of intellectual bankruptcy you may fill them up with what idea you like it makes no difference for there are no funds in the treasury upon which they are drawn colleges and goodfornothing smokingclubs are the places where these conversational fungi spring up most luxuriantly dont think i undervalue the proper use and application of a cant word or phrase it adds piquancy to conversation as a mushroom does to a sauce but it is no better than a toadstool odious to the sense and poisonous to the intellect when it spawns itself all over the talk of men and youths capable of talking as it sometimes does as we hear flash phraseology it is commonly the dishwater from the washings of english dandyism schoolboy or fullgrown wrung out of a threevolume novel which had sopped it up or decanted from the pictured urn of mr verdant green and diluted to suit the provincial climate the young fellow called john spoke up sharply and said it was rum to hear me pitchin into fellers for goin it in the slang line when i used all the flash words myself just when i pleased i replied with my usual forbearance certainly to give up the algebraic symbol because a or b is often a cover for ideal nihility would be unwise i have heard a child laboring to express a certain condition involving a hitherto undescribed sensation as it supposed all of which could have been sufficiently explained by the participle bored i have seen a countryclergyman with a onestory intellect and a onehorse vocabulary who has consumed his valuable time and mine freely in developing an opinion of a brotherministers discourse which would have been abundantly characterized by a peachdownlipped sophomore in the one word slow let us discriminate and be shy of absolute proscription i am omniverbivorous by nature and training passing by such words as are poisonous i can swallow most others and chew such as i cannot swallow dandies are not good for much but they are good for something they invent or keep in circulation those conversational blank checks or counters just spoken of which intellectual capitalists may sometimes find it worth their while to borrow of them they are useful too in keeping up the standard of dress which but for them would deteriorate and become what some old fools would have it a matter of convenience and not of taste and art yes i like dandies well enough on one condition what is that sir said the divinitystudent that they have pluck i find that lies at the bottom of all true dandyism a little boy dressed up very fine who puts his finger in his mouth and takes to crying if other boys make fun of him looks very silly but if he turns red in the face and knotty in the fists and makes an example of the biggest of his assailants throwing off his fine leghorn and his thicklybuttoned jacket if necessary to consummate the act of justice his small toggery takes on the splendors of the crested helmet that frightened astyanax you remember that the duke said his dandy officers were his best officers the sunday blood the supersuperb sartorial equestrian of our annual fastday is not imposing or dangerous but such fellows as brummel and dorsay and byron are not to be snubbed quite so easily look out for la main de fer sous le gant de velours which i printed in english the other day without quotationmarks thinking whether any scarabaeus criticus would add this to his globe and roll in glory with it into the newspapers which he didnt do it in the charming pleonasm of the london language and therefore i claim the sole merit of exposing the same a good many powerful and dangerous people have had a decided dash of dandyism about them there was alcibiades the curled son of clinias an accomplished young man but what would be called a swell in these days there was aristoteles a very distinguished writer of whom you have heard a philosopher in short whom it took centuries to learn centuries to unlearn and is now going to take a generation or more to learn over again regular dandy he was so was marcus antonius and though he lost his game he played for big stakes and it wasnt his dandyism that spoiled his chance petrarca was not to be despised as a scholar or a poet but he was one of the same sort so was sir humphrey davy so was lord palmerston formerly if i am not forgetful yes a dandy is good for something as such and dandies such as i was just speaking of have rocked this planet like a cradle aye and left it swinging to this day still if i were you i wouldnt go to the tailors on the strength of these remarks and run up a long bill which will render pockets a superfluity in your next suit elegans nascitur non fit a man is born a dandy as he is born a poet there are heads that cant wear hats there are necks that cant fit cravats there are jaws that cant fill out collars willis touched this last point in one of his earlier ambrotypes if i remember rightly there are tournures nothing can humanize and movements nothing can subdue to the gracious suavity or elegant languor or stately serenity which belong to different styles of dandyism we are forming an aristocracy as you may observe in this country not a gratiadei nor a juredivino one but a defacto upper stratum of being which floats over the turbid waves of common life like the iridescent film you may have seen spreading over the water about our wharves very splendid though its origin may have been tar tallow trainoil or other such unctuous commodities i say then we are forming an aristocracy and transitory as its individual life often is it maintains itself tolerably as a whole of course money is its cornerstone but now observe this money kept for two or three generations transforms a race i dont mean merely in manners and hereditary culture but in blood and bone money buys air and sunshine in which children grow up more kindly of course than in close back streets it buys countryplaces to give them happy and healthy summers good nursing good doctoring and the best cuts of beef and mutton when the springchickens come to market i beg your pardon that is not what i was going to speak of as the young females of each successive season come on the finest specimens among them other things being equal are apt to attract those who can afford the expensive luxury of beauty the physical character of the next generation rises in consequence it is plain that certain families have in this way acquired an elevated type of face and figure and that in a small circle of cityconnections one may sometimes find models of both sexes which one of the rural counties would find it hard to match from all its townships put together because there is a good deal of running down of degeneration and waste of life among the richer classes you must not overlook the equally obvious fact i have just spoken of which in one or two generations more will be i think much more patent than just now the weak point in our chrysoaristocracy is the same i have alluded to in connection with cheap dandyism its thorough manhood its highcaste gallantry are not so manifest as the plateglass of its windows and the more or less legitimate heraldry of its coachpanels it is very curious to observe of how small account military folks are held among our northern people our young men must gild their spurs but they need not win them the equal division of property keeps the younger sons of rich people above the necessity of military service thus the army loses an element of refinement and the moneyed upper class forgets what it is to count heroism among its virtues still i dont believe in any aristocracy without pluck as its backbone ours may show it when the time comes if it ever does come these united states furnish the greatest market for intellectual green fruit of all the places in the world i think so at any rate the demand for intellectual labor is so enormous and the market so far from nice that young talent is apt to fare like unripe gooseberries get plucked to make a fool of think of a country which buys eighty thousand copies of the proverbial philosophy while the authors admiring countrymen have been buying twelve thousand how can one let his fruit hang in the sun until it gets fully ripe while there are eighty thousand such hungry mouths ready to swallow it and proclaim its praises consequently there never was such a collection of crude pippins and halfgrown windfalls as our native literature displays among its fruits there are literary greengroceries at every corner which will buy anything from a buttonpear to a pineapple it takes a long apprenticeship to train a whole people to reading and writing the temptation of money and fame is too great for young people do i not remember that glorious moment when the late mr we wont say who editor of the we wont say what offered me the sum of fifty cents per doublecolumned quarto page for shaking my young boughs over his foolscap apron was it not an intoxicating vision of gold and glory i should doubtless have revelled in its wealth and splendor but for learning that the fifty cents was to be considered a rhetorical embellishment and by no means a literal expression of past fact or present intention beware of making your moral staple consist of the negative virtues it is good to abstain and teach others to abstain from all that is sinful or hurtful but making a business of it leads to emaciation of character unless one feeds largely also on the more nutritious diet of active sympathetic benevolence i dont believe one word of what you are saying spoke up the angular female in black bombazine i am sorry you disbelieve it madam i said and added softly to my next neighbor but you prove it the young fellow sitting near me winked and the divinitystudent said in an undertone optime dictum your talking latin said i reminds me of an odd trick of one of my old tutors he read so much of that language that his english half turned into it he got caught in town one hot summer in pretty close quarters and wrote or began to write a series of city pastorals eclogues he called them and meant to have published them by subscription i remember some of his verses if you want to hear them you sir addressing myself to the divinitystudent and all such as have been through college or what is the same thing received an honorary degree will understand them without a dictionary the old man had a great deal to say about aestivation as he called it in opposition as one might say to hibernation intramural aestivation or townlife in summer he would say is a peculiar form of suspended existence or semiasphyxia one wakes up from it about the beginning of the last week in september this is what i remember of his poem aestivation an unpublished poem by my late latin tutor in candent ire the solar splendor flames the foles languescent pend from arid rames his humid front the cive anheling wipes and dreams of erring on ventiferous ripes how dulce to vive occult to mortal eyes dorm on the herb with none to supervise carp the suave berries from the crescent vine and bibe the flow from longicaudate kine to me alas no verdurous visions come save yon exiguous pools confervascumno concave vast repeats the tender hue that laves my milkjug with celestial blue me wretched let me curr to quercine shades effund your albid hausts lactiferous maids oh might i vole to some umbrageous clumpdepart be off excede evade erump i have lived by the seashore and by the mountains no i am not going to say which is best the one where your place is is the best for you but this difference there is you can domesticate mountains but the sea is ferae naturae you may have a hut or know the owner of one on the mountainside you see a light halfway up its ascent in the evening and you know there is a home and you might share it you have noted certain trees perhaps you know the particular zone where the hemlocks look so black in october when the maples and beeches have faded all its reliefs and intaglios have electrotyped themselves in the medallions that hang round the walls of your memorys chamber the sea remembers nothing it is feline it licks your feet its huge flanks purr very pleasantly for you but it will crack your bones and eat you for all that and wipe the crimsoned foam from its jaws as if nothing had happened the mountains give their lost children berries and water the sea mocks their thirst and lets them die the mountains have a grand stupid lovable tranquillity the sea has a fascinating treacherous intelligence the mountains lie about like huge ruminants their broad backs awful to look upon but safe to handle the sea smooths its silver scales until you cannot see their joints but their shining is that of a snakes belly after all in deeper suggestiveness i find as great a difference the mountains dwarf mankind and foreshorten the procession of its long generations the sea drowns out humanity and time it has no sympathy with either for it belongs to eternity and of that it sings its monotonous song forever and ever yet i should love to have a little box by the seashore i should love to gaze out on the wild feline element from a front window of my own just as i should love to look on a caged panther and see it stretch its shining length and then curl over and lap its smooth sides and byandby begin to lash itself into rage and show its white teeth and spring at its bars and howl the cry of its mad but to me harmless fury and then to look at it with that inward eye who does not love to shuffle off time and its concerns at intervals to forget who is president and who is governor what race he belongs to what language he speaks which goldenheaded nail of the firmament his particular planetary system is hung upon and listen to the great liquid metronome as it beats its solemn measure steadily swinging when the solo or duet of human life began and to swing just as steadily after the human chorus has died out and man is a fossil on its shores what should decide one in choosing a summer residence constitution first of all how much snow could you melt in an hour if you were planted in a hogshead of it comfort is essential to enjoyment all sensitive people should remember that persons in easy circumstances suffer much more cold in summer that is the warm half of the year than in winter or the other half you must cut your climate to your constitution as much as your clothing to your shape after this consult your taste and convenient but if you would be happy in berkshire you must carry mountains in your brain and if you would enjoy nahant you must have an ocean in your soul nature plays at dominos with you you must match her piece or she will never give it up to you the schoolmistress said in a rather mischievous way that she was afraid some minds or souls would be a little crowded if they took in the rocky mountains or the atlantic have you ever read the little book called the stars and the earth said i have you seen the declaration of independence photographed in a surface that a flys foot would cover the forms or conditions of time and space as kant will tell you are nothing in themselves only our way of looking at things you are right i think however in recognizing the category of space as being quite as applicable to minds as to the outer world every man of reflection is vaguely conscious of an imperfectlydefined circle which is drawn about his intellect he has a perfectly clear sense that the fragments of his intellectual circle include the curves of many other minds of which he is cognizant he often recognizes these as manifestly concentric with his own but of less radius on the other hand when we find a portion of an are on the outside of our own we say it intersects ours but are very slow to confess or to see that it circumscribes it every now and then a mans mind is stretched by a new idea or sensation and never shrinks back to its former dimensions after looking at the alps i felt that my mind had been stretched beyond the limits of its elasticity and fitted so loosely on my old ideas of space that i had to spread these to fit it if i thought i should ever see the alps said the schoolmistress perhaps you will some time or other i said it is not very likely she answered i have had one or two opportunities but i had rather be anything than governess in a rich family proud too you little softvoiced woman well i cant say i like you any the worse for it how long will schoolkeeping take to kill you is it possible the poor thing works with her needle too i dont like those marks on the side of her forefinger tableau chamouni mont blanc in full view figures in the foreground two of them standing apart one of them a gentleman ofoh ah yes the other a lady in a white cashmere leaning on his shoulder the ingenuous reader will understand that this was an internal private personal subjective diorama seen for one instant on the background of my own consciousness and abolished into black nonentity by the first question which recalled me to actual life as suddenly as if one of those iron shopblinds which i always pass at dusk with a shiver expecting to stumble over some poor but honest shopboys head just taken off by its sudden and unexpected descent and left outside upon the sidewalk had come down in front of it by the run should you like to hear what moderate wishes life brings one to at last i used to be very ambitious wasteful extravagant and luxurious in all my fancies read too much in the arabian nights must have the lamp couldnt do without the ring exercise every morning on the brazen horse plump down into castles as full of little milkwhite princesses as a nest is of young sparrows all love me dearly at once charming idea of life but too highcolored for the reality i have outgrown all this my tastes have become exceedingly primitive almost perhaps ascetic we carry happiness into our condition but must not hope to find it there i think you will be willing to hear some lines which embody the subdued and limited desires of my maturity contentment man wants but little here below

them muchtoo grateful for the blessing lent of simple tastes and mind content my last walk with the schoolmistress a parenthesis i cant say just how many walks she and i had taken together before this one i found the effect of going out every morning was decidedly favorable on her health two pleasing dimples the places for which were just marked when she came played shadowy in her freshening cheeks when she smiled and nodded goodmorning to me from the schoolhousesteps i am afraid i did the greater part of the talking at any rate if i should try to report all that i said during the first halfdozen walks we took together i fear that i might receive a gentle hint from my friends the publishers that a separate volume at my own risk and expense would be the proper method of bringing them before the public i would have a woman as true as death at the first real lie which works from the heart outward she should be tenderly chloroformed into a better world where she can have an angel for a governess and feed on strange fruits which will make her all over again even to her bones and marrow whether gifted with the accident of beauty or not she should have been moulded in the rosered clay of love before the breath of life made a moving mortal of her lovecapacity is a congenital endowment and i think after a while one gets to know the warmhued natures it belongs to from the pretty pipeclay counterfeits of them proud she may be in the sense of respecting herself but pride in the sense of contemning others less gifted than herself deserves the two lowest circles of a vulgar womans inferno where the punishments are smallpox and bankruptcy she who nips off the end of a brittle courtesy as one breaks the tip of an icicle to bestow upon those whom she ought cordially and kindly to recognize proclaims the fact that she comes not merely of low blood but of bad blood consciousness of unquestioned position makes people gracious in proper measure to all but if a woman puts on airs with her real equals she has something about herself or her family she is ashamed of or ought to be middle and more than middleaged people who know family histories generally see through it an official of standing was rude to me once oh that is the maternal grandfather said a wise old friend to me he was a boor better too few words from the woman we love than too many while she is silent nature is working for her while she talks she is working for herself love is sparingly soluble in the words of men therefore they speak much of it but one syllable of womans speech can dissolve more of it than a mans heart can hold whether i said any or all of these things to the schoolmistress or not whether i stole them out of lord bacon whether i cribbed them from balzac whether i dipped them from the ocean of tupperian wisdom or whether i have just found them in my head laid there by that solemn fowl experience who according to my observation cackles oftener than she drops real live eggs i cannot say wise men have said more foolish things and foolish men i dont doubt have said as wise things anyhow the schoolmistress and i had pleasant walks and long talks all of which i do not feel bound to report you are a stranger to me maam i dont doubt you would like to know all i said to the schoolmistress i shant do it i had rather get the publishers to return the money you have invested in this besides i have forgotten a good deal of it i shall tell only what i like of what i remember my idea was in the first place to search out the picturesque spots which the city affords a sight of to those who have eyes i know a good many and it was a pleasure to look at them in company with my young friend there were the shrubs and flowers in the franklinplace frontyards or borders commerce is just putting his granite foot upon them then there are certain small seragliogardens into which one can get a peep through the crevices of high fences one in myrtle street or backing on it here and there one at the north and south ends then the great elms in essex street then the stately horsechestnuts in that vacant lot in chambers street which hold their outspread hands over your head as i said in my poem the other day and look as if they were whispering may grace mercy and peace be with you and the rest of that benediction nay there are certain patches of ground which having lain neglected for a time nature who always has her pockets full of seeds and holes in all her pockets has covered with hungry plebeian growths which fight for life with each other until some of them get broadleaved and succulent and you have a coarse vegetable tapestry which raphael would not have disdained to spread over the foreground of his masterpiece the professor pretends that he found such a one in charles street which in its daredevil impudence of roughandtumble vegetation beat the prettybehaved flowerbeds of the public garden as ignominiously as a group of young tatterdemalions playing pitchandtoss beats a row of sundayschoolboys with their teacher at their head but then the professor has one of his burrows in that region and puts everything in high colors relating to it that is his way about everything i hold any man cheap he said of whom nothing stronger can be uttered than that all his geese are swans how is that professor said i i should have set you down for one of that sort sir said he i am proud to say that nature has so far enriched me that i cannot own so much as a duck without seeing in it as pretty a swan as ever swam the basin in the garden of the luxembourg and the professor showed the whites of his eyes devoutly like one returning thanks after a dinner of many courses i dont know anything sweeter than this leaking in of nature through all the cracks in the walls and floors of cities you heap up a million tons of hewn rocks on a square mile or two of earth which was green once the trees look down from the hillsides and ask each other as they stand on tiptoe what are these people about and the small herbs at their feet look up and whisper back we will go and see so the small herbs pack themselves up in the least possible bundles and wait until the wind steals to them at night and whispers come with me then they go softly with it into the great city one to a cleft in the pavement one to a spout on the roof one to a seam in the marbles over a rich gentlemans bones and one to the grave without a stone where nothing but a man is buried and there they grow looking down on the generations of men from mouldy roofs looking up from between the lesstrodden pavements looking out through iron cemeteryrailings listen to them when there is only a light breath stirring and you will hear them saying to each other wait awhile the words run along the telegraph of those narrow green lines that border the roads leading from the city until they reach the slope of the hills and the trees repeat in low murmurs to each other wait awhile byandby the flow of life in the streets ebbs and the old leafy inhabitants the smaller tribes always in front saunter in one by one very careless seemingly but very tenacious until they swarm so that the great stones gape from each other with the crowding of their roots and the feldspar begins to be picked out of the granite to find them food at last the trees take up their solemn line of march and never rest until they have encamped in the marketplace wait long enough and you will find an old doting oak hugging a huge worn block in its yellow underground arms that was the cornerstone of the statehouse oh so patient she is this imperturbable nature let us cry but all this has nothing to do with my walks and talks with the schoolmistress i did not say that i would not tell you something about them let me alone and i shall talk to you more than i ought to probably we never tell our secrets to people that pump for them books we talked about and education it was her duty to know something of these and of course she did perhaps i was somewhat more learned than she but i found that the difference between her reading and mine was like that of a mans and a womans dusting a library the man flaps about with a bunch of feathers the woman goes to work softly with a cloth she does not raise half the dust nor fill her own eyes and mouth with it but she goes into all the corners and attends to the leaves as much as the covers books are the negative pictures of thought and the more sensitive the mind that receives their images the more nicely the finest lines are reproduced a woman of the right kind reading after a man follows him as ruth followed the reapers of boaz and her gleanings are often the finest of the wheat but it was in talking of life that we came most clearly together i thought i knew something about that that i could speak or write about it somewhat to the purpose to take up this fluid earthly being of ours as a sponge sucks up water to be steeped and soaked in its realities as a hide fills its pores lying seven years in a tanpit to have winnowed every wave of it as a millwheel works up the stream that runs through the flume upon its floatboards to have curled up in the keenest spasms and flattened out in the laxest languors of this breathingsickness which keeps certain parcels of matter uneasy for three or four score years to have fought all the devils and clasped all the angels of its delirium and then just at the point when the whitehot passions have cooled down to cherryred plunge our experience into the icecold stream of some human language or other one might think would end in a rhapsody with something of spring and temper in it all this i thought my power and province the schoolmistress had tried life too once in a while one meets with a single soul greater than all the living pageant which passes before it as the pale astronomer sits in his study with sunken eyes and thin fingers and weighs uranus or neptune as in a balance so there are meek slight women who have weighed all which this planetary life can offer and hold it like a bauble in the palm of their slender hands this was one of them fortune had left her sorrow had baptized her the routine of labor and the loneliness of almost friendless citylife were before her yet as i looked upon her tranquil face gradually regaining a cheerfulness which was often sprightly as she became interested in the various matters we talked about and places we visited i saw that eye and lip and every shifting lineament were made for love unconscious of their sweet office as yet and meeting the cold aspect of duty with the natural graces which were meant for the reward of nothing less than the great passion i never addressed one word of love to the schoolmistress in the course of these pleasant walks it seemed to me that we talked of everything but love on that particular morning there was perhaps a little more timidity and hesitancy on my part than i have commonly shown among our people at the boardinghouse in fact i considered myself the master at the breakfasttable but somehow i could not command myself just then so well as usual the truth is i had secured a passage to liverpool in the steamer which was to leave at noon with the condition however of being released in case circumstances occurred to detain me the schoolmistress knew nothing about all this of course as yet it was on the common that we were walking the mall or boulevard of our common you know has various branches leading from it in different directions one of these runs down from opposite joy street southward across the whole length of the common to boylston street we called it the long path and were fond of it i felt very weak indeed though of a tolerably robust habit as we came opposite the head of this path on that morning i think i tried to speak twice without making myself distinctly audible at last i got out the question will you take the long path with mecertainly said the schoolmistress with much pleasure thinki said before you answer if you take the long path with me now i shall interpret it that we are to part no more the schoolmistress stepped back with a sudden movement as if an arrow had struck her one of the long granite blocks used as seats was hard by the one you may still see close by the gingkotree pray sit down i said no no she answered softly i will walk the long path with you the old gentleman who sits opposite met us walking arm in arm about the middle of the long path and said very charmingly good morning my dears chapter xii i did not think it probable that i should have a great many more talks with our company and therefore i was anxious to get as much as i could into every conversation that is the reason why you will find some odd miscellaneous facts here which i wished to tell at least once as i should not have a chance to tell them habitually at our breakfasttable were very free and easy you know we dont read what we dont like our parish is so large one cant pretend to preach to all the pews at once one cant be all the time trying to do the best of ones best if a company works a steam fireengine the firemen neednt be straining themselves all day to squirt over the top of the flagstaff let them wash some of those lowerstory windows a little besides there is no use in our quarrelling now as you will find out when you get through this paper travel according to my experience does not exactly correspond to the idea one gets of it out of most books of travels i am thinking of travel as it was when i made the grand tour especially in italy memory is a net one finds it full of fish when he takes it from the brook but a dozen miles of water have run through it without sticking i can prove some facts about travelling by a story or two there are certain principles to be assumed such as thesehe who is carried by horses must deal with rogues todays dinner subtends a larger visual angle than yesterdays revolution a mote in my eye is bigger to me than the biggest of dr goulds private planets every traveller is a selftaught entomologist old jokes are dynamometers of mental tension an old joke tells better among friends travelling than at home which shows that their minds are in a state of diminished rather than increased vitality there was a story about strahps to your pahnts which was vastly funny to us fellows on the road from milan to venice caelum non animum travellers change their guineas but not their characters the bore is the same eating dates under the cedars of lebanon as over a plate of baked beans in beacon street parties of travellers have a morbid instinct for establishing raws upon each other a man shall sit down with his friend at the foot of the great pyramid and they will take up the question they had been talking about under the great elm and forget all about egypt when i was crossing the po we were all fighting about the propriety of one fellows telling another that his argument was absurd one maintaining it to be a perfectly admissible logical term as proved by the phrase reductio ad absurdum the rest badgering him as a conversational bully mighty little we troubled ourselves for padus the po a river broader and more rapid than the rhone and the times when hannibal led his grim africans to its banks and his elephants thrust their trunks into the yellow waters over which that pendulum ferryboat was swinging back and forward every ten minutes here are some of those reminiscences with morals prefixed or annexed or implied lively emotions very commonly do not strike us full in front but obliquely from the side a scene or incident in undress often affects us more than one in full costume is this the mighty ocean is this all says the princess in gebir the rush that should have flooded my soul in the coliseum did not come but walking one day in the fields about the city i stumbled over a fragment of broken masonry and lo the worlds mistress in her stone girdle alta maenia romae rose before me and whitened my cheek with her pale shadow as never before or since i used very often when coming home from my mornings work at one of the public institutions of paris to stop in at the dear old church of st etienne du mont the tomb of st genevieve surrounded by burning candles and votive tablets was there the mural tablet of jacobus benignus winslow was there there was a noble organ with carved figures the pulpit was borne on the oaken shoulders of a stooping samson and there was a marvellous staircase like a coil of lace these things i mention from memory but not all of them together impressed me so much as an inscription on a small slab of marble fixed in one of the walls it told how this church of st stephen was repaired and beautified in the year and how during the celebration of its reopening two girls of the parish filles de la paroisse fell from the gallery carrying a part of the balustrade with them to the pavement but by a miracle escaped uninjured two young girls nameless but real presences to my imagination as much as when they came fluttering down on the tiles with a cry that outscreamed the sharpest treble in the te deum look at carlyles article on boswell and see how he speaks of the poor young woman johnson talked with in the streets one evening all the crowd gone but these two filles de la paroisse gone as utterly as the dresses they wore as the shoes that were on their feet as the bread and meat that were in the market on that day not the great historical events but the personal incidents that call up single sharp pictures of some human being in its pang or struggle reach us most nearly i remember the platform at berne over the parapet of which theobald weinzapflis restive horse sprung with him and landed him more than a hundred feet beneath in the lower town not dead but sorely broken and no longer a wild youth but gods servant from that day forward i have forgotten the famous bears and all else i remember the percy lion on the bridge over the little river at alnwick the leaden lion with his tail stretched out straight like a pumphandle and why because of the story of the village boy who must fain bestride the leaden tail standing out over the water which breaking he dropped into the stream far below and was taken out an idiot for the rest of his life arrowheads must be brought to a sharp point and the guillotineaxe must have a slanting edge something intensely human narrow and definate pierces to the seat of our sensibilities more readily than huge occurrences and catastrophes a nail will pick a lock that defies hatchet and hammer the royal george went down with all her crew and cowper wrote an exquisitely simple poem about it but the leaf which holds it is smooth while that which bears the lines on his mothers portrait is blistered with tears my telling these recollections sets me thinking of others of the same kind which strike the imagination especially when one is still young you remember the monument in devizes market to the woman struck dead with a lie in her mouth i never saw that but it is in the books here is one i never heard mentioned if any of the note and query tribe can tell the story i hope they will where is this monument i was riding on an english stagecoach when we passed a handsome marble column as i remember it of considerable size and pretensions what is that i said that answered the coachman is the hangmans pillar then he told me how a man went out one night many years ago to steal sheep he caught one tied its legs together passed the rope over his head and started for home in climbing a fence the rope slipped caught him by the neck and strangled him next morning he was found hanging dead on one side of the fence and the sheep on the other in memory whereof the lord of the manor caused this monument to be erected as a warning to all who love mutton better than virtue i will send a copy of this record to him or her who shall first set me right about this column and its locality and telling over these old stories reminds me that i have something which may interest architects and perhaps some other persons i once ascended the spire of strasburg cathedral which is the highest i think in europe it is a shaft of stone filigreework frightfully open so that the guide puts his arms behind you to keep you from falling to climb it is a noonday nightmare and to think of having climbed it crisps all the fiftysix joints of ones twenty digits while i was on it pinnacled dim in the intense inane a strong wind was blowing and i felt sure that the spire was rocking it swayed back and forward like a stalk of rye or a catoninetails bulrush with a bobolink on it i mentioned it to the guide and he said that the spire did really swing back and forward i think he said some feet keep any line of knowledge ten years and some other line will intersect it long afterwards i was hunting out a paper of dumerils in an old journal the magazin encyclopedique for lan troisieme when i stumbled upon a brief article on the vibrations of the spire of strasburg cathedral a man can shake it so that the movement shall be shown in a vessel of water nearly seventy feet below the summit and higher up the vibration is like that of an earthquake i have seen one of those wretched wooden spires with which we very shabbily finish some of our stone churches thinking that the lidless blue eye of heaven cannot tell the counterfeit we try to pass on it swinging like a reed in a wind but one would hardly think of such a things happening in a stone spire does the bunkerhill monument bend in the blast like a blade of grass i suppose so you see of course that i am talking in a cheap way perhaps we will have some philosophy by and by let me work out this thin mechanical vein i have something more to say about trees i have brought down this slice of hemlock to show you tree blew down in my woods that were in twelve feet and a half round fair girth nine feet where i got my section higher up this is a wedge going to the centre of the general shape of a slice of applepie in a large and not opulent family length about eighteen inches i have studied the growth of this tree by its rings and it is curious three hundred and fortytwo rings started therefore about the thickness of the rings tells the rate at which it grew for five or six years the rate was slow then rapid for twenty years a little before the year it began to grow very slowly and so continued for about seventy years in it took a new start and grew fast until then for the most part slowly until when it started again and grew pretty well and uniformly until within the last dozen years when it seems to have got on sluggishly look here here are some human lives laid down against the periods of its growth to which they corresponded this is shakspeares the tree was seven inches in diameter when he was born ten inches when he died a little less than ten inches when milton was born seventeen when he died then comes a long interval and this thread marks out johnsons life during which the tree increased from twentytwo to twentynine inches in diameter here is the span of napoleons career the tree doesnt seem to have minded it i never saw the man yet who was not startled at looking on this section i have seen many wooden preachers never one like this how much more striking would be the calendar counted on the rings of one of those awful trees which were standing when christ was on earth and where that brief mortal life is chronicled with the stolid apathy of vegetable being which remembers all human history as a thing of yesterday in its own dateless existence i have something more to say about elms a relative tells me there is one of great glory in andover near bradford i have some recollections of the former place pleasant and other i wonder if the old seminary clock strikes as slowly as it used to my roommate thought when he first came it was the bell tolling deaths and peoples ages as they do in the country he swore ministers sons get so familiar with good words that they are apt to handle them carelessly that the children were dying by the dozen of all ages from one to twelve and ran off next day in recess when it began to strike eleven but was caught before the clock got through striking at the foot of the hill down in town is or was a tidy old elm which was said to have been hooped with iron to protect it from indian tomahawks credat hahnemannus and to have grown round its hoops and buried them in its wood of course this is not the tree my relative means also i have a very pretty letter from norwich in connecticut telling me of two noble elms which are to be seen in that town one hundred and twentyseven feet from boughend to boughend what do you say to that and gentle ladies beneath it that love it and celebrate its praises and that in a town of such supreme audacious alpine loveliness as norwich only the dear people there must learn to call it norridge and not be misled by the mere accident of spelling norwich porchmouth cincinnatah what a sad picture of our civilization i did not speak to you of the great tree on what used to be the colman farm in deerfield simply because i had not seen it for many years and did not like to trust my recollection but i had it in memory and even noted down as one of the finest trees in symmetry and beauty i had ever seen i have received a document signed by two citizens of a neighboring town certified by the postmaster and a selectman and these again corroborated reinforced and sworn to by a member of that extraordinary collegeclass to which it is the good fortune of my friend the professor to belong who though he has formerly been a member of congress is i believe fully worthy of confidence the tree girts eighteen and a half feet and spreads over a hundred and is a real beauty i hope to meet my friend under its branches yet if we dont have youth at the prow we will have pleasure at the elm and just now again i have got a letter about some grand willows in maine and another about an elm in wayland but too late for anything but thanks and this leads me to say that i have received a great many communications in prose and verse since i began printing these notes the last came this very morning in the shape of a neat and brief poem from new orleans i could not make any of them public though sometimes requested to do so some of them have given me great pleasure and encouraged me to believe i had friends whose faces i had never seen if you are pleased with anything a writer says and doubt whether to tell him of it do not hesitate a pleasant word is a cordial to one who perhaps thinks he is tiring you and so becomes tired himself i purr very loud over a good honest letter that says pretty things to me sometimes very young persons send communications which they want forwarded to editors and these young persons do not always seem to have right conceptions of these same editors and of the public and of themselves here is a letter i wrote to one of these young folks but on the whole thought it best not to send it is not fair to single out one for such sharp advice where there are hundreds that are in need of it dear sir you seem to be somewhat but not a great deal wiser than i was at your age i dont wish to be understood as saying too much for i think without committing myself to any opinion on my present state that i was not a solomon at that stage of development you long to leap at a single bound into celebrity nothing is so commonplace as to wish to be remarkable fame usually comes to those who are thinking about something else very rarely to those who say to themselves go to now let us be a celebrated individual the struggle for fame as such commonly ends in notoriety that ladder is easy to climb but it leads to the pillory which is crowded with fools who could not hold their tongues and rogues who could not hide their tricks if you have the consciousness of genius do something to show it the world is pretty quick nowadays to catch the flavor of true originality if you write anything remarkable the magazines and newspapers will find you out as the schoolboys find out where the ripe apples and pears are produce anything really good and an intelligent editor will jump at it dont flatter yourself that any article of yours is rejected because you are unknown to fame nothing pleases an editor more than to get anything worth having from a new hand there is always a dearth of really fine articles for a firstrate journal for of a hundred pieces received ninety are at or below the sealevel some have water enough but no head some head enough but no water only two or three are from full reservoirs high up that hill which is so hard to climb you may have genius the contrary is of course probable but it is not demonstrated if you have the world wants you more than you want it it has not only a desire but a passion for every spark of genius that shows itself among us there is not a bullcalf in our national pasture that can bleat a rhyme but it is ten to one among his friends and no takers that he is the real genuine nomistake osiris quest ce quil a fait what has he done that was napoleons test what have you done turn up the faces of your picturecards my boy you need not make mouths at the public because it has not accepted you at your own fancyvaluation do the prettiest thing you can and wait your time for the verses you send me i will not say they are hopeless and i dare not affirm that they show promise i am not an editor but i know the standard of some editors you must not expect to leap with a single bound into the society of those whom it is not flattery to call your betters when the pactolian has paid you for a copy of verses i can furnish you a list of alliterative signatures beginning with annie aureole and ending with zoe zenith when the ragbag has stolen your piece after carefully scratching your name out when the nutcracker has thought you worth shelling and strung the kernel of your cleverest poem then and not till then you may consider the presumption against you from the fact of your rhyming tendency as called in question and let our friends hear from you if you think it worth while you may possibly think me too candid and even accuse me of incivility but let me assure you that i am not half so plainspoken as nature nor half so rude as time if you prefer the long jolting of public opinion to the gentle touch of friendship try it like a man only remember this that if a bushel of potatoes is shaken in a marketcart without springs to it the small potatoes always get to the bottom believe me etc etc i always think of versewriters when i am in this vein for these are by far the most exacting eager selfweighing restless querulous unreasonable literary persons one is like to meet with is a young man in the habit of writing verses then the presumption is that he is an inferior person for look you there are at least nine chances in ten that he writes poor verses now the habit of chewing on rhymes without sense and soul to match them is like that of using any other narcotic at once a proof of feebleness and a debilitating agent a young man can get rid of the presumption against him afforded by his writing verses only by convincing us that they are verses worth writing all this sounds hard and rough but observe it is not addressed to any individual and of course does not refer to any reader of these pages i would always treat any given young person passing through the meteoric showers which rain down on the brief period of adolescence with great tenderness god forgive us if we ever speak harshly to young creatures on the strength of these ugly truths and so sooner or later smite some tendersouled poet or poetess on the lips who might have sung the world into sweet trances had we not silenced the matinsong in its first low breathings just as my heart yearns over the unloved just so it sorrows for the ungifted who are doomed to the pangs of an undeceived selfestimate i have always tried to be gentle with the most hopeless cases my experience however has not been encouraging x y aet a cheaplygotup youth with narrow jaws and broad bony cold red hands having been laughed at by the girls in his village and got the mitten pronounced mittin two or three times falls to souling and controlling and youthing and truthing in the newspapers sends me some strings of verses candidates for the orthopedic infirmary all of them in which i learn for the millionth time one of the following facts either that something about a chime is sublime or that something about time is sublime or that something about a chime is concerned with time or that something about a rhyme is sublime or concerned with time or with a chime wishes my opinion of the same with advice as to his future course what shall i do about it tell him the whole truth and send him a ticket of admission to the institution for idiots and feebleminded youth one doesnt like to be cruel and yet one hates to lie therefore one softens down the ugly central fact of donkeyism recommends study of good models that writing verse should be an incidental occupation only not interfering with the hoe the needle the lapstone or the ledger and above all that there should be no hurry in printing what is written not the least use in all this the poetaster who has tasted type is done for he is like the man who has once been a candidate for the presidency he feeds on the madder of his delusion all his days and his very bones grow red with the glow of his foolish fancy one of these young brains is like a bunch of india crackers once touch fire to it and it is best to keep hands off until it has done popping if it ever stops i have two letters on file one is a pattern of adulation the other of impertinence my reply to the first containing the best advice i could give conveyed in courteous language had brought out the second there was some sport in this but dulness is not commonly a game fish and only sulks after he is struck you may set it down as a truth which admits of few exceptions that those who ask your opinion really want your praise and will be contented with nothing less there is another kind of application to which editors or those supposed to have access to them are liable and which often proves trying and painful one is appealed to in behalf of some person in needy circumstances who wishes to make a living by the pen a manuscript accompanying the letter is offered for publication it is not commonly brilliant too often lamentably deficient if rachels saying is true that fortune is the measure of intelligence then poverty is evidence of limited capacity which it too frequently proves to be notwithstanding a noble exception here and there now an editor is a person under a contract with the public to furnish them with the best things he can afford for his money charity shown by the publication of an inferior article would be like the generosity of claude duval and the other gentlemen highwaymen who pitied the poor so much they robbed the rich to have the means of relieving them though i am not and never was an editor i know something of the trials to which they are submitted they have nothing to do but to develope enormous calluses at every point of contact with authorship their business is not a matter of sympathy but of intellect they must reject the unfit productions of those whom they long to befriend because it would be a profligate charity to accept them one cannot burn his house down to warm the hands even of the fatherless and the widow the professor under chloroform you havent heard about my friend the professors first experiment in the use of anaesthetics have you he was mightily pleased with the reception of that poem of his about the chaise he spoke to me once or twice about another poem of similar character he wanted to read me which i told him i would listen to and criticize one day after dinner he came in with his face tied up looking very red in the cheeks and heavy about the eyes hyrye he said and made for an armchair in which he placed first his hat and then his person going smack through the crown of the former as neatly as they do the trick at the circus the professor jumped at the explosion as if he had sat down on one of those small calthrops our grandfathers used to sow round in the grass when there were indians about iron stars each ray a rusty thorn an inch and a half long stick through moccasins into feet cripple em on the spot and give em lockjaw in a day or two at the same time he let off one of those big words which lie at the bottom of the best mans vocabulary but perhaps never turn up in his life just as every mans hair may stand on end but in most men it never does after he had got calm he pulled out a sheet or two of manuscript together with a smaller scrap on which as he said he had just been writing an introduction or prelude to the main performance a certain suspicion had come into my mind that the professor was not quite right which was confirmed by the way he talked but i let him begin this is the way he read it prelude im the fellah that tole one day the tale of the wonerful onehossshay wan to hear another sayfunny wasnit made me laughim too modest i am by halfmade me laughs though i shd splitcahn a fellah like fellahs own witfellahs keep sayin well now thats nice did it once but cahn do it twicedon you blieve thez no more fat lots in the kitchn z good z that fusrate throw n no mistakehan us the props for another shakeknow ill try n guess ill win here sh goes for hit m agin here i thought it necessary to interpose professor i said you are inebriated the style of what you call your prelude shows that it was written under cerebral excitement your articulation is confused you have told me three times in succession in exactly the same words that i was the only true friend you had in the world that you would unbutton your heart to you smell distinctly and decidedly of spirits i spoke and paused tender but firm two large tears orbed themselves beneath the professors lids in obedience to the principle of gravitation celebrated in that delicious bit of bladdery bathos the very law that moulds a tear with which the edinburgh review attempted to put down master george gordon when that young man was foolishly trying to make himself conspicuous one of these tears peeped over the edge of the lid until it lost its balance slid an inch and waited for reinforcements swelled again rolled down a little further stopped moved on and at last fell on the back of the professors hand he held it up for me to look at and lifted his eyes brimful till they met mine i couldnt stand it i always break down when folks cry in my face so i hugged him and said he was a dear old boy and asked him kindly what was the matter with him and what made him smell so dreadfully strong of spirits upset his alcohol lamp he said and spilt the alcohol on his legs that was it but what had he been doing to get his head into such a state had he really committed an excess what was the matter then it came out that he had been taking chloroform to have a tooth out which had left him in a very queer state in which he had written the prelude given above and under the influence of which he evidently was still i took the manuscript from his hands and read the following continuation of the lines he had begun to read me while he made up for two or three nights lost sleep as he best might parson turells legacy or the presidents old armchair a mathematical story facts respecting an old armchair at cambridge is kept in the college there seems but little the worse for wear thats remarkable when i say it was old in president holyokes day one of his boys perhaps you know died at one hundred years ago he took lodging for rain or shine under green bedclothes in know old cambridge hope you doborn there dont say so i was too born in a house with a gambrelroofstanding still if you must have proofgambrel gambrel let me beg youll look at a horses hinder legfirst great angle above the hoofthats the gambrel hence gambrelroofnicest place that ever was seencolleges red and common green sidewalks brownish with trees between sweetest spot beneath the skies when the cankerworms dont risewhen the dust that sometimes flies into your mouth and ears and eyes in a quiet slumber lies not in the shape of unbaked pies such as barefoot children prize a kind of harber it seems to be facing the flow of a boundless sea rows of gray old tutors stand ranged like rocks above the sand rolling beneath them soft and green breaks the tide of bright sixteenone wave two waves three waves four sliding up the sparkling floor then it ebbs to flow no more wandering off from shore to shore with its freight of golden orepleasant place for boys to playbetter keep your girls away hearts get rolled as pebbles do which countless fingering waves pursue and every classic beach is strown with heartshaped pebbles of bloodred stone but this is neither here nor thereim talking about an old armchair youve heard no doubt of parson turell over at medford he used to dwell married one of the mathers folk got with his wife a chair of oakfunny old chair with seat like wedge sharp behind and broad front edgeone of the oddest of human things turned all over with knobs and ringsbut heavy and wide and deep and grandfit for the worthies of the landchiefjustice sewall a cause to try in or cotton mather to sit and lie inparson turell bequeathed the same to a certain student smith by name these were the terms as we are told saide smith saide chaire to have and holde when he doth graduate then to passe to ye oldest youth in ye senior classe on payment ofnaming a certain sumby him to whom ye chaire shall come he to ye oldest senior next and soe forever thus runs the textbut one crown lesse then he gave to claime that being his debte for use of same smith transferred it to one of the browns and took his money five silver crowns brown delivered it up to moore who paid it is plain not five but four moore made over the chair to lee who gave him crowns of silver three lee conveyed it unto drew and now the payment of course was two drew gave up the chair to dunnall he got as you see was one dunn released the chair to hall and got by the bargain no crown at alland now it passed to a second brown who took it and likewise claimed a crown when brown conveyed it unto ware having had one crown to make it fair he paid him two crowns to take the chair and ware being honest as all wares be he paid one potter who took it three four got robinson five got dix johnson primus demanded six and so the sum kept gathering still till after the battle of bunkers hillwhen paper money became so cheap folks wouldnt count it but said a heap a certain richards the books declare a m in ive looked with care through the triennial name not there this person richards was offered then eight score pounds but would have ten nine i think was the sum he tooknot quite certain but see the bookby and by the wars were still but nothing had altered the parsons will the old armchair was solid yet but saddled with such a monstrous debt things grew quite too bad to bear paying such sums to get rid of the chair but dead mens fingers hold awful tight and there was the will in black and white plain enough for a child to spell what should be done no man could tell for the chair was a kind of nightmare curse and every season but made it worse as a last resort to clear the doubt they got old governor hancock out the governor came with his lighthorse troop and his mounted truckmen all cockahoop halberds glittered and colors flew french horns whinnied and trumpets blew the yellow fifes whistled between their teeth and the bumblebee bassdrums boomed beneath so he rode with all his band till the president met him cap in handthe governor hefted the crowns and saida will is a will and the parsons dead the governor hefted the crowns said hethere is your pint and heres my fee these are the terms you must fulfilon such conditions i break the will the governor mentioned what these should be just wait a minute and then youll see the president prayed then all was still and the governor rose and broke the willabout those conditions well now you go and do as i tell you and then youll know once a year on commencementday if youll only take the pains to stay youll see the president in the chair likewise the governor sitting there the president rises both old and young may hear his speech in a foreign tongue the meaning whereof as lawyers swear is this can i keep this old armchair and then his excellency bows as much as to say that he allows the vicegub next is called by name he bows like tother which means the same and all the officers round em bow as much as to say that they allow and a lot of parchments about the chair are handed to witnesses then and there and then the lawyers hold it clear that the chair is safe for another year god bless you gentlemen learn to give money to colleges while you live dont be silly and think youll try to bother the colleges when you die with codicil this and codicil that that knowledge may starve while law grows fat for there never was pitcher that wouldnt spill and theres always a flaw in a donkeys will hospitality is a good deal a matter of latitude i suspect the shade of a palmtree serves an african for a hut his dwelling is all door and no walls everybody can come in to make a morning call on an esquimaux acquaintance one must creep through a long tunnel his house is all walls and no door except such a one as an apple with a wormhole has one might very probably trace a regular gradation between these two extremes in cities where the evenings are generally hot the people have porches at their doors where they sit and this is of course a provocative to the interchange of civilities a good deal which in colder regions is ascribed to mean dispositions belongs really to mean temperature once in a while even in our northern cities at noon in a very hot summers day one may realize by a sudden extension in his sphere of consciousness how closely he is shut up for the most part do you not remember something like this july between and p m fahrenheit degrees or thereabout windows all gaping like the mouths of panting dogs long stinging cry of a locust comes in from a tree half a mile off had forgotten there was such a tree babys screams from a house several blocks distant never knew there were any babies in the neighborhood before tinman pounding something that clatters dreadfully very distinct but dont remember any tinmans shop near by horses stamping on pavement to get off flies when you hear these four sounds you may set it down as a warm day then it is that one would like to imitate the mode of life of the native at sierra leone as somebody has described it stroll into the market in natural costume buy a watermelon for a halfpenny split it and scoop out the middle sit down in one half of the empty rind clap the other on ones head and feast upon the pulp i see some of the london journals have been attacking some of their literary people for lecturing on the ground of its being a public exhibition of themselves for money a popular author can print his lecture if he deliver it it is a case of quaestum corpore or making profit of his person none but snobs do that ergo etc to this i reply negatur minor her most gracious majesty the queen exhibits herself to the public as a part of the service for which she is paid we do not consider it lowbred in her to pronounce her own speech and should prefer it so to hearing it from any other person or reading it his grace and his lordship exhibit themselves very often for popularity and their houses every day for money no if a man shows himself other than he is if he belittles himself before an audience for hire then he acts unworthily but a true word fresh from the lips of a true man is worth paying for at the rate of eight dollars a day or even of fifty dollars a lecture the taunt must be an outbreak of jealousy against the renowned authors who have the audacity to be also orators the sublieutenants of the press stick a too popular writer and speaker with an epithet in england instead of with a rapier as in france poh all england is one great menagerie and all at once the jackal who admires the gilded cage of the royal beast must protest against the vulgarity of the talkingbirds and the nightingales being willing to become a part of the exhibition the long path last of the parentheses yes that was my last walk with the schoolmistress it happened to be the end of a term and before the next began a very nice young woman who had been her assistant was announced as her successor and she was provided for elsewhere so it was no longer the schoolmistress that i walked with but let us not be in unseemly haste i shall call her the schoolmistress still some of you love her under that name when it became known among the boarders that two of their number had joined hands to walk down the long path of life side by side there was as you may suppose no small sensation i confess i pitied our landlady it took her all of a suddin she said had not known that we was keepin company and never mistrusted anything particular maam was right to better herself didnt look very rugged to take care of a femily but could get hired haalp she calclated the great maternal instinct came crowding up in her soul just then and her eyes wandered until they settled on her daughter no poor dear woman that could not have been but i am dropping one of my internal tears for you with this pleasant smile on my face all the time the great mystery of gods providence is the permitted crushing out of flowering instincts life is maintained by the respiration of oxygen and of sentiments in the long catalogue of scientific cruelties there is hardly anything quite so painful to think of as that experiment of putting an animal under the bell of an airpump and exhausting the air from it i never saw the accursed trick performed laus deo there comes a time when the souls of human beings women perhaps more even than men begin to faint for the atmosphere of the affections they were made to breathe then it is that society places its transparent bellglass over the young woman who is to be the subject of one of its fatal experiments the element by which only the heart lives is sucked out of her crystalline prison watch her through its transparent walls her bosom is heaving but it is in a vacuum death is no riddle compared to this i remember a poor girls story in the book of martyrs the drypan and the gradual fire were the images that frightened her most how many have withered and wasted under as slow a torment in the walls of that larger inquisition which we call civilization yes my surfacethought laughs at you you foolish plain overdressed mincing cheaplyorganized selfsaturated young person whoever you may be now reading this little thinking you are what i describe and in blissful unconsciousness that you are destined to the lingering asphyxia of soul which is the lot of such multitudes worthier than yourself but it is only my surfacethought which laughs for that great procession of the unloved who not only wear the crown of thorns but must hide it under the locks of brown or gray under the snowy cap under the chilling turban hide it even from themselves perhaps never know they wear it though it kills them there is no depth of tenderness in my nature that pity has not sounded somewhere somewhere love is in store for them the universe must not be allowed to fool them so cruelly what infinite pathos in the small halfunconscious artifices by which unattractive young persons seek to recommend themselves to the favor of those towards whom our dear sisters the unloved like the rest are impelled by their godgiven instincts read what the singingwomen one to ten thousand of the suffering women tell us and think of the griefs that die unspoken nature is in earnest when she makes a woman and there are women enough lying in the next churchyard with very commonplace blue slatestones at their head and feet for whom it was just as true that all sounds of life assumed one tone of love as for letitia landon of whom elizabeth browning said it but she could give words to her grief and they could not will you hear a few stanzas of mine the voiceless we count the broken lyres that rest where the sweet wailing singers slumberbut oer their silent sisters breast the wild flowers who will stoop to number a few can touch the magic string and noisy fame is proud to win themalas for those that never sing but die with all their music in them nay grieve not for the dead alone whose song has told their hearts sad storyweep for the voiceless who have known the cross without the crown of glory not where leucadian breezes sweep oer sapphos memoryhaunted billow but where the glistening nightdews weep on nameless sorrows churchyard pillow o hearts that break and give no sign save whitening lip and fading tresses till death pours out his cordial wine slowdropped from miserys crushing pressesif singing breath or echoing chord to every hidden pang were given what endless melodies were poured as sad as earth as sweet as heaven i hope that our landladys daughter is not so badly off after all that young man from another city who made the remark which you remember about boston statehouse and boston folks has appeared at our table repeatedly of late and has seemed to me rather attentive to this young lady only last evening i saw him leaning over her while she was playing the accordion indeed i undertook to join them in a song and got as far as come rest in this boooo when my voice getting tremulous i turned off as one steps out of a procession and left the basso and soprano to finish it i see no reason why this young woman should not be a very proper match for a man that laughs about boston statehouse he cant be very particular the young fellow whom i have so often mentioned was a little free in his remarks but very goodnatured sorry to have you go he said schoolmaam made a mistake not to wait for me havent taken anything but mournin fruit at breakfast since i heard of it mourning fruit said i whats that huckleberries and blackberries said he couldnt eat in colors raspberries currants and such after a solemn thing like this happening the conceit seemed to please the young fellow if you will believe it when we came down to breakfast the next morning he had carried it out as follows you know those odious little saasplates that figure so largely at boardinghouses and especially at taverns into which a strenuous attendant female trowels little dabs sombre of tint and heterogeneous of composition which it makes you feel homesick to look at and into which you poke the elastic coppery teaspoon with the air of a cat dipping her foot into a washtub not that i mean to say anything against them for when they are of tinted porcelain or starry manyfaceted crystal and hold clean bright berries or pale virgin honey or lucent syrups tinct with cinnamon and the teaspoon is of white silver with the towerstamp solid but not brutally heavy as people in the green stage of millionism will have them i can dally with their amber semifluids or glossy spherules without a shiver you know these small deep dishes i say when we came down the next morning each of these two only excepted was covered with a broad leaf on lifting this each boarder found a small heap of solemn black huckleberries but one of those plates held red currants and was covered with a red rose the other held white currants and was covered with a white rose there was a laugh at this at first and then a short silence and i noticed that her lip trembled and the old gentleman opposite was in trouble to get at his bandanna handkerchief what was the use in waiting we should be too late for switzerland that season if we waited much longer the hand i held trembled in mine and the eyes fell meekly as esther bowed herself before the feet of ahasuerus she had been reading that chapter for she looked up if there was a film of moisture over her eyes there was also the faintest shadow of a distant smile skirting her lips but not enough to accent the dimples and said in her pretty still way if it please the king and if i have found favor in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes i dont remember what king ahasuerus did or said when esther got just to that point of her soft humble words but i know what i did that quotation from scripture was cut short anyhow we came to a compromise on the great question and the time was settled for the last day of summer in the mean time i talked on with our boarders much as usual as you may see by what i have reported i must say i was pleased with a certain tenderness they all showed toward us after the first excitement of the news was over it came out in trivial matters but each one in his or her way manifested kindness our landlady for instance when we had chickens sent the liver instead of the gizzard with the wing for the schoolmistress this was not an accident the two are never mistaken though some landladies appear as if they did not know the difference the whole of the company were even more respectfully attentive to my remarks than usual there was no idle punning and very little winking on the part of that lively young gentleman who as the reader may remember occasionally interposed some playful question or remark which could hardly be considered relevant except when the least allusion was made to matrimony when he would look at the landladys daughter and wink with both sides of his face until she would ask what he was pokin his fun at her for and if he wasnt ashamed of himself in fact they all behaved very handsomely so that i really felt sorry at the thought of leaving my boardinghouse i suppose you think that because i lived at a plain widowwomans plain table i was of course more or less infirm in point of worldly fortune you may not be sorry to learn that though not what great merchants call very rich i was comfortable comfortable so that most of those moderate luxuries i described in my verses on contentment most of them i say were within our reach if we chose to have them but i found out that the schoolmistress had a vein of charity about her which had hitherto been worked on a small silver and copper basis which made her think less perhaps of luxuries than even i did modestly as i have expressed my wishes it is a rather pleasant thing to tell a poor young woman whom one has contrived to win without showing his rentroll that she has found what the world values so highly in following the lead of her affections that was an enjoyment i was now ready for i began abruptlydo you know that you are a rich young person i know that i am very rich she said heaven has given me more than i ever asked for i had not thought love was ever meant for me it was a womans confession and her voice fell to a whisper as it threaded the last words i dont mean that i said you blessed little saint and seraph if theres an angel missing in the new jerusalem inquire for her at this boarding house i dont mean that i mean that i that is you am are confound it i mean that youll be what most people call a lady of fortune and i looked full in her eyes for the effect of the announcement there wasnt any she said she was thankful that i had what would save me from drudgery and that some other time i should tell her about it i never made a greater failure in an attempt to produce a sensation so the last day of summer came it was our choice to go to the church but we had a kind of reception at the boardinghouse the presents were all arranged and among them none gave more pleasure than the modest tributes of our fellowboarders for there was not one i believe who did not send something the landlady would insist on making an elegant bridecake with her own hands to which master benjamin franklin wished to add certain embellishments out of his private funds namely a cupid in a mousetrap done in white sugar and two miniature flags with the stars and stripes which had a very pleasing effect i assure you the landladys daughter sent a richly bound copy of tuppers poems on a blank leaf was the following written in a very delicate and careful hand presented to by on the eve ere her union in holy matrimony may sunshine ever beam oer her even the poor relative thought she must do something and sent a copy of the whole duty of man bound in very attractive variegated sheepskin the edges nicely marbled from the divinitystudent came the loveliest english edition of kebles christian year i opened it when it came to the fourth sunday in lent and read that angelic poem sweeter than anything i can remember since xaviers my god i love thee i am not a churchman i dont believe in planting oaks in flowerpots but such a poem as the rosebud makes ones heart a proselyte to the culture it grows from talk about it as much as you like ones breeding shows itself nowhere more than in his religion a man should be a gentleman in his hymns and prayers the fondness for scenes among vulgar saints contrasts so meanly with that god only and good angels look behind the blissful scene and that other he could not trust his melting soul but in his makers sight that i hope some of them will see this and read the poem and profit by it my laughing and winking young friend undertook to procure and arrange the flowers for the table and did it with immense zeal i never saw him look happier than when he came in his hat saucily on one side and a cheroot in his mouth with a huge bunch of tearoses which he said were for madam one of the last things that came was an old square box smelling of camphor tied and sealed it bore in faded ink the marks calcutta on opening it we found a white cashmere shawl with a very brief note from the dear old gentleman opposite saying that he had kept this some years thinking he might want it and many more not knowing what to do with it that he had never seen it unfolded since he was a young supercargo and now if she would spread it on her shoulders it would make him feel young to look at it poor bridget or biddy our redarmed maid of all work what must she do but buy a small copper breastpin and put it under schoolmaams plate that morning at breakfast and schoolmaam would wear it though i made her cover it as well as i could with a tearose it was my last breakfast as a boarder and i could not leave them in utter silence goodby i said my dear friends one and all of you i have been long with you and i find it hard parting i have to thank you for a thousand courtesies and above all for the patience and indulgence with which you have listened to me when i have tried to instruct or amuse you my friend the professor who as well as my friend the poet is unavoidably absent on this interesting occasion has given me reason to suppose that he would occupy my empty chair about the first of january next if he comes among you be kind to him as you have been to me may the lord bless you all and we shook hands all round the table half an hour afterwards the breakfast things and the cloth were gone i looked up and down the length of the bare boards over which i had so often uttered my sentiments and experiences and yes i am a man like another all sadness vanished as in the midst of these old friends of mine whom you know and others a little more up in the world perhaps to whom i have not introduced you i took the schoolmistress before the altar from the hands of the old gentleman who used to sit opposite and who would insist on giving her away and now we two are walking the long path in peace together the schoolmistress finds her skill in teaching called for again without going abroad to seek little scholars those visions of mine have all come true i hope you all love me none the less for anything i have told you farewell
