how to count on your fingers everyone knows that the decimal system of counting which is based on the ten digits through has driven out all other systems and has become universal by virtue of being simplest and best like a good many things that everyone knows there is one thing wrong with that statement it isnt so true it is not that any of the predecessors of the decimal system is likely to make a comeback there is for instance vanishingly little chance that we will return to the babylonian sexagesimal systemthough that is a tough old bird and will not be finally dead as long as we count minutes to the hour and degrees to the circle there are traces of systems to other bases surviving in such terms as score and the french word for quatrevingt suggesting an extinct system to the base and in terms like dozen gross and so on which appear to derive from a system to the base in science fiction most of the speculation on numbering systems of the future has dwelt on this base system but it is hard to understand why it is argued that a digit system simplifies writing decimal equivalents of such fractions as and but that seems a small reward for the enormous task of conversion setting aside the merits or demerits of the duodecimal system itself think of the cost of such a change for a starter our decimal system of coinage either goes down the drain to be replaced by a new one or lingers on as a clumsy anachronism like the british Ñ˜ s d and that cost is only the bare beginning science is measurement and interpretation without measurement interpretation is foggy soulsearching and measurement is number change our system of writing numbers and you must translate nearly the entire recorded body of human knowledgelab reports and tax returns cost estimates and time studies knowledge about the behavior of nu mesons and knowledge about transactions on the new york stock exchange the project of converting the worlds essential records from one system of numbering to another staggers the mind its cost is measurable not merely in millions of dollars but in perhaps millions of manyears that being so why is this enormous project now in process the answer is simply that machines arent any smarter than russian peasants this is not meant to run down the russians but only to observe that univac and ivan have a lot of things in commonand one of these things is a lack of skill in performing decimal multiplication and division lets take a simple sumsay x and see how it would be done by us by ivan and by univac you and i having completed at least a couple of years of grade school write down a compact little operation like this x that wasnt hard to do if we had to we probably could have done it in our heads however ivan would find that pretty hard because he didnt happen to go to grade school what ivan would do in a similar case is a process called russian multiplication or sometimes mediation and duplication it consists merely of writing down two columns of figures side by side the first column starts with one of your original figures which is successively halved until there is nothing left to halve ivan didnt understand fractions very well so he simply threw them awayhe would write half of for instance as the second column starts with the other number which is successively doubled as many times as the first number was halved as follows having gotten this far ivan examines the lefthand or halved column for even numbers he finds two of themthe fourth number and the sixth he strikes out the numbers next to them in the righthand columnthat is and he then adds up the remaining numbers in the righthand column having gone all around robin hoods barn to do it as it appears he was wound up with the same answer we got that may not seem like much of an accomplishment at first glimpse until you stop to think of ivans innocence of the multiplication table and then it becomes pretty ingenious indeed ivan turns out to be a clever fellow yet he was not so clever all the same but what he would have laughed in your face if you had accused him of seeking help from the binary system of numbering but that is what he did and that of course is what univac and its electronic brothers do today to see how univac does this lets take some numbers apart and see what is inside them our own decimal numbers for exampleare simply a shorthand positional way of saying x plus x the larger the number the shorter the shorthand becomes for instance is shorthand for onetimestencubed plus ninetimestensquared plus fivetimesten plus sixtimesone or it has been said in many sciencefiction stories that this is homo sapiens natural system of counting because look dont we have ten fingers on our hands as a theory lets not worry ourselves about this too much if true it will have plenty of chance to prove itself when our exploring rockets turn up some digited and duo decimal extraterrestrials still if we assume the fable is true we can conveniently explain univac by saying that the computer not having ten fingers to count on has to use a simpler system the name of this simpler system is the binary or dyadic system and it is this system that most of the worlds numbers are being translated into now in order to be taped and fed into computers the binary system obeys all the laws of the decimal it is positional it can represent any finite number it can be used for addition subtraction multiplication division exponential functions and any other arithmetical process known to man or to univac the only difference is that it is to the base instead of the base it lops off eight of the ten basic decimal digits and retaining only and you can count with it of course is one is two is three is four is five is six is seven is eight is nine is ten and so on you can subtract or add with it four plus three is seven you can multiply or divide with it six divided by three is two and you can do all of these things rather simply without the necessity of memorizing multiplication tables thus freeing your preadolescent evenings for baseball and doorbellringing look back at ivans system of russian multiplication let us do it over again in a slightly different way lets halve both columns the right as well as the left and instead of striking out any number let us write a next to the odd numbers and a next to the even ones as follows now you might not know what you have just accomplished and ivan certainly wouldntbut you have translated two decimal numbers into their binary equivalents reading from bottom to top is binary for is binary for to see what these mean remember how we dissected a decimal number a binary number comes apart in the same sort of pieces the only difference is that the pieces are multiples of powers of not of powers of then is a shorthand way of saying which is what we said it was in the first place when you feed numbers like and into univac its digestion gets upsetin fact it wont accept them until they are predigested so you must convert them into binary digits just as we did above such binary numbers as and univac handles very well indeed multiply them no trouble at all univac in its electronic way does something like this that may look frightening because it is unfamiliar but it is still the same old product of x it is shorthand for observe the simplicity true the number is long but see how simple manipulating it becomes addition for instance is reduced to simple counting to add a column of figures like you simply count the ones in the righthand column then count the ones in the middle column starting of course with the one you carried then count the ones in the lefthand column again remembering the one you carried that is i submit about as simple as an arithmetical operation can get and multiplication is nearly as much so multiplication becomes merely a matter of writing down the number moved an appropriate number of places to the left or not writing down the number at all thereafter it is addition and addition as we have seen is merely counting no multiplication tables no tedious memorizing no wonder univac and ivan like it if binary arithmetic has a fault it is that it is so excessively easy that it becomes boring but the worlds work is full of boring operations that get done anyhow we have found two good ways to handle themeither to turn them over to machines which do not have the capacity for boredom or to learn to do them as a matter of mechanical routine my wife observes that it doesnt much matter what sort of change she suggests i can usually find a dozen splendid reasons for keeping things just as they are since the human animal is conservative most of us can find objections to any sort of change since the human animal is also educable we often however overcome our objections when the change promises rewards let us see what the drawbacks and rewards of changeover to binary notation may be not that the case is really arguable since the silent vote of the computers constitutes a carrying majority over our human veto but let us see if there are any advantages for us borable errorprone humans the drawbacks stand out immediately starting with the sheer physical size of a binary number as contrasted with its decimal equivalent still a binary number isnt so very much longer than a decimal as to be ipso facto out of the question as a matter of fact really large numbers are hopelessly unwieldy in any notation at all in the prevailing decimal system scientific people express large numbers either as approximations or in terms of their prime factors and exponents or in other factored or shorthand ways even the headlines in our daily papers are more likely to read billion than for householdsized numbersoh up to a million lets sayit doesnt seem as though the mere matter of length ought to be a prevailing count against binary notation you might use binary digits to write a number that big and a number such asto take one at random is pretty hideous but is its decimal equivalent utterly lovely perhaps the number itself isnt so bad perhaps the way we are reading it could stand some improvement look at the number for instance you just came across it a couple of pages ago and yet you almost certainly failed to recognize it is it because its recognition value is intrinsically low or because we lack practice in reading that sort of number in decimal notation remember we simplify the reading of such large numbers by setting off groups of three is pretty hard to read by itself though reveals itself to be five trillion rather conveniently why should we not adopt a similar convention for binary numbers there is no reason to stick to groups of three lets make it groups of five and thus write the expression for the product of x that is as follows well thats a help but as is often the case a little progress in one direction merely brightens the light on a related problem still unsolved the related problem here is the problem of subvocalization all of us are lip readers even if the motion of the lip muscles is so thoroughly suppressed as to be invisible to the naked eye the larynx is still forming the sounds of everything we reador think for that matter and groups like oneoneone comma oneoneoneohoh comma oneoneohoneone simply do not pronounce well but being able to state a problem is progressing far toward solving it it is apparent that there is no difficulty involved in assigning more pronounceable phonetic values to the parts of binary notation one such system is in fact already widely in use if you walk into the bank of ireland bar in chelsea on a noisy night you may come across a couple of merchant marine officers having a relaxed and private conversation which is not subject to either eavesdropping or interference regardless of the surrounding noise if you do they are probably radiomen and they are talking to each other in code for the dots and dashes of morse there is a wellestablished pronouncing convention dit is a dot dah is a dash if we merely appropriate this convention for our binary numbers we may sacrifice some efficiencyno doubt an even more compact and clear system could be worked out from basic phonetic principles but it offers a very special advantage it works we dont have to test it or doubt it we know it works it has worked all over the world for countless radio operators for a period of decades let us then pronounce as dit and as dah then becomes dididit didididahdah dididahdidit and we notice something odd we already conceded that the binary system had an intrinsic drawback in that its terms were by definition always less compact than the decimal yet if we wish to transmit the decimal number in morse code it must be expressed like this dahdahdahdidit dahdahdahdahdah dahdahdahdahdit didalhdahdahdah that is four groups each comprising five bits or bits in all but its binary equivalent needs only three groups totalling bits as we have just seen our concession was evidently premature in this one special case at leastand it is far from an unimportant onethe binary system can be made more compact than the decimal having found one such case let us be encouraged enough to look for more when i was around ten we kids used to kill time on long auto rides by playing a game of counting we would pick a common phenomenoncows or fords or for sale signs on farmsand see who in a given period had spotted the most it almost always kept us quiet and out of the drivers hair for the first mile or twoand almost never beyond that the trouble was that we counted on our fingers that worked beautifully for numbers up to ten of course it worked passably for numbers up to or even to it wasnt much of a trick to remember that we were on the second or third goaround of fingercounting but when we got to numbers much above that we began to rely pretty heavily on our individually differing memories of just how many times we had counted up to ten and thats when the fights would start naturally we were counting by the decimal system could we have done better with the binary spread out the ten fingers on your two hands before you and lets see what can be done with them we start by establishing a convention an extended finger is a a retracted finger is a clench your fists and begin to count extend the right little finger that is in both binary and decimal notation retract the little finger and extend the right ring finger read it as keep the ring finger out and extend the little finger beside it read retract both those fingers and extend the middle finger of the right hand read or four and so on you may find that waggling your fingers like this requires practice or natural flexibilityunless of course you make it easy on yourself by resting the fingers against the edge of a table your fingers are now indeed digits and you are using them in positional notation observe that you can represent any number from to next time you want to count a reasonably large number say the number of cars ahead of you in a tunnel jam or the number of hits against a met pitcher you might try this system its good anywhere from to indeed by a few obvious extensions for instance by adding on successively extended or retracted positions of the wrists elbows and so on you can soon reach numbers beyond which you are never likely to count moreover your running total is available to you at any time you merely read it off suppose for instance you are out hiking with a companion and your friend wants to know how many paces you can go in a given period of time you keep count on your fingers and at the end of the time you see you have the little finger index finger and thumb of the left hand and the thumb and ring finger of the right hand extended reading off your hands according to our established convention you find you have come paces and you pass on the information to him according to the pronouncing convention didahdahdidit didahdahdidah of course your friend may be a square who still uses the old stickinthemud decimal system so you may want to translate for him thats easy enough if you remember the decimal equivalents of each of the fingers left hand little finger ring finger middle finger index finger thumb right hand thumb index finger middle finger ring finger little finger accordingly to convert your finger count into decimal figures just add up the finger equivalents given above for the aforementioned read left little finger left index finger left thumb right thumb right ring finger and inform your friend you have come paces as promised we have found another case where an ingenious use of binary notation is actually more compact than decimalby a factor of as it turns out let us turn then away from the demolished drawbacks of binary notation in order to take a quick look at some of its more attractive features we recall that it has already been demonstrated that binary arithmetic is about as simple as arithmetic can get that is what makes it so uniquely right for univac but even on a less complicated level of computer design it presents lovely aspects think for example of the beautifully compact desk adding machine that might be designed for binary numbers no wheels and gear trainstherefore at least for normalsized calculations no necessity for a power source to drive them to handle addition or subtraction of say tenplace numbers you need only a row of ten levers with an up and down position of course you wouldnt have to spend much money on a calculator as simple as that you could build it yourself or alternatively you could merely use the builtin tenplace binary computer weve just been talking about the one that grows out of the ends of your arms for instance youre remodeling your house you have x panels of sheetrock on hand and you discover that you have square feet of wall to cover question how many additional panels of sheetrock will you have to go out and buy thats not the most difficult problem in the world true but lets run through it once in binary arithmetic using our fingers as computers first we need to convert to binary numbersbut only because we chose to start out with decimal ones it isnt fair to include conversion time as part of the time required for solving the problem in binary numbers you have l x panels on hand and square feet of wall to cover lllxlxl obviously is merely a matter of pointing off places you represent on your left hand and on your right hand thats how many square feet of sheetrock you haveuh on hand so to speak then the subtraction is merely a matter of considering the successive digits reading from the right subtracting the digit shown on your finger from the corresponding digit in the written number you are subtracting from and carrying borrowed numbers the result you write one digit at a time on your fingers that is by the time you are subtracting your rightthumb digit from the written figure the remaining fingers on your right hand are already indicating the last four digits of the answer when youre done you read the answer off as already shown the number of square feet of sheetrock you need to buy is there are square feet in a panel divided by sq ft wall to cover sq ft sheetrock on hand sq ft needed is obviously and a fraction but you cant buy part of a panel so you add to the and get answer you need to buy panels look hard once again consider it from the perspective of relative difficulty after all this is probably your first binary problem make up a few more by the time youve done six it wont be hard at all by the time youve done a hundred it will be semiautomatic by the time youve done a thousand well hold on for a moment before you do your thousand perhaps it will cheer you up to know that there are some special cases of binary arithmetic which arent ever hard not even the first time for example multiplication by powers of is an obvious case you simply point off and add zeroes true the decimal system has a similar situation in regard to powers of but you still have to give the verdict to binary on this point simply because in any finite series there are more powers of than powers of but if you want to see something really easy consider the strange case of the problem n lets arbitrarily take n as do this one on your fingers first show yourself the binary representation of then cancel that and represent on your fingers the binary equivalent of dont bother about subtracting youve already done it just reverse your convention for reading finger representations read an extended finger as a retracted finger as and you get in other words any number n in binary notation is always the reverse of the number n not only that but the same sort of rule can be made for the cases n n n etcfor any number whose binary representation is all ones as you may already have realized try it and see it may be objected that such special cases are comparatively rare this is true enough but in the decimal system they are not only rare they do not exist at all and we have not by any means exhausted binarys bag of tricks it is in fact hardly possible that any reader can spend as much as a single evening trying out experiments in binary arithmetic without discovering additional shortcuts to this one decimal system that clumsy sprawly quaint old thing
