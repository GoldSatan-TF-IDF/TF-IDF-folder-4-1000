i saw the great pyramid and got thirsty maybe it was all the sand so dry and yellow it seemed to stretch on forever it even made the sky look dry i poked my mom in the side mom im really thirsty not now she said she had one hand up on her forehead shielding her eyes from the bright sun as she stared up at the enormous pyramid not now what does not now mean i was thirsty now someone bumped me from behind and apologized in a foreign language i never dreamed when i saw the great pyramid thered be so many other tourists i guess half the people in the world decided to spend their christmas vacation in egypt this year but mom i said i didnt mean to whine it was just that my throat was so dry im really thirsty we wont get you a drink now she answered staring at the pyramid stop acting like youre four youre twelve remember twelveyearolds get thirsty too i muttered all this sand in the air its making me gag look at the pyramid she said sounding a little irritated thats why we came here we didnt come here to get a drink but im choking i cried gasping and holding my throat okay so i wasnt choking i exaggerated a little just trying to get her attention but she pulled the brim of her straw hat down and continued to stare up at the pyramid which shimmered in the heat i decided to try my dad as usual he was studying the handful of guidebooks he always carried everywhere i dont think hed even looked at the pyramid yet he always misses everything because he always has his nose buried in a guidebook dad im really thirsty i said whispering as if my throat were strained to get my message across wow do you know how wide the pyramid is he asked staring at a picture of the pyramid in his book im thirsty dad its thirteen acres wide gabe he said really excited do you know what its made of i wanted to say silly putty hes always testing me whenever we go on a trip he always asks me a million questions like that i dont think ive ever answered one right some kind of stone i answered thats right he smiled at me then turned back to his book its made of limestone limestone blocks it says here that some of the blocks weigh up to a thousand tons whoa i said thats more than you and mom put together he turned his eyes from the book and frowned at me not funny gabe just kidding i said dads a little sensitive about his weight so i try to tease him about it as often as i can how do you think the ancient egyptians moved stones that weighed a thousand tons he asked quiz time wasnt over i took a guess in trucks he laughed trucks they didnt have the wheel i shielded my eyes and stared up at the pyramid it was really huge much bigger than it looks in pictures and much dryer i couldnt imagine how they pulled those big stones across the sand without wheels i dont know i confessed im really thirsty no one knows how they did it dad said so it was a trick question dad i really need a drink not now he said he squinted at the pyramid gives you a funny feeling doesnt it it gives me a thirsty feeling i said trying to get my point across no i mean it gives me a funny feeling to think that our ancestors yours and mine gabe may have walked around these pyramids or even helped to build them it gives me kind of a chill how about you i guess i told him he was right it was kind of exciting were egyptian you see i mean both sets of my grandparents came from egypt they moved to the united states around my mom and dad were both born in michigan we were all very excited to see the country our ancestors came from i wonder if your uncle ben is down inside that pyramid right now dad said shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand uncle ben hassad i had nearly forgotten about my uncle the famous archaeologist uncle ben was another one of the reasons we had decided to come to egypt over the holidays that and the fact that my mom and dad had some business to do in cairo and alexandria and some other places mom and dad have their own business they sell refrigeration equipment it usually isnt very exciting but sometimes they travel to neat places like egypt and i get to go with them i turned my eyes to the pyramids and thought about my uncle uncle ben and his workers were digging around in the great pyramid exploring and discovering new mummies i guess he had always been fascinated by our ancestors homeland he had lived in egypt for many years uncle ben was an expert on pyramids and mummies i even saw his picture once in national geographic when are we going to see uncle ben i asked tugging dads arm i accidentally tugged too hard and the guidebooks fell out of his hands i helped him pick them up not today dad said making a face he didnt like to bend over to pick up things his stomach got in the way bens going to meet us in cairo in a few days why dont we go up to the pyramid and see if hes there now i asked impatiently were not allowed dad replied look camels mom poked me on the shoulder and pointed sure enough some people had arrived on camels one of the camels seemed to be having a coughing fit i guess he was thirsty too the people riding the camels were tourists and they looked very uncomfortable they didnt seem to know what to do next do you know how to get down from a camel i asked my dad he was squinting at the pyramid studying the top of it no how you dont get down from a camel i said you get down from a duck i know i know its a very old joke but my dad and i never get tired of it do you see the camels mom asked im not blind i replied being thirsty always puts me in a bad mood besides what was so exciting about camels they were really grosslooking and they smelled like my gym socks after a basketball game whats your problem mom asked fiddling with her straw hat i told you i said not meaning to sound so angry im thirsty gabe really she glanced at dad then went back to staring at the pyramid dad do you think uncle ben can take us inside the pyramid i asked enthusiastically that would really be outstanding no i dont think so he said he tucked his guidebooks into his armpit so he could raise his binoculars to his eyes i really dont think so gabe i dont think its allowed i couldnt hide my disappointment i had all these fantasies about going down into the pyramid with my uncle discovering mummies and ancient treasures fighting off ancient egyptians who had come back to life to defend their sacred tomb and escaping after a wild chase just like indiana jones im afraid youll just have to appreciate the pyramid from the outside dad said peering over the yellow sand trying to focus the binoculars ive already appreciated it i told him glumly can we go get a drink now little did i know that in a few days mom and dad would be gone and i would be deep inside the pyramid we were staring at not just inside it but trapped inside it sealed inside it probably forever we drove from aljizah back to cairo in the funny little rental car dad had picked up at the airport it wasnt a long drive but it seemed long to me the car was just a little bit bigger than some of my old remotecontrol cars and my head hit the ceiling with every bump id brought my game boy with me but mom made me put it away so that i could watch the nile as the road followed along its bank it was very wide and very brown no one else in your class is seeing the nile this christmas mom said the hot wind blowing her brown hair through the open car window can i play with my game boy now i asked i mean when you get right down to it a river is a river an hour or so later we were back in cairo with its narrow crowded streets dad made a wrong turn and drove us into some kind of market and we were trapped in a little alley behind a herd of goats for nearly half an hour i didnt get a drink till we got back to the hotel and by that time my tongue was the size of a salami and hanging down to the floor just like elviss hes our cocker spaniel back home ill say one nice thing about egypt the coke tastes just as good as the coke back home its the classic coke too not the other kind and they give you plenty of ice which i like to crunch with my teeth we had a suite at the hotel two bedrooms and a sort of living room if you looked out the window you could see a tall glass skyscraper across the street just like youd see in any city there was a tv in the living room but everyone spoke arabic on it the shows didnt look too interesting anyway mainly a lot of news the only channel in english was cnn but that was news too we had just started to talk about where to go for dinner when the phone rang dad went into the bedroom to answer it a few minutes later he called mom in and i could hear the two of them discussing something they were talking very quietly so i figured it had something to do with me and they didnt want me to hear it as usual i was right they both came out of the bedroom a few minutes later looking kind of worried my first thought was that my grandmother had called to say that something bad had happened to elvis back home whats wrong i asked who called your dad and i have to go to alexandria right away mom said sitting down beside me on the couch huh alexandria we werent supposed to go there until the end of the week business dad said an important customer wants to meet with us first thing tomorrow morning we have to take a plane that leaves in an hour mom said but i dont wand to i told them jumping up from the couch i want to stay in cairo and see uncle ben i want to go to the pyramids with him you promised we argued about it for a short while they tried to convince me there were a lot of cool things to see in alexandria but i held my ground finally mom had an idea she went into the bedroom and i heard her making a phone call to someone a few minutes later she came back with a smile on her face i talked to uncle ben she announced wow do they have phones in the pyramid i asked no i talked to him at the small lodge hes staying at in aljizah she replied he said hed come and take care of you if you want while your dad and i are in alexandria yeah this was starting to sound outstanding uncle ben is one of the coolest guys ive ever known sometimes i couldnt believe he was moms brother its your choice gabe she said glancing at my dad you can come with us or you can stay with ben till we get back some choice i didnt have to think about it for more than oneeighteenth of a second ill stay with uncle ben i declared one other thing mom said grinning for some reason you might want to think about this i dont care what it is i insisted i choose uncle ben sari is also on christmas vacation mom said and shes staying with him too barf i cried and i flung myself down on the couch and began pounding the cushions with both fists sari is uncle bens stuckup daughter my only cousin shes the same age as me twelve and she thinks shes so great she goes to boarding school in the united states while her dad works in egypt shes really pretty and she knows it and sites smart and the last time i saw her she was an inch taller than me that was last christmas i guess she thought she was really hot stuff because she could get to the last level of super mario land but it wasnt fair because i dont have super nintendo only regular nintendo so i never get to practice i think thats what she liked about me best that she could beat me at games and things sari is the most competitive person i know she has to be first and best at everything if everyone around is catching the flu she has to be the first one to catch it stop pounding the couch like that mom said she grabbed my arm and pulled me to my feet does that mean you changed your mind youre coming with us dad asked i thought about it no ill stay here with uncle ben i decided and you wont fight with sari mom asked she fights with me i said your mom and i have got to hurry dad said they disappeared into the bedroom to pack i turned on the tv and watched some kind of game show in arabic the contestants kept laughing a lot i couldnt figure out why i hardly know a word of arabic after a while mom and dad came out again dragging suitcases well never get to the airport in time dad said i talked to ben mom told me brushing her hair with her hand hell be here in an hour hour and a half gabe you dont mind staying alone here for just an hour do you huh not much of an answer ill admit but her question caught me by surprise i mean it never occurred to me that my own parents would leave me all alone in a big hotel in a strange city where i didnt even know the language i mean how could they do that to me no problem i said ill be fine ill just watch tv till he comes bens on his way already mom said he and sari will be here in no time and i phoned down to the hotel manager he said hed have someone look in on you from time to time wheres the bellhop dad asked nervously pacing to the door and back i called down there ten minutes ago just stay here and wait for ben okay mom said to me walking up behind the couch leaning over and squeezing my ears for some reason she thinks i like that dont go out or anything just wait right here for him she bent down and kissed me on the forehead i wont move i promised ill stay right here on the couch i wont go to the bathroom or anything cant you ever be serious mom asked shaking her head there was a loud knock on the door the bellhop a bentover old man who didnt look as if he could pick up a feather pillow had arrived to take the bags mom and dad looking very worried gave me hugs and more final instructions and told me once again to stay in the room the door closed behind them and it was suddenly very quiet very quiet i turned up the tv just to make it a little noisier the game show had gone off and now a man in a white suit was reading the news in arabic im not scared i said aloud but i had kind of a tight feeling in my throat i walked to the window and looked out the sun was nearly down the shadow of the skyscraper slanted over the street and onto the hotel i picked up my coke glass and took a sip it was watery and flat my stomach growled i suddenly realized that i was hungry room service i thought then i decided id better not what if i called and they only spoke arabic i glanced at the clock seventwenty i wished uncle ben would arrive i wasnt scared i just wished hed arrive okay maybe i was a little nervous i paced back and forth for a bit i tried playing tetris on the game boy but i couldnt concentrate and the light wasnt very good sari is probably a champ at tetris i thought bitterly where were they what was taking so long i began to have horrible frightening thoughts what if they cant find the hotel what if they get mixed up and go to the wrong hotel what if theyre in a terrible car crash and die and im all by myself in cairo for days and days i know they were dumb thoughts but theyre the kind of thoughts you have when youre alone in a strange place waiting for someone to come i glanced down and realized i had taken the mummy hand out of my jeans pocket it was small the size of a childs hand a little hand wrapped in papery brown gauze i had bought it at a garage sale a few years ago and i always carried it around as a good luck charm the kid who sold it to me called it a summoner he said it was used to summon evil spirits or something i didnt care about that i just thought it was an outstanding bargain for two dollars i mean what a great thing to find at a garage sale and maybe it was even real i tossed it from hand to hand as i paced the length of the living room the tv was starting to make me nervous so i clicked it off but now the quiet was making me nervous i slapped the mummy hand against my palm and kept pacing where were they they shouldve been here by now i was beginning to think that id made the wrong choice maybe i shouldve gone to alexandria with mom and dad then i heard a noise at the door footsteps was it them i stopped in the middle of the living room and listened staring past the narrow front hallway to the door the light was dim in the hallway but i saw the doorknob turn thats strange i thought uncle ben would knock first wouldnt he the doorknob turned the door started to creak open hey i called out but the word choked in my throat uncle ben would knock he wouldnt just barge in slowly slowly the door squeaked open as i stared frozen in the middle of the room unable to call out standing in the doorway was a tall shadowy figure i gasped as the figure lurched into the room and i saw it clearly even in the dim light i could see what it was a mummy glaring at me with round dark eyes through holes in its ancient thick bandages a mummy pushing itself off the wall and staggering stiffly toward me into the living room its arms outstretched as if to grab me i opened my mouth to scream but no sound came out i took a step back and then another without realizing it id raised my little mummy hand in the air as if trying to fend off the intruder with it as the mummy staggered into the light i stared into its deep dark eyes and recognized them uncle ben i screamed angrily i heaved the mummy hand at him it hit his bandaged chest and bounced off he collapsed backwards against the wall laughing that booming laugh of his and then i saw sari poking her head in the doorway she was laughing too they both thought it was hilarious but my heart was pounding so hard i thought it was going to pop out of my chest that wasnt funny i shouted angrily balling my hands into fists at my sides i took a deep breath then another trying to get my breathing to return to normal i told you hed be scared sari said walking into the room a big superior grin on her face uncle ben was laughing so hard he had tears running down his bandaged face he was a big man tall and broad and his laughter shook the room you werent that scared were you gabe i knew it was you i said my heart still pounding as if it were a windup toy someone had wound up too tight i recognized you right away you sure looked scared sari insisted i didnt want to spoil the joke i replied wondering if they could see how terrified i really was you shouldve seen the look on your face uncle ben cried and started laughing all over again i told daddy he shouldnt do it sari said dropping down onto the couch im amazed the hotel people let him come up dressed like that uncle ben bent down and picked up the mummy hand i had tossed at him youre used to me and my practical jokes right gabe yeah i said avoiding his eyes secretly i scolded myself for falling for his stupid costume i was always falling for his dumb jokes always and now there was sari grinning at me from the couch knowing i was so scared that id practically had a cow uncle ben pulled some of the bandages away from his face he stepped over and handed the little mummy hand back to me whered you get that he asked garage sale i told him i started to ask him if it was real but he surrounded me in a big bear hug the gauze felt rough against my cheek good to see you gabe he said softly youve grown taller almost as tall as me sari chimed in uncle ben motioned to her get up and help me pull this stuff off i kind of like the way you look in it sari said get over here uncle ben insisted sari got up with a sigh tossing her straight black hair behind her shoulders she walked over to her dad and started unraveling the bandages i got a little carried away with this mummy thing gabe uncle ben admitted resting his arm on my shoulder as sari continued working but its just because im so excited about whats going on at the pyramid whats going on i asked eagerly daddys discovered a whole new burial chamber sari broke in before her dad had a chance to tell me himself hes exploring parts of the pyramid that have been undiscovered for thousands of years really i cried thats outstanding uncle ben chuckled wait till you see it see it i wasnt sure what he meant you mean youre going to take me into the pyramid my voice was so high that only dogs could hear it but i didnt care i couldnt believe my good luck i was actually going inside the great pyramid into a section that hadnt been discovered until now i have no choice uncle ben said dryly what else am i going to do with you two are there mummies in there i asked will we see actual mummies do you miss your mummy sari said her lame idea of a joke i ignored her is there treasure down there uncle ben egyptian relics are there wall paintings lets talk about it at dinner he said tugging off the last of the bandages he was wearing a plaid sportshirt and baggy chinos under all the gauze come on im starving race you downstairs sari said and shoved me out of the way to give herself a good head start out of the room we ate downstairs in the hotel restaurant there were palm trees painted on the walls and miniature palm trees planted in big pots all around the restaurant large wooden ceiling fans whirled slowly overhead the three of us sat in a large booth sari and i across from uncle ben we studied the long menus they were printed in arabic and english listen to this gabe sari said a smug smile on her face she began to read the arabic words aloud what a showoff the whitesuited waiter brought a basket of flat pita bread and a bowl of green stuff to dip the bread in i ordered a dub sandwich and french fries sari ordered a hamburger later as we ate our dinner uncle ben explained a little more about what he had discovered at the pyramid as you probably know he started tearing off a chunk of the flat bread the pyramid was built some time around bc during the reign of the pharaoh khufu gesundheit sari said another lame joke her father chuckled i made a face at her it was the biggest structure of its time uncle ben said do you know how wide the base of the pyramid is sari shook her head no how wide she asked with a mouthful of hamburger i know i said grinning its thirteen acres wide hey thats right uncle ben exclaimed obviously impressed sari flashed me a surprised look thats one for me i thought happily sticking my tongue out at her and one for my dads guidebooks the pyramid was built as a royal burial place uncle ben costumed his expression turning serious the pharaoh made it really enormous so that the burial chamber could be hidden the egyptians worried about tomb robbers they knew that people would try to break in and take all of the valuable jewels and treasures that were buried alongside their owners so they built dozens of tunnels and chambers inside a confusing maze to keep robbers from finding the real burial room pass the ketchup please sari interrupted i passed her the ketchup saris heard all this before uncle ben said dipping the pita bread into the dark gravy on his plate anyway we archaeologists thought wed uncovered all of the tunnels and rooms inside this pyramid but a few days ago my workers and i discovered a tunnel that isnt on any of the charts an unexplored undiscovered tunnel and we think this tunnel may lead us to the actual burial chamber of khufu himself outstanding i exclaimed and sari and i will be there when you discover it uncle ben chuckled i dont know about that gabe it may take us years of careful exploration but ill take you down into the tunnel tomorrow then you can tell your friends you were actually inside the ancient pyramid of khufu ive already been in it sari bragged she turned her eyes to me its very dark you might get scared no i wont i insisted no way the three of us spent the night in my parents hotel room it took me hours to get to sleep i guess i was excited about going into the pyramid i kept imagining that we found mummies and big chests of ancient jewels and treasure uncle ben woke us up early the next morning and we drove out to the pyramid outside aljizah the air was already hot and sticky the sun seemed to hang low over the desert like an orange balloon there it is sari declared pointing out the window and i saw the great pyramid rising up from the yellow sand like some kind of mirage uncle ben showed a special permit to the blueuniformed guard and we followed a narrow private road that curved through the sand behind the pyramid we parked beside several other cars and vans in the bluegray shadow of the pyramid as i stepped out of the car my chest was thudding with excitement i stared up at the enormous worn stones of the great pyramid its over four thousand years old i thought im about to go inside something that was built four thousand years ago your sneakers untied sari said pointing she sure knew how to bring a guy back down to earth i bent in the sand to tie my sneaker for some reason the left one was always coming untied even when i doubleknotted it my workers are already inside uncle ben told us now stick close together okay dont wander off the tunnels really are like a maze its very easy to get lost no problem i said my trembling voice revealing how nervous and excited i was dont worry ill keep an eye on gabe dad sari said she was only two months older than me why did she have to act like she was my babysitter or something uncle ben handed us both flashlights clip them onto your jeans as we go in he instructed he gazed at me you dont believe in curses do you you know the ancient egyptian kind i didnt know how to reply so i shook my head good uncle ben replied grinning because one of my workers claims weve violated an ancient decree by entering this new tunnel and that weve activated some curse were not scared sari said giving him a playful shove toward the entrance get going dad and seconds later we were stepping into the small square opening cut into the stone stooping low i followed them through a narrow tunnel that seemed to slope gradually down uncle ben led the way lighting the ground with a bright halogen flashlight the pyramid floor was soft and sandy the air was cool and damp the walls are granite uncle ben said stopping to rub a hand along the low ceiling all of the tunnels were made of limestone the temperature dropped suddenly the air felt even wetter i suddenly realized why uncle ben had made us wear our sweatshirts if youre scared we can go back sari said im fine i replied quickly the tunnel ended abruptly a pale yellow wall rose up in front of us bens flashlight darted over a small dark hole in the floor down we go ben said groaning as he dropped to his knees he turned back to me afraid there are no stairs down to the new tunnel my workers installed a rope ladder just take your time on it take it slowly one rung at a time and youll be fine no problem i said but my voice cracked dont look down sari advised it might make you dizzy and youll fall thanks for the encouragement i told her i pushed my way past her ill go down first i said i was already tired of her acting so superior i decided to show her who was brave and who wasnt no let me go first uncle ben said raising a hand to stop me then ill shine the light up at the ladder and help you down with another groan he maneuvered himself into the hole he was so big he nearly didnt fit slowly he began to lower himself down the rope ladder sari and i leaned over the hole and peered down watching him descend the rope ladder wasnt very steady it swung back and forth under his weight as he slowly carefully made his way down its a long way down i said softly sari didnt reply in the shadowy light i could see her worried expression she was chewing on her lower lip as her dad reached the tunnel floor she was nervous too that cheered me up a lot okay im down youre next gabe uncle ben called up to me i turned and swung my feet onto the rope ladder i grinned at sari see ya i lowered my hands to the sides of the rope ladder and as i slid them down i cried out ow the rope wasnt smooth it was coarse it cut my hands the sharp stab of pain made me lift my hands and before i even realized what was happening i started to fall two hands reached down for mine they shot through the air and grabbed my wrists hold on sari cried she had slowed my fall just enough to allow me to grab back onto the sides of the rope ladder oh wow i managed to utter that was the best i could do i gripped the rope for dear life waiting for my heart to stop pounding i closed my eyes and didnt move i squeezed the ropes so hard my hands ached saved your life sari called down to me leaning into the opening her face inches from mine i opened my eyes and stared up at her thanks i said gratefully no problem she replied and burst out laughing laughing from relief i guess why couldnt i save her life i asked myself angrily why cant i ever be the big hero what happened gabe uncle ben called from the tunnel floor below his booming voice echoed loudly through the chamber the wide circle of light from his flashlight danced across the granite wall the rope cut my hands i explained i wasnt expecting just take your time he said patiently one rung at a time remember lower your hands dont slide them sari advised her face poking through the hole above me okay okay i said starting to breathe normally i took a deep breath and held it then slowly carefully i made my way down the long rope ladder a short while later all three of us were standing on the tunnel floor holding our lighted flashlights our eyes following the circles of light this way uncle ben said quietly and he headed off to the right walking slowly stooping because of the low ceiling our sneakers crunched on the sandy floor i saw another tunnel leading off to the right then another tunnel on the left were breathing air that is four thousand years old ben said keeping his light aimed on the floor ahead of him smells like it i whispered to sari she laughed the air really did smell old kind of heavy and musty like someones attic the tunnel widened a little as it curved to the right were going deeper into the earth ben said does it feel like youre going downhill sari and i both muttered that it did dad and i explored one of the side tunnels yesterday sari told me we found a mummy case inside a tiny room a beautiful one in perfect condition was there a mummy inside it i asked eagerly i was dying to see a mummy the museum back home had only one id stared at it and studied it all my life no it was empty sari replied why didnt the mummy have any hobbies uncle ben asked stopping suddenly i dont know i answered he was too wrapped up in his work uncle ben exclaimed he laughed at his own joke sari and i could only muster weak smiles dont encourage him sari told me loud enough for her dad to hear he knows a million mummy jokes and theyre all just as bad wait up just a sec i said i bent down to tie my sneaker which had come undone again the tunnel curved then divided into two tunnels uncle ben led us through the one on the left which was so narrow we had to squeeze through it making our way sideways heads bent until it widened into a large highceilinged chamber i stood up straight and stretched it felt so good not to be scrunched down i stared around the large room several people came into view at the far wall working with digging tools bright spotlights had been hung above them on the wall attached to a portable generator uncle ben brought us over to them and introduced us there were four workers two men and two women another man stood off to the side a clipboard in his hand he was an egyptian dressed all in white except for a red bandanna around his neck he had straight black hair slicked down and tied in a ponytail behind his head he stared at sari and me but didnt come over he seemed to be studying us ahmed you met my daughter yesterday this is gabe my nephew uncle ben called to him ahmed nodded but didnt smile or say anything ahmed is from the university uncle ben explained to me in a low voice he requested permission to observe us and i said okay hes very quiet but dont get him started on ancient curses hes the one who keeps warning me that im in deadly danger ahmed nodded but didnt reply he stared at me for a long while weird guy i thought i wondered if hed tell me about the ancient curses i loved stories about ancient curses uncle ben turned to his workers so any progress today he asked we think were getting real close a young redhaired man wearing faded jeans and a blue denim work shirt replied and then he added just a hunch ben frowned thanks quasimodo he said the workers all laughed i guess they liked uncle bens jokes quasimodo was the hunchback of notre dame sari explained to me in her superior tone i know i know i replied irritably i get it we could be heading in the wrong direction altogether uncle ben told the workers scratching the bald spot on the back of his head the tunnel might be over there he pointed to the wall on the right no i think were getting warm ben a young woman her face smudged with dust said come over here i want to show you something she led him over to a large pile of stones and debris he shined his light where she was pointing then he leaned closer to examine what she was showing him thats very interesting christy uncle ben said rubbing his chin they fell into a long discussion after a while three other workers entered the chamber carrying shovels and picks one of them was carrying some kind of electronic equipment in a flat metal case it looked a little like a laptop computer i wanted to ask uncle ben what it was but he was still in the corner involved in his discussion with the worker named christy sari and i wandered back toward the tunnel entrance i think hes forgotten about us sari said sullenly i agreed shining my flashlight up at the high cracked ceiling once he gets down here with the workers he forgets everything but his work she said sighing i cant believe were actually inside a pyramid i exclaimed sari laughed she kicked at the floor with one sneaker look ancient dirt she said yeah i kicked up some of the sandy dirt too i wonder who walked here last maybe an egyptian priestess maybe a pharaoh they might have stood right here on this spot lets go exploring sari said suddenly huh her dark eyes gleamed and she had a really devilish look on her face lets go gabey lets check out some tunnels or something dont call me gabey i said come on sari you know i hate that sorry she apologized giggling you coming we cant i insisted watching uncle ben he was having some kind of argument with the worker carrying the thing that looked like a laptop your dad said we had to stick together he said hell be busy here for hours she interrupted glancing back at him he wont even notice were gone really but sari i started besides she continued putting her hands on my shoulders and pushing me backwards toward the chamber door he doesnt want us hanging around well only get in the way sari i went exploring yesterday she said pushing me with both hands we wont go far you cant get lost all the tunnels lead back to this big room really i just dont think we should i said my eyes on uncle ben he was down on his hands and knees now digging against the wall with some kind of a pick let go of me i told her really i and then she said what i knew shed say what she always says when she wants to get her way are you chicken no i insisted you know your dad said chicken chicken chicken she began clucking like a chicken really obnoxious stop it sari i tried to sound tough and menacing are you chicken gabey she repeated grinning at me as if shed just won some big victory huh gabey stop calling me that i insisted she just stared at me i made a disgusted face okay okay lets go exploring i told her i mean what else could i say but not far i added dont worry she said grinning we wont get lost ill just show you some of the tunnels i looked at yesterday one of them has a strange animal picture carved on the wall i think its some kind of a cat im not sure really i cried instantly excited ive seen pictures of relief carvings but ive never it may be a cat sari said or maybe a person with an animal head its really weird where is it i asked follow me we both gave one last glance back to uncle ben who was down on his hands and knees picking away at the stone wall then i followed sari out of the chamber we squeezed through the narrow tunnel then turned and followed a slightly wider tunnel to the right i hesitated a few steps behind her are you sure well be able to get back i asked keeping my voice low so she couldnt accuse me of sounding frightened no problem she replied keep your light on the floor theres a small chamber on the other end of this tunnel thats kind of neat we followed the tunnel as it curved to the right it branched into two low openings and sari took the one to the left the air grew a little warmer it smelled stale as if people had been smoking cigarettes there this tunnel was wider than the others sari was walking faster now getting farther ahead of me hey wait up i cried i looked down to see that my sneaker had come untied again uttering a loud annoyed groan i bent to retie it hey sari wait up she didnt seem to hear me i could see her light in the distance growing fainter in the tunnel then it suddenly disappeared had her flashlight burned out no the tunnel probably curved i decided shes just out of my view hey sari i called wait up wait up i stared ahead into the dark tunnel sari why didnt she answer me sari my voice echoed through the long curving tunnel no reply i called again and listened to my voice fading as the echo repeated her name again and again at first i was angry i knew what sari was doing she was deliberately not answering deliberately trying to frighten me she had to prove that she was the brave one and i was the fraidy cat i suddenly remembered another time a few years before sari and uncle ben had come to my house for a visit i think sari and i were seven or eight we went outside to play it was a gray day threatening rain sari had a jump rope and was showing off as usual showing me how good she was at it then of course when she let me try it i tripped and fell and she laughed like crazy id decided to get back at her by taking her to this deserted old house a couple blocks up the street the kids in the neighborhood all believed the house was haunted it was a neat place to sneak in and explore although our parents were always warning us to stay away from it because it was falling apart and dangerous so i led sari to this house and told her it was haunted and we sneaked in through the broken basement window it got even darker out and started to rain it was perfect i could tell sari was really scared to be alone in the creepy old house i of course wasnt scared at all because id been there before well we started exploring with me leading the way and somehow we got separated and it started thundering and lightning outside there was rain pouring in through the broken windows i decided maybe we should get home so i called to sari no answer i called again still no answer then i heard a loud crash calling her name i started running from room to room i was scared to death i was sure something terrible had happened i ran through every room in the house getting more and more scared i couldnt find her i shouted and shouted but she didnt answer me i was so scared i started to cry then i totally panicked and i ran out of the house and into the pouring rain i ran through the thunder and lightning crying all the way home by the time i got home i was soaked through and through i ran into the kitchen sobbing and crying that id lost sari in the haunted house and there she was sitting at the kitchen table comfortable and dry eating a big slice of chocolate cake a smug smile on her face and now peering into the darkness of the pyramid i knew sari was doing the same thing to me trying to scare me trying to make me look bad or was she as i made my way through the low narrow tunnel keeping the light aimed straight ahead i couldnt help it my anger quickly turned to worry and troubling questions whirred through my mind what if she wasnt playing a mean trick on me what if something bad had happened to her what if she had missed a step and fallen into a hole or had gotten herself trapped in a hidden tunnel or i didnt know what i wasnt thinking clearly my sneakers thudded loudly over the sandy floor as i started to halfwalk halfjog through the winding tunnel sari i called frantically now not caring whether i sounded frightened or not where was she she wasnt that far ahead of me i should at least be able to see the light from her flashlight i thought sari there was no place for her to hide in this narrow space was i following the wrong tunnel no i had been in the same tunnel all along the same tunnel i had watched her disappear in dont say disappear i scolded myself dont even think the word suddenly the narrow tunnel ended a small opening led into a small square room i flashed the light quickly from side to side sari no sign of her the walls were bare the air was warm and stale i moved the flashlight rapidly across the floor looking for saris footprints the floor was harder less sandy here there were no footprints oh i uttered a low cry when my light came to rest on the object against the far wall my heart pounding i eagerly took a few steps closer until i was just a few feet from it it was a mummy case a large stone mummy case at least eight feet long it was rectangular with curved corners the lid was carved i stepped closer and aimed the light yes a human face was carved on the lid the face of a woman it looked like a death mask the kind wed studied in school it stared wideeyed up at the ceiling wow i cried aloud a real mummy case the carved face on the lid must have been brightly painted at one time but the color had faded over the centuries now the face was gray as pale as death staring at the top of the case smooth and perfect i wondered if uncle ben had seen it or if i had made a discovery of my own why is it all by itself in this small room i wondered and what does it hold inside i was working up my courage to run my hand over the smooth stone of the lid when i heard the creaking sound and saw the lid start to raise up oh a hushed cry escaped my lips at first i thought i had imagined it i didnt move a muscle i kept the light trained on the lid the lid lifted a tiny bit more and i heard a hissing sound come from inside the big coffin like air escaping a new coffee can when you first open it uttering another low cry i took a step back the lid raised up another inch i took another step back and dropped the flashlight i picked it up with a trembling hand and shined it back onto the mummy case the lid was now open nearly a foot i sucked in a deep breath of air and held it i wanted to run but my fear was freezing me in place i wanted to scream but i knew i wouldnt be able to make a sound the lid creaked and opened another inch another inch i lowered the flashlight to the opening the light quivering with my hand from the dark depths of the ancient coffin i saw two eyes staring out at me i uttered a silent gasp i froze i felt a cold chill zigzag down my back the lid slowly pushed open another inch the eyes stared out at me cold eyes evil eyes ancient eyes my mouth dropped open and before i even realized it i started to scream scream at the top of my lungs as i screamed unable to turn away unable to run unable to move the lid slid open all the way slowly as if in a dream a dark figure raised itself from the depths of the mummy case and climbed out sari a broad smile widened across her face her eyes glowed gleefully sari that wasnt funny i managed to shout in a highpitched voice that bounced off the stone walls but now she was laughing too hard to hear me loud scornful laughter i was so furious i searched frantically for something to throw at her but there wasnt anything not even a pebble on the floor staring at her my chest still heaving from my fright i really hated her then she had made a total fool of me there i had been screaming like a baby i knew shed never let me live it down never the look on your face she exclaimed when she finally stopped laughing i wish i had a camera i was too angry to reply i just growled at her i pulled the little mummy hand from my back pocket and began rolling it around in my hand i always fiddled with that hand when i was upset it usually helped to calm me but now i felt as if id never calm down i told you id found an empty mummy case yesterday she said brushing the hair back off her face didnt you remember i growled again i felt like a total dork first id fallen for her dads stupid mummy costume and now this silently to myself i vowed to pay her back if it was the last thing i ever did she was still chuckling about her bigdeal joke the look on your face she said again shaking her head rubbing it in you wouldnt like it if i scared you i muttered angrily you couldnt scare me she replied i dont scare so easy hah that was the best comeback i could think of not very clever i know but i was too angry to be clever i was imagining myself picking sari up and tossing her back into the mummy case pulling down the lid and locking it when i heard footsteps approaching in the tunnel glancing over at sari i saw her expression change she heard them too a few seconds later uncle ben burst into the small room i could see immediately even in the dim light that he was really angry i thought i could trust you two he said talking through gritted teeth dad sari started but he cut her off sharply i trusted you not to wander off without telling me do you know how easy it is to get lost in this place lost forever dad sari started again i was just showing gabe this room i discovered yesterday we were going to come right back really there are hundreds of tunnels uncle ben said heatedly ignoring saris explanation maybe thousands many of them have never been explored no one has ever been in this section of the pyramid before we have no idea what dangers there are you two cant just wander off by yourselves do you know how frantic i was when i turned around and you were gone sorry sari and i both said in unison lets go uncle ben said gesturing to the door with his flashlight your pyramid visit is over for today we followed him into the tunnel i felt really bad not only had i fallen for saris stupid joke but id made my favorite uncle really angry sari always gets me into trouble i thought bitterly since we were little kids now she was walking ahead of me arm in arm with her dad telling him something her face close to his ear suddenly they both burst out laughing and turned back to look at me i could feel my face getting hot i knew what shed told him shed told him about hiding in the mummy case and making me scream like a scared baby and now they were both chuckling about what a jerk i was merry christmas to you too i called bitterly and that made them laugh even harder we spent the night back in the hotel in cairo i beat sari in two straight games of scrabble but it didnt make me feel any better she kept complaining that she had only vowels and so the games werent fair finally i put my scrabble set back in my room and we sat and stared at the tv the next morning we had breakfast in the room i ordered pancakes but they didnt taste like any pancakes id ever eaten they were tough and grainy as if they were made of cowhide or something what are we doing today sari asked uncle ben who was still yawning and stretching after two cups of black coffee i have an appointment at the cairo museum he told us glancing at his wristwatch its just a couple of blocks away i thought you two might like to wander around the museum while i have my meeting ooh thrills and chills sariaid sarcastically she slurped up another spoonful of frosted flakes the little frosted flakes box had arabic writing all over it and tony the tiger was saying something in arabic i wanted to save it and take it home to show my friends but i knew sari would make fun of me if i asked her for it so i didnt the museum has an interesting mummy collection gabe uncle ben said to me he tried to pour himself a third cup of coffee but the pot was empty youll like it unless they climb out of their cases sari said lame really lame i stuck my tongue out at her she tossed a wet frosted flake across the table at me when are my mom and dad getting back i asked uncle ben i suddenly realized i missed them he started to answer but the phone rang he walked into the bedroom and picked it up it was an oldfashioned black telephone with a dial instead of buttons as he talked his face filled with concern change of plans he said a few seconds later hanging up the receiver and coming back into the living room whats the matter daddy sari asked shoving her cereal bowl away its very strange he replied scratching the back of his head two of my workers came down sick last night some kind of mysterious illness his expression became thoughtful worried they took them to a hospital here in cairo he started to gather up his wallet and some other belongings i think id better get over there right away he said but what about gabe and me sari asked glancing at me ill only be gone an hour or so her dad replied stay here in the room okay in the room sari cried making it sound like a punishment well okay you can go down to the lobby if you want but dont leave the hotel a few minutes later he pulled on his tan safari jacket checked one last time to make sure he had his wallet and keys and hurried out the door sari and i stared at each other glumly what do you want to do i asked poking the cold uneaten pancakes on my plate with a fork sari shrugged is it hot in here i nodded yeah its about a hundred and twenty we have to get out of here she said standing up and stretching you mean go down to the lobby i asked still poking the pancakes pulling them into pieces with the fork no i mean get out of here she replied she walked over to the mirror in the entranceway and began brushing her straight black hair but uncle ben said i started we wont go far she said and then quickly added if youre afraid i made a face at her i dont think she saw me she was busy admiring herself in the mirror okay i told her we could go to the museum your dad said it was just a block away i was determined not to be the wimp anymore if she wanted to disobey her dad and go out fine with me from now on i decided ill be the macho guy no repeats of yesterday ever again the museum she made a face well okay she said turning to look at me were twelve after all its not like were babies we can go out if we want yes we can i said ill write uncle ben a note and tell him where were going in case he gets back before we do i went over to the desk and picked up a pen and a small pad of paper if youre afraid gabey we can just walk around the block she said in a teasing voice staring at me waiting to see how id react no way i said were going to the museum unless youre afraid no way she said imitating me and dont call me gabey i added gabey gabey gabey she muttered just to be annoying i wrote the note to uncle ben then we took the elevator down to the lobby we asked a young woman behind the desk where the cairo museum was she said to turn right outside the hotel and walk two blocks sari hesitated as we stepped out into the bright sunshine you sure youre up for this what could go wrong i replied lets go this way i said shielding my eyes from the bright sunlight with my hand its so hot sari complained the street was crowded and noisy i couldnt hear anything over the honking of car horns drivers here lean on their horns the minute they start up their cars and they dont stop honking till they arrive at their destinations sari and i stayed close together making our way through the crush of people on the sidewalk all kinds of people passed by there were men in americanstyle business suits walking alongside men who appeared to be wearing loosefitting white pajamas we saw women who would look right at home on any street in america wearing colorful leggings and stylish skirts and slacks women in jeans followed by women dressed in long flowing black dresses their faces covered by heavy black veils this sure doesnt look like back home i exclaimed shouting over the blare of car horns i was so fascinated by all the interestinglooking people crowding the narrow sidewalk that i forgot to look at the buildings before i knew it we were standing in front of the museum a tall stone structure looming above the street behind steeply sloping steps we climbed the steps and entered the revolving door of the museum wow its so quiet in here i exclaimed whispering it was nice to get away from the honking horns the crowded sidewalks and shouting people why do you think they honk their horns so much sari asked holding her ears just a custom i guess i replied we stopped and looked around we were standing in the center of an enormous open lobby tall marble stairways rose up on the far left and far right twin white columns framed a wide doorway that led straight back an enormous mural across the wall to the right showed an aerial view of the pyramids and the nile we stood in the middle of the floor admiring the mural for a while then we made our way to the back wall and asked a woman at the information desk for the mummy room she flashed us a nice smile and told us in perfect english to take the stairs to the right our sneakers thudded loudly over the shiny marble floor the stairway seemed to go up forever this is like mountain climbing i complained halfway up race you to the top sari said grinning and took off before i had a chance to reply of course she beat me by about ten steps i waited for her to call me slowpoke or snail face or something but she had already turned to see what lay ahead of us a dark highceilinged room seemed to stretch on forever a glass case stood centered in the entryway inside was a detailed construction of wood and clay i went up close to take a good look the construction showed thousands of workers dragging enormous blocks of limestone across the sand toward a partially built pyramid in the room behind the display i could see huge stone statues large mummy cases displays of glass and pottery and case after case of artifacts and relics i think this is the place i exclaimed happily rushing over to the first display case ooh whats that some kind of giant dog sari asked pointing to an enormous statue against the wall the creature appeared to have a fierce dogs head and a lions body its eyes stared straight ahead and it seemed ready to pounce on anyone who came near it they put creatures like that in front of tombs i told sari you know to protect the place scare away grave robbers like guard dogs sari said stepping up close to the ancient sculpture hey theres a mummy in this case i exclaimed leaning over an ancient stone coffin look still staring back at the enormous sculpture sari walked up beside me yep its a mummy okay she said unimpressed i guess shes seen a lot more of them than me its so small i said staring at the yellowed linen wrapped so tightly around the skinny head and body our ancestors were shrimps sari replied think it was a man or a woman i glanced at the plaque on the side of the coffin it says its a man guess they didnt work out in those days she said and laughed at her own remark they did a great wrapping job i said examining the carefully wrapped fingers on the hands which were crossed over the mummys chest i was a mummy the halloween before last and my costume completely unraveled after ten minutes sari tsktsked do you know how they made mummies i asked moving around to view it from the other side do you know the first thing they did they removed the brain yuck stop she said sticking out her tongue and making a disgusted face dont you know about this i asked delighted that i had some truly gruesome information that she didnt please enough she said holding up one hand as if to fend me off no this is interesting i insisted the brain had to come out first they had this special tool it was like a long skinny hook theyd push it up the corpses nose until it reached the brain and then wiggled it back and forth back and forth until the brain became mush stop sari pleaded covering her ears then they took a long spoon i continued gleefully and scooped the brain out a little at a time i made a scooping motion with my hand scoop scoop they scooped the brain out through the nose or sometimes they popped off an eyeball and scooped the brain out through the eyeball socket gabe i mean it sari cried she really looked like she was about to hurl she was green i loved it i never knew that sari had a squeamish bone in her body but i was really making her sick outstanding i thought i would definitely have to remember this technique its all true i told her unable to hold back a wide grin just shut up she muttered of course sometimes they didnt pull the brain out the nose sometimes they just sliced off the head then they drained the brains out through the neck and put the head back on the body they just bandaged it back on i guess gabe id been staring at her the whole time checking out her reaction she was looking sicker and sicker she was breathing real heavy her chest was sort of heaving i really thought she was going to lose her breakfast if she did id never let her forget it thats really gross she said her voice sounded funny like it was coming from underwater or something but its true i said didnt your dad ever tell you about how they made mummies she shook her head he knows i dont like and you know what they did with the guts i asked enjoying the startled look on her face they put them in jars and i suddenly realized that saris startled look wasnt for me she was actually staring over my shoulder huh i turned around and saw why she suddenly looked so surprised a man had entered the room and was standing just in front of the first display case it took me a few seconds to recognize him it was ahmed the strange silent egyptian with the black ponytail who had greeted us in such an unfriendly manner down inside the pyramid he was dressed the same in loosefitting white trousers and shirt with a scarlet bandanna around his neck and his expression was just as unfriendly angry even sari and i both backed away from the mummy case and ahmed his eyes darting from one of us to the other took a step toward us gabe hes coming after us sari whispered she grabbed my arm her hand was cold as ice lets get out of here she cried i hesitated shouldnt we stop and say hello to him first but something about the stern determined look on ahmeds face told me that sari was right we turned and began walking really fast away from him into the vast room sari a few steps ahead of me i turned and saw that ahmed was jogging after us he shouted something to us his voice angry threatening i couldnt make out the words run sari cried and now we were both running at full speed our sneakers drumming loudly over the polished marble floor we scooted around an enormous glass display case containing three upright mummy cases then we ran straight down the wide aisle between sculptures and shelves of ancient pottery and pyramid relics behind us i could hear ahmed shouting furiously come back come back he sounded really angry his shoes clacked against the floor as he ran the sound echoing in the vast empty museum chamber hes gaining on us i called to sari who was still a few steps ahead theres got to be a way out of here she answered breathlessly but i immediately saw that there wasnt we were nearly to the back wall we passed a gigantic sphinx then stopped there was nowhere to go no doorway no exit a solid granite wall we both turned and saw ahmeds eyes grow wide with triumph he had us cornered ahmed stopped a few feet in front of us he was panting like a dog gasping for air and holding his side he glared at us angrily sari glanced at me she looked pale really frightened we both had our backs pressed against the wall i swallowed hard my throat felt tight and dry what was he going to do to us why did you run ahmed finally managed to say still holding his side as if he had a cramp why we didnt reply we both stared back at him waiting to see what he was about to do i came with a message from your father he told sari breathing hard he raised the red bandanna from his neck and wiped his perspiring forehead with it why did you run a message sari stammered yes ahmed said you know me we met again yesterday i dont understand why you ran im sorry sari said quickly glancing guiltily at me we werent thinking clearly i said sari frightened me and i followed her gabe was telling me all this frightening stuff she said jabbing me hard in the side with her elbow it was his fault he scared me with all this mummy stuff so when i saw you i wasnt thinking clearly and both of us were babbling we both felt so relieved that he wasnt chasing us and so embarrassed that we had run away from him your father sent me to get you ahmed said his dark eyes trained on me i didnt think id have to chase you through the whole museum sorry sari and i said in unison i felt like a complete jerk im sure sari did too daddy came back to the hotel and saw gabes note sari asked straightening her hair with her hand as she moved away from the wall yes ahmed nodded he got back from the hospital awfully fast sari said glancing at her wristwatch yes ahmed replied again come i will take you back to the hotel he is waiting for you there we followed him in silence sari and i walking side by side a few steps behind him as we made our way down the long stairway we glanced sheepishly at each other we were both feeling really foolish for running away like that a short while later we were back on the crowded noisy sidewalk an unending stream of cars honking past all moving in starts and stops drivers hanging out of car windows shouting and shaking their fists ahmed checked to make sure we were with him then turned right and began leading the way through the crowd the sun was high over the buildings now the air was hot and humid hey wait i called ahmed turned back but kept walking were going the wrong way i called to him shouting over the cries of a street peddler behind a cart of vegetables the hotel is back that way i pointed ahmed shook his head my car is just up there were driving back to the hotel sari asked her voice revealing her surprise its only two blocks i said to ahmed sari and i could walk back by ourselves if you want you really dont have to take us it is no trouble ahmed replied and he placed his hands firmly one on my shoulder one on saris and continued to guide us to his car we crossed the street and continued walking the sidewalk grew even more crowded a man swinging a leather briefcase accidentally clipped my shoulder with it i cried out in pain sari laughed you have a great sense of humor i muttered sarcastically i know she replied if wed walked we would have been at the hotel already i said ahmed must have overheard because he said the cars in the next block we made our way quickly through the crowds a short while later ahmed stopped at a small fourdoor stationwagon it was covered with dust and the fender on the drivers side was crunched he pulled open the back door and sari and i piled in ow i complained the leather seats were burning hot the wheel is hot too ahmed said climbing in and fastening his seat belt he touched the steering wheel a few times with both hands trying to get used to the heat they should invent a car that stays cool inside when it is parked the engine started on the second try and he pulled away from the curb and into the line of traffic immediately he began honking the horn at the car in front of us we moved slowly stopping every few seconds through the narrow street i wonder why daddy didnt come to get us sari said to me her eyes on the crowds passing by the dusty car window he said he would wait for you at the hotel ahmed replied from the front seat he made a sudden sharp turn onto a wider avenue and began to pick up speed it took me a long while to realize that we were heading in the wrong direction away from our hotel uh ahmed i think the hotel is back that way i said pointing toward the back window i believe you are mistaken he replied softly staring straight ahead through the windshield we will be there shortly no really i insisted one thing about me is i have a really good sense of direction mom and dad always say they dont need a map when im around i almost always know when im heading the wrong way sari turned to glance at me an expression of concern beginning to tighten her features settle back and enjoy the ride ahmed said staring at me through the rearview mirror have you fastened your seat belts better do it right now he had a smile on his face but his voice was cold his words sounded like a threat ahmed weve gone too far i insisted starting to feel really afraid outside the window the buildings were lower more rundown we seemed to be heading away from the downtown area just settle back he replied with growing impatience i know where im going sari and i exchanged glances she looked as worried as i did we both realized that ahmed was lying to us he wasnt taking us to the hotel he was taking us out of town we were being kidnapped seeing ahmeds eyes on me in the rearview mirror i fiddled with the seat belt pretending to fasten it as i did this i leaned close to sari and whispered in her ear next time he stops at first she didnt get my meaning but then i saw that she understood we both sat tensely eyes on the door handles waiting in silence your father is a very smart man ahmed said staring at sari in the mirror i know sari replied in a tiny voice the traffic slowed then stopped now i screamed we both grabbed for the door handles i pushed my door open and flung myself out of the car horns were honking in front of me and behind me i could hear ahmeds surprised shout leaving the car door open i turned to see that sari had made it to the street too she turned to me as she slammed her door shut her eyes wide with fear without a word we started to run the car horns seemed to grow louder as we headed into a narrow side street we were running side by side following the narrow brick street as it curved between two rows of tall white stucco buildings i feel like a rat in a maze i thought the street grew even narrower then it emptied into a wide circle filled with a small market of fruit and vegetable stands is he following us sari cried a few steps behind me now i turned back and searched for him my eyes darting through the small crowd attending the market i saw several people in flowing white robes two women entered the market dressed in black carrying a basket loaded high with bananas a boy on a bicycle swerved to keep from running straight into them i dont see him i called back to sari but we kept running just to make sure id never been so scared in my life please please i begged silently dont let him be following us dont let him catch us turning a corner we found ourselves on a wide busy avenue a truck bounced past pulling a trailer filled with horses the sidewalk was crowded with shoppers and businesspeople sari and i pushed our way through them trying to lose ourselves in the crowd finally we came to a stop near the entrance of what appeared to be a large department store breathing hard i rested my hands on my knees leaned forward and tried to catch my breath weve lost him sari said staring back in the direction from which wed come yeah were okay i said happily i smiled at her but she didnt return the smile her face was filled with fear her eyes continued to stare into the crowd one hand tugged nervously at a strand of her hair were okay i repeated we got away theres only one problem she said quietly her eyes still on the crowd bustling toward us on the sidewalk huh problem now were lost she replied finally turning to face me were lost gabe we dont know where we are i suddenly had a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach i started to utter a frightened cry but i forced myself to hold it in i forced myself to pretend i wasnt afraid sari had always been the brave one the winner the champ and i was always the wimp but now i could see that she was really scared this was my chance to be the cool one my chance to show her who was really the champ no problem i told her gazing up at the tall glass and concrete buildings well just ask somebody to direct us to the hotel but no one speaks english she cried sounding as if she were about to cry uh no problem i said a little less cheerily im sure someone were lost she repeated miserably shaking her head totally lost and then i saw the answer to our problem parked at the curb it was a taxi an empty taxi come on i said tugging her arm i pulled her to the taxi the driver a thin young man with a wide black mustache and stringy black hair falling out of a small gray cap turned around in surprise as sari and i climbed into the back seat the cairo center hotel i said glancing reassuringly at sari the driver stared back at me blankly as if he didnt understand please take us to the cairo center hotel i repeated slowly and clearly and then he tossed back his head opened his mouth and started to laugh the driver laughed till tears formed in the corners of his eyes sari grabbed my arm hes working for ahmed she whispered squeezing my wrist weve walked right into a trap huh i felt a stab of fear in my chest i didnt think she was right she couldnt be right but i didnt know what else to think i grabbed the door handle and started to leap out of the taxi but the driver raised a hand signaling for me to stop gabe go sari pushed me hard from behind cairo center hotel the driver asked suddenly wiping the tears from his eyes with a finger then he pointed through the windshield cairo center hotel sari and i both followed his finger there was the hotel right across the street he started to laugh again shaking his head thanks i shouted and climbed out sari scrambled out behind me a wide relieved smile on her face i dont think its that funny i told her the cab driver has a strange sense of humor i turned back the driver was still staring at us a broad smile on his face come on she urged tugging at my arm we have to tell daddy about ahmed but to our surprise our hotel room was empty my note was still on the table where i had left it nothing had been moved or touched he hasnt been back here sari said picking up my note and crumpling it into a ball in her hand ahmed lied about everything i flopped down on the couch with a loud sigh i wonder whats going on i said unhappily i just dont get it sari and i both screamed as the door to the room flew open daddy sari cried running to hug him i was sure glad it was uncle ben and not ahmed daddy the strangest thing sari started uncle ben had his arm around her shoulder as he led her across the room toward the couch i could see that he had a really dazed expression on his face yes its strange he muttered shaking his head both of my workers huh are they okay sari asked no not really uncle ben replied dropping onto the arm of the armchair staring hard but not really focusing on me theyre both in a state of shock i guess thats how to describe it they were in an accident in the pyramid i asked uncle ben scratched the bald spot at the back of his head i dont really know they cant talk theyre both speechless i think something or someone frightened them scared them speechless the doctors are completely confused they said that daddy ahmed tried to kidnap us sari interrupted squeezing his hand what ahmed he narrowed his eyes his forehead wrinkling up in confusion what do you mean ahmed the guy at the pyramid the one who wears the white suits with the red bandanna and always carries the clipboard sari explained he told us you sent him to get us i said he came to the museum museum uncle ben climbed to his feet what were you doing at the museum i thought i told you we had to get out of here sari said putting a hand on her dads shoulder trying to calm him gabe wanted to see mummies so we went to the museum but ahmed came and took us to his car he said he was taking us to you at the hotel but he was driving the wrong way i continued the story so we jumped out and ran away ahmed uncle ben kept repeating the name as if he just couldnt believe it he came to me with excellent credentials and references he said hes a cryptographer he studies ancient egyptian hes mainly interested in the wall writings and symbols we uncover so why did he come for us i asked where was he going to take us sari asked i dont know uncle ben said but i certainly intend to find out he hugged sari what a mystery he continued youre both okay yeah were okay i replied ive got to get to the pyramid he said letting go of sari and walking to the window i gave my workers the day off but ive got to get to the bottom of this clouds rolled over the sun the room suddenly grew darker ill order up some room service for you uncle ben said a thoughtful expression on his face will you two be okay here till i get back tonight no sari cried you cant leave us here why cant we come with you i asked yes were coming with you sari exclaimed before uncle ben had a chance to reply he shook his head too dangerous he said his eyes narrowing as he glanced first at me then at sari until i can find out what happened to my two workers in there but daddy what if ahmed comes back sari cried sounding really frightened what if he comes here uncle ben scowled ahmed he muttered ahmed you cant leave us here sari repeated uncle ben stared out the window at the darkening sky i guess youre right he said finally i guess i have to take you with me yes sari and i both cried relieved but you have to promise to stick close uncle ben said sternly pointing a finger at sari i mean it no wandering off no more practical jokes i realized i was seeing a whole new side of my uncle even though he was a wellknown scientist he had always been the jolly practical joker of the family but now he was worried seriously worried no more jokes until the frightening mystery was cleared up we had sandwiches downstairs in the hotel restaurant then drove through the desert to the pyramid heavy clouds rolled across the sun as we drove casting shadows over the sand coloring the desert darkly in shimmering shades of blue and gray before long the enormous pyramid loomed on the horizon appearing to grow larger as we approached on the nearly empty highway i remembered the first time i had seen it just a few days before such an amazing sight but now watching it through the car windshield i felt only dread uncle ben parked the car near the low entrance he had discovered behind the pyramid as we stepped out the wind whipped at the ground tossing the sand up whirling it around our legs uncle ben raised a hand to stop us at the tunnel entrance here he said he reached into his supply pack and pulled out equipment for sari and me clip this on he handed each of us a beeper just push the button and it will beep me he said helping me clip mine to the belt on my jeans its like a homing device if you push the button it sends electronic signals to the unit im wearing then i can track you down by following the sound levels of course i dont expect you to use it because i expect you to stay close to me he handed us flashlights watch your step he instructed keep the light down at your feet a few yards ahead of you on the floor we know daddy sari said weve done this before remember just follow instructions he said sharply and turned into the darkness of the pyramid opening i stopped at the entrance and pulled out my little mummy hand just to make sure i had it what are you doing with that sari asked making a face my good luck charm i said slipping it back into my pocket she groaned and gave me a playful shove into the pyramid entrance a few minutes later we were once again making our way carefully down the long rope ladder and into the first narrow tunnel uncle ben led the way the wide circle of light from his flashlight sweeping back and forth across the tunnel ahead of him sari was a few steps behind him and i walked a few steps behind her the tunnel seemed narrower and lower this time i guess it was just my mood gripping the flashlight tightly keeping the light aimed down i dipped my head to keep from hitting the low curved ceiling the tunnel bent to the left then sloped downhill where it split into two paths we followed the one to the right the only sound was that of our shoes scraping against the sandy dry floor uncle ben coughed sari said something i couldnt hear what it was i had stopped to shine my light on a bunch of spiders on the ceiling and the two of them had walked several yards ahead of me following my light as it moved over the floor i saw that my sneaker had come untied once again oh man not again i stooped to tie it setting the flashlight on the ground beside me hey wait up i called but they had started to argue about something and i dont think they heard me i could hear their voices echoing loudly down the long twisting tunnel but i couldnt make out their words i hurriedly doubleknotted the shoe lace grabbed up the flashlight and climbed to my feet hey wait up i shouted anxiously where had they gone i realized that i couldnt hear their voices anymore this cant be happening to me again i thought hey i shouted cupping my hands over my mouth my voice echoed down the tunnel but no voices called back wait up typical i thought they were so involved in their argument they forgot all about me i realized that i was more angry than frightened uncle ben had made such a big deal about us sticking close together and then he walked off and left me alone in the tunnel hey where are you i shouted no reply beaming the light ahead of me on the floor i ducked my head and began jogging following the tunnel as it curved sharply to the right the floor began to slope upwards the air became hot and musty smelling i found myself gasping for breath uncle ben i called sari they must be around the next curve in the tunnel i told myself it hadnt taken me that long to tie my shoelace they couldnt have gotten that far ahead hearing a sound i stopped and listened silence now was i starting to hear things i had a sudden flash was this another mean practical joke were sari and uncle ben hiding waiting to see what id do was this another lame trick of theirs to frighten me it could be uncle ben i knew could never resist a practical joke he had laughed like a hyena when sari told him how shed hid in the mummy case and scared about ten years off my life were they both hiding in mummy cases now just waiting for me to stumble by my heart thumped in my chest despite the heat of the ancient tunnel i felt cold all over no i decided this isnt a practical joke uncle ben was too serious today too worried about his stricken workers too worried about what wed told him about ahmed he wasnt in any mood for practical jokes i began making my way through the tunnel again as i jogged my hand brushed against the beeper at my waist should i push it no i decided that would only give sari a good laugh shed be eager to tell everyone how id started beeping for help after being in the pyramid for two minutes i turned the corner the tunnel walls seemed to close in on me as the tunnel narrowed sari uncle ben no echo maybe the tunnel was too narrow for an echo the floor grew harder less sandy in the dim yellow light i could see that the granite walls were lined with jagged cracks they looked like dark lightning bolts coming down from the ceiling hey where are you guys i shouted i stopped when the tunnel branched in two directions i suddenly realized how scared i was where had they disappeared to they had to have realized by now that i wasnt with them i stared at the two openings shining my light first into one tunnel then the other which one had they entered which one my heart pounding i ran into the tunnel on the left and shouted their names no reply i backed out quickly my light darting wildly over the floor and stepped into the tunnel to the right this tunnel was wider and higher it curved gently to the right a maze of tunnels thats how uncle ben had described the pyramid maybe thousands of tunnels he had told me thousands keep moving i urged myself keep moving gabe theyre right up ahead theyve got to be i took a few steps and then called out to them i heard something voices i stopped it was so quiet now so quiet i could hear my heart pounding in my chest the sound again i listened hard holding my breath it was a chattering sound a soft cluttering not a human voice an insect maybe or a rat uncle ben sari silence i took a few more steps into the tunnel then a few more i decided id better forget my pride and beep them so what if sari teased me about it i was too frightened to care if i beeped them theyd be right there to get me in a few seconds but as i reached to my waist for the beeper i was startled by a loud noise the insect chittering became a soft cracking sound i stopped to listen the fear rising up to my throat the soft cracking grew louder it sounded like someone breaking saltines in two only louder louder louder right under my feet i turned my eyes to the floor i shined the light at my shoes it took me so long to realize what was happening the ancient tunnel floor was cracking apart beneath me the cracking grew louder seemed to come from all directions to surround me by the time i realized what was happening it was too late i felt as if i were being pulled down sucked down by a powerful force the floor crumbled away beneath me and i was falling falling down down down an endless black hole i opened my mouth to scream but no sound came out my hands flew up and grabbed nothing i closed my eyes and fell down down into the swirling blackness i heard the flashlight clang against the floor then i hit hard i landed on my side pain shot through my body and i saw red a flash of bright red that grew brighter and brighter until i had to close my eyes i think the force of the blow knocked me out for a short while when i opened my eyes everything was a grayyellow blur my side ached my right elbow throbbed with pain i tried the elbow it seemed to move okay i sat up the haze slowly began to lift like a curtain slowly rising where was i a sour smell invaded my nostrils the smell of decay of ancient dust of death the flashlight had landed beside me on the concrete floor i followed its beam of light toward the wall and gasped the light stopped on a hand a human hand or was it the hand was attached to an arm the arm hung stiffly from an erect body my hand trembling i grabbed up the flashlight and tried to steady the light on the figure it was a mummy i realized standing on its feet near the far wall eyeless mouthless the bandaged face seemed to stare back at me tense and ready as if waiting for me to make the first move a mummy the light darted over its featureless face i couldnt steady my hand my whole body was shaking frozen in place not able to move off the hard floor i gaped at the frightening figure i suddenly realized i was panting loudly trying to calm myself i sucked in a deep breath of the putrid air and held it the mummy stared blindly back at me it stood stiffly its arms hanging at its sides why is it standing there like that i wondered taking another deep breath the ancient egyptians didnt leave their mummies standing at attention realizing that it wasnt moving forward to attack me i began to feel a little calmer easy gabe easy i said aloud trying to steady the flashlight i gripped so tightly in my hand i coughed the air was so foul so old groaning from the pain in my side i climbed to my feet and began rapidly shining the light back and forth beyond the silent faceless mummy i was in an enormous highceilinged chamber much bigger than the chamber uncle bens workers had been digging in and much more cluttered wow i uttered a low cry as the pale light of the flashlight revealed an amazing scene dark bandaged figures hovered all around me the vast chamber was crammed with mummies in the unsteady light their shadows seemed to reach toward me shuddering i took a step back i moved the light slowly over the strange hideous scene the light burned through the shadows revealing bandaged arms torsos legs covered faces there were so many of them there were mummies leaning against the wall mummies lying on stone slabs arms crossed over their chests mummies leaning at odd angles crouched low or standing tall their arms straight out in front of them like frankenstein monsters against one wall stood a row of mummy cases their lids propped open i turned following the arc of my light i realized that my fall had dropped me into the center of the room behind me i could make out an amazing array of equipment strange pronglike tools i had never seen before tall stacks of cloth gigantic clay pots and jars easy gabe easy whoa breathe slowly i took a few reluctant steps closer trying to hold the flashlight steady a few more steps i walked up to one of the tall stacks of cloth linen most likely the material used for making mummies gathering my courage i examined some of the tools not touching anything just staring at them in the wavering light of the flashlight mummymaking tools ancient mummymaking tools i stepped away turned back toward the crowd of unmoving figures my light traveled across the room and came to rest on a dark square area on the floor curious i moved closer stepping around twin mummies lying on their backs their arms crossed over their chests whoa easy gabe my sneakers scraped noisily along the floor as i made my way hesitantly across the vast chamber the dark square on the floor was nearly the size of a swimming pool i bent down at its edge to examine it more closely the surface was soft and sticky like tar was this an ancient tar pit was this tar used in the making of the mummies that hovered so menacingly around the room i had a sudden chill that froze me to the spot how could this tar pit be soft after four thousand years why was everything in this chamber the tools the mummies the linen preserved so well and why were these mummies at least two dozen of them left out like this scattered about the room in such strange positions i realized that i had made an incredible discovery here by falling through the floor i had found a hidden chamber a chamber where mummies had been made i had found all of the tools and all of the materials used to make mummies four thousand years ago once again the sour smell invaded my nose i held my breath to keep myself from gagging it was the smell of fourthousandyearold bodies i realized a smell that had been bottled up in this ancient hidden chamber until now staring at the twisted shadowy figures gazing back at me in faceless horror i reached for the beeper uncle ben you must come quickly i thought i dont want to be alone down here any longer you must come here now i pulled the beeper off my belt and brought it up close to the light all i had to do i realized was push the button and uncle ben and sari would come running gripping the small square tightly in my hand i moved my hand to the button and cried out in alarm the beeper was ruined wrecked smashed the button wouldnt even push i must have landed on it when i fell it was useless i was all alone down here alone with the ancient mummies staring facelessly silently at me through the deep dark shadows all alone i stared in horror at the worthless beeper the flashlight trembled in my hand suddenly everything seemed to move in on me the walls the ceiling the darkness the mummies huh i stumbled back a step then another i realized i was gripping the flashlight so tightly my hand hurt the light played over the faceless figures they werent moving of course they werent moving i took another step back the sour odor seemed to grow stronger thicker i held my breath but the smell was in my nostrils in my mouth i could taste it taste the decay taste the fourthousandyearold aroma of death i tossed the worthless beeper on the floor and took another step back keeping my eyes on the hovering mummies what was i going to do the smell was making me sick i had to get out of there had to call uncle ben another step back help i tried to shout but my voice sounded weak muffled by the heavy foul air help can anybody hear me a little louder tucking the flashlight under my arm i cupped my hands around my mouth to form a megaphone can anybody hear me i screamed i listened desperate for a reply silence where were sari and uncle ben why couldnt they hear me why werent they looking for me help somebody please help i screamed as loud as i could tilting my head up to the hole in the ceiling the hole i had fallen through cant anybody hear me i shrieked i could feel the panic grip my chest freeze my legs the panic swept over me wave after paralyzing wave help me somebody please i took another step back and something crunched under my sneaker i uttered a highpitched yelp and stumbled forward whatever it was slithered away i exhaled loudly a long sigh of relief and then i felt something brush against my ankle i cried out and the flashlight dropped from under my arm it clattered noisily to the floor the light went out again something scraped silently against me something hard i heard soft scrabbling sounds down on the floor something snapped at my ankle i kicked hard but hit only air ohh help there were creatures down there a lot of them but what were they again something slapped at my ankle and i kicked wildly frantically i bent down grabbing for the flashlight in the darkness and touched something hard and warm ohh no i jerked my hand up with a startled cry in the darkness groping for the flashlight i had the feeling that the entire floor had come to life the floor was moving in waves rolling and tossing seething beneath me finally i found the flashlight i grabbed it up in my trembling hand climbed to my feet and struggled to turn it back on as i stepped backward something slid against my leg it felt hard and prickly i heard clicking sounds snapping creatures bumping into each other panting loudly my chest heaving my entire body gripped with terror i jumped up tried to dance away as i fiddled with the flashlight something crunched loudly beneath my sneaker i danced away hopping over something that scuttled through my legs finally the light flickered on my heart thudding i lowered the yellow beam of light to the floor and saw the scrabbling snapping creatures scorpions i had stumbled into a disgusting nest of them ohh help i didnt recognize my tiny frightened voice as i cried out i didnt even realize i had cried out the light darted over the slithering creatures their tails raised as if ready to attack their claws snapping silently as they moved crawling over each other slithering past my ankles somebody help i leapt backwards as a pair of claws grabbed at the leg of my jeans into another of the creatures whose tail snapped against the back of my sneaker struggling to escape from the poisonous creatures i tripped no please no i couldnt save myself i started to fall my hands shot out but there was nothing to grab on to i was going to plunge right into the middle of them nooooo i uttered a frantic cry as i toppled forward and felt two hands grab me by the shoulders from behind a mummy i thought my entire body convulsed with fear the scorpions snapped and scrabbled at my feet the strong hands gripped my shoulders pulled me hard the ancient bandaged hands i couldnt breathe i couldnt think finally i managed to spin around sari i cried she gave me one more tug we both stumbled backwards claws snapping up at us sari how we moved together now making our way toward the center of the vast chamber safe safe from the disgusting nest of snapping scorpions saved your life she whispered yuck those are gross tell me about it i said weakly i could still feel the hideous creatures sliding along my ankles still feel them slithering between my legs crunching under my sneakers i dont think ill ever forget that crunching sound what are you doing down here sari cried impatiently as if scolding a child daddy and i have been looking everywhere for you i pulled her even farther from the scorpions into the center of the chamber how did you get down here i cried struggling to calm my breathing struggling to stop the pounding in my chest she pointed with her flashlight to a tunnel in the corner that i hadnt seen i was searching for you daddy and i got separated do you believe it he stopped to talk to a worker and i didnt realize it by the time i turned back he was gone then i saw the light moving around in here i thought it was daddy you got lost too i asked wiping beads of cold sweat off my forehead with the back of my hand im not lost youre lost she insisted how could you do that gabe daddy and i were totally freaked why didnt you wait up for me i demanded angrily i called to you you just disappeared we didnt hear you she replied shaking her head i was really glad to see her but i hated the way she was looking at me like i was some kind of hopeless idiot i guess we got involved in our argument we thought you were right behind us then when we turned around you were gone she sighed and shook her head what a day what a day i cried shrilly what a day gabe why did you do that she demanded you know we were supposed to stay close together hey it wasnt my fault i insisted angrily daddy is so mad sari said shining her light in my face i raised my arm to shield my eyes cut it out i snapped he wont be mad when he sees what ive discovered look i shined my light onto a mummy crouching near the tar pit then moved it to another mummy this one lying down then to the row of mummy cases against the wall wow sari mouthed the word silently her eyes grew wide with surprise yeah wow i said starting to feel a little more like normal the chamber is filled with mummies and there are all kinds of tools and cloth and everything you need to make a mummy its all in perfect shape like it hasnt been touched in thousands of years i couldnt hide my excitement and i discovered it all i added this must be where they prepared the mummies for burial sari said her eyes darting from mummy to mummy but why are some of them standing up like that i shrugged beats me she walked over to admire the stacks of neatly folded linen wow this is amazing gabe outstanding i agreed and if i hadnt stopped to tie my sneaker i never would have discovered it youre going to be famous sari said a smile spreading across her face thanks to me saving your life sari i started but she had moved across the room and was admiring one of the upright mummies close up wait till daddy sees all this she said suddenly sounding as excited as me we have to call him i said eagerly i glanced back at the scorpion nest and felt a chill of fear tighten the back of my neck people were so tiny back then she said holding her flashlight up close to the mummys covered face look im taller than this one sari use your beeper i said impatiently walking over to her yuck there are bugs crawling in this ones face she said stepping back and lowering the light she made a disgusted face gross come on use your beeper call uncle ben i said i reached for the beeper at her waist but she pulled away okay okay why didnt you use yours she eyed me suspiciously you forgot about it didnt gabe she accused no way i replied sharply mine broke when i fell into this place she made a face and pulled the beeper off her belt loop i shined my light on it as she pushed the button she pressed it twice just to make sure then clipped it back onto her jeans we stood with our arms crossed waiting for uncle ben to follow the radio signals and find us it shouldnt take him long sari said her eyes on the tunnel in the corner he wasnt far behind me sure enough a few seconds later we heard the sounds of someone approaching in the tunnel uncle ben i called excitedly look what ive found sari and i both started to run to the tunnel our lights zigzagging over the low entrance daddy you wont believe sari started she stopped when the stooped figure leaned out of the darkness and straightened up we both gaped in horror our flashlights making his mustached face glow eerily its ahmed sari cried grabbing my arm i swallowed hard sari and i stared at each other i saw her features tighten in fear ahmed he had tried to kidnap us and now he had us all alone down here he stepped forward a naming torch held high in one hand his black hair glowed in the flickering flames his eyes narrowed at us in menace ahmed what are you doing here sari called grasping my arm so hard i winced what are you doing here he asked softly his voice as cold as his eyes holding the torch in front of him he stepped into the chamber his eyes went around the room as if inspecting it making sure that nothing had been moved my dad will be here in a second sari warned him i just beeped him i tried to warn your father ahmed said staring hard at sari the flickering orange light from the torch made him grow bright then fade into shadow warn him sari asked about the curse ahmed said without emotion uncle ben mentioned some kind of curse to me i said glancing nervously at sari i dont think he takes that kind of thing seriously he should ahmed replied screaming the words his eyes glowing with anger in the torch light sari and i stared back at him in silence where is uncle ben i wondered whats keeping him hurry i urged silently please hurry the curse must be carried out ahmed said softly again almost sadly i have no choice you have violated the priestesss chamber priestess i stammered sari was still squeezing my arm i tugged it away she crossed her arms resolutely over her chest this chamber belongs to the priestess khala ahmed said lowering the torch this is the sacred preparation chamber of the priestess khala and you have violated it well we didnt know sari snapped i really dont see whats the big deal ahmed shes right i said quickly we didnt touch anything we didnt move anything i dont think shut up you fools ahmed screamed he swung the torch angrily as if trying to hit us ahmed my dad will be here any second sari repeated her voice trembling we both turned our eyes to the tunnel it was dark and silent no sign of uncle ben your father is a smart man ahmed said it is too bad he wasnt smart enough to heed my warnings warnings sari asked i realized she was stalling for time trying to keep ahmed talking until uncle ben arrived i frightened the two workers ahmed confessed to sari i frightened them to show your father that the curse was alive that i was prepared to carry out khalas wishes how did you frighten them sari demanded he smiled i gave them a little demonstration i showed them what it might feel like to be boiled alive he turned his eyes to the tar pit they didnt like it he added quietly but ahmed sari started he cut her off your father should have known better than to return here he should have believed me he should have believed in the priestesss curse the priestess cursed all who would violate her chamber but come on you dont really believe i started he raised the torch menacingly it was decreed by khala more than four thousand years ago that this sacred chamber would not be violated he cried gesturing with the torch leaving a trail of orange light against the darkness since that time from generation to generation descendants of khala have made sure that the priestesss command was obeyed but ahmed sari cried it has come to me he continued ignoring her ignoring us both staring at the ceiling as he spoke as if speaking directly to the priestess up in the heavens it has come to me as a descendant of khala to make sure the curse is carried out i stared past ahmed to the tunnel still no sign of uncle ben was he coming had saris beeper worked what was keeping him i volunteered to work for your father to make sure that khalas sacred sanctuary was not violated ahmed continued shadows flickering over his menacing face when he would not heed my warnings i had to take action i frightened the two workers then i planned to take you away to hide you until he agreed to stop his work he lowered the torch his face filled with sadness now i have no choice i must carry out my sacred duties i must keep the ancient promise to khala but what does that mean sari cried the orange torchlight revealed her frightened expression what does it mean ahmed repeated he gestured with the torch look around you we both turned and glanced quickly around the chamber but we didnt understand the mummies he explained we still didnt understand what about the mummies i managed to stammer they were all violators of the priestesss chamber ahmed revealed the thin smile that formed on his face could only be described as a proud smile you mean theyre not from ancient egypt sari cried raising her hands in horror to her face a few of them ahmed replied still smiling that frightening cold smile a few of them were ancient intruders some are quite recent but they all have one thing in common they all became victims of the curse and they all were mummified alive no i screamed without realizing it ahmed ignored my terrified outburst i did that one myself he said pointing to a mummy standing stiffly at attention at the edge of the tar pit oh how awful sari cried her voice trembling i stared hopefully at the tunnel opening behind ahmed but there was still no sign of uncle ben today i must go to work again ahmed announced today there will be new mummies new trophies for khala you cant do that sari shrieked i grabbed her hand to my horror i understood perfectly now i understood why some of the mummies were in such good condition they were new all of the tools the tar the linen they had been used by descendants of khala descendants like ahmed since the time of khala anyone who had entered the chamber the chamber we were now standing in had been mummified alive and now sari and i were about to become mummies too ahmed you cant sari cried she let go of my hand and balled her hands into angry fists at her side it is the will of khala he replied softly his dark eyes glowing in the light of the torch i saw a longbladed dagger appear in his free hand the blade caught the light from the torch sari and i both took a step back as ahmed began moving toward us with quick determined strides as ahmed approached sari and i shrank back to the center of the chamber run i thought we can run away from him my eyes searched frantically for a place we could escape through but there was no way out the tunnel in the corner appeared to be the only opening and wed have to run right past ahmed to get to it sari i saw was frantically pressing the beeper at her waist she glanced at me her features tight with fear yowwww i cried out as i suddenly backed into someone i turned and stared into the bandaged face of a mummy with a loud gasp i lurched away from it lets make a run for the tunnel i whispered to sari my throat so dry and tight i could barely make myself heard he cant get both of us sari stared back at me confused i dont know if she heard me or not there is no escape ahmed said softly as if reading my thoughts there is no escape from khalas curse he hes going to kill us sari screamed you have violated her sacred chamber ahmed said raising the torch high holding the dagger at his waist he stepped nearer i saw you yesterday climb into the sacred sarcophagus i saw you two playing in khalas holy chamber it was then that i knew i had to carry out my sacred duties i sari and i both cried out as something dropped from the chamber ceiling all three of us looked up to see a rope ladder dangling from the hole i had fallen through it swung back and forth as it was lowered nearly to the floor are you down there im coming down uncle ben shouted down to us uncle ben no i screamed but he was already moving down the ladder making his way quickly the ladder steadying under his weight halfway down he stopped and peered into the chamber what on earth he cried his eyes roaming over the amazing scene and then he saw ahmed ahmed what are you doing here uncle ben cried in surprise he quickly lowered himself to the floor jumping down the last three rungs merely carrying out khalas wishes ahmed said his face expressionless now his eyes narrowed in anticipation khala the priestess uncle ben wrinkled his features in confusion hes going to kill us sari cried rushing up to her dad throwing her arms around his waist daddy hes going to kill us and then turn us into mummies uncle ben held sari and looked over her shoulder accusingly at ahmed is this true the chamber has been violated it has fallen to me doctor to carry out the curse uncle ben put his hands on saris trembling shoulders and gently moved her aside then he began to make his way slowly steadily toward ahmed ahmed let us go out of here and discuss this he said raising his right hand as if offering it in friendship ahmed took a step back raising the torch menacingly the priestesss will must not be ignored ahmed you are a scientist and so am i uncle ben said i couldnt believe how calm he sounded i wondered if it was an act the scene was tense we were in such terrifying danger but i felt just a little bit calmer knowing that my uncle was here knowing that hed be able to handle ahmed and get us out of here alive i glanced reassuringly at sari who was staring hard biting her lower lip in tense concentration as her father approached ahmed ahmed put down the torch uncle ben urged his hand extended the dagger too please lets discuss this scientist to scientist what is there to discuss ahmed asked softly his eyes studying uncle ben intently the will of khala must be carried out as it has been for four thousand years that cannot be discussed as scientist to scientist uncle ben repeated returning ahmeds stare as if challenging him the curse is ancient khala has had her way for many centuries perhaps it is time to let it rest lower your weapons ahmed lets talk about this scientist to scientist its going to be okay i thought breathing a long sigh of relief its all going to be okay were going to get out of here but then ahmed moved with startling quickness without warning without a word he pulled back his arms and gripping the torch handle with both hands swung it as hard as he could at uncle bens head the torch made a loud thonk as it connected with the side of uncle bens face the orange flames danced up a swirl of bright color and then shadows uncle ben groaned his eyes bulged wide with surprise with pain the torch hadnt set him aflame but the blow knocked him out he slumped to his knees then his eyes closed and he dropped limply to the floor ahmed raised the torch high his eyes gleaming with excitement with triumph and i knew we were doomed daddy sari rushed to her father and knelt at his side but ahmed moved quickly thrusting the torch toward her holding the dagger ready forcing her to back away a thin trickle of blood glowing darkly hi the light of the fire rolled down the side of uncle bens face he groaned but didnt stir i glanced quickly at the mummies scattered around the room it was hard to believe that we would soon be one of them i thought of leaping at ahmed trying to knock him over i imagined grabbing the torch swinging it at him forcing him against the wall forcing him to let us escape but the blade of the dagger glowed as if warning me to stay back im just a kid i thought thinking i could beat a grown man with a knife and a torch was just crazy crazy the whole scene was crazy and terrifying i suddenly felt sick my stomach tightened and a wave of nausea swept over me let us go wow sari screamed at ahmed to my surprise he reacted by swinging back the torch and heaving it across the room it landed with a soft plop in the center of the tar pit instantly the surface of the tar burst into flames the flames spread leaping up toward the chamber ceiling until the entire square was aflame as i stared in amazement the tar popped and bubbled beneath the orange and red covering of flames we must wait for it to boil ahmed said calmly the shadows cast by the flames flickering across his face and clothing the chamber grew thick with smoke sari and i both started to cough ahmed bent down and put his hands under uncle bens shoulders he began to drag him across the floor leave him alone sari screamed running frantically toward ahmed i saw that she was going to try to fight him i grabbed her shoulders and held her back we were no match for ahmed he had already knocked uncle ben unconscious there was no telling what he would do to us holding onto sari i stared at him what did he plan to do now it didnt take long to find out with surprising strength he pulled uncle ben across the floor to one of the open mummy cases against the wall then he hoisted him over the side and shoved him into the case not even the slightest bit out of breath ahmed slid the lid closed over my unconscious uncle then he turned to us you two into that one he pointed to an enormous mummy case on a tall pedestal next to uncle bens it was nearly as tall as i was and at least ten feet long it must have been built to hold a mummified person and all of his or her possessions let us go sari insisted let us out of here we wont tell anyone what happened really please climb into the case ahmed insisted patiently we must wait for the tar to be ready were not going in there i said i was shaking all over i could feel the blood pulsing at my temples i didnt even realize i was saying what i was saying i was so scared i didnt even hear myself i glanced at sari she stood defiantly with her arms crossed tightly over her chest but despite her brave pose i could see her chin trembling and her eyes beginning to tear into the coffin ahmed repeated to await your fate khala will not be kept waiting the ancient curse will be carried out in her name no i cried angrily i stood on tiptoe and peered into the enormous mummy case it smelled so sour in there i nearly hurled the case was made of wood it was warped and stained and peeling inside in the flickering light i was sure i saw dozens of insects crawling around in there get into the case now ahmed demanded sari climbed up over the side and lowered herself into the ancient mummy case she always had to be first at everything but this was one time i didnt mind i hesitated resting my hand on the rotting wood on the side of the case i glanced at the case next to it the case with uncle ben inside it was carved of stone and the heavy stone lid was closed sealing it up tight did uncle ben have any air hi there i wondered gripped with fear was he able to breathe and then i thought glumly what difference does it make all three of us are going to be dead soon all three of us are going to be mummies locked away in this hidden chamber forever get in now ahmed ordered his dark eyes burning into mine i im just a kid i cried i dont know where the words came from i was so scared i really didnt know what i was saying an unpleasant sneer formed on ahmeds face many of the pharaohs were your age at death he said i wanted to keep him talking i had the desperate idea that if i could keep the conversation going i could get us out of this mess but i couldnt think of anything to say my brain just froze get in ahmed ordered moving toward me menacingly feeling totally defeated i slid one leg over the side of the rotting coffin raised myself up and then dropped down beside sari she had her head bowed and her eyes shut tight i think she was praying she didnt glance up even when i touched her shoulder the coffin lid began to slide over us the last thing i saw were the red flames leaping up over the pit of tar then the lid closed us into complete blackness gabe sari whispered a few seconds after the lid was closed im frightened for some reason her confession made me snicker she said it with such surprise as if being frightened was a startling new experience im too frightened to be frightened i whispered back she grabbed my hand and squeezed it her hand was even colder and clammier than mine hes crazy she whispered yeah i know i replied still holding onto her hand i think there are bugs in here she said with a shudder i can feel them crawling on me me too i told her i realized i was gritting my teeth i always do that when im nervous and now i was more nervous than i thought was humanly possible poor daddy sari said the air in the coffin was already beginning to feel stuffy and hot i tried to ignore the disgusting sour smell but it had crept into my nostrils and i could even taste it i held my breath to keep from gagging were going to suffocate in here i said glumly hes going to kill us before we can suffocate sari wailed ow i could hear her slap at a bug on her arm maybe something will happen i told her pretty lame but i couldnt think of what else to say i couldnt think period all i keep thinking about is how hes going to reach in and pull my brain out through my nose sari wailed why did you have to tell me that gabe it took me a while to reply then all i could say was sorry i began to picture the same thing and another wave of nausea swept over me we cant just sit here i said we have to escape i tried to ignore the thick sour smell huh how lets try to push up the lid i said maybe if we both push together i counted to three in a low whisper and we both flattened our hands against the coffin top and pushed up as hard as we could no the lid wouldnt budge maybe hes locked it or put something heavy on top of it sari suggested with a miserable sigh maybe i replied feeling just as miserable we sat in silence for a while i could hear sari breathing she was sort of sobbing as she breathed i realized my heart was racing i could feel my temples throbbing i pictured the long hook that ahmed would use to pull our brains out of our heads i tried to force the thought out of my mind but it wouldnt go away i remembered being a mummy two halloweens ago and how the costume unraveled in front of my friends little did i know then that id soon have a mummy costume that would never unravel time passed i dont know how long i realized i had been sitting with my legs crossed now they were beginning to fall asleep i uncrossed them and stretched them out the mummy case was so big sari and i could both he down if we wanted to but we were too tense and terrified to lie down i was the first to hear the scrabbling sound like something climbing quickly around inside the mummy case at first i thought it was sari but she grabbed my hand with her icy hand and i realized she hadnt moved from in front of me we both listened hard something near us something right next to us bumped the side of the case a mummy was there a mummy in the case with us moving i heard a soft groan sari squeezed my hand so tightly it hurt and i uttered a sharp cry another sound closer gabe sari whispered her voice tiny and shrill gabe theres something in here with us its not a mummy i told myself it cant be its a bug a very large bug moving across the coffin floor its not a mummy its not a mummy the words repeated in my mind i didnt have too long to think about it whatever it was crept closer hey a voice whispered sari and i both shrieked where are you guys we recognized the voice immediately uncle ben i cried swallowing hard my heart pounding daddy sari lunged over me to get to her father but how i stammered how did you get in here easy he replied squeezing my shoulder reassuringly daddy i dont believe it sari wailed i couldnt see in the blackness of the closed coffin but i think she was crying im okay im okay he repeated several times trying to calm her down how did you get out of that case and into this one i asked totally confused and amazed theres an escape hatch uncle ben explained a small opening with a doorway the egyptians built hidden doorways and escape hatches into many of their mummy cases for the corpses soul to be able to leave wow i said i didnt know what to say ahmed is so caught up in his ancient curse mumbo jumbo hes forgotten about this little detail uncle ben said i felt his hand on my shoulder again come on you two follow me but hes out there i started no uncle ben replied quickly hes slipped away when i climbed out of my case i looked for him i didnt see him anywhere maybe he went somewhere else while hes waiting for the tar to get hot enough or maybe he decided to just leave us in the mummy cases to suffocate i felt a bug slither up my leg i slapped at it then tried to pull it out from inside the leg of my jeans out we go uncle ben said i heard him groan as he turned in the enormous coffin then i could hear him crawling to the back i saw a small rectangle of light as he pushed open the hidden door in the back of the case it was a very small escape hatch just big enough for us to squeeze through i followed uncle ben and sari out of the case flattening myself to crawl out the small opening then dropping onto all fours on the chamber floor it took a while for my eyes to adjust to the brightness the red flames still danced over the pit of bubbling tar casting eerie blue shadows on all four chamber walls the mummies stood as before frozen in place around the room shadows flickering over their faceless forms as my eyes began to focus i saw that uncle ben had an enormous dark bruise on the side of his head a wide ribbon of dried blood streaked down his cheek lets get out of here before ahmed comes back he whispered standing between us one hand on each of our shoulders sari looked pale and trembly her lower lip was bleeding from her chewing on it so hard uncle ben started toward the rope ladder in the center of the chamber but then stopped itll take too long he said thinking out loud come on to the tunnel hurry all three of us started jogging toward the tunnel in the corner looking down i saw that my stupid shoelace had come untied again but there was no way i was going to stop to tie it we were about to get out of there a few seconds before i had given up all hope but now here we were out of the mummy case and heading to freedom we were just a few yards in front of the tunnel entrance when the tunnel suddenly filled with orange light then from out of the tunnel ahmed emerged holding a new torch in front of him the flames revealing a startled look on his face no sari and i cried in unison all three of us skidded to a halt right in front of him you cannot escape ahmed said softly quickly regaining his composure his startled expression tightening to anger you mil not escape he thrust the torch toward uncle ben who was forced to fall backwards out of reach of the hissing flames he landed hard on his elbows and cried out in pain his cry brought a grim smile to ahmeds lips you have made khala angry he announced raising the torch above his head and reaching for the dagger sheathed at his waist you will not join the other violators of this chamber whew i breathed a sigh of relief ahmed had changed his mind he wasnt going to turn us into mummies after all the three of you will die in the tar pit he declared sari and i exchanged horrified glances uncle ben had climbed back to his feet and put his arms around us ahmed cant we talk about this calmly and rationally as scientists he asked to the tar pit ahmed ordered thrusting the flaming torch angrily at us ahmed please uncle ben cried in a whining frightened tone id never heard from him before ahmed ignored uncle bens desperate pleas pushing the torch at our backs and gesturing with the longbladed dagger he forced us to make our way to the edge of the pit the tar was bubbling noisily now making ugly popping and sucking sounds the flames across the top were low and red i tried to pull back it smelled so bad and the steam coming off it was so hot it made my face burn one by one you will jump ahmed said he was standing a few feet behind us as we stared down into the bubbling tar if you dont jump i will be forced to push you ahmed uncle ben began but ahmed brushed the torch against bens back it has come to me ahmed said solemnly the honor of carrying out khalas wishes the tar fumes were so overwhelming i thought i was going to faint the pit started to tilt in front of me i felt very dizzy i shoved my hands into my jeans pockets to steady myself i guess and my hand closed around something i had forgotten about the summoner the mummy hand that i carry around everywhere im not sure why i wasnt thinking clearly if at all but i pulled out the little mummy hand i spun around quickly and i held the mummy hand up high i cant really explain what was going through my mind i was so terrified so overwhelmed with fear that i was thinking a hundred things at once maybe i thought the mummy hand would distract ahmed or interest him or confuse him or frighten him maybe i was just stalling for time or maybe i was unconsciously remembering the legend behind the hand that the kid at the garage sale had told me the legend of why it was called the summoner how it was used to call up ancient souls and spirits or maybe i wasnt thinking anything at all but i spun around and gripping it by its slender wrist held the mummy hand up high and waited ahmed stared at it but nothing happened i waited standing there like the statue of liberty with the little hand raised high above my head it seemed as if i were standing like that for hours sari and uncle ben stared at the hand lowering the torch a few inches ahmed squinted at the mummy hand then his eyes grew wider and his mouth dropped open in surprise he cried out i couldnt understand what he was saying the words were in a language id never heard ancient egyptian maybe he took a step back his surprised expression quickly replaced by a wideeyed look of fear the hand of the priestess he cried at least thats what i think he cried because i was suddenly distracted by what was going on behind him sari uttered a low cry all three of us stared over ahmeds shoulder in disbelief a mummy propped against the wall appeared to lean forward another mummy lying on its back slowly sat up creaking as it raised itself no i cried still holding the mummy hand high sari and uncle ben were gaping wideeyed as the vast chamber filled with motion as the mummies creaked and groaned to life the air filled with the odor of ancient dust of decay in the shadowy light i saw one mummy then another straighten up stand tall they stretched their bandaged arms above their featureless heads slowly painfully staggering moving stiffly the mummies lumbered forward i watched frozen in amazement as they climbed out of mummy cases raised themselves from the floor leaned forward took their first slow heavy steps their muscles groaning dust rising up from their dry dead bodies theyre dead i thought all of them dead dead for so many years but now they were rising up climbing from their ancient coffins struggling toward us on their heavy dead legs their bandaged feet scraped across the chamber floor as they gathered in a group scrape scrape scrape a dry shuffling sound i knew id never forget scrape scrape the faceless army approached bandaged arms outstretched they lumbered toward us creaking and groaning moaning softly with ancient pain ahmed caught the astonishment on our faces and spun around he cried out again in that strange language as he saw the mummies advancing on us scraping so softly so deliberately across the chamber floor and then with a furious scream ahmed heaved the torch at the mummy in the lead the torch hit the mummy in the chest and bounced to the floor flames burst from the mummys chest immediately spreading over the arms and down the legs but the mummy kept advancing didnt slow didnt react at all to the fire that was quickly consuming it gaping in openmouthed horror babbling an endless stream of words in that mysterious language ahmed tried to run but he was too late the burning mummy lunged at him the ancient figure caught ahmed up by the throat lifted him high above its flaming shoulders ahmed uttered a highpitched shriek of terror as the other mummies lumbered forward moaning and wailing through their yellowed bandages they moved in to help their burning colleague they raised ahmed high above their moaning heads and then held him over the burning tar pit squirming and kicking ahmed uttered a piercing scream as they held him over the boiling bubbling steaming tar i closed my eyes the heat and tar fumes swirled around me i felt as if i were being swallowed up pulled down into the steaming blackness when i opened my eyes i saw ahmed fleeing to the tunnel staggering clumsily shrieking in openmouthed terror as he ran the mummies remained by the pit enjoying their victory i realized i was still holding the mummy hand over my head i lowered it slowly and gazed at sari and uncle ben they were standing beside me their faces filled with confusion and relief the mummies i managed to utter look sari said pointing i followed the direction of her gaze the mummies were all back in place some were leaning some propped at odd angles some lying down they were exactly as they had been when i entered the chamber huh my eyes darted rapidly around the room had they all moved had they raised themselves stood up and staggered toward us or had we imagined it all no we couldnt have imagined it ahmed was gone we were safe were okay uncle ben said gratefully throwing his arms around sari and me were okay were okay we can go now sari cried happily hugging her dad then she turned to me you saved our lives she said she had to choke out the words but she said them then uncle ben turned his gaze on me and the object i still gripped tightly in front of me thanks for the helping hand uncle ben said we had an enormous dinner at a restaurant back in cairo its a miracle any of us got any food down since we were all talking at once chattering excitedly reliving our adventure trying to make sense of it all i was spinning the summoner around on the table uncle ben grinned at me i had no idea how special that mummy hand was he took it from me and examined it closely better not play with it he said seriously we must treat it carefully he shook his head some great scientist i am he exclaimed scornfully when i saw it i thought it was just a toy some kind of reproduction but this hand may be my biggest discovery of all its my good luck charm i said handling it gently as i took it back you can say that again sari said appreciatively the nicest thing shed ever said to me back at the hotel i surprised myself by falling asleep instantly i thought id be up for hours thinking about all that had happened but i guess all the excitement had exhausted me the next morning sari uncle ben and i had a big breakfast in the room i had a plate of scrambled eggs and a bowl of frosted flakes as i ate i fiddled with the little mummy hand all three of us were feeling good happy that our frightening adventure was over we were kidding around teasing each other laughing a lot after i finished my cereal i raised the little mummy hand high o summoner i chanted in a deep voice i summon the ancient spirits come alive come alive again stop it gabe sari snapped she grabbed for the hand but i swung it out of her reach that isnt funny she said you shouldnt fool around like that are you chicken i asked laughing at her i could see that she was really frightened which made me enjoy my little joke even more keeping it away from her i raised the hand high i summon thee ancient spirits of the dead i chanted come to me come to me now and there was a loud knock on the door all three of us gasped uncle ben knocked over his juice glass it clattered onto the table and spilled i froze with the little hand in the air another loud knock we heard a scrabbling at the door the sound of ancient bandaged fingers struggling with the lock sari and i exchanged horrified glances i slowly lowered the hand as the door swung open two shadowy figures lumbered into the room mom and dad i cried ill bet they were surprised at how glad i was to see them
