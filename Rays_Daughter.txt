rays daughter a story of manila by general charles king usv author of rays recruit marions faith the colonels daughter etc philadelphia and london j b lippincott company copyright by j b lippincott company electrotyped and printed by j b lippincott company philadelphia usa rays daughter chapter i the long june day was drawing to its close hot and strong the slanting sunbeams beat upon the grimy roofs of the train and threw distorted shadows over the sand and sagebrush that stretched to the far horizon dense and choking from beneath the whirring wheels the dustclouds rose in tawny billows that enveloped the rearmost coaches and mingling with the black smoke of the doubleheader engines rolled away in the dreary wake east and west north and south far as the eye could reach hemmed by low duncolored ridges or sharply outlined crests of remote mountain range in lifeless desolation the landscape lay outspread to the view southward streaked with white fringe of alkali the flat monotone of sand and ashes blended with the flatter flawless surface of a widespreading ashcolored inland lake its shores dotted at intervals with the bleaching bones of cattle and ridged with ancient wagontracks unwashed by not so much as a single drop from the cloudless heavens since their first impress on the sinking soil here and there along the right of way a right no human being would care to dispute were the way ten times its width some drowsing lizards sprawling in the sunshine along the ties roused at the sound and tremor of the coming train to squirm off into the sagebrush but no sign of animation had been seen since the crossing of the big divide near promontory the long winding train made up of mail express baggage emigrant and smokingcars tourists coaches and huge sleepers at the rear with a diner midway in the chain was packed with gasping humanity westward bound for the far pacific the long long tortuous climb to the snowcapped sierras ahead the parched and baking valley of the great salt lake long dreary miles behind it was early june of the year and the war with spain was on there had been some delay at ogden the trains from the east over the union pacific and the denver and rio grande came in crowded and the resources of the southern pacific were suddenly taxed beyond the expectation of its officials troops had been whirling westward throughout the week absorbing much of the rolling stock and the empty cars were being rushed east again from oakland pier but the nearest were still some hundreds of miles from this point of transfer when a carload of recruits was dumped upon the broad platform and the superintendent scratched his head and screwed up the corner of his mouth and asked an assistant how in a hotter place than even salt lake valley the road could expect him to forward troops without delay when the road took away the last car in the yard getting those iowa boys out there aint nuthin left cept that old tourist thats been rustin and kilndryin up longside the shops since last winter said the junior helplessly shall we have her out guess youll have to was the answer its that or nothin and the boss turned on his heel and slammed the office door behind him ten to one said he therell be a kick comin when the boys see what theyve got to ride in an ill let jim take the kick the kick had come as predicted but availed nothing a score of lusty young patriots were the performers but being destined for service in the regulars they had neither senator nor state official to wire to in wrathful protest as was usual on such occasions the superintendent would have thought twice before ever suggesting that car as a component part of the train bearing the volunteers from nebraska colorado or iowa so recently shipped over the road they could have made it hot for the management said he but these fellows these waifs were from no state or place in particular they hadnt even an officer with them but were hurrying on to their destination under command of a veteran gunner lanced for the purpose at the recruiting station he had done his best for his men ruefully they looked through the dustcovered interior and inspected the muddy trucks and brakegear she wheezes like she had bronchitis said the corporal and the insides a cross between a hencoop and coalbin you aint going to run that old rookery for a car are you best weve got was the curt reply yet the yardman shook his head as he heard the squeal of the rusty journals and ordered his men to pack in fresh waste and touch em up somehow any man who had spent a week about a railway could have prophesied hot boxes before that coach had run much more than its own length but it wouldnt do for an employee to say so the corporal looked appealingly at his fellowpassengers of the rio grande train there were dozens of them stretching their legs and strolling about the platform after getting their handluggage transferred and seats secured but there was no one in position or authority to interpose some seemed to feel no interest get your rations and plunder aboard he ordered turning suddenly to his party and loading up with blankets overcoats haversacks and canteens the recruits speedily took possession of their new quarters forced open the jammed windows to let out the imprisoned and overheated air piled their boxes of hard bread and stacks of tinned meat at the ends and their scant soldier goods and chattels in the rude sections then tumbled out again upon the platform to enjoy while yet there was time the freedom of the outer air despite the torrid heat of the midday sunshine in knots of three or four they sauntered about their hands deep in their empty pockets their boyish eyes curiously studying the signs and posters or wistfully peering through the screened doors at the temptations of the bar and lunch counter or the shaded windows of the diningroom where luckier fellowpassengers were taking their fill of the good cheer afforded two of the number dressed like the rest in blue flannel shirts with trousers of lighter hue and heavier make fanning their heated faces with their drab broadbrimmed campaign hats swung off the rear end of the objectionable car and with a quick glance about them started briskly down the track to where the diner and certain sleepers of the southern pacific were being shunted about come back here you fellers shouted the corporal catching sight of the pair you dont know how soon this here train may start come back i say he added emphatically as the two looking first into each others eyes seemed to hesitate then with sullen downcast face the nearer turned and slowly obeyed the other a bright merry youngster whose white teeth gleamed as he laughed his reply still stood in his tracks were only going to the diningcar corporal he shouted thats going with us so we cant be left youve got no business in the diningcar mellen thats not for your sort or mine for that matter was the corporals ultimatum and with a grin still expanding his broad mouth the recruit addressed as mellen came reluctantly sauntering in the trail of his comrade who had submitted in silence and yet not without a shrug of protest it was to the latter the corporal spoke when the two had rejoined their associates youve got sense enough to know youre not wanted at that diner murray whether mellen has or not thats no place for empty pockets what took you there wanted a drink and you said keep away from the barroom answered murray briefly his gray eyes glancing about from man to man in the group resting for just a second on the form and features of one who stood a little apart a youth of twentyone years probably it was fosters treat he added and that remark transferred the attention of the party at the instant to the youngster on the outskirts he had been leaning with folded arms against a lamppost looking somewhat wearily up the long platform to where in pairs or little groups the passengers were strolling men and women both seeking relief from the constraint and stiffness of the long ride by rail he had an interesting even a handsome face and his figure was well knit well proportioned his eyes were a dark soft brown with very long curving lashes his nose straight his mouth finely curved soft and sensitive his throat was full round and at the base very white and fair as the unfastened and flapping shirtcollar now enabled one to see his hands too were soft and white showing that at least one of the twenty came not from the ranks of the toilers his shoes were of finer make than those of his comrades and the handkerchief so loosely knotted at the opening of the coarse blue shirt was of handsome and costly silk he had been paying scant attention to his surroundings and was absorbed evidently in his watch on the tourists up the platform when recalled to himself by the consciousness that all eyes were upon him whats this about your treatin foster asked the corporal for a week he had felt sure the boy had money and not a little nothing would have persuaded him to borrow a cent of foster or anybody else but others and plenty of them had no such scruples the young recruit turned slowly he seemed reluctant to quit his scrutiny of his fellowpassengers the abrupt tone and manner of the accustomed regular too jarred upon him it might be the corporals prerogative so to address his charges but this one didnt like it and meant to show that he didnt his money at least was his own and he could do with it as he liked the answer did not come until the question had been asked twice then in words as brief and manner as blunt he said why shouldnt i corporal connelly stood a second or two without venturing a word looking steadfastly at the young soldier whose attitude was unchanged and whose eyes were again fixed on the distant group as though in weary disdain of those about him then connelly took half a dozen quick springy steps that landed him close to the unmoved recruit youve two things to learn among two thousand foster said he in low firm voice one is to keep your money and the other your temper i spoke for your good principally but if youve been ladling out your money to be spent in liquor i say stop it theres to be no whiskey in that car nobody wants it less than i do said foster wearily why didnt you keep it out of the others because i never knew till it was gone how much money did you give murray and why and connellys eyes were looking straight into those of foster as he spoke compelling respect for sturdy manhood a dollar i believe was the languid answer and because he asked it and again the lads gaze wandered off along the platform the switch engine was busily at work making up the train and brakemen were signalling up and down the line the diningcar followed by some ponderous sleepers came gliding slowly along the rails and brought up with a bump and jar against the buffers of the old tourists ark assigned the recruits somewhere up at the thronged station a bell began to jangle followed by a shout of all aboard tumble in you men ordered connelly and at the moment there came a general movement of the crowd in their direction the passengers of the sleepers were hurrying to their assigned places some with flushed faces and expostulation they thought their car should have come to them its because our train is so very long explained the brakeman to some ladies whom he was assisting up the steps weve twice as many cars as usual yours is the next car maam the one behind the diner the recruit foster had started but slowly when in obedience to the corporals order his fellows began to move he was still looking half in search half in expectation towards the main entrance of the station building but the instant he became aware of the movement in his direction on the part of the passengers he pushed ahead past several of the party he even half shoved aside one of their number who had just grasped the handrail of the car then sprang lightly past him and disappeared within the doorway there half hidden by the gloom of the interior he stood well back from the grimy windows yet peering intently through at the swiftly passing crowd suddenly he stooped recoiled and seated himself in the opposite section while his comrades came filing rapidly in and at the moment a tall young officer in dark uniform a man perhaps of twentyfive with a singularly handsome face and form strode past the window scrupulously acknowledged connellys salute and then glancing about saw the heads and shoulders of a dozen soldiers at the windows why what detachment is this corporal he asked we brought no troops on our train recruits th cavalry sir was the ready answer we came by way of denver ah yes that explains it whos in command and the tall officer looked about him as though in search of kindred rank we have no officer with us sir said connelly diplomatically im in charge youll have to hurry sir spoke the brakeman at the moment jump on the diner if you like and go through the officer took the hint and sprang to the steps there he turned and faced the platform again just as the train began to move a little group two ladies and a man of middle age stood directly opposite him closely scanning the train and all on a sudden their faces beamed their glances were directed their hands waved towards him goodby goodby take good care of yourself wire from sacramento were their cries addressed apparently to his head and turning quickly he found himself confronting a young girl standing smiling on the platform of the diningcar her tiny feet about on a level with his knees yet he had hardly to cast an upward glance for her beaming beautiful face was but a trifle higher than his own in all his life he had never seen one so pretty realizing that he stood between this fair traveller and the friends who were there to wish her godspeed recognizing too with the swift intuition of his class the possibility of establishing relations on his own account the young soldier snatched off his new foragecap briefly said i beg your pardon take my place and swinging outward transferred himself to the rear of the recruit car thereby causing the corporal to recoil upon a grinning squad of embryo troopers who were shouting jocular farewell to the natives and getting much in the way of trainhands who were busy straightening out the bellcord something seemed amiss with that portion of it which made part of the equipment of the old tourists car it was either wedged in the narrow orifice above the door or caught among the rings of the pendants from above for it resisted every jerk whereat the brakeman set his teeth and said improper things it would have grieved the management to hear this faithful employйs denunciation of that particular item of their rollingstock get out of the way here boys and lets see whats the matter with this damned bellcord he continued elbowing his way through the swarm about the door once fairly within he threw a quick glance along the aisle the left sections of the car were deserted out of almost every window on the right side poked a head and pair of blue flannel shoulders only one man of the party seemed to have no further interest in what was going on outside with one hand still grasping the edge of the upright partition between two sections near the forward end and the other just letting go apparently of the bellcord the tall slender wellbuilt young soldier with darkbrown eyes and softly curling lashes was lowering himself into the aisle the brakeman proceeded to rebuke him on the spot look here young feller youll have to keep your hands off that bellcord here ive been cussin things for keeps thinking it was knotted or caught it was just you had hold of it dont you know bettern that aint you ever travelled before the man addressed was stowing something away inside the breast of his shirt he did it with almost ostentatious deliberation quietly eying the brakeman before replying then slowly readjusting the knot of a fine blacksilk necktie so that its broad flapping ends spread over the coarser material of the garment he slowly looked the justly exasperated brakeman over from head to foot and as slowly and placidly answered not more than about half around the world as for your bellcord it was knotted it caught in that ring i saw that someone was tugging and trying to get it loose so i swung up there and straightened it just what youd have done under the circumstances i fancy the brakeman turned redder under the ruddy brown of his suntanned skin this was no raw rookie after all in his own vernacular as afterwards expressed to the conductor i seen i was up agin the real ting dis time but it was hard to admit it at the moment vexation had to have a vent the bellcord no longer served the supposed meddler had proved a help something or somebody had to be the victim of the honest brakemans spleen so somewhat unluckily as events determined he took it out on the company and that decrepit car now buzzing along with much complaint of axle and of bearing damn this old shakedown anyhow said he the company ought to know nough not to have such things lyin round loose some night itll fall to pieces and kill folks and with this implied apology for his aspersions of recruit foster the brakeman bustled away but what he said was heard by more than one and remembered when perhaps he would have wished it forgotten the delay at ogden was supplemented by a long halt before the setting of that blazing sun necessitated by the firing of the waste in the boxes of those longneglected trucks far back as the rearmost sleeper the sickening smell of burning oilsteeped packing drove feminine occupants to their satchels in search of scentbottles and the men to such comfort as could be found in flasks of bulkier make in the heart of the desert with dust and desolation spreading far on every hand the long train had stopped to douse those foulsmelling fires and while trainhands pried off the redhot caps and dumped buckets of water into the blazing cavities changing malodorous smoke to dense clouds of equally unsavory steam and the recruits in the afflicted car found consolation in joshing the hardsweating hardswearing workers the young officer who had boarded the second sleeper at ogden together with half a dozen bipeds in dusters or frazzled shirtsleeves had become involved in a complication on the shadier side of the train somewhere into the sagebrush a jackrabbit had darted and was now in hiding with a dozen eager heads poked from the northward windows and stretching arms and index fingers guiding them in their inglorious hunt the lieutenant and his few associates were stalking the first fourfooted object sighted from the train since the crossing of the bald divide within the heated cars with flushed faces and plying palmleaf fans a few of the women passengers were languidly gazing from the windows at the centre window of the second sleeper without a palmleaf and looking serene and unperturbed sat the young girl whose lovely face had so excited mr stuyvesants deep admiration thrice since leaving ogden on one pretext or other had he passed her section and stolen such a look as could be given without obvious staring immediately in rear of the seat she occupied was an austere maiden of middle age one of the passengers who had come on by the union pacific from omaha directly opposite sat two men whom stuyvesant had held in but scant esteem up to the time they left the valley of salt lake now because their sections stood over against hers his manner relaxed with his mood circumstances had brought the elderly maid and himself to the same table on two occasions in the diningcar but he had hitherto felt no desire to press the acquaintance this afternoon he minded him of a new book he had in his bag for literature he judged might be her hobby and had engaged her in conversation of which his share was meant to impress the tiny translucent ear that nestled in the darkbrown coils and waves of the pretty head in front of him when however it became patent that his companion desired to form her own impressions of the pages uninfluenced by his welldelivered comments mr stuyvesant had bethought him of the semisomnolent occupants of the opposite section and some cabalistic signs he ventured with a little silver cup summoned them in pleased surprise to the watercooler at the rear end where he regaled them with a good story and the best of v o p scotch and accepted their lavish bid to sit with them awhile from this coign of vantage he had studied her sweet serious oval face as she sat placidly reading a little volume in her lap only once in a while raising a pair of very dark very beautiful very heavily browed and lashed brown eyes for brief survey of the forbidding landscape then with never an instants peep at him dropping their gaze again upon the book not once in the long hot afternoon had she vouchsafed him the minimum of a show of interest curiosity or even consciousness of his presence then the train made its second stop on account of the fires and brer rabbit his luckless break into the long monotony of the declining day tentative spikes clods and empty flasks having failed to find him the beaters had essayed a skirmish line and with instant result like a meteoric puff of gray and white to a chorus of yells and the accompaniment of a volley of missiles jack had shot into space from behind his shelter and darted zigzagging through the brush a whizzing spike a chance shot that nearly grazed his nose so dazzled his brainlet that the terrified creature doubled on his trail and came bounding back towards the train close to the trackside ran a narrow ditch in this ditch at the instant crouched the tall lieutenant into this ditch leaped bunny and the next second had whizzed past the stooping form and bored straight into a little wooden drain there some unseen unlookedfor object blocked him desperately the hindlegs kicked and tore in the effort to force the passage and with a shout of triumph the tall soldier swooped upon the prize seized the struggling legs swung the wretched creature aloft and for the first time in six mortal hours met full in his own the gaze of the deep beautiful brown eyes he had so striven to attract and they were half pleading half commanding for bunny the next instant uninjured but leaping madly for life brer rabbit was streaking eastward out of harms way a liberated victim whose first huge leap owed much of its length to the impetus of stuyvesants long lean sinewy arm this time when he looked up and raised his cap and stood there with his blond hair blowing down over his broad white forehead although the soft curves of the ripe red lips at the window above him changed not there was something in the darkbrown eyes that seemed to say thank you yet when he would have met those eyes again that evening when last call for dinner in the diningcar was sounding through the train he could not neither were they among those that peered from between parted curtains in the dim light of the sleeper many in fright all in anxiety when somewhere in the dead of the summer night long after all occupants of the rearmost cars were wrapped in slumber the long train bumped to sudden jarring standstill and up ahead there arose sound of rush of excitement and alarm chapter ii it was just after sunset when for the second time the hot boxes of the recruit car had been treated to liberal libations from the watertank and the belated train again moved on dinner had been ready in the diningcar a full hour but so long as the sickening smell of burning waste arose from the trucks immediately in front very few of the passengers seemed capable of eating the car as a consequence was crowded towards eight oclock and the steward and waiters were busy men the evening air drifting in through open windows was cooler than it had been during the day but still held enough of the noontide caloric to make fans a comfort and mr stuyvesant dining at a fourinhand table well to the front and attempting to hold his own in a somewhat desultory talk with his fellowmen found himself paying far more attention to the lovely face of the girl across the aisle than to the viands set before him she was seated facing the front and opposite the austere maiden previously mentioned conversation had already begun and now stuyvesant was able to see that beautiful in feature as was her face in repose its beauty was far enhanced when animated and smiling when to wellnigh perfect external features there is added the charm of faultlessly even and snowy teeth and a smile that illumines the entire face shining in the eyes as it plays about the pretty sensitive mouth a young woman is fully equipped for conquest stuyvesant gazed in fascination uncontrollable he envied the prim precise creature who sat unbending severe and even while keeping up a semblance of interest in the conversation seemed to feel it a duty to display disapprobation of such youthful charms no woman is so assured that beauty is only skin deep as she who has none of it her manner therefore had been decidedly stiff and from that had imperceptibly advanced to condescension but when the steward presently appeared with a siphon of iced seltzer and bowing deferentially said he hoped everything was to miss rays liking and added that it seemed a long time since they had seen the captain and supposed he must be a colonel now the thin eyebrows of the tall maiden were uplifted into little arches that paralleled the furrows of her brow as she inquired miss ray from fort leavenworth the answer was a smiling nod of assent as the younger lady buried her lovely dark face in the flowers set before her by the assiduous waiter and stuyvesant felt sure she was trying to control an inclination to laugh well you must excuse me if i have been a little slow said the elder in evident perturbation you see we meet such queer people travelling sometimes dont you find it so the dark face was dimpling now with suppressed merriment yes occasionally was the smiling answer but then being the daughter of an army officer pursued the other hurriedly you have to travel a great deal i suppose you really have no home she essayed in the halfhopeful tone to be expected of one who considered that a being so endowed by nature must suffer some compensatory discomforts yes and no answered miss ray urbanely in one sense we army girls have no home in another we have homes everywhere it is a reproach in the eyes of certain severe moralists that a fellowbeing should be so obviously content with his or her lot the elder woman seemed to feel it a duty to acquaint this beaming creature with the manifest deficiency in her moral makeup yes but i should think most any one would rather have a real home a place where they werent bounden to anybody no matter if it was homely she called it humbly and associated it in mind with the words of paynes immortal song now when i went to see colonel ray about our society he told me he had to break up everything going to cuba but he didnt mention about your going west father was a little low in his mind that day said miss ray a shade of sadness passing over her face both my brothers are in the service and one is barely seventeen out at service interrupted the other you dont mean no was the laughing answer and in miss rays enjoyment of the situation her eyes came perilously near seeking those of mr stuyvesant which she well knew were fixed upon her i mean that both are in the army well i thought not still i didnt know its all rather new to me this dealin with soldiers but i suppose ill get to know all about it after a spell our societys getting much encouraged red cross queried miss ray with uplifted brows and evident interest yet a suspicion of incredulity well same thing only we dont propose to levy contributions right and left like they do i am vicepresident of the society of patriotic daughters of america you know i thought perhaps your father might have told you and our association is selfsustaining at least it will be as soon as we are formally recognized by the government you know the red cross hasnt any real standing whereas our folks expect the president to issue the order right away making us part of the regular hospital brigade now your father was very encouraging though some officers we talked to were too stuck up to be decent when i called on general drayton he just as much as up and told me wed only be in the way just here it must be owned miss ray found it necessary to dive under the table for a handkerchief which she had not dropped mr stuyvesant ignoring the teachings of his childhood and gazing over the rim of his coffeecup observed that she was with difficulty concealing her merriment then all of a sudden her face that had been so full of radiance became suddenly clouded by concern and distress the door at the head of the car had swung suddenly open and remained so despite the roar and racket of the wheels and the sweep of dust and cinders down the aisle the steward glanced up from his cupboard opposite the kitchen window at the rear and quickly motioned to some one to shut that door a waiter sprang forward and then came the steward himself the look in the girls face was enough for stuyvesant he whirled about to see what had caused it and became instantly aware of a stoutbuilt soldier swaying uneasily at the entrance and in thick tones arguing with the waiter he saw at a glance the man had been drinking and divined he was there to get more liquor he was on the point of warning the steward to sell him none but was saved the trouble the steward bent down and whispered this makes the second time hes come in since six oclock i refused to let him have a drop cant something be done to keep him out we cant lock the door you know sir stuyvesant quickly arose and stepped up the aisle by this time everybody was gazing towards the front entrance in concern and curiosity the colored waiter was still confronting the soldier as though to prevent his coming farther into the car the soldier with flushed and sodden face and angry eyes had placed a hand on the broad shoulder of the servant and was clumsily striving to put him aside stuyvesants tall athletic figure suddenly shut both from view never hesitating he quickly elbowed the negro out of the way seized the doorknob with his left hand throwing the door wide open then looking the soldier full in the face pointed to the tourist car with the other go back at once was all he said the man had been hardly six days in service and had learned little of army life or ways he was a whole american citizen however if he was half drunk and the average american thinks twice before he obeys a mandate of any kind this one coming from a tall young swell was especially obnoxious the uniform as yet had little effect on recruit murray where he hailed from the sight of it had for years provoked only demonstrations of derision and dislike he didnt know who the officer was didnt want to know didnt care what he wanted was whiskey and so long as the money was burning in his pocket he knew no reason why he shouldnt have it therefore instead of obeying he stood there sullen and swaying scowling up as though in hate and defiance into the grave set young face another second and the thing was settled stuyvesants right hand grasped the blue collar at the throat the long slender fingers gripping tight and half shot half lifted the amazed recruit across the swaying platform and into the reeling car ahead there he plumped his captive down into a seat and sent for the corporal connelly came rubbing his eyes and took in the situation at a glance i ordered him not to leave the car three hours ago sir he quickly spoke but after supper i got drowsy and fell asleep in my section then he skinned out id iron him sir if i had anything of the kind no said stuyvesant dont think of that just keep a watch over him and forbid his leaving the section no sir none of that he added as in drunken dignity murray was searching for a match to light his pipe and hide his humiliation there must be no smoking in this flimsy car corporal a spark would set fire to it in a second them was my orders sir this fellow knows it as well as i do but hes given trouble one way or other ever since we started you hear that again now murray no drink no smoke ill see to it that he doesnt quit the car again sir he concluded turning appealingly to the young officer and stuyvesant taking a quiet look up and down the dimly lighted dusty aisle was about to return to the diner when murray struggled to his feet balked in his hope of getting more drink and defrauded as in his muddled condition it seemed to him of the solace of tobacco the devil in him roused to evil effort by the vile liquor procured surreptitiously somewhere along the line the time had come for him as he judged to assert himself before his fellows and prove himself a man you think youre a better man than i am he began thickly glaring savagely at the young officer but ill be even with you young fellow ill and here ended the harangue for one broad hand clapped over the leering mouth and the other grasping the back of his collar corporal connelly jammed him down on the seat with a shock that shook the car shut up you drunken fool he cried dont mind him lieutenant hes only a day at the depot sir sit still you blackguard or ill smash you this to murray who half suffocated was writhing in his effort to escape a ch he cried with sudden wrenching away of the brawny hand the beast has bitten me and the broad palm dripping with blood was held up to the light deeply indented there were the jagged marks of murrays teeth here foster hunt grab this man and dont let him stir hand or foot see what you get for giving a drunkard money grab him i say shouted connelly grinning with mingled pain and wrath as the lieutenant led him to the washstand another recruit a stalwart fellow who had apparently seen previous service sprang to the aid of the first two named and between them though he stormed and struggled a moment the wretch was jammed and held in his corner stanching the blood as best he could and bandaging the hand with his own kerchief stuyvesant bade the corporal sit at an open window a moment for he looked a trifle faint and sick it was a brutal bite but connelly was game that blackguards got to be taught theres a god in israel he exclaimed as he turned back to the rear of the car i beg the lieutenants pardon but he is not in the regular army i see with a glance at the collar of the young officers blouse we sometimes get hard cases to deal with and this is one of them this kind of a cur wouldnt hesitate to shoot an officer in the back or stab him in the dark if he didnt like him i hope the lieutenant may never be bothered with him again no damn you he added between his set teeth as he looked down at the sullen scowling prisoner what you ought to have is a good hiding and what youll get if you give any more trouble is a roping hand and foot we ought to have irons on a trip like this lieutenant he continued glancing up into the calm refined face of the young soldier but i can get a rope if you say so and tie him in his berth i have no authority in the matter said stuyvesant reflectively no one has but you that i know of perhaps hell be quiet when he cools down and the lieutenant looked doubtfully at the semisavage in the section nearest the door hell give no more trouble this night anyhow said connelly as the officer turned to go and thank you sir for this and he held up the bandaged hand but ill keep my eyes peeled whenever hes about hereafter and youll be wise to do the same sir for one instant as the lieutenant paused at the doorway and looked back the eyes of the two men met his so brave and blue and clear the others murrays furtive bloodshot and full of hate then the door slammed and stuyvesant was gone twice again that night he visited the recruit car at ten oclock after enjoying for an hour or more the sight of miss ray in animated chat with two of the six women passengers of the sleeper and the sound of her pleasant voice stuyvesant wandered into the diner for a glass of cool budweiser thats an ugly brute of a fellow that bit your corporal sir said the steward i was in there just now and hes as surly as a cur dog yet stuyvesant nodded without a word he was in a petulant frame of mind he wanted worst kind as he would have expressed it to know that girl but not a glance would she give him she owed him one thought he for letting that rabbit go moreover being an army girl as he had learned she should not be so offish with an officer then the readiness with which the corporal had spotted him as a volunteer as not a regular occurred to him and added to his faintly irritable mood true his coatcollar bore the telltale letters u s v but he had served some years with one of the swellest of swell eastern regiments whose setup and style were not excelled by the regulars whose officers prided themselves upon their dress and bearing if it was because he was not of the regular service that miss ray would not vouchsafe him a glance mr stuyvesant was quite ready to bid her understand he held himself as high as any soldier in her fathers famous corps if it was not that then what in blazes was it he knew that in travelling cross continent in this way it was considered the proper thing for an officer of the regular army to send his card by the porter to the wife or daughter of any brother officer who might be aboard and to tender such civilities as he would be glad to have paid his own were he so provided he wondered whether it would do to send his pasteboard with a little note to the effect that he had once met colonel ray at the united service club and would be glad to pay his respects to the colonels daughter it was an unusual thing for mr stuyvesant to quaff beer at any time except after heavy exercise at polo or tennis but tonight he was ruffled and when the porter began making up the berths and dames and damsels disappeared he had wandered disconsolately into the diner and ordered beer as his excuse then he crossed the platform and entered the tourist the night was hot and close the men were lying two in a berth as a rule the upper berths not being used one or two murray among them had not removed their trousers but most of them were stretched out in their undergarments while others chatting in low tones were watching the brakeman turning down the lights they made way respectfully as the lieutenant entered connelly came to meet him and nodded significantly at murray who lay in a berth near the middle of the car still carefully watched by hunt foster wearied had turned in and with his face to the window seemed to have fallen asleep the conductor came through lantern in hand its the quietest and best behaved lot barring that chap i ever carried said he to stuyvesant but hes wicked enough for a dozen wonder he dont go to sleep humph says he wants a bottle of beer grunted connelly cant get to sleep without it i wouldnt give it to him if i had a kag he doesnt deserve it of course said the conductor what he ought to have is an allaround licking but ive known beer to have a soothing effect on men whod been drinking and it might put him to sleep and save bother let him have it said stuyvesant briefly ill send it in by the steward and corporal if you or any of your men would like it ill be glad some two or three looked quickly and expectantly up as though they might like it very much but corporal connelly said he dassent he never took a drink of anything on duty since three years ago come fourth of july so the others were abashed and would not ask older hands would not have held their tongues to murrays surprise a brimming glass of cool beer was presently offered him he gulped it thirstily down and without a word held out the glass for more a grinning waiter obliged him with what remained in the bottle murray asked if that was all then with something like a grunt of dissatisfaction rolled heavily over and turned his face to the wall well of all the ungrateful cads i ever seen said hunt youre the worst dye know who sent that beer murray it was the young officer you insulted but murrays only answer at the moment was a demand that hunt shut up and let him go to sleep the last thing stuyvesant remembered before dozing off was that the smell of those journalboxes was getting worse at two in the morning in the heart of the desert the conductor had made his way through the train and remarked that despite that unpleasant odor every man of the recruit detachment was sound asleep in a berth next the door the steward of the diningcar had found room and the entire car seemed wrapped in repose five minutes later by the watch it was wrapped in flames speaking of the matter later in the morning the brakeman said it didnt seem ten seconds after he had pulled the bellrope and given the alarm before lieutenant stuyvesant a tall slim figure in pajamas and slippers came bounding to his aid the flames even then were bursting from under the steps and platform the dense smoke pouring from the rear door of the recruit car and coughing choking blinded staggering some of them scorched and blistered most of them clad only in undershirt and drawers the luckless young troopers came groping forth and were bundled on into the interior of the diner some in their excitement strove to leap from the train before it came to its bumping grinding halt some were screaming in pain and panic only one hunt was dressed throughout in uniform the steward of the diner nearly suffocated before being dragged out of his berth was making vain effort to shove a way back into the blazing car crying that all his money was under that pillow but it was impossible to stem the torrent of human forms the instant the train stopped the flames shot upward through the skylight and ventilator and then the voice of connelly was heard yelling for aid seizing a blanket that had been dragged after him by some bewildered recruit and throwing it over his head and shoulders stuyvesant bending low dove headlong into the dense wall of smoke the flames came leaping and lapping out from the doorway the instant he disappeared and a groan of dismay arose from the little group already gathered at the side of the track five ten seconds of awful suspense and then bending lower still his loose clothing afire his hair and eyebrows singed his face black with soot and smoke and seared by flame the young officer came plunging forth dragging by the legs a prostrate howling man and after them blind and staggering came connelly eager hands received and guided the rescuers leading them into the diner while the trainmen worked the stiff levers broke loose the coupling and swung their lanterns in frantic signals to the engineer far ahead another moment and the blazing car was drawn away run up the track a hundred yards and left to illumine the night and burn to ashes while male passengers swarmed about the diningcar proffering stimulant and consolation besides stuyvesant and corporal connelly two soldiers were seriously burned every stitch of clothing not actually on their persons at the moment of their escape was already consumed and with it every ounce of their soldier rations and supplies the men least injured were those who being nearest the rear door were first to escape the men worst burned were those longest held within the blazing car barring one murray whom hunt had thoughtfully bound hand and foot as he slept reasoning that in that way only might his guardians enjoy a like blessing connelly had tripped over the roaring bully as he lay on his back in the aisle stuyvesant had rushed in and between them they dragged him to a place of safety there his limbs unbound his tongue unloosed murray indulged in a blast of malediction on the road the company the government his comrades even his benefactors and then thoughtfully demanded drink there was no longer a stern corporal to forbid for connelly suffering and almost sightless had been led into a rear coach but there was no longer money with which to buy for fosters last visible cent had gone up in smoke and flame and scorched and smarting in a dozen places wrapped in a blanket in lieu of clothes the darkeyed young soldier sat still trembling from excitement by the roadside it was three hours before the wreck could be cleared another car procured and the recruits bundled into it then as dawn was spreading over the firmament the train pushed on and the last thing gerard stuyvesant was conscious of before exhausted he dropped off to troubled sleep was that a soft slender hand was renewing the cool bandage over his burning eyes and that he heard a passenger say that little brunette that little miss ray was worth the hull carload of women put together she just went in and nursed and bandaged the burned men like as though theyd been her own brothers certainly the young lady had been of particular service in the case of connelly and one of the seriously injured recruits she had done something for every man whose burns deserved attention with a single exception recruit foster had declared himself in need of no aid and with his face to the wall lay well out of sight chapter iii at one of the desert stations in the humboldt valley a physician boarded the train under telegraphic orders from the company and went some distance up the road he had brought lint and bandages and soothing lotions but in several cases said no change was advisable that with handkerchiefs contributed by the passengers and bandages made from surplus shirts little miss ray had extemporized well and had skilfully treated her bewildered patients questioned and complimented both miss ray blushingly admitted that she had studied first aid to the wounded and had had some instructions in the post hospitals of more than one big frontier fort passengers had ransacked bags and trunks and presented spare clothing to the few recruits whom the garments would fit but most of the men were shoeless and blanketed when morning dawned and all were thankful when served with coffee and a light breakfast though many even then were too much excited and some in too much pain to eat mellen the laughing and joyous lad of yesterday was nursing a blistered hand and arm and stalking about the car in stocking feet and a pair of trousers two sizes too big for him murray now that the corporal was no longer able to retain active command had resumed his truculent and swaggering manner almost the first thing he did was to demand more money of foster and call him a liar when told that every dollar was burned then he sought to pick a fight with hunt who had as he expressed it roped him like a steer but the carload by this time had had too much of his bluster and made common cause against him two brawny lads gave him fair warning that if he laid a finger on hunt they would lay him out then he insisted on seeing the corporal and complaining of illtreatment and with such diversion the long day wore on stuyvesant refreshed by several hours of sleep yet looking somewhat singed and blistered went through the car to see the sufferers along towards eleven oclock he had inquired of the porter for miss ray who was not visible when he had finished his toilet and was told that she had remained up until after the doctor came aboard and was now sleeping finding three of the men stretched in the berths with comrades fanning them he ordered cooling drinks compounded by the steward and later as they began the climb of the sierras and the men grew hungry he sought to get a substantial luncheon for them on the diner but was told their supply on hand was barely sufficient for the regular passengers so when the train stopped at truckee he tumbled off with three of the party bought up a quantity of bread and cheese soda crackers and fruit and after consultation with the conductor wired ahead to sacramento for a hot dinner for eighteen men to be ready at the restaurant in the station it being now certain that they could not reach san francisco before midnight the company ought to do that said the trainmen and the company had authorized the light breakfast tendered earlier in the day in view of the fact that every item of personal property in possession of the recruits had been destroyed together with every crumb of their rations nobody questioned that the company would only be too glad to do that much for the men so nearly burned alive in their travelling holocaust not a doubt was entertained among either passengers or trainmen as to the origin of the fire it had started underneath and the dry woodwork burned like tinder and what was there to cause it but those blazing boxes on the forward truck the conductor knew there had been no smoking aboard the car and that every man was asleep when he went through at two oclock the brakeman had prophesied disaster and danger it was gods mercy that warned the poor fellows in time not until along in the afternoon as they were spinning swiftly down through the marvellous scenery about blue caсon and cape horn did miss ray again appear stuyvesant had been sitting awhile by connelly and had arranged with him to wire to the presidio for ambulances to meet the party at oakland pier for two at least would be unable to walk and until provided with shoes and clothing few could march the distance then he had spent a few minutes with the other patients when he returned to the sleeper there at last was the object of so many of his thoughts but she was reclining wearily her head upon a pillow and the austere maid and two other women stood guard over her a severe headache was the explanation and stuyvesant felt that he must defer his intrusion until later somewhere down the western slope of the sierras he found at a station some delicious cherries and a little basket of the choicest he made bold to send with his compliments and the hope that her indisposition would soon disappear the porter came back with the ladys thanks the cherries were lovely but stuyvesant observed that not more than one or two found their way to those pearly teeth the rest being devoured by her too devoted attendants it was after nine at night when he marshalled his motley party into the diningroom at sacramento and they were made glad by substantial wellcooked food with abundant hot coffee they thanked him gratefully did many of the young fellows and hoped they might meet more such officers an elderly passenger who had quietly noted the outlay of money to which mr stuyvesant had been subjected strolled up to the manager that young gentleman has had to pay too much today just receipt the bill if you please said he and drew forth a roll of treasury notes stuyvesant went in search of this new benefactor when he heard of it there was really no necessity sir said he though i fully appreciate your kindness the company will doubtless reimburse me for any such outlay if they will reimburse you my young friend said the veteran traveller drily theyll reimburse me at all events i know them better than you do and i dont intend to let you bear all the risk the lieutenant argued but the elder was firm as the men shuffled back to the train with full stomachs and brightened faces murray hulking by them with averted eyes and mellen tendering a grinning salute the manager came forward theres one man shy sir even counting the dinners sent aboard said he and hunt hearing it turned back and explained it is foster sir he said he wasnt hungry and couldnt eat i reckon its because he wouldnt turn out in such looking clothes as were given him yet when stuyvesant went to the car to see whether the young soldier could not be induced to change his mind it was discovered that he had turned out his berth was empty nor did he appear until just as the train was starting he explained that he had stepped off on the outer side away from the crowd for a little fresh air there was plenty of bread and cheese left from luncheon he didnt care for anything really and indeed he seemed most anxious to get back to his berth and away from the lieutenant in whose presence he was obviously and painfully ill at ease stuyvesant turned away feeling a trifle annoyed or hurt he couldnt tell which and swung himself to the platform of the sleeper as it came gliding by at last he could hope to find opportunity to thank miss ray for her attention to the injured men and incidentally her ministrations on his own account then once arrived at san francisco where he had friends of rank and position in the army he would surely meet someone who knew her father well and possibly herself some one to present him in due form but for the present he could only hope to say a conventional word or two of gratitude and he was striving to frame his thoughts as he hastened into the brightly lighted car and towards the section where last he had seen her it was occupied by a newcomer a total stranger and the three women recently sharing her section and more than sharing her cherries were now in animated chat across the aisle in blank surprise and disappointment stuyvesant turned and sought the porter miss ray yes suh she done got off at sacramento suh dere was friends come to meet her and took her away in the carriage once more stuyvesant found himself constrained to seek the society of the maiden of uncertain years her presence was forbidding her countenance severe and her voice and intonation something appalling but she might know miss rays address he could at least write his thanks but he found the vicepresident of the order of the patriotic daughters of america in evil mood she didnt know miss rays address and in the further assertion that she didnt want to know too readily betrayed the fact that her petulance was due to her not having been favored therewith after all i did for her last night and today twould have been a mighty little thing to tell where she was going to stop but just soons her fine friends came aboard she dropped us like as if we werent fit to notice the irate lady however seemed to find scant sympathy and support in the faces of her listeners some of whom had long since wearied of her strident voice and oracular ways it was well remembered that so far from being of aid or value in caring for the injured men she had pestered people with undesired advice and interference had made much noise and no bandages and later when an official of the company boarded the train had constituted herself spokeswoman for the passengers not at all to their advantage and much to his disgust then finding that miss ray was looked upon as the only heroine of the occasion she had assumed a guardianship so to speak over that young lady which became almost possessive in form so passively was it tolerated she had plied the girl with questions as to the friends who were to meet her on arrival in san francisco and miss ray had smilingly given evasive answers when therefore they neared sacramento and the vicepresident announced her intention of sallying forth to see to it that proper victuals were provided for her soldier boys miss ray had a few minutes in which to make her preparations and the next thing the vicepresident saw of her supposed ward and dependant that young lady was in the embrace of a richly dressed and most distinguished looking woman whose gray hair only served to heighten the refinement of her features just behind the elder lady stood a silkhatted dignitary in the prime of life and behind him a footman or valet to whom the porter was handing miss rays belongings and what the vicepresident so much resented was that miss ray had not only never mentioned her purpose of leaving the train at sacramento but never so much as introduced her friends at whom the vicepresident smiled invitingly while accepting miss rays courteous but brief thanks for so much attention during the afternoon but who merely bowed in acknowledgment when she would have addressed them on the subject of miss rays being of so much help to her when help was so much needed and who spirited the young lady away to the handsome carriage awaiting her the vicepresident was distinctly of the opinion that folks didnt need to slink off in that way unless they were ashamed of where they were going or afraid of being found out whereat stuyvesant found himself gritting his teeth with wrath and so whirled about and left her it was after midnight when they reached the pier at oakland there under the great trainshed track after track was covered with troop cars and a full regiment lay sleeping an alert young officer of the guard raised his hand in salute as stuyvesant addressed him no there were no ambulances no soldiers from the presidio they might be waiting across the ferry but how was he to get the injured men across the ferry thought stuyvesant two of them would have to be carried the long train except that recruit car was now emptied the throng of passengers had gone on through the waitingrooms and up the stairway to the saloon deck of the huge ferryboat if he purposed going no time was to be lost and the porter bearing his handluggage ventured a word to that effect stuyvesant looked back there were protruding heads at many of the windows of the recruit car but obedient to the instructions given by connelly no man apparently had left his place and connelly though suffering had evidently resumed control much benefited by the services of another physician who had boarded the train in the late afternoon and renewed the bandages and dressings of the injured men then stuyvesant became suddenly aware of a messengerboy with a telegram it was addressed to lieutenant stuyvesant a d c train no oakland tearing it open he read as follows report by wire condition of recruit foster if serious have him conveyed to st pauls hospital commission as lieutenant and signal officer awaits him here it was signed by the adjutantgeneral at department headquarters san francisco but the boy had still another this too he held forth to stuyvesant and the latter not noticing that it was addressed commanding officer u s troops train no mechanically opened and read and made a spring for the car the message was from port costa barely thirty miles away and briefly said any your men missing soldier left car here believed jumped overboard return trip ferryboat one man was missing recruit foster for whom a commission as lieutenant and signal officer was waiting at department headquarters could not be found chapter iv in the busy week that followed lieutenant stuyvesant had his full share of work and no time for social distraction appointed to the staff of general vinton with orders to sail without delay for manila the young officer found his hours from morn till late at night almost too short for the duties demanded of him the transports were almost ready the troops had been designated for the expedition the supplies were being hurried aboard the general had his men all the livelong day at the rifleranges or drillgrounds for most of the brigade were raw volunteers who had been rushed to the point of rendezvous with scant equipment and with less instruction the camps were thronged with men in all manner of motley as to dress and no little variety as to dialect few of the newly appointed officers in the department of supply were versed in their duties and the young regulars of the staff of the commanding general were working sixteen hours out of the twentyfour coaching their comrades of the volunteers the streets were crowded with citizens eager to welcome and applaud the arriving troops hotels were thronged restaurants were doing a thriving business for the army ration did not too soon commend itself in its simplicity to the stomachs of some thousands of young fellows who had known better diet if no better days many of their number having left luxurious homes and surroundings and easy salaries to shoulder a musket for three dollars a week private soldiers in blue flannel shirts were learning to stand attention and touch their caps to young men in shoulderstraps whom they had laughed at and called tin soldiers a year agone because they belonged to the militia a thing most of the gilded youth in many of our western cities seemed to scorn as beneath them in the wave of patriotic wrath and fervor that swept the land when the maine was done to death in havana harbor many and many a youth who has sneered at the state guardsmen learned to wish that he too had given time and honest effort to the school of the soldier for now unless he had sufficient pull to win for him a staff position his only hope was in the ranks and so even in the recruit detachments of the regulars were found scores of young men whose social status at home was on a plane much higher than that of many of their officers but the time had come when the long and patient effort of the once despised militiaman had won deserved recognition the commissions in the newly raised regiments were held almost exclusively by officers who had won them through long service with the national guard and in the midst of all the whirl of work in which he found himself lieutenant stuyvesant had been summoned to the tent of general drayton commanding the great encampment on the sandlots south of the presidio reservation and bidden to tell what he knew of one walter f foster recruit th cavalry member of the detachment sent on via the denver and rio grande to ogden then transferred to the southern pacific train number en route to san francisco which detachment was burned out of its car and the car out of its train early on the morning of the of june somewhere in the neighborhood of a station with the uncouth name of beowawe in the heart of the humboldt desert and which recruit foster had totally disappeared the following evening having been last seen by his comrades as the train was ferried across carquinez straits thirty miles from oakland pier and later by railway hands at port costa on the back trip of the big boat to the benicia side there was little stuyvesant could tell he hardly remembered the man except as a finefeatured young fellow who seemed shy nervous and unstrung something stuyvesant had hitherto attributed to the startling and painful experience of the fire and who furthermore seemed desirous of dodging the lieutenant which circumstance stuyvesant could not fathom at all and if anything rather resented he explained to the general that he was in no wise responsible for the care of the detachment he had only casually met them at ogden and circumstances later had thrown him into closer relation but the veteran general was desirous of further information he sat at the pine table in his plainly furnished tent looking thoughtfully into the frank and handsome face of the young officer his fingers beating a tattoo on the tabletop the generals eyes were sombre even sad at times beneath them lay lines of care and sorrow his voice was low his manner grave courteous even cold he was studying his man and discussing in his mind how far he might confide in him obedient to the generals invitation stuyvesant had taken a chair close to the commanders table and sat in silence awaiting further question at last it came you say he left nothing no trace behind there was nothing to leave general he had only a suit of underwear in which he escaped from the car the men say he had had money and a valise filled with things which he strove to keep from sight of any of his fellows they say that he befriended a tough character by the name of murray who had enlisted with him and they think murray knows something about him where is murray now asked the chief in the guardhouse at the presidio he gave the corporal in charge a good deal of trouble and was placed under guard the morning they reached the city they had to spend the night with the iowa regiment at oakland pier again the grayhaired general gave himself to thought could you tell how he was dressed when he disappeared he finally asked a young man in the second sleeper gave him a pair of worn blue serge trousers and his morocco slippers somebody else contributed a nйgligй shirt and a black silk travelling cap he was wearing these when last i spoke to him at sacramento where he would not eat anything i i had wired ahead for dinner for them yes said the general with sudden indignation in his tone and im told the company refused to reimburse you what excuse did they give its of little consequence sir laughed stuyvesant the loss hasnt swamped me thats as may be answered the general its the principle involved that company is coining money by the thousands transporting troops at full rates and some of the cars it furnished were simply abominable what was the excuse given they said or rather some official wrote that they wouldnt reimburse us because they had already had to sustain the loss of that car due to the carelessness of our men and their own trainhands general knew there was no smoking and the men were all asleep foster had a very narrow escape and corporal connelly was badly burned lugging murray out the general took from a stack of correspondence at his right hand a letter on club paper studied it a moment and then glanced up at stuyvesant was not colonel rays regiment with you at chickamauga he asked it was expected when i left general you mean the th kentucky i mean his volunteer regiment yes i was wondering whether any of his family had gone thither but you wouldnt be apt to know and stuyvesant felt the blood beginning to mount to his face he could answer for it that one member had not gone thither he was wondering whether he ought to speak of it when drayton finally turned upon him and held forth the letter read that said he but regard it as confidential it was such a letter as one frank old soldier might write another it was one of a dozen that had come to drayton that day asking his interest in behalf of some young soldier about joining his command it was dated at cincinnati five days earlier and before stuyvesant had read half through the page his hand was trembling dear drayton it said im in a snarl and i want your help my sisters pet boy came out to try his hand at ranching near us last year he had some money from his father and everything promised well for his success if he could have stuck to business but he couldnt billy ray commanding my first squadron was stationed with me and the first thing i knew the boy was head over ears in love with billys daughter i cant blame him marion junior is as pretty a girl as ever grew up in the army and shes a brave and winsome lass besides her dad all over as her mother says walters ranch was thirty miles away but hed ride the sixty six times a week if need be to have a dance with maidie ray and the cattle could go to the wolves then came the war the governor of kentucky gave ray the command of a regiment and that fool boy of mine begged him to take him along ray couldnt besides i dont think he half liked walters devotions to the girl though he hadnt anything against him exactly then i was retired and sent home and the next thing my sister mrs foster came tearing in to tell me walter had gone and enlisted enlisted in the regulars at denver and was going to frisco and manila as he couldnt get to cuba shes completely broke up about it foster went to washington and saw the president and got a commission for him in the signal corps volunteers and he should be with you by the time you get this so i wired ahead he isnt altogether a bad lot but lacks horse sense and gave his parents a good deal of anxiety in his varsity days abroad he was in several scrapes along with a boon companion who seems to have been so much like him physically and morally that motherlike mrs foster is sure that very much of which her walter was accused was really done by wallys chum im not so sure of this myself but at all events foster made it a condition that the boy should cut loose from the evil association as he called it before certain debts would be paid i dont know what soldier stuff there is in him if any but give him a fair start for old times sake i need not tell you that i wish you all the joy and success the double stars can bring id be in it too but for that old spotsylvania shothole and rheumatics my eagles however will fold their wings and take a rest but well flap em and scream every time you make a tenstrike yours as ever martindale stuyvesant did not look up at once after finishing the letter when he did and before he could speak the general was holding out some telegrams and these too he took and read the almost agonized appeals of a mother for news of her boy the anxious inquiries coupled with suggestions of the veteran soldier concerning the only son of a beloved sister draytons fine thoughtful face was full of sympathy his eyes clouded with anxiety and sorrow martindale was not the only old soldier in search of son or nephew that fateful summer you see how hard it is to be able to send no tidings whatever he said i sent to you in the hope that you might think of some possible explanation might suggest some clue or theory can you there was just one moment of silence and then again stuyvesant looked up his blue eyes meeting the anxious gaze of the commander general he hazarded it is worth while to try sacramento miss ray is there chapter v at sunset that evening the regiments destined to embark with the expedition commanded by general vinton were paraded for inspection in full marching order while a dozen other commands less fortunate looked enviously on the day had been raw and chilly the wind blew salt and strong sending the fog in dripping clouds sailing in at the golden gate obscuring all the bold northern shore and streaming up the sandy slopes and over the wide wastes south of sutro heights men who owned overcoats were few and far between so while the designated battalions stood and shivered in the wet grass the mass of spectators hovered about in ponchos or wrapped in blankets the downturned brims of their campaign hats dripping heavily and contributing much to the weird and unmilitary look of the wearers officers had donned mackintoshes and heavy boots badges of rank except in cases of those provided with the regulation overcoat were lost to sight only among the regulars and one or two regiments made up from the national guard were uniforms so complete that in their foulweather garb it was possible to distinguish colonel from subaltern staff sergeant from private in front of the guardhouse at the presidio a dozen cavalrymen armed with the new carbine and dressed throughout for winter service this being san francisco june had formed ranks under command of a sergeant and stood silently at ease awaiting the coming of the officer of the day the accurate fit of their warm overcoats the cut of their trooper trousers the polish of their brasses and buttons the snug trim set of their belts all combined to tell the skilled observer that these were regulars as such they were objects of interest and close scrutiny to the little knots of volunteers who had sauntered in to pick up points to the former it looked odd and out of gear to see the foragecaps and broad white stripes of commissioned officers mingling with the slouch hats and illfitting nether garments of the rank and file it was too early in the campaign for the boys to have settled down to realization of the subtle distinction between their status as soldiers of the nation and citizens of a sovereign state to private a of the far westerners his company commander was still billy old boy or at best cap save when actually in ranks and on drill or parade to the silently observant volunteer on the other hand it was just as odd to note that when a grayhaired veteran sergeant issuing from the guardhouse caught sight of a trig alert little fellow with beardless face and boyish features and keen snapping dark eyes hastening towards him in the garb of a lieutenant of cavalry the veteran was suddenly transformed into a rigid statue in light blue standing attention and at the salute a phenomenon that extracted from the infant officer only a perfunctory touch of finger to cap visor and not so much as a glance how could the boys from far nebraska be supposed to know that the little chap had spent his whole life in the shadow of the flag and had many a time in baby days been dandled on the very arm that was now so deferentially bent and uplifted in soldier homage what was there in the manner of the youngster to betray the fact that he dreaded old sergeant rigneys criticism even more than that of his commanding officer then came another phenomenon at a brief curt sergeant get out your prisoners from the beardless lips there was instant fumbling of big keys and clanking of iron from the hidden recesses of the guardhouse the dismounted troopers sprang suddenly to attention the guard split in two at its middle each half facing outward marched half a dozen paces away like the duellists of old days from the back to back position halted faced front once more and stood again at ease with a broad gap of a dozen paces between their inner flanks into this space shuffling dejectedly in some cases stalking defiantly in others slinking shivering and decrepit in the case of two or three poor wrecks of the rum fiend a stream of humanity in soiled soldier garb came pouring from the prison door and lined up under the eyes of vigilant noncommissioned officers in front of the young lieutenant in command there they stood their eyes shifting nervously from group to group of huddling spectators their shoulders hunched up to their ears the riffraff of the garrison the few desperate dangerous characters from the surrounding camps an uncouth uncanny lot at any time but looking its worst in the drip of the floating fogwreaths and the gloom and despond of the dying day the boom of the sunset gun from alcatraz fell sullenly on the ear even as the soft trumpets of the cavalry close at hand began sounding the retreat at its last prolonged note the sharp crack of an old threeinch rifle echoed the report from alcatraz and from the invisible mistshrouded top of the staff the dripping folds of the stormflag came flapping down in view limp and bedraggled and the guard sprang again to attention as a burly redfaced heartylooking soldier with a captains insignia in loop and braid on the sleeves of his overcoat broke a way through the group of lookerson and barely waiting for the salute and report of the young lieutenant commanding began a sharp scrutiny of the prisoners before him down along the line he went until at the fourth man from the left in the front rank he stopped short a bulky thickset soldier stood there a sullen semidefiant look about his eyes a grim set to the jaws bristling with a weekold beard of dirty black then came the snapping colloquy your name murray thats what they call me what was your name before that jim whereat there was a titter in the ranks of prisoners some of the guard even allowed their mouths to expand and the groups of volunteers chuckling in keen enjoyment came edging in closer instantly the voice of the officer of the guard was heard ordering silence and faces straightened out in the twinkling of an eye the elder officer the captain grew a trifle redder but he was master of himself and the situation it is with schoolboys as with soldiers their master is the man whom pranks or impudence cannot annoy the officer of the day let no tone of temper into his next question looking straight into the shifting eyes he waited for perfect silence and then spoke jim what i wish the name under which you served in your previous enlistment never said id served before no you declared you had not but i know better youre a deserter from the seventh cavalry the face under the shrouding campaign hat went gray white with sudden twitch of the muscles then set again rigid and defiant the eyes snapped angrily the answer was sharp yet seemed as soldiers say to hang fire a second never seen the seventh cavalry in my life the officer of the day turned and beckoned to a figure hitherto kept well in the background screened by the groups of surrounding volunteers a man of middle age smooth shaven and stout dressed in business sacksuit came sturdily forward and took position by the captains side at sight of the newcomer murrays face that had regained a bit of its ruddy hue again turned dirty white and the boy lieutenant eying him closely saw the twitch of his thin halfhidden lips point out your man said the captain to the new arrival the civilian stepped forward and without a word twice tapped with his forefinger the broad breast of prisoner murray and never looking at him turned again to the officer of the day what was his name in the seventh asked the latter sackett the captain turned to the officer of the guard mr ray said he separate murray from the garrison prisoners and have him put in a cell that man must be carefully guarded you may dismiss the guard sir and followed by the stranger captain kress was leaving the ground when murray seemed to recover himself and in loud and defiant voice gave tongue that mans a damned liar and this is an outrage shut up murray shouted the sergeant of the guard scandalized at such violation of military proprieties its gagged youll be you idiot he added between his set teeth as with scowling face he bore down on the equally scowling prisoner come out of that and step along here ahead of me ill put you where shoutin wont help and slowly sullenly murray obeyed slowly and in silence the groups of spectators broke up and sauntered away as the last of the prisoners dragged back into the guardhouse and the guard itself broke ranks and went within doors leaving only the sentry pacing mechanically the narrow hardbeaten path the sergeant and at the turn of the road the young lieutenant whom captain kress had addressed as mr ray this officer having silently received his superiors orders and seen to it that murray was actually behind the bars had again come forth into the gathering twilight the gloaming of a cheerless day and having hastened to the bend from which point the forms of the officer of the day and his associate were still faintly visible stood gazing after them a puzzled look in his brave young face not yet a month in possession of his commission here was a lad to whom every iota of the routine of a lieutenants life was as familiar as though he had drawn the pay for a decade born and bred in the army taught from early boyhood to ride and shoot to spar and swim spending his vacation in saddle and his schooldays in unwilling study an adept in every healthful and exhilarating sport keen with rifle and revolver with shotgun and rod with bat and racquet with the gloves and indian clubs the nimblest quarterback and dodger the swiftest runner of his school it must be owned that mr sanford ray was a most indifferent scholar of geography history and languages he had rather more than a smattering because of occasional tours abroad when still at an impressionable age yet sandy took more stock as he expressed it and stawk as he called it in sioux and the sign language than he did in french or german knew far more of the rockies and sierras than he did of the alps studied the european cavalry with the eye of an accomplished critic and stoutly maintained that while they were bigger swells and prettier to look at they could neither ride nor shoot to compare with the sturdy troopers of his fathers squadron as to uniforms said sandy anybody could look swagger in the lancer and huzzar rig it takes a man to look like a soldier in what our fellows have to wear it wasnt the field garb sandy despised but the full dress the blue and yellow enormity in which our troopers are compelled to appear it had been the faint hope of his fond parents that master sandy would grow up to be something by which was meant a lawyer an artist architect engineer something in civil life that promised home and fortune but the lad from babyhood would think of nothing but the army and with much misgiving in sandys fifteenth year his father shipped him to kentucky where they were less at home than in kansas and gave him a years hard schooling in hopes of bracing up his mathematics sandy was wild to go to west point and at the bottom of his heart major ray would have rejoiced had he thought it possible for sandy to pull through but ruefully he minded him how hard a task was his own and how close he came to failure at the semiannual exams sandy hates math even more than i did said he to marion his devoted wife it was all i could do to squirm through when the course was nowhere near as hard as it is today so dont set your heart on it little woman the appointment was not so hard to get for major billy had a host of friends in his native state and an old chum at the point assured him he could coach young sandy through the preliminary and indeed he did sandy scraped in after six months vigorous work managed to hold his own through the first years tussle with algebra and geometry which he had studied hard and faithfully before was a pet in his class and the pride and joy of his mothers and sisters heart in yearling camp where he blossomed out in corporals chevrons and made as natty and active a first sergeant as could be found while the furlough class was away but the misery began with analytical and the crisis came with calculus and to the boys bitter sorrow after having been turned back one year on the former and failing utterly on the latter the verdict of the academic board went dead against him and stout old soldiers thereon cast their votes with grieving hearts for billy rays boy was a lad they hated to let go but west point rules are inexorable so too were there saddened hearts far out on the frontier where the major was commanding a cavalry post in a busy summer but neither he nor marion had one word of blame or reproach for the boy loving arms and eyes that smiled through their sorrow welcomed him when the little chap returned to them dont anybody come to meet me he wrote just let mother be home and so it was settled he sprang from the wagon that met him at the station went hand in hand with his father into the hall and then with one sob bounded into marions outstretched arms as she stood awaiting him in the little army parlor the major softly closed the door and with blinking eyes stole away to stables there had been another meeting a little later when marion the second was admitted and the girl stole silently to her brothers side and her arms twined about his neck her love for him had been something like adoration through all the years of girlhood and now though he was twenty and she eighteen its fervor seemed to know no diminution they had done their best all of them to encourage while the struggle lasted but to teach him that should failure come it would come without reproach or shame the path to success in other fields was still before him the road to the blessed refuge of home and love and sympathy would never close it was hard to reconcile the lad at first the major set him up as a young ranchman in a lovely valley in the big horn range and there he went sturdily to work but before the winter was fairly on the country was rousing to the appeals of cuba and before it was gone the maine had sunk a riddled hulk and the spring came in with a call to arms together with some two hundred young fellows all over the land sanford ray went up for examination for the vacant second lieutenancies in the army and he who had failed in analytical and calculus passed without grave trouble the more practical ordeal demanded by the war department was speedily commissioned in the artillery and to his glory and delight promptly transferred to the cavalry then came the first general break up the family had really known for the major hurried away to kentucky to assume command of the regiment of volunteers of which he had been made colonel billy junior a lad of barely seventeen enlisted at lexington as a bugler in his fathers regiment and swore hed shoot himself if they didnt let him serve the kentuckians were ordered to chickamauga the young regular to the presidio at san francisco and mrs ray after seeing her husband and youngest son started for the south returned to leavenworth where they had just settled down a week before the war began packed and stored the household furniture then taking maidie with her hurried westward to see the last of her boy whose squadron was destined for service at manila the lieutenant as they delighted in calling him joined them at denver looking perfectly at home in his field uniform and perfectly happy they left maidie to spend a week with old army friends at fort douglas and as soon as sandy was settled in his new duties and the loving mother had satisfied herself the cavalry would not be spirited away before july she accepted the eager invitation of other old friends to visit them at sacramento and there they were mother and daughter again united this very raw and foggy evening when mr ray as officer of the guard stood at the bend of the roadway east of the presidio guardhouse gazing after the vanishing forms of captain kress and the burly stranger in civilian clothes and wondering where on earth it was he had seen the latter before so engrossed was he in this that it was only when a second time addressed that he whirled about and found himself confronting a tall and slender young officer with frank handsome blue eyes and fine clearcut face a man perhaps five years his senior in age and one grade in rank for his overcoat sleeve bore the single loop and braid of a first lieutenant he was in riding boots and spurs as ray noted at first glance and there behind him stood an orderly holding the horses of both pardon me i am lieutenant stuyvesant of general vintons staff this is the officer of the guard i believe and i am sent to make some inquiry of a prisoner a man named murray we have such a man said ray eying the newcomer with soldierly appreciation of his general appearance and not without envy of his inches but hes just been locked in a cell and it will take an order from the officer of the day to fetch him out unless you could see him in there with other prisoners within earshot not very well answered stuyvesant looking curiously into the dark eyes of the youngster perhaps id better see the officer of the day at once youll find him at the club hes just gone in said ray mindful of the fact that this was the captains time for a cocktail and with a courteous salute the aidedecamp hastened away in five minutes he was back with a pencilled scrawl from kress to the effect that lieutenant stuyvesant was to be permitted to interview the prisoner murray outside the guardhouse but sentries must be placed to prevent escape quickly young ray called out the corporal and two men warned them of the duty demanded stationed them up and down the road and opposite the guardhouse but just out of earshot ordered the prisoner brought forth and then leaving stuyvesant standing at the post of number one stepped a dozen yards away into the mist a minute later out came the sergeant marshalling murray after him a sentry at his heels then in the gathering darkness the tall officer and the short thickset soldier met face to face and the latter recoiled and began glancing quickly furtively about him just how it all happened ray could never quite tell the light was now feeble the lamps were only just beginning to burn there was a moment of lowtoned talk between the two a question twice repeated in firmer tone then a sudden desperate spring and dash for liberty like a centre rush a charging bull the prisoner came head on straight to where young ray was standing heedless of a yell to halt and in less time than it takes to tell it the lithe little athlete of west points crack football team had sprung and tackled and downed him in his tracks biting cursing straining the big bully lay in the mud overpowered now by the instant dash of the guard while their bantam officer rising and disgustedly contemplating the smear of wet soil over his new overcoat was presently aware of stuyvesant bending forward extending a helping hand and exclaiming by jove but that was a neat tackle you must have been a joy to your team what was it west point last years and may i ask the name my names ray said sandy with beaming smile showing a row of even white teeth under the budding dark mustache and stuyvesant felt the warm blood surging to his forehead just as it had before that day in the generals tent i think i should have known that he presently stammered it was miss ray who so skilfully treated those poor fellows burned out on our train i suppose you heard of it why yes answered the youngster again curiously studying the face of his tall visitor then it was you she i heard about wish i werent on duty id be glad to have you over at my quarters or the club i wish so too and yet im lucky in finding you here since and here stuyvesant turned and looked resentfully towards the bedraggled figure of murray now being supported back to the cells since that fellow proved so churlish and ungrateful hes all wrath at being put behind the bars and wont answer any questions what else could he expect asked ray bluntly hes a deserter a deserter exclaimed stuyvesant in surprise who says so captain kress officer of the day or at least a cit who came with him to identify him they say he skipped from the seventh cavalry at this piece of information mr stuyvesant whirled about again in added astonishment why said he this upsets one theory completely i declare if thats true were all at sea i beg pardon he continued but now with marked hesitancy you know youve heard i suppose about foster what foster why the recruit you know the one we lost at port costa and the blue eyes were curiously and intently studying the face of the younger soldier dimly visible now that the guardhouse lamps were beginning to glow i knew there was a recruit missing and seems to me that was the name answered ray and didnt you know who he was that it was pardon me the man who lived near you had a ranch great scott you dont mean wally foster he enlisted and in the cavalry well im and now mr rays merriment overcame him i never thought there was that much to wally he was a lackadaisical sort of a spook when i saw him what possessed him to enlist hes no stuff for a soldier stuyvesant hesitated that letter of old colonel martindales was shown him in confidence but rays next impetuous outburst settled it oh by jove i see it its and here the white teeth gleamed in the lamplight for mr ray was laughing heartily yes its what smiled stuyvesant sympathetically its my sister i reckon laughed ray she once said she wouldnt marry outside of the army and he heard it oh did she said stuyvesant reflectively and then he was silent chapter vi when vintons flotilla drew out into that wonderful bay and the crowded transports rode at anchor on the tide there came swarming about them all manner of harbor craft some laden with comforts for the departing soldiery some with curiosity seekers some with contraband of war in the shape of fruit and fluids but all were warned to keep a cables length at least away the commanding general with other officers of rank was darting from ship to ship in a swift steam launch holding brief conference with the colonel in command of each and finally repairing to his own the flagship where the final adieux were exchanged the general and his aides nimbly mounted the steep stairway to the bridge the launch swung loose and then up to the masthead flew a little bunch of bunting that broke as it reached the truck and there fluttered in the strong salt wind whistling in from sea the eagerly awaited signal to up anchor and follow and then at the stern of the vanguard the waves were churned into foam as the massive screw began its spin and slowly steadily the flagship forged ahead to the accompaniment of a deafening din of steam whistles and sirens all over the bay promptly the other transports followed the movements of the leader and presently in trailing column five big black steamships thronged with cheering soldiery were slowly ploughing their way towards the grand entrance of that spacious harbor the matchless golden gate coming abreast of rockribbed alcatraz still moving at less than half speed the flagship was greeted by the thunder of the parting salute and the commanding general standing with his staff upon the bridge doffed his cap and bared his handsome head in acknowledgment the next guns were apt to hear will be the spaniards at manila and shotted guns instead of blanks said a staff officer to the tall fairhaired aidedecamp whats the matter stuyvesant beginning to feel wabbly already theres no sea here to speak of i was watching that boat was the quiet reply as the young officer pointed to a small white steamer that appeared coming in pursuit carefully picking a way through the host of harbor craft still screeching and steaming along as escort to the fleet there was an eager light in the bright blue eyes but the high color had fled stuyvesant looked as though he had not slept as much or as well of late as perfect health required and his questioner gazed keenly into his face then turned away with a smile only three days before on the register of the occidental appeared among the arrivals the entry mrs william p ray miss ray fort leavenworth and that evening at least a dozen officers called and sent up their cards and lieutenant ray came in from the presidio and was with his mother and sister an hour or more the ladies held quite a little levee in the parlor of the familiar old army hostelry and mr stuyvesant after a long and fatiguing days duty at camp accompanied his general to their very handsome apartments at the palace and then falteringly asked if he might be excused awhile he had a call or two to make the evening papers had announced the arrival of the wife and daughter of the gallant officer so well known for quarter of a century gone by to many of our citizens captain billy ray now colonel of the th kentucky and stuyvesant had determined to make an effort to meet them but he was a stranger to the officers who called and sent up their cards all old regulars lieutenant ray was with the party in the parlor and stuyvesant felt a strange shyness when striving to persuade himself to send his card to that young officer and boldly ask to be presented surely it was the proper thing to seek and meet her and thank her for her deft ministrations the night of the fire surely a man of his distinguished family and connections need not shrink from asking to be introduced to any household in all our broad domain and yet stuyvesant found himself nervous and hesitant wandering about the crowded office making pretense of interest in posters and pictures wistfully regarding the jovial knots of regulars who seemed so thoroughly at home over at the palace where so many of the general officers and their staffs were quartered he had dozens of friends here at this favorite old resort of the regular service he stood alone and to his proud and sensitive spirit it seemed as though there were a barrier between him and these professional soldiers there was the whole secret of his trouble absurd and trivial as it may seem stuyvesant shrank from the enterprise even at the very threshold shrank even from sending his card and asking for lieutenant ray for no other or better reason than that he did not know how a volunteer would be welcomed and so for nearly half an hour he hovered irresolute about the office unconscious of the many glances of interest and admiration from the keen eyes of the officers gathered in laughing groups about the marbled floor not one of their number was his superior in form and feature and his uniform was the handiwork of gothams best military tailor they saw that the instant he threw off his cape one of their number whispered that it was mr stuyvesant general vintons aide for everybody knew vinton and more than one would have been glad to take the aidedecamp by the hand and bid him welcome to their coterie but for that same odd shyness that once away from camp or garrison and in the atmosphere of metropolitan life seems to clog and hamper the kindlier impulses of the soldier presently as stuyvesant stood at the desk looking over the register he heard himself accosted by name and turning quickly hopefully found to his disappointment only a stocky little man in civilian dress yet the face was familiar and the trouble in the honest brown eyes looking up to him as though for help and sympathy went right to his heart even before the man could give his name or tell his need stuyvesant knew him and held out a cordial hand why youre our brakeman im glad to see you whats wrong ive lost me job sir was the answer with a little choke they let me out two days ago for sayin their rotten old car caught fire from the boxes i reckon you dont tell me exclaimed stuyvesant in honest indignation now how can i help you what shall we do take me to manila sir i dont need this place theres no one dependent on me i cant soldier they wont list a fellow with only two fingers and he held up a maimed hand lost the others in a freight smashup six years ago but theres a railway out there thatll be ours in a few months then youll want yankee trainhands can you do that much for me lieutenant come to me at the palace at eight oclock in the morning answered stuyvesant ill have had a chance to talk to my general by that time meanwhile and with a blush he began drawing forth his purse the brakeman smiled ive got money enough sir they paid me off and i had some put by thank you all the same mr stuyvesant oh yes sir im ready he broke off suddenly in addressing some other person and stuyvesant turning quickly to see was confronted by lieutenant ray oh howdedo going to be here long promptly queried that young gentleman havent seen you since the night at the presidio scuse me will you ive got to take er my sister wants to see the brakeman you know with you the night of the fire and with that mr ray hopped briskly away to the elevator the extrainman following leaving stuyvesant standing enviously at the counter even a brakeman could go to her and hear her pleasant words and receive that beaming smile and perhaps a clasp of that cool slender little hand while he who so longed for it all stood without the pale then an impulse that had been spurring him for half an hour overmastered him the parlors were public at least he could go and take a peep at her he started for the elevator then changed his plan turned and with his cape still thrown over his arm ascended the stairs the clerk at the office desk glanced curiously at him but the uniform was sufficient in a moment he found himself in the broad corridor and almost in front of the doorway to the parlor half a dozen groups women and officers were scattered about in merry conversation but stuyvesants eyes were riveted instantly on a little party close by the elevator shaft there hat in hand bowing and blushing stood the brakeman there with a bright genial smile on her serene and happy face stood a matronly woman who despite her soft blue eyes and fair hair and complexion was patent at once as the mother of the lovely darkeyed girl and the trim young soldier who formed the other members of the group three or four officers some of them past the meridian others young subalterns stood looking on in evident interest and stuyvesant halted spellbound not knowing just what to do it was over in a moment the railwayman confused but happy had evidently been the recipient of kind and appreciative words for his face was glowing and miss rays fairly beamed with the radiance of its smile then the door flew open as the elevatorcar stopped for passengers and the exbrakeman backed in and disappeared from view then the mother twined an arm about her daughters slender waist and two young officers sprang forward to her side together they came sauntering towards the parlor door and then all on a sudden she looked up and saw him there was no mistaking the flash of instant recognition in her beautiful eyes stuyvesants heart leaped as his eager gaze met the swift glance and noted with joy that she certainly saw and knew him more than that that the sight gave her pleasure but in another instant she had recovered herself and turned to ask some quick question of the young gallant at her side and stuyvesant who was almost at the point of bowing low found himself savagely hating those yellow straps and stripes and wishing the cavalry in perdition somebody was speaking to mr ray and he couldnt catch that young officers eye the party stopped a moment at the threshold one of the officers was saying goodnight and then a voice at stuyvesants elbow said which is lieutenant ray it was the bellboy a sudden inspiration came to stuyvesant what is it he said have you a message for him yes was the answer theyre telephoning for him from the presidio want him to come at once tell me the whole message and ill give it said stuyvesant anything wrong yes sir the clerks at the phone now but i couldnt get the trouble somethings broke loose as i understand it and that delay was fatal bounding up the steps three at a stride came a young officer breathless and made straight for the group seeing that mrs ray and miss marion were close at hand he paused one moment then with significant gesture called ray to his side then stuyvesant could not but hear every word of the sudden and startling message ray youre wanted at the barracks at once prisoners scaped and your house is robbed stuyvesant ran beside him as ray went bounding down the stairs and out into montgomery street can i be of any service can i help you some way he urged for he saw the young officer was looking white and anxious but ray hurriedly thanked him and declined he could not imagine he said what his loss might be yet something told him if anybody had escaped it was that hulking sinner murray he sprang upon the first streetcar at the corner waved his hand in parting and was whisked away westward leaving stuyvesant standing disconsolate how now could he hope to meet her the clerk at the office seemed friendly and sympathetic when stuyvesant wandered back there and gave him such particulars of the situation at the presidio as he had been able to gather over the wire it seemed that a rumor had reached the commanding officer that a number of tools had been smuggled into the guardhouse by the prisoners and by the aid of these they hoped to cut their way out despite the fact that it was growing dark a search of the prison room and cells was ordered while the prisoners stood in line in front awaiting the usual evening inspection there was no one to tell just who started it or how but all on a sudden while many of the guard were aiding in the search inside the whole array of prisoners regular and volunteer old and young except those few in irons made a sudden and simultaneous dash for liberty scattering in every direction some had already been recaptured but at least twentyfive were still at large and the post adjutant telephoning for ray briefly added that there was every evidence that his quarters had been robbed all this stuyvesant heard with an absorbing interest wondering whether it might not be possible to make it a plea or pretext on which to present himself to mrs ray and then ask to be presented to her daughter a second time he ascended the stairs and sauntering by peered in at the parlordoor yes there sat the charming matron looking so winsome and kind as she smiled upon her circle of visitors but alas they were four in number and all officers of rank in the regular service and stuyvesants shyness again overcame him moreover his brief glance into the brightly lighted apartment all decorated as it was with flags and flowers revealed miss ray seated near the window with two young cavalrymen in devoted attendance all three apparently so absorbed in their chat that he lonely and wistful escaped observation entirely until just as he passed from view her lovely dark eyes were for an instant quickly raised and though he knew it not she saw him and saw too that he was wandering aimlessly about but quick as womans intuition her eyes returned to the face of the eager young trooper by her side for stuyvesant turned for one more longing glance before descending defeated to the office floor it was his last opportunity and fate seemed utterly against him for when on the following evening his general went to call upon mrs ray and took his handsome and hopeful aide the ladies are out said the bellboy they were dining at the adjutantgenerals in desperation stuyvesant went over to a florists on post street bought a box of superb roses and sent them with his card to miss ray expressing deep regret that he had been denied opportunity to thank her in person for her kindness to him the night of the fire he wanted to say that he owed his eyes to her but felt that she knew better and would be more offended than pleased he was to sail on the morrow and he had not even seen her brother again but the department commander had said he purposed coming out with a party of friends to run alongside the flagship as she steamed slowly out to sea and that was why mr stuyvesant stood so eagerly watching the ploughing sidewheeler so swiftly coming in pursuit already he had made out the double stars in the bunting at the jackstaff already he could distinguish the forms of several general officers whose commands were not yet ready for embarkation and the fluttering garments of a score of women something told him she would be of the party and as the vanguard slowed down to let the headquarters boat run alongside his heart beat eagerly when his general said well go down gentlemen and board her itll be much easier than the climb would be to them so it happened that five minutes later he found himself at the heels of his chief shaking hands mechanically with a dozen officers while his eyes kept peering beyond them to where on the afterdeck the smiling group of women stood expectant and presently the general pushed on for a word of farewell with them the aides obediently following and then came more presentations to cordial and kindly people whose names he did not even hear for just a little farther on and still surrounded by cavaliers stood mrs ray the handsomest and most distinguishedlooking woman of the party and close beside her petite and graceful her dark beauty even the more noticeable in contrast with the fair features of her mother stood maidie and then at last it came the simple words that threw down the social barrier that so long had balked him my aidedecamp mr stuyvesant mrs ray miss ray and with his soul in his eyes he looked down into that radiant face smiling so cordially unconstrainedly into his and then found himself striving to recall what on earth it was he was so anxious to say he knew that he was flushing to the peak of his foragecap he knew he was trying to stammer something he saw that she was perfectly placid and at her ease he saw worse luck that she wore a little knot of roses on the breast of her natty jacket but that they were not his he faltered something to the effect that he had been trying to see her ever since the night of the fire had so much to thank her for and her white even beautiful teeth gleamed as she laughingly answered that the cherries had more than cancelled the score he asked for news of her brother and was told that he had been too much occupied to come in again they were going out to the presidio that afternoon and then he ventured to hope mr ray had sustained no great loss in the robbery of his quarters and saw at once that he was breaking news for the smile vanished instantly the lovely face clouded with concern and he had only time to stammer then probably there was no truth in the story i merely happened to hear two nights ago that mr rays quarters had been robbed about the time the prisoners escaped and then he heard his general calling and saw that the party was already clambering back to the vanguard i i i hope i may see you when we get back from manila miss ray he said as he bowed over her hand i think you may see me before that was the smiling answer and then captain hawley grabbed him by the arm and rushed him to the side two minutes more and he was on the deck of the transport the lines were cast off the white sidewheeler alive with sympathetic faces some smiling some tearful and a forest of fluttering kerchiefs dropped slowly astern and all that long evening as they bored through the fogs of the farallones and bowed and dipped to the long swell of the sea and all the long week that followed as they steamed over a sunlit summer ocean stuyvesant found himself repeating again and again her parting words and wondering what could have been the explanation of her knowing nothing of the robbery of her brothers quarters or what could have been her meaning when she said i think you may see me before that only once on the run to honolulu was the flotilla of transports neared by other voyagers three days out from san francisco the o and o liner doric slowly overhauled and gradually passed them by exchanging signals all well on board she was soon lost in the shadows of the night long miles ahead chapter vii there was trouble at the presidio all but ten of the escaped prisoners had been recaptured or selfsurrendered but the ten still at large were among the worst of the array and among the ten was the burly hulking recruit enlisted under the name of murray but declared by captain kress on the strength of the report of a detective from town to be earlier and better known as sackett and as a former member of the seventh cavalry from which regiment he had parted company without the formality of either transfer or discharge murray was a man worth his keep as military records of misdemeanors went and a sorehearted fellow was the sergeant of the guard held responsible for the wholesale escape and yet it was not so much the sergeants fault the evening had come on dark damp and dripping gaslamps and barracklanterns were lighted before the sunset gun the sergeant himself and several of the guard had been called inside to the prison room by the commanding officer and his staff there was a maze of brick and wooden buildings in front of the guardhouse and a perfect tangle of dense shrubbery only fifty yards away to the west it was into this that most of the fugitives dived and were instantly lost to sight while others had doubled behind the guardhouse and rushed into an alleyway that passed in rear of the club and a row of officers quarters some of them apparently had taken refuge in the cellars or woodand coalsheds until thick darkness came down and others had actually dared to enter the quarters of lieutenant ray for the back door was found wide open the sideboard wherein had been kept some choice old kentucky whiskey produced only on special occasions had been forced and the halfemptied demijohn and some glasses stood on the table in a pool of sloppy water but what was worse the lieutenants desk in the front room securely locked when he went to town had been burst open with a chisel and mr ray had declined to say how much he had lost indeed he did not fully know too busy to come in was the message he had sent his mother the morning after the discovery and yet all that morning he remained about his quarters after one brief interview with the perturbed and exasperated post commander ransacking desks drawers and trunks in the vain hope that he might find in them some of the missing property for little by little the realization was forced upon him that his loss would sum up several hundreds all through his own neglect and through disregard of his fathers earnest counsel only three days before the lieutenant commanding his troop had been sent to oregon and washington on duty connected with the mustering of volunteers their captain was a field officer of one of the regiments of his native state and in hurriedly leaving lieutenant creswell had turned over to his young subordinate not only the troop fund amounting to over four hundred dollars but the money belonging to the post athletic association and marked envelopes containing the pay of certain soldiers on temporary detached service in all between nine hundred and one thousand dollars whenever you have care of public money even temporarily put it at once into the nearest united states depository said his father even office safes in garrison are not safe he had further said clerks somehow learn the combination and are tempted sometimes beyond their strength lose no time therefore in getting your funds into the bank and that was what he meant to do in this case only as the absent troopers were expected to return in two days what was the use of breaking up those sealed envelopes and depositing the whole thing only to have to draw it out in driblets again as the men came to him for it surely he could safely leave that much at least in the quartermasters safe creswell never thought of depositing the cash at all he carried it around with him a wad of greenbacks and a little sack of gold and never lost a cent ray took the entire sum to the quartermasters office tuesday evening and asked to store it in the safe the clerk looked up from his desk and said he was sorry but the quartermaster was the only man who knew the combination and he had gone over to camp merritt so ray kept it that night and intended taking it to town wednesday morning but drills interposed he carried a little fortune with him when he went in to meet his mother and sister wednesday evening half intending to ask the genial major mine host of the occidental to take care of it for him in the private safe but the major was out and the money was still bulging in rays pockets when he returned to the post late that night and it had been very much in his way thursday he fully expected the troopers back and yet when stables were over thursday evening and he was ready to start for town to join his dear ones and was arraying himself in his most immaculate uniform and secretly rejoicing in the order prohibiting officers from wearing for the time being civilian dress he found himself still burdened by the money packages and in a hurry to catch a certain car or else keep them waiting for dinner the quartermasters office was several hundred yards away and there stood his own desk a beautiful and costly thing his mothers gift with its strong locks and intricate system of pigeonholes and secret drawers he would chance it one night he said and give his trusted servant orders to stand guard over the premises and so the little bag of gold went into one closed compartment the envelopes and wads of treasury notes into the hidden drawer and the key into his watchpocket his servant was a young man whose father had been with colonel ray for quarter of a century a faithful irishman by the name of hogan he was honest to the core and had but one serious failing he would drink he would go for months without a lapse and then something would happen to give him a start and nothing short of a spree would satisfy his craving it was said that in days gone by old man hogan was similarly afflicted but those were times when an occasional frolic was the rule rather than the exception with most troopers on the far frontier and hogan senior had followed the fortunes of the th cavalry and captain ray until an indian bullet had smashed his bridlearm and compelled his discharge whereupon mrs ray had promptly told the gallant fellow that their army home was to be his and that if he would consent to serve as butler or as the captains own man to look after his boots spurs and sabres he would never lack for money comforts or home perhaps had mrs ray foreseen that the dashing irishman was destined to lay siege to the heart of her pretty maid she might have suggested setting hogan up in business farther away perhaps too she would not for his almost pathetic devotion to her beloved husband was something she could never forget hogan the crippled veteran and kitty the winsome maid were duly wed and continued as part of the army household wherever they went and in course of the quarter century it seemed to be but a case of domestic history repeating itself that young mart should become mr sandys factotum and valet even though sandy could have secured the services of a much better one for less money young mart had all his fathers oldtime dash and impetuosity but less of his devotion and on this particular thursday evening just when his master most needed him mart was not to be found ray stormed a bit as he finished his toilet then as there was no time to be lost he closed the door of his bedroom behind him and hastened away to the east gate just outside the reservation was a resort kept by a jovial compatriot of hogans assuming that an irishman is always an irishman whether born on the sod or in the states and there ray felt pretty sure of finding his servant and sending him home to mount guard and there sure enough he learned that hogan had been up to within five minutes and had left saying he must go to help the lieutenant he was perfectly sober said the publican and it was more than half a mile back to quarters ray would be late for dinner as it was the car was coming and so though dissatisfied and ill at ease he jumped aboard hurried to the occidental and within three hours was stunned and almost crushed by the tidings that the house had been entered and robbed probably within an hour after he left it and now saturday morning while the guns of alcatraz were booming in salute across the bay and all the garrison was out along the shore or on the seaward heights waving farewell to the vinton flotilla and his mother and maidie had gone out with the department commander to bid them godspeed poor sandy sat wretchedly in his quarters hogan overwhelmed by the magnitude of his masters misfortune and realizing that it was due in no small degree to his own neglect was now selfexiled from the lieutenants roof and seeking such consolation as he could find at the harp of erin outside the walls a miserable and contrite man contrite that is to say as manifested in the manner of his country for hogan was pottle deep in his distress although vouched for as perfectly sober from the hibernian point of view he well knew that he had taken so much that fatal thursday evening as to be fearful of meeting his master and so had kept out of the way until full time for him to be gone to dinner then working his way homeward in the darkness of the night he had marvelled much at finding the back door open rejoiced at sight of the demijohn and disorder in the little diningroom arguing therefrom that the lieutenant had had some jovial callers and therefore hadnt missed him hogan drank in his masters priceless old blue grass bourbon to the health of the party and then stumbling into the bedroom and lighting the lamp came upon a sight that filled him with dismay the beautiful desk burst open drawers and letters and papers scattered about in utter confusion and in his excitement and terror he had gone on the run to the adjutants quarters told that official of his discovery and then learned of the wholesale jail delivery that occurred at retreat he wrung his hands and wept as he listened to his young masters wrathful rebuke and the recital of his losses he hung meekly about the house all night long but unable to bear the sight of poor rays mingled anger and distress he had fled with the coming of the day and gone to tell his woes to his friend of the harp afternoon of saturday came and still ray sat there nerveless he knew that any moment now would bring that loving mother and sister he had cleared up the litter left by the robbers put his desk in order and hogan had done his best with the sideboard in the other room sympathetic souls among his brother officers had been in from time to time consoling him with theories that the thief could not escape would surely be recaptured and the money recovered but on the other hand he was visited by the returned troopers in quest of their money and was compelled to tell them of the robbery and to ask them to wait until monday when he would be able to pay them luckier than others who have been overtaken in the army by somewhat similar misfortune ray knew that he had only to acquaint his parents with the extent of his loss and even though the sum was great it would be instantly made good yet the thought of having to tell his mother was a sore thing he had disregarded his fathers caution he had proved unworthy of trust before the gloss had begun to wear from his first shoulderstraps and he well knew that his mothers fortune was no longer what it was at the time of her marriage in the years of their wanderings all over the west all her business affairs had been in the hands of a trusted agent at home and it so often happens that in the prolonged absence of owners trusted agents follow the lead of the unjust steward of holy writ and make friends of the mammon of unrighteousness and ducks and drakes of their employers assets the ranch bought for him the year gone by was a heavy drain his father in giving him a few hundred dollars for his outfit had told him that now he must live entirely on his pay and that he should be able to put by a little every month but as was to be expected of his fathers son and his kentucky blood sandy could not bid farewell to his associates at the ranch or the citizens of the little cow and mining town on the big horn without a parting blow out in which his health was drunk a dozen times an hour oh that he had that money now instead of certain unpaid bills in that ravished secret drawer it was humiliation inexpressible to have to send those men away emptyhanded and in his dejection and misery poor boy he wandered to his sideboard instead of going to luncheon at the mess and all he had had to eat or drink that day by the time mrs ray and maidie came late in the afternoon was some crackers and cheese and he didnt know how many nips of that priceless blue grass bourbon the bright brave young eyes were glassy and his dark cheek heavily flushed when at four oclock he hastened out to assist his mother from her carriage and the color fled from her beautiful face her heart seemed to stand still and her hand trembled violently as she noted it all but took his arm without a word and with maidie silently following went up the steps and into the little army home where the door closed behind them and the knot of lookerson officers awaiting the call for afternoon stables glanced significantly at each other then went on their way chapter viii vintons flotilla came steaming into honolulu harbor just as the smoke of the doric was fading away on the westward horizon cheers and acclamations a banquet tendered to the entire force in the beautiful grounds about the palace and a welcome such as even san francisco had not given awaited them three days were spent in coaling for the long voyage to manila and during that time officers and men were enabled to spend hours in seabathing and sightseeing vinton eager to push ahead fumed with impatience over the slow and primitive methods by which his ships were coaled but the junior officers found many a cause for rejoicing over their enforced detention dinners dances and surfrides were the order of every evening riding parties to the pali and picnics at pearl harbor and the plantations along the railway filled up every hour of the long soft sensuous days the soldiers explored every nook and corner of the town and for a wonder got back to ship without serious diminution in their number and with a high opinion of the police who seemed bent on protecting the bluecoats from the states and making the best of their exuberance of spirits only one row of any consequence occurred within the fortyeight hours of their arrival three of the colorado volunteers playing billiards in a prominent resort were deliberately annoyed and insulted by some merchant sailors who had been drinking heavily at the expense of a short thickset burly fellow in a loud check suit and flaming necktie a stranger to the police who knew of him only that he had landed from the doric and was waiting the coming of the miowera from vancouver for australia and she was due on the morrow he had taken quarters at a secondrate sailors lodginghouse and at first kept much to himself but once started to drinking with his maritime neighbors he became noisy and truculent and sallied forth with four of his newfound friends all half drunk and wholly bent on mischief the sight of three quietmannered young fellows playing pool in the saloon was just the thing to excite all the blackguard instinct latent in their halfsodden skins and from sneering remark they had rapidly passed to deliberate insult in less than a minute thereafter the three young volunteers flushed and panting were surveying the police and bystanders busily engaged in dragging out from under the tables and propping up some wrecks of humanity while the head devil of the whole business the burly civilian in the loudchecked suit pitched headlong out of the rear window was stanching the blood from his broken nose at the hydrant of a neighboring stable the volunteers were escorted to the landing with all honors and their antagonists barring the ringleader to the police station the affair was over so quickly that few had seen anything of it and only one man had pitched in to the support of the soldiers a civilian who came over on the vanguard by the authority of general vinton the exbrakeman of the southern pacific while the colorado men had little to say beyond the statement that they had been wantonly insulted if not actually assailed by a gang of strangers the railway man was ablaze with excitement and wrath over the escape of the leader of the vanquished party ive seen that curdog face of his somewhere before said he and the quicker you find him and nab him the better that mans wanted in more than one place or im a duffer and so the police spent hours that night in search of the stranger but to no purpose he kept in hiding somewhere and their efforts were vain search of his luggage at the lodginghouse revealed the fact that he had a lot of new shirts underwear etc but not a paper or mark that revealed his identity the proprietor said the man had given the name of spence but he heard two of the sailors call him sackett the following evening the general and his staff dined at the beautiful home of one of the old and wealthy residents and towards nine oclock mr stuyvesant asked his generals permission to withdraw as he had two calls to make before returning aboard ship they were to sail at dawn bidding goodnight and goodby to his charming hostess and declining the hospitable offer of a postprandial peg from her genial lord the young officer stepped blithely away down the moonlit avenue it was a beautiful summer night the skies were cloudless the air soft and still somewhere either at the park or in the grounds of the royal hawaiian the famous band of honolulu was giving a concert and strains of glorious music rich and full came floating on the gentle breeze here and there the electric lights were gleaming in the dense tropical foliage and sounds of merry chat and musical laughter fell softly on the ear the broad thoroughfare of beretania street was well nigh deserted though once in a while the lights of a cab on noiseless wheel flashed by and at rare intervals stuyvesant met or overtook some blissful pair whispering in the deep shadows of the overhanging trees it was quite a walk to the consulgenerals his first objective point but he enjoyed it and the brief visit that followed naturally the affair of the previous evening came up for discussion and there was some conjecture and speculation as to the identity of the leader of the attack on the denver boys stuyvesant repeated what his friend the brakeman said that somewhere he had seen the fellows face before but he had only a seconds glimpse of it for the moment he launched in to the aid of the volunteers the man in the check suit caught sight of him and a simultaneous crack on the nose that sent him reeling towards the open window through which he darted the instant he could recover balance leaving the field equally divided four to four in point of numbers but otherwise with overwhelming advantage on the side of the clear heads and trained muscles of the soldiers a grewsome sight those sailors had presented when called up for sentence in the morning and a remorseful quartette they proved moreover to the consulgeneral who had been called in in the interest of fair play for jack they declared that they were innocent of all evil intent they only went in for a little fun with the soldiers it was that san francisco fellow who called himself spence when he was sober and sackett when he got drunk who brought on the row and then abandoned them to their fate he had owned that he had it in for soldiers in general hated the whole gang of them and wanted to see them well licked he had plenty of money and would pay their fines if the police ran them in and now he had left them in the lurch they had no money and were confronted with the probability of a months labor with the chaingang on the public roads if the consulgeneral couldnt get them off so that amiable official had gone out to the flotilla and had a talk with the colorado officers and the three brawny heroes of the billiardroom battle with the result that everybody agreed to heap all the blame on the vanished culprit in the check suit and the sailors got off with a nominal fine and went home to nurse their bruises and their wrath against spence alias sackett that fellow shouldnt get away on the miowera if they could help it all this stuyvesant was pondering over as after stopping to leave his p p c at the pacific club he strolled down fort street on his way to the boatlanding the big whistle of an incoming steamer had attracted his attention as he left the consulgenerals to make one more call and at the club he heard someone say the miowera had reached her dock and would sail for australia in the morning the sky that had been so cloudless early in the evening became somewhat overcast by eleven and the moonlight was dim and vague as he reached the landing in his several trips to and from the transport it happened that he had fallen frequently into the hands of a bright kanaka boatboy whose admirable rowing and handling of the boat had pleased and interested him be ready to take me out about he had told him and now where was he several officers and soldiers were there bargaining with the boatmen and three or four of these amphibious hawaiians precipitated themselves on stuyvesant with appeals for a job but he asked for joe him gone was the answer of an eager rival him other job but even as they would have persuaded stuyvesant that joe was not to be had and his selection must be one of their number joe himself came running from the direction of a warehouse a short pistolshot away what kept you joe asked stuyvesant as the light boat danced away on the tide feller want me take him outside miowera was the answer him behind warehouse the deuce you say exclaimed stuyvesant turning about in the sternsheets and gazing back to shore are there landingstairs at the warehouse and is he waiting for you there huh nodded joe then here said stuyvesant glancing moonward and noting with satisfaction that the luminary was behind a thick bank of clouds turn back and row to the warehouse steps i want to look at that fellow so saying he quickly threw off his uniform coat with its gleaming shoulderstraps and collar device stowed his foragecap under the seat and sat bareheaded and in his shirtsleeves obedient to joes powerful strokes the little boat was speedily gliding in among the shadows of the sailingships moored along the quay and presently her stern was swung round to a flight of stone steps and stuyvesant bounded ashore over at the boatlanding the electric lights were gleaming and the sound of many voices chaffering over boatfares was heard here among the sheds and warehouses all was silence and darkness but stuyvesant unhesitatingly strode straight to the corner of the big building and into the blackness of the westward side peering right and left in search of the skulker who dared not come to the open dock yet sought means of reaching the australian steamer for a moment he could distinguish no living object then paused to listen and within ten seconds was rewarded somewhere close at hand between him and a low shed to his left there was the sound of sudden collision and a muttered oath some invisible body had bumped against some invisible box and turning sharply stuyvesant made a spring and the next instant had grappled with some burly powerful form and was dragging it despite furious resistance towards the light he was conscious of the sickening odor of sour whiskey of a volley of mad threats and imprecations of a stinging blow in the face that only served to make him cling the tighter to his prisoner then as they swayed and struggled to and fro he felt that he was not gaining ground and that this unseen ruffian might after all escape him he lifted up his voice in a mighty shout police police this way then he heard a savage oath a sputtering savage let go damn your soul and then felt a sharp stinging pang in the right side another another and earth and sky reeled as his grasp relaxed and with a moan of anguish he sank fainting on the dock chapter ix vintons fleet had reached manila a third expedition had coaled at honolulu and gone on its way more transports were coming and still there lingered in this lovely land of sun and flowers lingered for a time twixt life and death vintons stricken aidedecamp lieutenant stuyvesant of his brutal antagonist no trace had been found the shrill cries of the kanaka boatboy supplementing the young officers stentorian shout for the police had brought two or three hawaiian starbearers and clubwielders to the scene of that fierce and wellnigh fatal struggle all they found was the gallant victim writhing in pain upon the dock his hand pressed to his side and covered with the blood that poured from his wounds it was half an hour before a surgeon reached them rowed in with the general from the vanguard by that time consciousness had fled and through loss of the vital fluid stuyvesants pulse was wellnigh gone they bore him to the royal hawaiian where a cool and comfortable room could be had and there early on the following morning and to the care of local physicians the general was compelled to leave him with the brakeman to aid them the police searched every nook and corner of the miowera and without result murray alias spence alias sackett fugitive from justice could not be aboard that ship unless he had burrowed beneath the coal in the bunkers in which event the stokers promised he should be shovelled into the furnaces as soon as discovered every sailors lodging in the town was ransacked but to no purpose murray could not be found for a fortnight stuyvesants fate was in doubt officers of the third expedition could carry with them to manila only the hope that he might recover not until the ships of the fourth flotilla were sighted was the doctor able to say that the chances were now decidedly in his favor he was lifted into a reclining chair the day of the flagraising that pathetic ceremony in which through teardimmed eyes the people saw their old and muchloved emblem supplanted by the stars and stripes of their new hope and aspirations he was sitting up languid pallid and grievously thin when the tidings reached him that the transport with six troops of the th cavalry among others had arrived and the doctor with a quizzical grin on his genial face informed his patient that some red cross nurses were with the command and that two very nicelooking young women in their official caps aprons and badges were at that moment inquiring at the office if they could not see the invalid officer and be of some service to him sore in body and spirit wrathful at the fate that robbed him of a share of the glory he felt sure awaited his comrades at manila stuyvesant was in no humor for a joke and plainly showed it he gave it distinctly to be understood that he needed no coddling of any kind and preferred not to see the ladies no matter what they belonged to not to put too fine a point upon it mr stuyvesant said he didnt wish to be bothered and this was practically the reply that reached two very earnest kindhearted young women for the attendant scenting the possible loss of a big fee if he should be supplanted by superior attractions communicated the invalids exact words to the red cross nurses and they went back wounded to their ship stuyvesants room was on the groundfloor in one of the outlying cottages and its venetian blinds opened on the broad and breezy veranda it was far more quiet and retired than apartments in the main building the rooms overhead being vacant and the occupants of that which adjoined his having left for san francisco within a day or two of his coming i feel too forlorn to see anybody was his explanation to the doctor so dont let anybody in but several officers from the transport got leave to come ashore and take quarters at the hawaiian the rooms above had to be given to them and their resounding footsteps made him wince theres two ladies to take this nextdoor room said his garrulous attendant that afternoon and stuyvesant thought opprobrious things theyll be giggling and talking all night i suppose said he disgustedly when the medico came in late that afternoon i wish youd move me if you cant them the doctor went and consulted the head of the house certainly said that affable boniface if mr stuyvesant is well enough to be carried up one flight i can give him a larger airier room with bath attached where hell be entirely isolated it was too expensive for our visitors from the transports but i believe you said mr stuyvesant wouldnt mind a tentative at which the doctor looked wise and sagely winked when that able practitioner returned to the cottage two young women with red cross badges were seated on the veranda just in from a drive apparently and a darkeyed little chap in the uniform of a subaltern of the cavalry was with them they had drawn their chairs into the shade and close to the venetian blinds behind which in his darkened room reclined the languid patient that will drive him simply rabid said the doctor to himself and prepared a professional smile with which to tell the glad tidings that he should be borne forthwith to higher regions he had left stuyvesant peevish fretful but otherwise inert asking only to be spared from intrusion he found him alert attent eager his eyes kindling his cheeks almost flushing the instant the doctor began to speak the patient checked him and bent his ear to the sound of soft voices and laughter from without ive fixed it all whispered the medical man reassuringly well move you in a minute just as soon as i can call in another man or two and he started for the door whereat his erratic patient again uplifted a hand and beckoned and the doctor tiptoed to his side and bent his ear and looked puzzled perturbed but finally pleased stuyvesant said that thinking it all over he guessed he would rather stay where he was and then when the doctor was gone what did he do but take a brace in his chair and bid the attendant go out and say to the officer on the veranda lieutenant ray that mr stuyvesant would be very glad to speak with him if hed be so kind as to come in whereat the soft laughter suddenly ceased there was a sound of light footsteps going in one direction and a springy soldierly step coming in the other then entered mr sanford ray with outstretched hands and the attendant following and peering over his shoulder marvelled at the sudden change that had come over his master three days later when the city of sacramento was pronounced ready to proceed and the officers and red cross nurses en route to manila were warned to rejoin the ship lieutenant stuyvesant shook so to speak his civil physician persuaded the army surgeons with the fleet that a seavoyage was all he needed to make a new man of him and was carried aboard the sacramento and given an airy stateroom on the upper deck vacated in his favor by one of the ships officers consideration not made public but claus spreckles co bankers had never before received such a deposit from this very able seaman in all the years he had been sailing or steaming in and out of honolulu harbor and now retribution overtook the invalid the red cross had made a marvellous name for itself in san francisco and was already organized and doing wonders at honolulu its ministrations had been gladly accepted by the scores of officers and men among the volunteers to whom the somewhat bare and crude conditions of camp hospitals were doubtless very trying women of gentlest birth and most refined associations donned its badge and dress and wrought in ward kitchen or refectory it was a noble and patriotic purpose that inspired such sacrifice it was a joy to the embryo soldiery to be fed and comforted day by day with the delicacies of the red cross tables but there were military magnates and martinets who dared to question the wisdom of such preparation for the stern scenes of campaigning ahead of the volunteers and who presumed to point out to the officers of this great and farreaching charity that while they were most grateful for such dainties for the invalids of their command the daily spectacle of scores of lusty hearty young heroes feasting at the tables of the red cross to the neglect of their own simple but sufficient rations prompted the query as to what the boys would do without the red cross when they got into the field and couldnt have cake and pie and cream with their coffee the red cross very properly took umbrage at such suggestions and branded the suggesters as horrid the red cross had done such widespread good and was ready to do so much more that criticism of its methods was wellnigh unbearable and now that it had obtained the sanction of the government to send out to manila not only supplies and dainties of every possible kind but dozens of its members to serve as nurses to the sick and wounded it scored a triumph over rival organizations notably the patriotic daughters of america whose vicepresident the austere miss perkins first bombarded the papers in vain protest and denunciation the red cross being her main objective and with abuse of the commanding officers in camp then called in person on the same officers to demand transportation to manila with the next expedition the red cross held its head very high and with reason it ruffled its feathers and resented any slight it sometimes mistook courteous protest against its lavish gifts to such soldiers as were in no wise needy as vicious and unhallowed criticism and occasionally only occasionally it grievously enlarged and exaggerated alleged slights received at the hands of luckless officials and then even those soft and shapely hands could develop catlike claws and the soothing voices take on an acid and scathing intonation and the eyes so ready to moisten with pity and sympathy at the sight of suffering could shoot spiteful little fires at the objects of such divine displeasure and poor stuyvesants petulant words wrung from him in a moment of exasperation and never intended to reach the fair band of sisters of the cross were piled high with additions impolitic impolite discourteous impudent intolerable yes even profane and blasphemous eleven of the twelve red cross nurses packed three in a room aboard the sacramento swore they would not have anything to do with mr stuyvesant the twelfth the one soldiers daughter in the band said nothing at all well now miss ray dont you think it was most discourteous most ungentlemanly in him to send such a message demanded a flushed and indignant young woman one of the most energetic of the sisterhood as they stood together on the promenade deck in the shade of the canvas awnings shunning the glare of the august sun are you sure such a message was sent was the serious reply sure why certainly he did and by his own servant too was the wrathful answer didnt he miss porter and miss porter the damsel appealed to and one of the two nurses who sent in their message from the office promptly assented miss ray looked unconvinced servants you know sometimes deliver messages that were never sent she answered with quiet decision we have seen quite a little of that in the army and it is my fathers rule to get all the facts before passing judgment my brother thought mr stuyvesants attendant garrulous and meddlesome but i asked him if he was sure that was what mr stuyvesant said persisted miss porter bridling and he answered they were just the very words and still i doubt his having sent them as a message said miss ray with slight access of color and that evening she walked the deck long with a happy subaltern and added to her unpopularity there were several wellinformed and pleasant women maids and matrons both in the little sisterhood but somehow the boys did not show such avidity to walk or chat with them as they did with miss ray she sorely wanted a talk with sandy that evening but the belgic had come in from frisco only six hours before they sailed and huge bags of letters and papers were transferred from her to the sacramento there were letters for maidie and sandy both several but there was one bulky missive for him that she knew to be from her father from faraway tampa and the boy had come down late to dinner they had seats at the table of the commanding officer a thing maidie had really tried to avoid as she felt that it discriminated somehow against the other nurses who except mrs doctor wells their official head were distributed about the other tables but the major had long known and loved her father and would have it so this night their first out from honolulu he had ordered wineglasses on the long table and champagne served and when dinner was wellnigh over noticed for the first time that ray had turned his glass down why sandy he cried impulsively it is just twentytwo years ago this summer that your father made the ride of his life through the indian lines to save waynes command on the cheyenne now there are just twentytwo of us here at table and i wanted to propose his health and promotion wont you join us the boy colored to the roots of his dark hair his eyes half filled he choked and stammered a moment and then back went the head with the old familiar toss that was so like his father and through his set lips sandy bravely spoke cant major i swore off today all right my boy that ends it answered the major heartily while marion her eyes brimming barely touched her lips to the glass and longed to be on sandys side of the table that she might steal a hand to him in love and sympathy and sisterly pride but he avoided even her when dinner was over and was busy he sent word with troop papers down betweendecks and she felt somehow that that letter was at the bottom of his sudden resolution and longed to see it yet could not ask at three bells halfpast nine she saw him coming quickly along the promenadedeck and she stopped her escort and held out a detaining hand youll come and have a little talk with me wont you sandy she pleaded ill wait for you as long as you like after ive seen stuyvesant awhile he answered hurriedly he isnt so well i reckon he must have overdone it and away he went with his springy step until he reached the forward end of the promenade where he tapped at the stateroom door the surgeon opened it and admitted him his eyes were grave and anxious when ten minutes later he reappeared norris is with him he said in low tone as he looked down into the sweet serious upturned face he shouldnt have tried it he fooled the doctors completely ill tell you more presently he added noting that mrs wells with two or three of the band were bearing down upon him for tidings of the invalid and sandy had heard as who had not the unfavorable opinions entertained by the sisterhood of his luckless newfound friend the doctor says he mustnt be both i mean disturbed wants to get him to sleep you know was his hurried and not too happy response to the queries of the three matter of business he wanted to ask me about thats all he called back as he broke away and dodged other inquiries once in the little box of a stateroom to which he and a fellow subaltern had been assigned he bolted the door turned on the electric light and took from under his pillow a packet of letters and sat him down to read there was one from his mother written on her way back to leavenworth which he pored over intently and then reverently kissed later and for the second time he unfolded and read the longest letter his father had ever penned it was as follows i have slipped away from camp and its countless interruptions and taken a room at the hotel tonight dear sandy for i want to have a long talk with my boy a talk we ought to have had before and it is my fault that we didnt i shrank from it somehow and now am sorry for it your frank and manful letter telling me of your severe loss and of the weakness that followed reached me two days ago your mothers came yesterday fonder than ever and pleading for you as only mothers can it is a matter that has cost us all dear financially but thanks to that loving mother you were promptly enabled to cover the loss and save your name you know and realize the sacrifices she had to make and she tells me that you insisted on knowing i am glad you did my boy i am going to leave in your hands the whole matter of repayment a young fellow of twenty can start in the army with many a worse handicap than a debt of honor and a determination to work it off that steadies him that matter really gives me less care than you thought for it is the other your giving way to an impulse to drink that fills me with concern you come up like a man admit your fault and say you deserve and expect my severe censure well ive thought it all over sandy my heart and my arms go out to you in your distress and humiliation and i have not one word of reproach or blame to give you for now i shall tell you what i had thought to say when your graduation drew nigh had we been able to master mechanics and molecules and other mathematical rot as useful to a cavalry officer as a binocular to a blind man and that i ought to have told you when you started out for yourself as a young ranchero but could not bring myself to it so long as you seemed to have no inclination that way times men and customs have greatly changed in the last forty or fifty years my boy and greatly for the better looking back over my boyhood i can recall no day when wine was not served on your grandfathers table the brightest minds and bravest men in all kentucky pledged each other day and night in the cup that sometimes cheers and ofttimes inebriates and no public occasion was complete without champagne and whiskey in abundance no personal or private transaction considered auspicious unless appropriately wet those were days when our statesmen revelled in sentiment and song and drank and gambled with the fervor of the followers of the races i was a boy of tender years then and often with my playmates i was called from our merry games to join the gentlemen over their wine and drain a bumper to our glorious harry of the west and before i went to the point sandy i knew the best and possibly the worst whiskeys made in kentucky we all did and the man or youth who could not stand his glass of liquor was looked upon as a milksop or pitied and yet after all respected as a singed cat a fellow who owned that john barleycorn was too much for him and he did not dare a single round with him then came the great war and wars are always in one way demoralizing west point in the early sixties was utterly unlike the west point of today and no worse than a dozen of our greatest colleges the corps still had its tales and traditions of the old time fourthofjuly dinners at the mess hall when everybody made a dash for the decanters and drank everything in sight it was the only day in the year on which wine was served it was in my time the invariable custom for the superintendent to receive the board of visitors on the day of their arrival at his quarters and to invite the officers and the graduating class to meet them and to set forth as for years had been the fashion at washington wine and punch in abundance and the very officers detailed as our instructors would laughingly invite and challenge the youngsters so soon to shed the gray and wear the blue to drink with them again and again i have seen dozens of the best and bravest of our fellows come reeling and shouting back to barracks and a thoughtless set of boys laughing and applauding i was stationed at the point soon after graduation and the men who drank were the rule not the exception social visits were rarely exchanged without the introduction of the decanter the marvel is that so many were temperate in our meat and drink as my father and grandfather used to plead when regularly every morning the family and the negro servants were mustered for prayers at every post where i was stationed either in the east or where i was most at home the far frontier whiskey was the established custom and man after man fellows who had made fine records during the war and bright boys with whom i had worn the gray at the point fell by the wayside and were courtmartialled out of service in and we had a board that swept the army like a seine and relegated scores of tipplers to civil life but that didnt stop it little by little the sense and manhood of our people began to tell little by little the feeling against stimulant began to develop at the point it was no longer a joke to set a fledgling officer to taste the tempter it was a crime four years after i was commissioned we had only one total abstainer out of some fifty officers at the mess and he was a man whose life and honor depended on it three years ago when i went to see you there were dozens at the mess who never drank at all and only eight who even smoked athletics and riflepractice had much to do with this i know but there has gradually developed all over our land notably in those communities where the custom used to be most honored in the observance a total revulsion of sentiment quarter of a century ago even among many gently nurtured women the sight of a man overcome by liquor excited only sorrow and sympathy now it commands nothing less than abhorrence i and my surviving contemporaries started in life under the old system you my dear boy are more fortunate in having begun with the new among the old soldiers there are still some few votaries of bacchus who have to count their cups most carefully or risk their commissions among those under forty our army has far more total abstainers than all the others in the world and such soldiers as grant crook merritt and upton of our service and kitchener of khartoum are on record as saying that the staying powers of the teetotaller exceed those even of the temperate man and staying power is a thing to cultivate as you know i have never banished wine from our table my boy both your mother and i had been accustomed to seeing it in daily use from childhood yet she rarely touches it even at our dinners but sanford i sent john barleycorn to the right about the day your blessed mother promised to be my wife and though i always keep it in the sideboard for old comrades whose heads and stomachs are still sound and who find it agrees with them better than wine i never offer it to the youngsters they dont need it sandy and no more do you but you come of a race that lived as did their fellowmen to whom cards the bottle and betting were everyday affairs it would be remarkable if you never developed a tendency towards one or all of them and it was my duty to warn you before i mourn every hour i wasted over cards and every dollar i ever won from a comrade more than much more than the many hundred dollars i lost in my several years apprenticeship to poker its just about the poorest investment of time a soldier can devise knowing all i do and looking back over the path of my life strewn as it is with the wrecks of fellowmen ruined by whiskey i declare if i could live it over again it would be with the determination never to touch a card for money or a glass for liquor and now my own boy let me bear the blame of this your first transgression you are more to us than we have ever told you you are now your sisters guardian and knight for though she goes under the wing of mrs dr wells and owing to her intense desire to take a womans part we could not deny her both your mother and i are filled with anxiety as to the result to you we look to be her shield in every possible way we have never ceased to thank god for the pride and joy he has given us in our children you yourself would delight in seeing what a tiptop little soldier will is making you have ever been manful truthful and i say it with pride and thankfulness unutterable square as boy could be you have our whole faith and trust and love unspeakable you have the best and fondest mother in the world my son and now i have not one more word to urge or advise think and decide for yourself your manhood under god will do the rest in love and confidence father when marion came tapping timidly at the stateroom door there was for a moment no answer sandys face was buried in his hands as he knelt beside the little white berth he presently arose dashed some water over his eyes and brows then shot back the bolt and took his sister in his arms chapter x not until the tenth day out from honolulu was mr stuyvesant so far recovered as to warrant the surgeons in permitting his being lifted from the hot and narrow berth to a steamerchair on the starboard side even then it was with the caution to everybody that he must not be disturbed the heat below and in many of the staterooms was overpowering and officers and soldiers in numbers slept upon the deck and not a few of the red cross nurses spent night after night in the bamboo and wicker recliningchairs under the canvas awnings except for the tropic temperature the weather had been fine and the voyage smooth and uneventful the sacramento rolled easily lazily along the men had morning showerbaths and a few at a time saltwater plunges in big canvas tanks set fore and aft on the main deck on the port or southern side of the promenade deck the officers sported their pajamas both day and night and were expected to appear in khaki or serge and consequent discomfort only at table on drill or duty and when visiting the starboard side which abaft the captains room was by common consent given up to the women they were all on hand the morning that the invalid officer was carefully aided from his stateroom to a broad recliningchair which was then borne to a shaded nook beneath the stairway leading to the bridge and there securely lashed the doctor and mr ray remained some minutes with him and the steward came with a cooling drink mrs wells doctor by courtesy and diploma arose and asked the surgeon if there were really nothing the ladies could do mr stuyvesant looks so very pale and weak and the sisterhood strained their ears for the reply which as the surgeon regarded the ladys remark as reflecting upon the results of his treatment might well be expected to be somewhat tart nothing today mrs er dr wells said the army man half vexed also at being detained on way to hospital the fever has gone and he will soon recuperate now provided he can rest and sleep it is much cooler on deck and if its only quiet oh he shant be bothered if thats what you mean interposed dr wells with proper spirit im sure nobody desires to intrude in the least i asked for my associates from a sense of duty most of them are capable of fanning or even reading aloud to a patient without danger of overexciting him unquestionably madam responded the surgeon affably and when such ministrations are needed ill let you know goodmorning and lifting his stiff helmet the doctor darted down the companionway brute said the lady doctor no wonder that poor boy doesnt get well miss ray i marvel that your brother can stand him miss ray glanced quietly up from her book and smiled we have known dr sturgis many years she said he is brusque yet very much thought of in the army but at this stage of the colloquy there came interruption most merciful for the surgeon the deep whistle of the steamer sounded three quick blasts there was instant rush and scurry on the lower deck the cavalry trumpets fore and aft rang out the assembly it was the signal for boatdrill and while the men of certain companies sprang to ranks and stood in silence at attention awaiting orders other detachments rushed to their stations at the liferafts and others still swarmed up the stairways or clambered over the rails and in less than a minute every man was at his post quickly the staff officers made the rounds received the reports of the detachment commanders and the boat crews and returning with soldierly salute gave the results to the commanding officer who had taken position with the captain on the bridge for five or ten minutes the upper deck was dotted by squads of blueshirted soldiers grouped in disciplined silence about the boats then the recall was sounded and slowly and quietly the commands dispersed and went below it so happened that in returning to the forecastle about a dozen troopers passed close to where stuyvesant lay a languid spectator and at sight of his pale thin face two of them stopped raised their hands in salute looked first eager and pleased and then embarrassed their faces were familiar and suddenly stuyvesant remembered beckoning them to come nearer he feebly spoke you were in the carfire i thought i knew your faces yes sir was the instant reply of the first were sorry to see the lieutenant so badly hurt and by that blackguard murray too they say if the boys ever get hold of him sir hell never have time for his prayers no nor another chance to bite grinned the second whom stuyvesant now recognized as the lance corporal of artillery hes left his mark on both of us sir and so saying the soldier held out his hand in the soft and fleshy part of the palm at the base of the thumb were the scars of several wounds it did not need an expert eye to tell that they were humantooth marks there were the even traces of the middle incisors the deep gash made by the fanglike dog tooth and between the mark of the right upper canine and those of three incisors a smooth unscarred space there then must have been a vacancy in the upper jaw a tooth broken off or gone entirely and stuyvesant remembered that as murray spoke the eyetooth was the more prominent because of the ugly gap beside it he had changed the cut of his jib considerably faintly whispered stuyvesant after he had extended a kind but nerveless hand to each but that mark would betray him anywhere under any disguise was foster ever found no sir they sent me back to sacramento but nobody could remember having seen anybody like him im afraid he was drowned there at carquinez my battery went over with the third expedition while i was up there thats how i happen to be with the cavalry on this trip then up went both hands to the caps again and both soldiers sprang to attention stuyvesant looking languidly around saw that mr ray had returned saw moreover that his sister was leaning on his arm her eyes fixed on the speakers weatherbeaten face again it all flashed upon him the story of fosters infatuation for this lovely girl his enlistment and then his strange and unaccountable disappearance im sorry men interposed mr ray in pleasant tone but the surgeon has ordered us not to talk with lieutenant stuyvesant and i shall have to repeat his order to you you were in the car that was burned i suppose yes sir beg pardon we didnt know about the doctors orders were mighty glad to see the lieutenant again come long mellen wait whispered stuyvesant come and see me again i want to talk with you and thank you for stopping today the soldiers departed happy and stuyvesant turned wistfully to greet miss ray she was already beyond reach of his voice leaning on sandys arm and gazing steadfastly into his face he saw mrs dr wells coming swiftly towards him with inquiry in her eyes and impulsively peevishly and in disappointment he turned again his face to the wall as it were at least that was not the red cross nurse he longed for good and sympathetic and wise in her way as she undoubtedly was he wished now with all his heart that they had placed his chair so that he could look back along the promenade deck instead of forward over the forecastle at the sparkling sea he felt that pacing up and down together the brother and sister must come within ten feet of his chair before they turned back and he longed to look at her yet could not sturgis had said he would return in a few minutes and he hadnt come stuyvesant felt aggrieved it would be high noon before many minutes already the ship officers were on the bridge ready to take the sun and messcall for the men was sounding on the lower decks he would give a fortune thought he to feel once more that cool soft slender little hand on his forehead there were other hands some that were certainly whiter than miss rays and probably quite as soft and cool hands that before the report of his slur upon the red cross would gladly have ministered to him but he shrank from thought of any touch but one he would have given another fortune if he had it could marion ray but come and sit by him and talk in her cordial pleasant tones there were better talkers wittier brighter women within hail women who kept their hearers laughing much of the time which miss ray did not yet he shrank from the possibility of one of their number accosting him twice he was conscious that dr wells and miss porter had tiptoed close and were peering interestedly at him but he shut his eyes and would not see or hear he did not want to be bothered it was only too evident and as the ships bell chimed the hour of noon and the watch changed his wouldbe visitors slipped silently away and he was alone when the doctor came cautiously towards him a few minutes later stuyvesant was to all appearances sleeping and the medico rejoiced in the success of his scheme when not five minutes after the doctor peeped at him the voice of the captain was heard booming from the bridge just over the patients pillowed head it developed that the patient was wide awake perhaps what the captain said would account for this a dozen times on the voyage that mariner had singled out miss ray for some piece of attention now despite the fact that almost the entire red cross party were seated or strolling or reclining there under the canvas awning and he must have known it although they were hidden from his view he again made that young lady the object of his homage she was at the moment leaning over the rail with sandy by her side gazing at the dark blue beautiful waters that flashing and foamcrested went sweeping beneath her the monarch of the ship standing at the outer end of the bridge had caught sight of her and gave tongue at once a good seaman was the captain and a stalwart man but he knew nothing of tact or discretion oh miss ray he bawled come up on the bridge and ill show you the chart bring the lieutenant for an instant she hesitated reluctant not even the staff of the commanding officer had set foot on that sacred perch since the voyage began only when especially bidden or at boat or fire drill did that magnate himself presume to ascend those stairs as for her sister nurses though they had explored the lower regions and were well acquainted with the interior arrangement of the sacramento and were consumed with curiosity and desire to see what was aloft on the hurricanedeck the stern prohibition still staring at them in bold brazen letters passengers are forbidden upon the bridge had served to restrain the impulse to climb and now here was captain butt singling out miss ray again and ignoring the rest of them if she could have found any reasonable excuse for refusing maidie ray would have declined but sandys eyes said come butt renewed his invitation she turned and looked appealingly at mrs wells as though to say what shall i do but that matron was apparently engrossed in a volume of stevenson and would not be drawn into the matter and finally marion caught miss porters eye there at least was a gleam of encouragement and sympathy impulsive and capricious as that young woman could be on occasions the girl had learned to appreciate the genuine qualities of her roommate and of late had been taking sides for marion against the jealousies of her fellows why dont you go she murmured with a nod of her head towards the stairs and with slightly heightened color miss ray smiled acceptance at the captain and following sandys lead through the labyrinth of steamerchairs about them tripped briskly away over the open deck and there at the very foot of the steep ladderlike ascent became aware of mr stuyvesant leaning on an elbow and gazing at her with all his big blue eyes she had to stop and go around under the stairs and take his thin outstretched hand she had to stop a moment to speak to him though what he said or she said neither knew a moment after all she was conscious of as she turned away was that now at least every eye in all the sisterhood was on her and redder than ever she fairly flew up the steep steps and was welcomed by the chivalric butt upon the bridge that afternoon several of the band were what miss porter was constrained to call nastily snippy in their manner to her and feeling wronged and misjudged it was not to be wondered at that her fathers daughter should resent it and yet so far from exulting in having thus been distinguished and recognized above her fellows miss ray had felt deeply embarrassed and almost the first words she said after receiving the bluff seamans effusive greeting were in plea for her associates oh captain butt its most kind of you to ask me up here and my brother too will be so interested in the chartroom but cant you wont you ask dr wells and at least some of the ladies you know they all would be glad to come and thats all right miss ray bawled old butt breaking in on her hurried words ill ask em up here some other time you see were rolling a bit today and like as not some of em would pitch over things and and well there aint room for moren three at a time anyhow then you ought to have asked dr wells first and some of the seniors she hesitated about saying elders no one of the band would have welcomed an invitation tendered on account of her advanced years itll be just as bad if i go and ask her now said butt testily the others will take offence and lifes too short for a shipmaster to be explaining to a lot of women why they cant all come at once on the bridge ill have em up tomorrow any three you say but when the morrow came he didnt have em up maidie had pleaded loyally for her associates but was too proud or sensitive to so inform them the captain had said he would do that and meanwhile she tried not to feel exasperated at the injured airs assumed by several of the band and the cutting remarks of one or two of their number that afternoon however the skies became overcast and the wind rose that night the sea dashed high towards the rail and the sacramento wallowed deep in the surges next morning the wind had freshened to a gale all airports were closed the spray swept the promenade deck along the starboard side and the red cross and twothirds of the martial passengerlist forgot all minor ills and annoyances in the miseries of mal de mer three days and nights were most of the women folk cooped in their cabins but miss ray was an old sailor and had twice seen far heavier weather on the atlantic sheltered from the rain by the bridgedeck and from the spray and gale by heavy canvas lashed athwartship in front of the captains room and securely strapped in her recliningchair this young lady fairly rejoiced in the magnificent battle with the elements and gloried in the bursting seas sandy too albeit a trifle upset was able to be on deck and one of the subs from the portside hearing of it donned his outer garments and cavalry boots and joined forces with them and stuyvesant hearing their merry voices declared that he could not breathe in his stuffy cabin and demanded to be dressed and borne out on deck too at first the surgeon said no whereupon his patient began to get worse so on the second day the doctor yielded and all that day and the third of the storm by which time the starboard deck was slowly becoming peopled with a few spectral and barely animate feminine shapes stuyvesant reclined within arms length of the darkeyed girl who had so entranced him studying her beauty drinking in her words and gaining such health and strength in the lifegiving air and such bliss from the association that sturgis contemplated with new complacency the happy result of his treatment for when the gale subsided and on the fourth day they ran once more into smooth and lazy waters it was stuyvesants consuming desire to take up his bed and walk except when miss ray was there to talk or read to him and this was the state of affairs when the sacramento hove in sight of the bold headlands green and beautiful that front the sea at the northeast corner of mountainous luzon once within soundings and close to a treacherous shore with only spanish authority to rely on as to rocks reefs and shoals no wonder old butt could have no women on the bridge this too at the very time they most wished to be there since everything worth seeing lay on the port or southern side and that given up to those horrid officers and their pajamas not until his anchor dropped in manila bay did the master of the sacramento think to redeem his promise to bid the ladies of the red cross to the sacred bridge and incidentally to tell them how miss ray had urged it in their behalf while they were out on blue waters but now it was too late chapter xi it was late in the afternoon when the sacramento slowly feeling her way southward had come within view of el fraile and corregidor looming up like sentinels at the entrance to the great farspreading bay butt and his assistants with the field officer in command of the troops peered through their binoculars or telescopes for sign of cruiser or transport along the rocky shores and marvelled much that none could be seen over against the evening sun just sinking to the west the dim outlines of the upper masts and spars of some big vessel became visible for three minutes then faded from view the passengers swarmed on deck silent anxious ever and anon gazing upward at the bridge as though in hope of a look or word of encouragement it was midsummer and more when they left honolulu and by this time the american force land and naval in front of manila ought to be ample to overcome the spaniards but there was ever that vexing problem as to what aguinaldo and his followers might do rather than see the great city given over to the americans for law and order instead of to themselves for loot and rapine the fact that all coast lights thus far were extinguished was enough to convince the sacramentos voyagers that they were still unwelcome to the natives but both the shipmaster and the cavalry officer commanding had counted on finding cruiser or despatch boat at least on lookout for them and ready to conduct them to safe anchorage but no such ship appeared and the alternative of going about and steaming out to sea for the night or dropping anchor where he lay was just presenting itself to butt when from the lips of the second officer who had clambered up the shrouds there came the joyous shout by jove theres corregidor light surely enough even before the brief tropic twilight was over and darkness had settled down away to the southward at regular tensecond intervals from the crest of the rockbound crumbling parapet on corregidor island a brilliant light split the cloudy vista and flashed a welcome to the lone wanderer on the face of the waters it could mean only one thing manila bay was dominated by deweys guns the yankee was master of corregidor and had possessed himself of both fort and lighthouse in all probability manila itself had fallen half speed ahead was the order and again the throb of the engines went pulsing through the ship and the sacramento slowly forged ahead over a smooth summer sea at midnight the pilot and glad tidings were aboard and at dawn the decks were thronged with eager voyagers and a great fullthroated cheer went up from the forecastle head as the gray ghostlike shapes of the warships loomed up out of the mist and dotted the unruffled surface but that cheer sank to nothingness beside one which followed fifteen minutes later when the red disk of the sun came peeping over the low fogdraped range far to the eastward and saluted by the boom of the morning gun from the battlements of the old city there sailed to the peak of the lofty flagstaff the brilliant colors and graceful folds of the stars and stripes the threecentury rule of castile and aragon was ended the yellow and red of spain was supplanted by the scarlet white and blue of america and in a new glory of its own old glory unfolded to the faintly rising breeze and all along the curving shore and over the placid waters rang out the joyous lifegiving heartstirring notes of the yankee reveille for long hours later there came launches bancas and cascoes from fleet and shore the debarkation of the cavalry began in the afternoon they had left their horses at the presidio six thousand miles away and were troopers only in name the officers who came as passengers got ashore in the course of the day and made their way to the ayuntamiento to report their arrival and receive their assignments the red cross nurses looked in vain for the hospital launch that it was supposed would hasten to convey them to comfortable quarters adjoining the sickwards or convalescent camps they listened with the deepest interest to the description of the assault of the th of august that made merritt master of manila and the elders masculine and feminine who knew something of what battle meant when american was pitted against american looked at each other in wonderment as they heard how much had been won at cost of so little sandy ray kissing marion goodby and promising to see stuyvesant in the near future went over the side with his troop and landing at the stone dock at the foot of the paseo de santa lucia found himself trudging along at the head of his men under massive walls nearly three centuries old bristling with antiquated highly ornamented spanish guns and streaked with slime and vegetation while along the high parapets across the moat thousands of spanish soldiers squatted and stared at them in sullen apathy maidies knight and champion indeed his duty called him with his fellows to a faraway suburb up the pasig river her duty held her to await the movements of the sisterhood and what she might lack for sympathy among them was made up in manifest yet embarrassing interest on part of the tall young aidedecamp for stuyvesant was bidden to remain aboard ship until suitable accommodation could be found for him ashore under any other circumstances he would have objected vehemently but finding that the red cross contingent was to share his fate and that miss ray was one of the dozen condemned to remain he bore his enforced lot with christian and soldierly resignation only said dr wells one would suppose that the red cross was entitled to some consideration and that all preparation would have been made for our coming it was neither flattering nor reassuring nor indeed was it kind that they should be so slighted said the sisterhood that evening but worse still was in store for on the morrow early the esmeralda came steaming in from hong kong where despite her roundabout voyage the belgic had arrived before the slowmoving sacramento had rounded the northern point of luzon and on the deck of the esmeralda as she steered close alongside the transport and thence on the unimpeded way to her moorings up the pasig in plain view of the sisterhood tall gaunt austere but triumphant towered the form of the vicepresident of the patriotic daughters of america for two days more the sacramento remained at anchor in the bay over a mile from the mouth of the river and for two days and nights the red cross remained aboard unsought unsummoned from the shore the situation became more strained than ever the only betterment arising from the fact that now there was more space and the nurses were no longer crowded three in a room mrs dr wells moved into that recently vacated by the cavalry commander and miss ray and her now earnest friend miss porter were relieved by the desertion of their eldest sister who preempted a majors stateroom on the upper deck butt stirred up a new trouble by promptly coming to miss ray and bidding her move out of that stuffy hole below and take major hortons quarters and bring miss porter with her if that was agreeable it would have been very but miss rays head was level as the purser put it and despite the snippy and exasperating conduct of most of the sisterhood that wise young woman pointed out to the shipmaster that theirs was a semimilitary organization and that the senior mrs dr wells and one or two veteran nurses should have choice of quarters by this time miss porters vehement championship of her charming and much misjudged friend had excited no little rancor against herself the more she proved that they had done miss ray injustice the less they liked miss rays advocate it is odd but true that many a woman finds it far easier to forgive another for being as wicked as she has declared her to be than for proving herself entirely innocent one thing anyhow miss porter couldnt deny said the sisterhood she was accepting devoted attentions from mr stuyvesant and in her capacity as a red cross nurse that was inexcusable fudge said miss porter if it were you instead of miss ray he was in love with how long would you let your badge keep him at a distance the sun went down on their unappeased wrath that second night in manila bay and with the morrow came added cause for disapprobation before the noon hour a snowwhite launch with colors flying fore and aft steamed alongside and up the stairs resplendent came stuyvesants general with a brace of staff officers all three precipitating themselves on the invalid and after brief converse with him all three sending their cards to miss ray who had taken refuge on the other deck and even while she sat reflecting what would be the wiser course the general himself followed the cardbearer and that distinguished warrior with all the honors of his victorious entry fresh upon him inclined his handsome head and begged that he might present himself to the daughter of an old and cherished friend of cadet days and seated himself by her side with hardly a glance at the array of surrounding femininity and launched into reminiscence of billy ray as he was always called ana it was some little time before she could say will you let me present you to dr wells who is practically my commanding officer a request the general was too much of a gentleman not to accede to at once yet looked not too much pleased when he was led before that commanding dame and then distinctly displeased as taking advantage of her opportunity the indignant lady burst forth with her grievance oh this is general vinton well i must say that i think you generals have treated the ladies of the red cross with precious little courtesy here weve been waiting thirtysix hours and not a soul has come near us or shown us where to go or told us what to do while everybody else aboard is looked after at once it is a matter entirely out of my jurisdiction madame answered the general with grave and distant dignity in fact i knew nothing of the arrival of any such party until at the commanding generals this morning your vicepresident is it was endeavoring to our vicepresident sir interposed the lady promptly is in san francisco attending to her proper functions the person you saw is not recognized by the red cross at all nor by any one in authority that i know of general vinton reddened a soldier accustomed to the courtesies indispensable among military men ill brooks it that a stranger and a woman should take him to task for matters beyond his knowledge or control you will pardon me if in my ignorance of the matter i fancied the lady in question to be a representative of your order and for suggesting that the chief surgeon is the official to whom you should address your complaint and rebukes goodmorning madame miss ray he continued as he quickly turned and led that young lady away two of my staff desire to be presented may i have the pleasure there was no mistaking the generals disapprobation of the official head of the sisterhood as represented on the sacramento though he and his officers remained aboard an hour not once again would he look towards dr wells or seem to see any of the party but miss ray this too despite the fact that she tried to explain matters and pour oil on such troubled waters captain butt sent up champagne to the distinguished party and miss ray begged to be excused and slipped away to her stateroom only to be instantly recalled by other cards colonel and mrs brent other old friends of her father and mother she remembered them well and remembered having heard how mrs brent had braved all opposition and had started for hong kong the day after the colonel steamed for manila and their coming with most hospitable intent only added to the poor girls perplexities for they showered welcomes upon her and bade her get her luggage up at once they had come to take her to their own roof they had secured such a quaint roomy house in ermita right near the bay shore and looking right out on the luneta and the parade grounds they stormed at her plea that she must not leave her companions they bade her send for miss porter and included her in their warmhearted invitation but by the time maidie was able to get a word in edgewise on her own account and begged them to come and meet mrs dr wells and the red cross sisterhood they demurred the general in marions brief absence had expressed his opinion of that official head and the brents had evidently accepted his views then vinton and his officers loudly begged mrs brent to play chaperon and persuade miss ray and miss porter to accompany them in their fine white launch on a visit to the admiral on the flagship and said nothing about others of the order the idea of seeing dewey on his own deck and being shown all over the olympia why it was glorious but miss ray faltered her refusal even against miss porters imploring eyes then stuyvesant declared he didnt feel up to it the general went off to the fleet and the brents back to shore without the girls but in the course of the afternoon four more officers came to tender their services to billy rays daughter and none not even a hospital steward came to do aught for the red cross and by sundown maidie ray had every assurance that the most popular girl at that moment in manila army circles was the least popular aboard the sacramento and kate porter cried herself to sleep after an outandout squabble with two of the band and the emphatic assertion that if she were marion ray she would cut them all dead and go live with her friends ashore but when the morrow came was it to be wondered at that miss ray had developed a high fever was it not characteristic that before noon from the official head down from dr wells to dottie fellows the most diminutive of the party there lived not a woman of their number who was not eager in tender of services and in desire to be at the sufferers bedside was it not manlike that stuyvesant who had shunned the sisterhood for days now sought the very women he had scorned and begged for tidings of the girl he loved chapter xii october had come and the rainy season was going but still the heat of the midday sun drove everybody within doors except the irrepressible yankee soldiery released on pass from routine duty at inner barracks or outer picket line and wandering about this strange oldworld metropolis of the philippines reckless of time or temperature in their determination to see everything there was to be seen about the whilom stronghold of the dons in asiatic waters along the narrow sidewalks of the escolta already bordered by american signs and saloons and rendered even more than usually precarious by american drinks the blueshirted boys wandered openeyed marvelling much to find twixt twelve and two the shutters up in all the shops not conducted as were the bars on the american plan while from some still more oriental the sun and the shopper both were excluded four full hours beginning at eleven all over the massive antiquated fortifications of old manila into the tortuous mazes of the northern districts through the crowded chinese quarter foul and ill savored the teeming suburbs of the native tagals humble yet cleanly along the broad shaded avenues bordered by stately old spanish mansions many of them still occupied by their castilian owners the yankee invaders wandered at will brimful of curiosity and good nature eager to gather in acquaintance information and bricаbrac making themselves perfectly at home filling the souls of the late lords of the soil with disdain and those of the natives with wonderment through their lavish jovial free and easy ways within a month from the time merritts little division had marched into the city manila was as well known to most of those farwestern volunteers as the streets of their own home villages and when once the paymaster had distributed his funds among them and at the rate of ten cents off on every dollar they had swapped their sound american coin for soft mexican or spanish pesos the prodigality with which they scattered their wealth among their dusky friends and admirers evoked the blessings of the church which was not slow to levy on the beneficiaries the curses of the sons of spain who had generally robbed and never given and at first the almost superstitious awe of the tagals who having never heard of such a thing before dreaded some deeplaid scheme for their despoilment but this species of dread lived but a few short weeks and before next payday was as far gone as the money of the americanos those were blithe days in manila as the autumn came on and the insurrection was still in the far future there were fine bands among the yankee regiments that played afternoon and evening in the kiosk on the luneta and every household possessed of an open carriage or the means of hiring one appeared regularly each day as the sun sank to the westward sea and after making swift yet solemn circuit of the anda monument at the pasig end of the paseo de santa lucia returned to the luneta proper and wedged in among the closely packed vehicles that covered the broad smooth driveways on both sides of the esplanade and for some hundred yards each way north and south of the bandstand along the shaded and gravelled walks that bordered the paseo within short pistolshot of the grim bastions beyond the green glacis and even greener moat many darkhaired darkeyed daughters of spain leaving their carriages and guarded by faithful duenna strolled slowly up and down exchanging furtive signal of hand or kerchief with some gallant among the throngs of captive soldiery that swarmed towards sunset on the parapet swarthy blackbrowed spanish officers in cool summer uniform and in parties of three or four lined the roadway or wandered up and down in search of some distraction to the deadly ennui of their lives now that their soldier occupation was gone vouchsafing neither glance nor salutation to their yankee conquerors no matter what the rank until the wives and daughters of american officers began to arrive and appear upon the scene when the disdain of both sexes speedily gave way to obvious if reluctant curiosity south of the walls and outworks of old manila and east of the luneta lay a broad open level bounded on the south by the suburb of ermita and in the midst of the long row of spanishbuilt houses extending from the battery of huge krupps at the bayside almost over to the diagonal avenue of the nozaleda stood the very cosey finely furnished house which had been hired as quarters for colonel brent high dignitary on the department staff its lower story of cut stone was pierced by the arched driveway through which carriages entered to the patio or inner court and as in the tenets of madrid the queen of spain is possessed of no personal means of locomotion so possibly to no spanish dame of high degree may be attributed the desire even though she have the power to walk no other portal therefore either for entrance or exit could be found at the front massive doors of dark heavy wood from the luzon forests strapped with iron swung on huge hinges that unless well oiled defied the efforts of unmuscular mankind a narrow panel opening in one of these doors two feet above the ground and on little hinges of its own gave means of passage to household servants and when pressed for time to such of their superiors as would condescend to step high and stoop low to the right and left of the main entrance were storerooms servants rooms and carriageroom and opposite the latter towards the rear the broad stairway that turning upon itself led to the livingrooms on the upper floor the broad salon at the head of the stairs being utilized as a diningroom on state occasions and its northward end as the parlor opening from the sides of the salon front and rear were four large roomy highceilinged chambers overlooking and partially overhanging the street and extending the length of the house was a wide enclosed veranda well supplied with tables loungingchairs and couches of bamboo and wicker its floor covered here and there with indian rugs its surrounding waisthigh railing fitted with parallel grooves in which slid easily the frames of the windows of translucent shells set in little fourinch squares or the darkgreen blinds that excluded the light and glare of midday with both thrown back there spread an unobstructed view of the paradeground even to the edge of the distant glacis and here it was the household sat to watch the military ceremonies to receive their guests and to read or doze throughout the drowsier hours of the day campo de bagumbayan was what the natives called that martial flat in the strange barbaric tongue that delights in igs and ags in ings and angs even to repetition and repletion and here one soft sensuous october afternoon with a light breeze from the bay tempering the heat of the slanting sunshine reclining in a broad bamboo easychair sat maidie ray now quite convalescent yet not yet restored to her oldtime vigorous health her hostess the colonels amiable wife was busy on the back gallery leading to the kitchen deep in counsel with her filipino majordomo and her chinese cook servitors who had been well trained and really needed no instruction and for that matter got but little for mrs brents knowledge of the spanish tongue was even less than her command of pidgin english nevertheless neither ignacio nor sing suey would fail to nod in the one case or smile broadly in the other in assent to her every proposition it being one of the articles of their domestic faith that peace and happiness truth and justice religion and piety could best be promoted throughout the establishment by never seeming to differ with the lady of the house to all outward appearances therefore and for the first few weeks at least housekeeping in the philippines seemed something almost idyllic and mrs brent was in ecstasies over the remarkable virtues of spanishtrained servants there had been anxious days during maidies illness the sacramento had been ordered away and the little patient had to be brought ashore but the chief quartermaster sent his especial steamlaunch for billy rays daughter the chief surgeon the best ambulance and team to meet her at the landing a squad of sandys troopers bore her recliningchair over the side into the launch out of the launch to the waiting ambulance and out of the ambulance upstairs into the airy room set apart for her and with mrs brent and miss porter sandy and the most devoted of army doctors to bear her company and keep the fans going maidies progress had been rather in the nature of a triumph so at least it had seemed to the austere vicepresident of the patriotic daughters of america who as it happened looked on in severe disapproval she had asked for that very ambulance that very day to enable her to make the rounds of regimental hospitals in the outlying suburbs and had been politely but positively refused by that time it seems this most energetic woman had succeeded in alienating all others in authority at corps headquarters to the end that the commanding general declined to grant her further audience the surgeongeneral had given orders that she be not admitted to his inner office the deputy surgeongeneral had asked for a sentry to keep her off his premises the sentries at the first and second reserve hospital had instructions to tell her also politely but positively that she could not be admitted except in visiting hours when the surgeon a steward or and here was the most unkindest cut of all some of the triumphant red cross could receive and attend to her for at last the symbol of geneva had gained full recognition at last dr wells and the sisterhood were on duty comfortably housed cordially welcomed and presumably happy but miss perkins was not she had come to manila full of high purpose as the selfstyled accredited representative of any quantity of good americans actuated by motives no doubt of purest patriotism the nation was full of it of men who wanted to be officers of women who wanted to be officials many of whom succeeded only in becoming officious there were not staff or line positions enough to provide for a hundredth part of the men or societies and orders sufficient to cater to the ambitions of a tenth part of the women the great red cross gave abundant employment for thousands of gentle and willing hands but limited the number of directing heads and miss perkins and others of the jellaby stamp were born as they thought not to follow but to lead balked in their ambitious designs to become prominent in that noble national association women possessed of the unlimited assurance of miss perkins started what might be termed an anticrusade with the result that in scores of quiet country towns as well as in the cities of the east and middle west many subscriptions were easily gained and hundreds of honest earnest women were rewarded with paper scrolls setting forth that they were named as sisters of the american soldier patriotic daughters of america or ministering angels of the camp and cot shades of florence nightingale and clara barton the very voice of such selfappointed angels as miss perkins was enough to set the nerves of strong men on edge and to drive fever patients to madness even the red cross could not always be sure of its selection it did prevent the sending to manila of certain undesirable applicants but it could not prevent the going of miss perkins at the expense of the deluded on ships that were common carriers even though she were a common scold there she was portentous as the british female portrayed by thackeray backed by apparently abundant means and obviously indomitable gall she counted on carrying all before her by sheer force of her powers of selfassertion and the name of the patriotic daughters of america but the commanding general was the most impassive of men gifted with a keen though little suspected sense of humor and no little judgment in estimating motive and character he actually enjoyed the first call made by miss perkins suggested her coming again on the morrow and summoned his chief surgeon and his provost marshal another keen humorist to be present at the interview it has been asserted that this triumvirate went so far as to encourage the lady to even wilder flights of assertion we have her own word for it that then and there she was promised as offices three big rooms in the palace the ayuntamiento six clerks and a private secretary but an impartial witness avows that the sole basis for this was a question propounded to the provost marshal by the chief surgeon as to whether the chief quartermaster or the chief engineer should be called on to vacate the rooms assigned to them as officers in order that the p d a might be properly recognized and quartered to which the response was made with unflinching gravity that something certainly should be vacated p d q if it took all his clerical force to effect it but this was sotto voce so to speak and presumably unheard by the general commanding it was gall of another kind and wormwood after these first few flattering receptions to be greeted thereafter only by aidesdecamp or a military secretary then to be told by the chief surgeon that under instructions from washington only those nurses and attendants recognized and employed by the general government could be permitted to occupy quarters or walk the wards about the hospitals it was bitter to find her criticisms and suggestions set at naught by impudent young quacks as she called the delighted doctors of the reserve hospitals to see the sisterhood of the red cross presently clothed with the purple of authority as well as white caps and aprons while she and through her the p d as were denied the privilege of stirring up the patients and overhauling the storerooms then in her wrath miss perkins unbosomed herself to the press correspondents a few of whom seeking sensation as demanded by their papers took her seriously and told tremendous tales of the brutal neglect of our sick and wounded boys in hospital of doctors and nurses in wild debauch on the choice wines and liquors sent for the sole use of the sick and wounded by such patriotic societies as the p d as and hinting at other and worse debaucheries which she blushed to name and involved in which were prominent officers and favorite members of a rival society which shall be as nameless as it is shameless all this had miss perkins accomplished within the first eight days of her sojourn and by way of hongkong the unexpurgated edition of her romance thrown out by the conscienceless censor at headquarters eventually found its way to the united states it was while in this uncharitable frame of mind that miss perkins caught sight of the little procession up the santa lucia when maidie was transferred from ship to shore and the refusal of the best looking of the impudent young quacks to permit her to see his patient that afternoon augmented her sense of indignity and wrong miss ray herself went down in the black book of the p d as forthwith but all this time the officials remained in blissful ignorance of the tremendous nature of the charges laid at their door by this much injured woman and maidie ray while duly informed of the frequent calls and kind inquiries of many an officer and permitted of late to welcome sandy for little talks had been mercifully spared the infliction of the personal visitation thrice attempted by her fellowtraveller on the train that awful voice however uplifted as was the habit of the vicepresident when aroused could not fail to reach the sickroom and when convalescence came and miss perkins came not maidie made inquiries both of dr frank and of her hostess frank showed his handsome teeth and smiled but mrs brent showed fight i wont have such a creature within my doors said she i dont believe you were ever intimate friends and that she nursed and cared for you in the cars when you were suffering from shock and fright because of a fire thats what she says though what was it maidie was it there mr stuyvesant got that burn on his face and lost his eyebrows and then it transpired that mr stuyvesant had been a frequent and assiduous caller for a whole fortnight driving thither almost every evening but maidie was oddly silent as to the episode of the fire on the train she laughed a little about miss perkins and her pretensions but to the disappointment of her hostess could not be drawn into talk about that tall handsome new yorker and what seemed strange to mrs brent was that now when maidie could sit up a few hours each day and see certain among the officers wives arriving by almost every steamer from the states and have happy chats with sandy every time he could come galloping in from paco and was taking delight in watching the parades and reviews on the bagumbayan and listening to the evening music of the band stuyvesant had ceased to call had maidie noticed it mrs brent wondered as coming in from her conference with the house of commons she stood a moment at the doorway gazing at the girl whose book had fallen to the floor and whose dark eyes under their veiling lids were looking far out across the field to the walls and church towers of old manila it was almost sunset there was the usual throng of carriages along the luneta and a great regiment of volunteers formed in line of platoon columns was drawn up on the campo directly in front of the house sandy had spent his allotted half hour by his sisters side and remounting had cantered out to see the parade miss perkins had declared on the occasion of her third fruitless call that not until miss ray sent for her would she again submit herself to be snubbed so there seemed no immediate danger of her reappearance and yet mrs brent had given ignacio orders to open only the panel door when the gate bell clanged and to refuse admission even to the driveway to a certain importunate caller besides miss perkins three days previous there had presented himself a young man in the white dress of the tropics and a hat of fine manila straw a young man who would not send up his card but in very mexican spanish asked for miss ray ignacio sent a boy for mrs brent who came down to reconnoitre and the youth reiterated his request an old friend was all he would say in response to her demand for his name and purpose she put him off saying miss ray was still too far from well to see anybody bade him call next day when dr frank and her husband she knew would probably be there duly notified them and frank met and received the caller when he came and sent him away in short order the man is a crank said he and i shall have him watched the colonel asked that one or two of the soldier police guard should be sent to the house to look after the stranger a corporal came from the company barrack around on the calle real and it was after nightfall when next the old friend rang the bell and was permitted by ignacio to enter but the instant the corporal started forward to look at him the caller bounded back into outer darkness he was tall sinewy speedy and had a twentyyard start before the little guardsman stout and burly could squeeze into the street then the latters shouts up the san luis only served to startle the sentries to spur the runner and to excite and agitate maidie dr frank was disgusted when he tried her pulse and temperature half an hour later and said things to the corporal not strictly authorized by the regulations the episode was unfortunate yet might soon have been forgotten but for one hapless circumstance despite her announcement something had overcome miss perkinss sense of injury for she had stepped from a carriage directly in front of the house at the moment of the occurrence was a witness to all that took place and the first one to extract from the corporal his version of the affair and his theory as to what lay behind it in another moment she was driving away towards the nozaleda the direction taken by the fugitive fast as her coachman could whip his ponies the original purpose of her call abandoned as in duty bound both mrs brent and dr frank had told sandy of this odd affair mrs brent described the stranger as tall slender sallow with big cavernous dark eyes that had a wild look to them and a scraggly fuzzy beard all over his face as though he hadnt shaved for long weeks his hands of course she had particularly noticed his hands what woman doesnt notice such things were slim and white he had the look of a man who had been long in hospital was probably a recently discharged patient perhaps one of the many men just now getting their home orders from washington somebody who served under your father perhaps said mrs brent soothingly to marion and thought he ought to see you somebody who had not been a soldier at all said she to sandy he had neither the look nor the manner of one and sandy marvelled a bit and decided to be on guard maidie he had said that afternoon before riding away when you get out next week we must take up pistol practice again you beat me at leavenworth but you cant do it now got your gun anywhere the one dad gave you and dad or daddy in the ray household was the lovingest of titles maidie turned a languid head on her pillow in the upper drawer of the cabinet in my room i think said she i remember mrs brents examining it sandy went in search and presently returned with the prize a short bigbarrelled powerful little weapon of the bulldog type sending a bullet like that of a derringer hot and hard warranted to shock and stop an ox at ten yards but miss a barn at over twenty a womans weapon for defence of her life not a target pistol and sandy twirled the shining cylinder approvingly it was a gleaming toy with its ivory stock and nickeled steel every chamber crammed said sandy and sure to knock spots out of anything from a mad dog to an elephant provided it hits best keep it by you at night maidie these natives are marvellous sneakthieves they go all through these ramshackle upper stories like so many ghosts no one can hear them then when he took his leave the pistol remained there lying on the table and frank coming in to see his most interesting patient just as the band was trooping back to its post on the right of the long line picked it up and examined it muzzle uppermost with professional approbation yours i see miss ray and from your father a man hit by one of these he continued musingly and fingering the fat leaden bullets would drop in his tracks you keep it by you always i no laughed maidie im eager to get to my work healing not giving gunshot wounds you will have abundant time my dear young lady said the doctor slowly as he carefully replaced the weapon on the table by her side and opportunity if i read the signs aright and we must get you thoroughly well before you begin ah whats that whats the matter over there he lazily asked it was a fad of the doctors never to permit himself to show the least haste or excitement a small operaglass stood on the sill and calmly adjusting it as he peered frank had picked it up and levelled it towards the front and centre of the line just back of where the colonel commanding sat in saddle a lively scuffle and commotion had suddenly begun among the groups of spectators miss rays recliningchair was so placed that by merely raising her head she could look out over the field mrs brent ran to where the colonels fieldglasses hung in their leathern case and joined the doctor at the gallery rail three pairs of eyes were gazing fixedly at the point of disturbance already the centre of a surging crowd of soldiers off duty oblivious now to the fact that the band was playing the starspangled banner and they ought to be standing at attention hats off and facing the flag as it came floating slowly to earth on the distant ramparts of the old city disdainful of outside attractions the adjutant came stalking out to the front as the strain ceased and his shrill voice was heard turning over the parade to his commander then the surging group seemed to begin to dissolve many following a little knot of men carrying on their shoulders an apparently inanimate form they moved in the direction of the old botanical garden towards the estado mayor and so absorbed were the three in trying to fathom the cause of the excitement that they were deaf to ignacios announcement a tall handsome most distinguishedlooking young officer stood at the wide doorway dressed capapiи in snowy white and not until after a moments hesitation he stepped within the room and was almost upon them did miss ray turn and see him why mr stuyvesant was all she said but the tone was enough mrs brent and the doctor dropped the glasses and whirled about both instantly noted the access of color it had not all disappeared by any means though the doctor had when ten minutes later colonel brent came in at the moment of his entrance stuyvesant seated close to marions recliningchair was with all the doctors caution and curiosity examining her revolver rather bulky for a pocketpistol he remarked as muzzle downward he essayed its insertion in the gaping orifice at the right hip of his manilamade flapping white trousers it slipped in without a hitch what was the trouble out there a while ago asked the lady of the house of her liege lord you saw it i suppose nothing much man had a fit and it took four men to hold him maidie look here captain kress handed this to me said they picked it up just back of where the colonel stood at parade is he another mash marion took the envelope from the outstretched hand drew forth a little cartedevisite on which was the vignette portrait of her own face gave one quick glance and dropped back on the pillow all the bright color fled the picture fell to the floor can you find sandy was all she could say as with imploring eyes she gazed into honest brents astonished face i can at once said stuyvesant who had risen from his chair at the colonels remark with quick bend he picked up the little card placed it face downward on the table by her side never so much as giving one glance at the portrait and noiselessly left the room chapter xiii like many another mans that summer and autumn of mr gerard stuyvesants one overwhelming ambition had been to get on to manila the enforced sojourn at honolulu had been therefore a bitter trial he had reached at last the objective point of his soldier desires and with all his heart now wished himself back on the sacramento with one at least or was it at most of the sacramentos passengers the voyage had done much to speed his recovery the cordial greeting extended by his general and comrade officers had gladdened his heart pleasant quarters on the breezy bay shore daily drives and presently gentle exercise in saddle had still further benefited him he had every assurance that marion rays illness was not of an alarming nature and that soon as the fever had run its course her convalescence would be rapid he was measurably happy in the privilege of calling every day to ask for her but speedily realized the poverty of oriental marts in the means wherewith to convey to the fair patient some tangible token of his constant devotion where were the glorious roses the fragrant delicate violets the heaping baskets of cool luscious tempting grapes pears and peaches with which from saco to seattle from the sault de sainte marie to southwest pass in any city outside of alaska in the three million square miles of his own native land he could have laid siege to her temporary retreat ransack the city as he might market shops and gardens hardly a flower could he find worthy her acceptance a garish redheaded hybrid twixt poppy and tulip and some inodorous waxen shoots that looked like decrepit hyacinths and smelled like nothing representing the stock in trade at that season of the few flowerstands about manila as for fruit some stunted sugar bananas about the size of a shoehorn and a few diminutive china oranges proved the extent of the weekly exhibit along the escolta once la extremeсa displayed a keg of malaga grapes duly powdered with cork and several pounds of these did stuyvesant levy upon forthwith and after being duly immersed in water and cooled in the icechest send them in dainty basket by a whiterobed lackey with an unimpeachable card bearing the legend mr gerard stuyvesant onehundredandsixth new york infantry volunteers and much were they admired on arrival but that was in the earlier days of maidies convalescence and dr frank shook his head grapeseeds were perilous stuff and mrs brent knew they would not last until maidie was well enough to enjoy them and so they did not military duty for the staff was not exacting about manila in the autumn days it was the intermission the spanish war was over the filipino yet to come there was abundant time for love and sighing and stuyvesant did both for there was no question the poor fellow had found his fate and yet thought it trembling in the balance not one look or word of hers for him could stuyvesant recall that was more winsome and kind than those bestowed on other men indeed had he not seen with jealous eyes with what beaming cordiality and delight she had met and welcomed one or two young gallants who having been comrades of sandy in the corps at the point had found means to get out to the sacramento obviously to see her just before that untimely illness claimed her for its own had he not heard his general his fellow staff officers speaking enthusiastically of her beauty and fascinations and their destructive effects in various quarters had he not been compelled in silence to listen again and in detail to the story of old sam martindales nephew sam martingale the cavalry called him martinet martindale he was dubbed by the doughboys that conscientious dutiful and therefore none too popular veteran whose sisters children much more than supplied the lack of his own farquhar of the cavalry scion of a philadelphia family well known to the stuyvesants of gotham and trotting in the same class had come over from department headquarters where he had a billet as engineer officer to call on stuyvesant and to cheer him up and contribute to his convalescence and did so after the manner of men by talking on all manner of topics for nearly an hour and winding up by a dissertation on billy rays pretty daughter and wally fosters infatuation farquhar said it was the general belief that maidie liked wally mighty well and would marry him were he only in the army and stuyvesant wondered how it was in all the years he had known farquhar and envied him his being a west pointer and in the cavalry he had never really discovered what a bore what a wearisome ass farquhar could be then just as miss ray was reported sitting up and soon to be able to see her friends with what smiling significance did mrs brent so assure him what should stuyvesants general do but select stuyvesant himself to go on a voyage of discovery to iloilo and beyond the commanding general wanted a competent officer who spoke spanish to make a certain line of investigation he consulted vinton vinton thought another voyage the very thing for stuyvesant and so suggested his name it sent the luckless gothamite away just at the time of all others he most wished to remain when he returned within a dozen days the first thing was to submit his written report already prepared aboard ship the next was to report himself in person at colonel brents to be asked into the presence of the girl he loved and longed to see and as has been told ushered out almost immediately selfdetailed in search of sandy he had found the lad easily enough but not so the man with the fit whom for reasons of his own and from what he had seen and heard stuyvesant was most anxious to overtake his carriage whirled him rapidly past the paradeground and over to the first reserve hospital whither he thought the victim had been borne but no civilian with or without fits had recently been admitted inquiry among convalescent patients and soldiers along the road without resulted at last in his finding one of the party that carried the stricken man from the field he had come to said the volunteer before they had gone quarter of a mile had soused his head in water at a hydrant rested a minute offered them a quarter for their trouble buttoned up the light coat that had been torn open in his struggle and nervously but positively declared himself all right and vastly obliged had then hailed a passing carromatta and been whisked away across the moat and drawbridge into the old city there all trace was lost of him baffled and troubled stuyvesant ordered his coachman to take him to the luneta the crowd had disappeared the carriages were nearly all departed the lights were twinkling here and there all over the placid bay it was still nearly an hour to dinnertime at the generals mess and he wished to be alone to think over matters to hear the soothing plash and murmur of the little waves and stuyvesant vowed in his wrath and vexation that satan himself must be managing his affairs for over and above the longedfor melody of the rhythmic waters he was hailed by the buzzsaw stridencies of miss perkins whose first words gave the lie to themselves im all out of breath and so het up runnin after you i cant talk but i was just bound to see you an ive been to your house so often the soldiers laugh at me those young men havent any sense of decency or respect but ill teach em and you see theyll sing another song where can we sit down continued the lady her words chasing each others heels in her breathless haste these lazy worthless spanish officers take every seat along here why here your carriage will do an ive got a thousand things to say heaven be merciful groaned stuyvesant to himself i saw you driving and i told my cabman to catch you if he had to flog the hide off his horse come arent you dont you want to sit down i do anyhow theres no comfort in my cab here ill dismiss it now you can just drop me on the way home you know im living down the calle real a few blocks this side of you all the soldiers know me and if they had their say it wouldnt be the stuckup red cross thats flirting with doctors and living high on the dainties our folks sent over the boys are all right its your generals that have ignored the p d as and ill show em presently what a miss theyve made wait till the papers get the letters i have written but say and this is the woman i thought might be literary moaned stuyvesant as he meekly followed to the little open carriage and with a shiver assisted his angular visitor to a seat a key she shouted a key cochero no quiere mas hoy maсana ocho sabe cochero ocho now dont chewbe whats late in their lingo anyhow tisnt tardy i know thats afternoon tardeeo thank you now well just sit down first lieutenant you see we know how to address officers by their titles if the red cross dont id teach em to mister me if i was an officer now what i want to see you about first is this your general has put me off one way or another every time ive called this last two weeks ive always treated him politely but for some reason hell never see me now and yet they almost ran after me at first now you can fix it easy enough and you do it and you wont regret it i only want him to listen to me three minutes and thats little enough for anybody to ask you do it and i can do a good deal more for you than you think for an i will do it too if certain people dont treat me better its something youll thank me for mightily later on if you dont now ive had my eyes open lieutenant an i see things an i hear things an i know things you mighty little suspect pardon me miss perkins interposed stuyvesant at this juncture his nerves fairly twitching under the strain let us get at the matters on which you wish to speak to me malate cochero he called to the pygmy filipino on the box i am greatly pressed for time he added as the carriage whirled away the hoofs of the pony team flying like shuttles the instant the little scamps were headed homeward well what i want mostly is to see the general hes got influence with general drayton and i know it and these red cross people have poisoned his ears everybodys ears seem to be just now against me and i can get no hearing whatever everything was all right at first everything was promised me and then first one and then another they all backed out and i want to know why im bound to know why and theyd better come to me and make their peace now than wait until the papers and the p d as get after em as they will you hear my words now they will do just as soon as my letters reach the states youre all right enough ive told them how you helped with those poor boys of mine aboard the train bad way theyd been in if we hadnt been there you and i why i just canvassed that train till i got clothes and shoes for every one of those poor burnedout fellows but there wouldnt anybody else have done it and nursing you ought to have seen those boys come to thank me the day i went out to the presidio an most cried some of them did said their own mothers couldnt have done more and theyd do anything for me now but when i went out to their camp at paco their major just as much as ordered me away and that little whippersnapper lieutenant ray that i could take on my knee and spank he lieutenant ray a friend of yours well you may think he is or you may be a friend of his but i can tell you right here and now hes no friend and youll see he isnt whats more i hate to see an honest hightoned young gentleman just throwing himself away on people that cant appreciate him i could tell you stop driver shouted stuyvesant unable longer to control himself miss perkins he added as the little coachman manfully struggled to bring his rushing team to a halt at the curb i have a call to make and am late tell my coachman where to take you and send him back to this corner goodnight madam and gritting his teeth out he sprang to the sidewalk it happened to be directly in front of one of those native resorts where day and night by dozens the swarthy little brown men gather about a billiardtable with its centre ornament of boxwood pins betting on a game resembling the yankee pin pool in everything but the possibility of fair play hovering about the entrance or on the outskirts of the swarm of men and boys a dozen native women some with babies in their arms and nearly all with cigars between their teeth stood watching the play with absorbing interest and a score of dusky potbellied children from two to twelve years of age sprawled about the premises as much at home as the keeper of the place the lamps had been lighted but a few minutes and the game was in full blast some stalwart soldiers regulars from the cuartel de malate from down the street or the nipa barracks of the dakotas and idahos were curiously studying the scene making jovial and unstinted comment after their fearless democratic fashion but sagely abstaining from trying their luck and not so sagely sampling the sizzling soda drinks held forth to them by tempting hands liquor the vendors dare not proffer the provost marshals people had forbidden that and only at the licensed bars in town or by bribery and stealth in the outlying suburbs could the natives dispose of the villainous bino with which at times the unwary and unaccustomed american was overcome three or four men in civilian dress that somehow smacked of the sea as did their muttered lowtoned talk huddled together at the corner post furtively eying the laughing soldiers and occasionally peering up and down the darkened street it was not the place stuyvesant would have chosen to leave his carriage but it was a case of any port in a storm anything to escape that awful woman with one quick spring he was out of the vehicle and into the midst of the group on the narrow sidewalk before he noticed them at all but not before they saw him even as miss perkins threw forward a wouldbe grasping and detaining hand and called him by name one of the group in civilian dress gave sudden instant start sprang round the corner but tripping on some obstacle sprawled full length on the hard stone pavement despite the violence of the fall which wrung from him a fierce curse the man was up in a second away and out of sight in a twinkling go on shouted stuyvesant impatiently imperiously to his coachman as never caring what street he took he too darted around the same corner and his tall white form vanished on the track of the civilian but the sound of the heavy fall the muttered curse and the sudden question in the nearest group whats wrong with sackett had reached miss perkinss ears for while once more the little team was speeding swiftly away the strident voice of the lone passenger was uplifted in excited hail to the coachman to stop and here the filipino demonstrated to the uttermost that the amenities of civilization were yet undreamed of in his darkened intellect as between the orders of the man and the demands of the woman he obeyed the former deaf even to that awful voice he drove furiously on until brought up standing by the bayonets of the patrol in front of the english club and in a fury of denunciation and quiver of mingled wrath and excitement miss perkins tumbled out into the arms of an amazed and disgusted sergeant and demanded that he come at once to arrest a vile thief and deserter chapter xiv that night the sentries all over the suburbs of ermita and malate were peering into every dark alleyway and closely scrutinizing every human being nearing their posts few and far between were these for the natives were encouraged to remain indoors after nine oclock and the soldiers forbidden to be out the streets were deserted save by occasional carriage or carromatta bearing army or navy officers or what were termed the foreign residents english or german as a rule from club or calls to their quarters lights out sounded early at the barracks of the soldiery for they were up with the dawn for breakfast that they might be through with their hardest drills before the heat of the day the pool rooms as the big americanos called these wide open singletabled billiard saloons that flourished in almost every block were required to put up their shutters at nine oclock and every discoverable establishment in which gambling had prevailed in other form had long since been closed by a stonyhearted chief of police whose star was worn on each shoulder rather than the left breast and who to the incredulous amaze of spaniard and filipino alike listened unmoved to the pleas of numerous prominent professors of the gambling industry even when backed by proffers of a thousand a week in gold that the partida de billar had not also been suppressed was due to the fact that like old sledge in the kentucky court its exponents established it to be not a game of chance but skill and such indeed it proved to every yankee who put up his money against the bank with an apparently congenital gift of sleight of hand developed by years of practice at pitch penny from toddling babyhood to cockfighting adolescence the native could so manipulate the tools of his game that no outsider had the faintest show for his money while as against each other as when greek met greek it became a battle of the giants a trial of almost superhuman skill it was the one game left to adult tagalhood in which he might indulge his allabsorbing and unconquerable passion to play for money all over town and suburbs wandered countless natives with wondering gamecocks under their arms suffering for a chance to spur if not to scrap for even the national sport had been stopped never in all the services in all the churches of luzon had such virtue been preached as that practised by these heartless soulless invaders from across the wide pacific men who stifled gambling and scorned all bribes your chief of police is no gentleman declared certain prominent merchants arrested for smuggling opium and naturally aggrieved and indignant at such unheardof treatment he did not tell us how much he wanted he did not even ask us to pay retained in responsible positions in the office of the collector of customs two spanish officers of rank were presently found to have embezzled some twelve thousand dollars in some six weeks of opportunity but this is outrage this is scandalous quoth they in righteous wrath on being bidden to disgorge and ordered before a courtmartial we have nothing but the customary perquisite it is you who would rob us from highest to lowest in church in state in school in every place there seemed no creed that barred the acquisition of money by any means short of actual robbery of the person as for thieving from the premises the filipino stood unequalled the champion sneakthief of the universe and the sentries this night softly lighted by a waning old moon were on the lookout everywhere among the suburbs for two malefactors distinctly differing in type yet equally in demand one said the descriptions compiled from the original information of zenobia perkins spinster residence calle real ermita occupation vicepresident and accredited representative for the philippine islands of the patriotic daughters of america and the additional particulars later obtained from lieutenant gerard stuyvesant aidedecamp to general vinton calle real malate one said the descriptions was a burly thickset somewhat slouching american in clothing of the sailor slopshop variety a man of five feet six and maybe forty years though he might be much younger a coarsefeatured heavybearded man with gray eyes generally bleary and one front tooth gone leaving a gap in the upper jaw next the canine which was fanglike yellow and prominent a man with harsh voice and surly ways a man known as sackett among seamen and certain civilians who probably had made their way to manila in the hope of picking up an easy living a man wanted as murray among soldiers for a deserter jailbird and thief the other malefactor was less minutely described a native five feet eight perhaps very tall for a tagal slender sinewy and with a tuft of wiry hair and sixteen inches of shirt missing for further particulars and the missing sixteen inches as well as the hair inquire at colonel brents number calle san luis ermita it seems that soon after dark that eventful evening mrs brent and miss porter had seen maidie comfortably bestowed in the big broad canebottomed bed in her airy room and had left her to all appearances sleeping placidly towards eight oclock and then gone out to dinner whatever the cause of her agitation on receiving at brents hands the little card photograph of herself it had subsided after a brief lowtoned conference with sandy who quickly came and speedily hastened away and a later visit from dr frank whose placid imperturbable restful ways were in themselves wellnigh as soothing as the orangeflower water prescribed for her even the little nightlight floating in its glass had been extinguished when the ladies left her the room assigned to marion was at the northwest corner of the house its two front windows opened on the wide gallery that in turn opened out on the bagumbayan parade its west windows also two in number were heavily framed there were sliding blinds to oppose to the westering sun translucent shells in place of brittle glass to temper yet admit the daylight and hanging curtains that slid easily on their supporting rods and rendered the room dark as could be desired for the siesta hours of the tropic day the dinnertable brightly lighted by lamps hung from hooks securely driven in the upper beams lath and plaster are unknown in this seismic land was set on the rear gallery overlooking the patio and here soon after eight brent his little household the doctor and two more guests were cosily chatting and dining while noiseless native servants hovered about and maidie ray presumably slept but maidie was not sleeping full of a new anxiety if not of dread and needing to think calmly and clearly she had turned away from her almost too assiduous attendants and closed her eyes upon the world about her a perplexity a problem such as never occurred to her as a possibility one that sorely worried sandy as she could plainly see had suddenly been thrust upon her hitherto she had ever had a most devoted mother as her counsellor and friend but now a time had come when she must think and act for herself the little card photograph picked up by the men on the scene of the scuffle at the edge of the bagumbayan had told its story to her at least and to sandy it could only mean that foster he who spent whole days and weeks at their new mexican station to the neglect of his cattleranch he who had listed in the cavalry and disappeared deserted maybe at carquinez had eluded search pursuit inquiry of every kind and all ignorant probably of the commission obtained for him had still secretly as though realizing his danger followed her to manila this then must have been the tall stranger who called himself an old friend and would give no name for it was to foster in answer to his most urgent plea perhaps touched by his devoted love for her lovely daughter that mrs ray had given that little vignette photograph long months before there on the back was the date in her mothers hand fort averill new mexico february well did marion remember how he had begged her to write her name beneath the picture and how for some reason she herself could not describe she had shrunk from so doing there had been probably half a dozen pictures of foster about their quarters at averill photographs in evening dress in ranch rig in winter garb in tennis costume but only one had he of maidie and that not of her giving now what could his coming mean what madness prompted this stealth and secrecy if innocent of wilful desertion his proper course was to have reported without delay to the military authorities at san francisco and told the cause of his disappearance or detention but he had evidently done nothing of the kind they would surely have heard of it and now he was here still virtually in hiding and possibly in disguise and one unguarded word of hers might land him a prisoner a wartime deserter within the walls of the gloomy carcel in old manila sandy she had to tell and he was overwhelmed with dismay had galloped to paco to see his colonel and get leave for urgent personal and family reasons as he was to say to spend fortyeight hours in and about manila if a possible thing sandy was to trail and find poor foster induce him to surrender himself at once to plead illness inexperience anything and throw himself on the mercy of the authorities sandy would be back by nine unless something utterly unforeseen detained him at east paco meantime what else could she do what could she plan to rescue that reckless luckless harebrained handsome fellow from the plight into which his misguided wasted passion had plunged him from the veranda the clink of glass and china the low hum of merry chat the sound of halfsmothered laughter fell upon the ear and vexed her with its careless jollity impatiently she threw herself upon the other the left side and then sat bolt upright in bed not a breath of air was stirring the night was so still she could hear the soft tinkle of the ships bells off the luneta could almost hear the soothing plash of the wavelets on the beach there was nothing whatever to cause that huge mahogany door to swing upon its welloiled hinges she heard them close it when they went out she saw that it was closed when they were gone yet as she turned on her pillow and towards the faint light through the northwest windows that door was slowly stealthily turning until at last wide open it interposed between her and the outward light at the front many an evening lately she had lain with hands clasped under the back of her bonny head looking dreamily out through that big open window across the gallery beyond and the open casements in front watching the twinkle of the electric lights above the distant ramparts of the old city and the nearer gleam of the brilliant globes that hung aloft along the west edge of the bagumbayan now onehalf of that vista was shut off by the massive door the other was unobscured but even as with beating heart still as a trembling mouse she sat and gazed something glided slowly stealthily noiselessly between her and those betraying lights something dark dim and human for the shape was that of a man a native as she knew by the stiffly brushedup hair above the forehead the loosely falling shirt a native taller than any of their household servants a native whose movements were so utterly without sound that maidie realized on the instant that here was one of manilas famous verandaclimbing housethieves and her first thought was for her revolver she had left it totally forgotten on the little table on the outer gallery even though still weak from her long and serious illness the brave armybred girl was conscious of no sentiment of fear to cry out was sure to bring about the instant escape of the intruder whereas to capture him and prevent his getting away with such valuables as he had probably already laid hands on became instantly her whole ambition the side windows were closed by the sliding blinds even if he leaped from them it would be into a narrow court shut in by a tenfoot spiketopped stone wall he had chosen the veranda climbers favorite hour that which found the family at dinner on the back gallery and the quiet streets wellnigh deserted save by his own skilled and trusted pals from whose shoulders he had easily swung himself to the overhanging structure at the front he would doubtless retire that way the moment he had stowed beneath his loose flapping ropas such items as he deemed of marketable value he was even now stealthily moving across the floor to where her dressingtable stood between the westward windows the man must have the eyes of a cat to see in the dark or else personal and previous knowledge of the premises if she could only slip as noiselessly out by the foot of the bed interpose between him and the door and that one wideopen window then scream for help and grab him as he sprang she might hope to hold him a second or two and then brent and dr frank would be upon him all her trembling was from excitement she knew no thought of fear but strong and steady hands were needed not the fevershattered members only just beginning to regain their normal tone she slid from underneath the soft light coverlet without a sound the sturdy yet elastic bottom of platted cane never creaked or complained she softly pushed outward the fine mosquito netting gathered her dainty nightrobe closely about her slender form and the next minute her little bare feet were on the polished hardwood floor the massive door barely five short steps away she cautiously lifted the netting till it cleared her head and then crouching low moved warily towards the dim vertical slit that told of subdued light in the salon there was no creak to those thick blackwood planks with which manila mansions are floored her outstretched hand had almost reached the knob when her knee collided with a light bamboo bedroom chair there was instant bamboo rasp and protest followed by instant vigorous spring across the room and instant piercing scream from maidies lips something dusky white shot before her eyes something inky black and dusky white was snatched at and seized by those nervous slender but determined little hands something dropped with clash and clatter on the resounding floor something ripped and tore as an agile slippery squirming form bounded from her grasp over the casement to the veranda over the sill into the street and when brent and the doctor and the womenfolk came rushing in and lamps were brought and brent went shouting to sentries up and down the san luis and shots were heard around the nearest corner maid marion second was found crouching upon the canebottomed chair that had baffled her plans halflaughing halfcrying with vexation but firmly grasping in one hand a tuft of coarse straight black hair and in the other a section of filipino shirt the size of a ladys kerchief all she had to show of her predatory visitor and to account for the unseemly disturbance they had made just to think just to think exclaimed mrs brent with clasping hands that this time when you might most have needed it mr stuyvesant should have gone off with your pistol chapter xv but there was little merriment when five minutes later the household had taken account of stock and realized the extent of their losses maidies had evidently been the last room visited the dressingtable and wardrobe of the opposite chamber that occupied by colonel and mrs brent had been ransacked the colonels watch and chain too bulky he said to be worn at dinner in white uniform his loyal legion and army of the potomac insignia and some prized though not expensive trinkets of his good wife were gone miss porters little purse with her modest savings and a brooch that had been her mothers were missing and with these items the skilled practitioner had made good his escape on the floor just under the window in maidies room lay a keen doubleedged knife the stumps of two or three matches found in the colonels apartment and others in miss porters showed that the thief had not feared to make sufficient light for his purpose and from the floor of marions room close to the bureau just where it had been dropped when the prowler was alarmed miss porter picked up one of the oldfashioned phosphors that ignite noiselessly and burn with but a tiny flame marions portemonnaie was in the upper drawer untouched and such jewelry as she owned save two precious rings she always wore was stored in her fathers safe deposit box in the bank at home the colonel was really the greatest loser and declared it served him right both provostmarshal and chief of police having warned him to leave nothing lying around loose at sound of the shots on the calle nueva brent had sallied forth and rushing impetuously into the dimly lighted thoroughfare had narrowly missed losing the top of his head as well as his watch an excited sentry sending a bullet whizzing into space by way of the colonels pith helmet which prompted the doctor to say in his placid and most effective way that more heads had been lost that night than valuables and one bad shot begat another sentries down towards the barracks hearing the three or four quick reports bethought them of the timehonored instructions prescribing that in case of a blaze which he could not personally extinguish the sentry should shout fire discharge his piece and add the number of his post sagely reasoning that nothing but a fire could start such a row or at least that there was sufficient excuse to warrant their having some fun of their own to enliven the dull hours of the night numbers and touched off their triggers and yelled fire and nearer home followed suit and in two minutes the bugles were blowing the alarm all over ermita and malate and rollicking young regulars and volunteers by the hundred were tumbling out into the street all eagerness and rejoicing at the prospect of having a lark with the bomberos the funny little manila firemen with their funnier little squirts on wheels it was fully half an hour before the officers could locate the origin of the alarm and order their companies back to bed an order most reluctantly obeyed for by that time the nearest native firecompany was aroused and on the way to the scene others could be expected in the course of the night and the manila fire department was something that afforded the yankee soldier unspeakable joy he hated to lose such an opportunity but for all his professional calm dr frank was by no means pleased with the excitement attending this episode for an hour or more officers from all over the neighborhood gathered in front of brents and had to be told the particulars billy rays daughter being pronounced the heroine everybody expected her to be while that young lady herself now that the affair could be called closed was in a condition bordering on the electric overwrought and nervous said miss porter but laughing at the whole business what frank thought he didnt say but he cut short sandys visit to his sister and suggested that he go down and tell the assemblage under the front gallery that they would better return to whist or whatever game was in progress when the alarm was given the colonel could not invite them in as matters stood and they slowly dispersed leaving only a senior or two and lieutenant stuyvesant to question further for stuyvesant coming from afar and arriving late was full of anxiety and concern despite his temporary escape circumstances and the civil authorities now become decidedly military had thrown him into still further association with the woman whom he would so gladly have shunned the importunate miss perkins he had taken a turn round the block and refuge in the english club until he thought her disposed of at home and his carriage returned he had come across the little equipage trundling slowly up and down the street in search of him had dined without appetite and smoked without relish striving to forget that odious womans hints and aspersions aimed evidently at the rays and had gone to his own room to write when a corporal appeared with the request from the captain in charge of the police guard of ermita to step down to the office it was much after nine then and the excitement caused by the alarm was about over the troops going back to barracks and presumably to bed the captain apologized for calling on him that late in the evening but told him a man recognized as murray deserter from the cavalry was secreted somewhere in the neighborhood and it was reported that he stuyvesant could give valuable information concerning him stuyvesant could and did and in the midst of it in came miss perkins flushed eager and demanding to know if that villain was yet caught and if not why not then she caught sight of stuyvesant and precipitated herself upon him that man murray had hatefully deceived her and imposed upon her goodness she declared she had done everything to help him at the presidio and he had promised her a paper signed by all the boys asking that the p d as be recognized as the organization the soldiers favored and showed her a petition he had drawn up and was getting signatures to by the hundreds that paper would have insured their being recognized by the government instead of those purseproud red cross people and then he had wickedly deserted after after and stuyvesant could scarcely keep a straight face getting fifty dollars from her and a ring that he was going to wear always until he came back from manila an officer oh he was a smart one a smooth one all that inside of three days after he got to the presidio and then was arrested and then next thing she knew he had fled petition money ring and all another soldier told her the signatures were bogus and that very night she recognized him spite of his beard and at sight of her he had cut and run well he might thought stuyvesant and then miss perkins yielded to the strain of overtaxed nerves and had to be conducted home she lived but a block or two away and it was stuyvesant who had to play escort the air unluckily revived her and at the gateway she turned and had this to add to her previous statements you think the ray people your friends lieutenant and im not the kind of a woman to see a worthy young man trifled with youve been going there every day and everybody knows it and knows that you were sent away to iloilo in hopes of breaking you of it that girls promised in marriage to that young man whos got himself into such a scrape all on her account hes here followed her here to marry her and if hes found hes liable to be shot oh you can believe or not just as you please but never say i didnt try to give you fair warning know why i know much more about whats going on here than your generals do i have friends everywhere among the boys they havent oh very well if you wont listen for stuyvesant had turned away in wrath and exasperation but youd be wiser if you heard me out ive seen mr foster and had the whole story from his lips hes been there every day too till he was taken sick but stuyvesant was out of the gate and at last out of hearing and with a vicious bang to the door the lady of the p d as so recently victimized by the astute sackett retired to the sanctity of her own apartment marvelling at the infatuation of men and yet though stuyvesant had angrily striven to silence the woman and had left her in disgust her words had not failed of certain weight again he recalled with jealous pain the obvious indifference with which his approaches had been received true no wellbred girl would be more than conventionally civil to a stranger even under the exceptional circumstances of their meeting on the train true she was cordial bright winsome and all that when at last he was formally presented but so she was to everybody true they had had many at least he had had many delightful long interviews on the shaded deck of the sacramento but though he would have eagerly welcomed a chance to indulge in sentiment never once did marion encourage such a move on the contrary he recalled with something akin to bitterness that when his voice or words betrayed a tendency towards such a lapse she became instantly and palpably most conventional now in the light of all he had heard from various sources what could he believe but that she was interested to say the least in that other man well and miserably he recalled the words of farquhar who had served some years at the same station with the rays shes the bonniest little army girl i know and her heads as level as it is pretty except on one point shes her fathers daughter and wrapped up in the army shes always said shed marry only a soldier but maidies getting wisdom with years i fancy young foster will be a rich man in spite of himself for hell have his mothers fortune and hes heels over head in love with her but i understood interposed the general with a quick glance at stuyvesant who had risen as though to get another cigar that ray didnt exactly approve of him oh ray didnt seem to have any special objection to foster unless it was that he neglected his business to lay siege to her fosters a gentleman has no bad habits and is the very man nine women out of ten would rejoice in for a husband and ninetynine out of ten if that were a mathematical possibility would delight in as a soninlaw he isnt brilliant buttons would have supplied the lack had he been in the cavalry i dare say hell be ass enough to go in for a commission now and sell out his ranch for a song then shed probably take him and then too as he strolled thoughtfully up the street still dimly lighted by the waning moon and dotted at long intervals by tiny electric fires stuyvesant went over in mind other little things that had come to his ears for many men were of a mind with regard to billy rays daughter and the young officer found himself vaguely weighing the reasons why he should now cease to play the moth why he should be winging his flight away from the flame and utterly ignoring the fact that his feet as though from force of habit were bearing him steadily towards it the snap and ring of a bayoneted rifle coming to the charge the stern voice of a sentry at the crossing of the calle faura brought him to his senses halt who is there staff officer first division was the prompt reply as stuyvesant looked up in surprise advance staff officer and be recognized came the response from a tall form in blue and the even taller white figure stepped forward and stood face to face with the guardian of the night i am lieutenant stuyvesant aidedecamp to general vinton explained the challenged officer noticing for the first time a little column of dusky men in heavy leathern helmets and belts shuffling away towards the jesuit college with an oldfashioned diminutive gooseneck village engine trailing at their heels been a fire sentry he asked where was it up at colonel brents sir i believe his house fronts the paradeground one moment please lieutenant who sir the officer of the guard orders us to account for every officer by name and stuyvesant who in instant alarm had impulsively started was again recalled to himself and hastily turning back spoke aloud stuyvesant my name is ill give it at the guardhouse as i pass once more he whirled about his heart throbbing with anxiety once more he would have hurried on his way to the calle san luis a fire there and she marion still so weak exhausted possibly by the excitement or distress or whatever it was that resulted from brents sudden presentation of that cartedevisite he would fly to her at once for a third time the sentry spoke and spoke in no faltering tone he was an american he was wearing the rough garb of the private soldier in the ranks of the regulars but like scores of other eager young patriots that year he held the diploma of a great albeit a foreign university he had education intelligence and assured social position to back the training and discipline of the soldier he knew his rights as well as his duties and that every officer in the service no matter how high from commanding general down was by regulation enjoined to show respect to sentries and this tall handsome young swell with a name that sounded utterly unfamiliar to california ears was in most unaccountable hurry and spoke as though he the sentry were exceeding his powers in demanding his name it put private thinking bayonets on his mettle halt sir said he my orders are imperative youll have to spell that name in the nervous anxiety to which stuyvesant was a prey the sentrys manner irritated him it smacked at first of undue unnecessary authority yet the soldier in him put the unworthy thought to shame and struggling against his impatience yet most unwillingly stuyvesant obediently turned he had shouldered a musket in a splendid regiment of citizen soldiery whose pride it was that no regular army inspector could pick flaws in their performance of guard and sentry duty he had brought to the point of his bayonet time and again officers far higher in rank than that which he now held he knew that whether necessary or not the sentrys demand was within his rights and there was no course for him but compliance he hastened back and controlling his voice as much as possible began youre right sentry stuy when through a gateway across the street north of the faura came swinging into sight a little squad of armed men again the sentrys challenge sharp clear resonant rang on the still night air three soldiers halted in their tracks the fourth with the white chevrons of a corporal on his sleeves came bounding across the street without waiting for a demand to advance for recognition same old patrol billy he called as he neared them on the way back to the guardhouse then seeing the straps on the officers shoulders respectfully saluted couldnt find a trace outside keep sharp lookout number he added and turning hurriedly back to his patrol started with them up the street in the direction stuyvesant was longing to go sorry to detain you sir and beg pardon for letting him run up on us in that way weve got extra orders tonight theres a queer set mostly natives in that second house yonder and he pointed to a substantial twostory building about thirty paces from the corner they got in there while the fire excitement was on twice ive seen them peeking out from that door thats why i dare not leave here and chase after you after the lieutenant now may i have the name again sir and at last without interruption stuyvesant spelled and pronounced the revered old dutch patronymic at last he was able to go unhindered and now overcome by anxiety eagerness and dread he hardly knew what he broke into fleetfooted rapid run much to the surprise of the staid patrol which he overtook trudging along on the opposite side of the street two blocks away and never halted until again brought up standing by a sentry at the san luis ten minutes later while still listening to brents oftrepeated tale of the theft and still quivering a little from excitement stuyvesant heard another sound the rapid rhythmic beat of dancing footsteps hullo interrupted one of the lingering officers another fire company coming its about time more began to arrive isnt it its a patrol and on the jump too whats up i wonder answered brent spinning about to face towards the calle real there was an officer with this patrol an officer who in his eagerness could barely abide the sentrys challenge officer of the guard with patrol he cried adding instantly as he darted into view sentry which which way did that officer go tall young officer in white uniform in surprise the sentry nodded towards the speechless group standing in front of brents and to them came the boy lieutenant panting and in manifest excitement i beg pardon colonel he began our sentry number was found a minute ago shot dead down on the padre faura my men said they saw an officer running from the spot running this way and this gentleman mr stuyvesant isnt it there was an awed silence an awkward pause i certainly was there not long ago spoke stuyvesant presently and number your sentry was then all right i certainly came running thats all i can hear was the sharp interruption my orders are to arrest you youre my prisoner mr stuyvesant gasped the lad preposterous said dr frank a few minutes later when told by an awestricken group what had occurred preposterous say i echoed brent and yet see hereoh of course you know major macneil field officer of the day he added indicating a tall thinfaced graymustached officer of regulars who had but just arrived and who now held forth a gleaming revolver with the words i picked this up myself not ten yards from where he lay it was marions chapter xvi a solemn assemblage was that at the ermita quarters of the provostguard the following day officers of rank and soldiers from the ranks in rusty blue in gleaming white in dingy khaki rubbed shoulders and elbows in the crowded courtyard in the presence of death the american remembers that men are born equal and forgets the ceremonious observance of military courtesies all voices were lowered all discussion hushed there was a spontaneous movement when the division commander entered and all made way for him without a word but sturdily stood the rank and file and held their ground against all others for the preliminary examination as it might be called was to take place at ten oclock the dead man was of their own grade and an ugly story had gone like wildfire through the barracks and quarters that his slayer was a commissioned officer an aidedecamp of the general himself a scion of a distinguished and wealthy family of the greatest city of america and all official influence presumably would be enlisted in his behalf therefore silent yet determined were they present in strong force not in disrespect not in defiance but with that calm yet indomitable resolution to see for themselves that justice was done that soldiers of no other than the anglosaxon race could ever imitate or that officers not american could ever understand appreciate and even tacitly approve the dead man had died instantly not in the flush and glory of battle but in the lonely yet most honorable discharge of the sacred duty of the sentinel murder most foul was his and had he been wellnigh a pariah among them a man set apart from his kind the impulse of his fellowsoldiers would have been to see to it that his death at such a time and on such a duty went not unavenged as it was the man who lay there already stiff and cold was known among them as one of the bravest brightest spirits of their whole array a lad of birth probably more gentle than that of many an officer of gifts of mind and character superior to those of not a few superiors a fellow who had won their fellowship as easily as he had learned the duties of the soldier a whole battalion in the regulars and dozens of gallant boys in the idahos and north dakotas knew billy benton and had been full of sympathy when he was picked up one night some three weeks previous his head laid open by a powerful blow from some blunt instrument bleeding and senseless even when released from hospital a fortnight later he was dazed and queer was twice reported out of quarters over night and absent from rollcall but was forgiven because of previous character and the belief that he was really not responsible for these soldier solecisms one thing seemed to worry him and that was as he admitted that he had been robbed of some papers that he valued but he soon seemed all right again said his fellows at least to the extent of resuming duty and when cleanshaved and in his best attire he marched on guard that glad october morning they were betting on him for the first chevrons and speedy commission all that his few intimates the one or two who claimed to know him could be induced to admit was that his real name was not benton and that he had enlisted utterly against the wishes of his kindred and so regulars and volunteers alike they thronged the open patio and all approaches thereto and no officer would now suggest that that court be cleared it was best that thinking bayonets should be there to hear and see for himself no indeed dont do anything of the kind said the general promptly when asked halfhesitatingly by the captain of the guard whether he preferred to exclude the men and in this unusual presence the brief straightforward examination went on first to tell his tale was the corporal of the second relief he had posted his men between and private benton on number at the corner of the calle real and padre faura that post had been chosen for him as being not very far away from that of the guard as the young feller had not entirely recovered his strength and the officer of the day had expressed some regret at his having so soon attempted to resume duty but benton had laughingly said that he was all right and he didnt mean to have other men doing sentry go for him soon after nine said the corporal i went round warning all the sentries to look out for the tall filipino and short squat american as directed by the officer of the guard the officer of the guard himself went round about that time personally cautioning the sentries there was a good deal of fun and excitement just then down the street number in the calle nueve had shot twice at some fleeing natives who nearly upset him as they dashed round the corner from the bagumbayan and he had later mistaken colonel brent in his white suit for a filipino and nervously fired numbers and in the side streets mistook the shooting for fire alarm and private benton repeated in accordance with his orders but when i the corporal saw him he was laughing to kill himself over the manila fire department benton didnt seem much impressed at first about the thief and the deserter but towards when the corporal again visited his post and the streets were getting quiet benton said there were some natives in the second house across the way whose movements puzzled him they kept coming to the front door and windows and peeping out at him a patrol came along just then searching alleyways and yards and they looked about the premises while he corporal scott started west on the faura to warn number who was over towards the beach and while there major macneil the field officer of the day came along and after making inquiries as to what number had seen and heard and asking him his orders he turned back to the faura corporal scott following one block west of the calle real the major stopped as though to listen to some sound he seemed to have heard in the dark street running parallel with the real and then stepped into it as though to examine so scott followed and almost instantly they heard a muffled report like a pistol inside a blanket and hastening round into the faura they found benton lying on his face in the middle of the street just at the corner of the calle real stone dead his rifle they found in the gutter not twenty feet from him scott ran at once to the guardhouse three blocks away and gave the alarm then the patrol said that a tall officer running full speed had passed them and here the provostmarshal interposed with never mind what the patrol said just tell what you the witness did next scott continued that he and others with the lieutenant officer of the guard ran back to number s post and there stood the major with the pistol when we asked should we search the yards and alleys the major nodded but the moment he heard the men telling about the running officer he gave the lieutenant orders and again the provostmarshal said never mind the major would describe all that and the major did he corroborated what corporal scott had said and then went on with what happened after scott was sent to alarm the guard barring some opening of shutters and peering out on the part of natives anxious to know the cause of the trouble there was no further demonstration until scott and others came running back but meanwhile something gleaming in the roadway the calle real about fifteen paces from the corner and up the street to the north towards the bagumbayan and close to the sidewalk attracted his attention he stepped thither and picked up this revolver by the electric light at the corner he saw that one chamber was empty when the guard came on the run and he heard of the tall officer fleeing up towards the bagumbayan the direction in which the pistol lay he sent mr wharton lieutenant wharton with a patrol in pursuit the inscription on the pistol revealed its ownership and cast certain suspicions that warranted his action he believed in ordering the instant arrest of the officer if found major macneil went on to say he had not yet made the acquaintance of lieutenant stuyvesant and did not actually know when he gave the order that it was lieutenant stuyvesant who ran up the street and here the major was evidently in a painful position but faced his duty like a man and told his story without passion or prejudice despite the fact that he declared the murdered man to be one of the very best young fellows in his battalion and that he was naturally shocked and angered at his death then the name of private reilly was called and a keenfeatured little irishman stepped forward it was one of the patrol corporal stamford first relief was in charge of it they had been hunting as far over as the knowsalady and on coming back number told them of some natives at the second house corporal stamford posted him reilly in the first yard near the street to head off any that tried to run out that way in case they stirred up a mares nest and took the other fellers and went round by the front nothing came of it but while they were beating up the yards and enclosures reilly heard benton challenge and saw a tall officer come up to be recognized they had some words the officer and the sentry he couldnt tell what but the officer spoke excited like and all of a sudden jumped away and started as though to run and number hollered after him though reilly didnt clearly understand what was said at all events he made him come back and it here reilly seemed greatly embarrassed and glanced about the room from face to face in search of help or sympathy it seemed to kind of rile the officer he acted like he wasnt going to come back first off and then the corporal came along with the patrol and the officer had to wait while stamford was recognized and the boys was sayin billy had a right to stand the corporal off until the lieutenant said advance him and we was laughin about it and sayin billy wasnt the boy to make any mistake about his orders when we heard the lieutenant come arunnin swift down tother side the street and then saw him scootin it for the open prade did the witness recognize the officer did he see him plainly yes the electric light was burnin at the corner and hed seen him several times driving by the barks was the officer present now yes and reillys face reddened to meet the hue of his hair reluctantly awkwardly pathetically almost for in no wise did identification as it happened depend on his evidence the little irish lad turned till his eyes met those of stuyvesant sitting pale calm and collected by his generals side and while the eyes of all men followed those of reilly they saw that so far from showing resentment or dismay the young gentleman bowed gravely reassuringly as though he would have the witness know his testimony was exactly what it should be and that no blame or reproach attached to him for the telling of what he had seen then dr frank was called and he gave his brief testimony calmly and clearly it was mainly about the pistol he recognized it as one he had seen and examined the previous afternoon at colonel brents quarters on the san luis it was lying on a little table in the front veranda he had closely examined it could not be mistaken about it and when he left it was still lying on that table who were present when he left other than the immediate family only lieutenant stuyvesant had he again visited the colonels that evening he had he returned an hour or so later to dine the ladies had then left their seats in the veranda and he noticed that the pistol was no longer on the table presumed miss ray had taken it with her to her room and thought no more about it as indicated by the inscription the pistol was her property then lieutenant ray was called but there was no response in low tone the assistant provostmarshal explained that the orderly sent to paco with message for lieutenant ray returned with the reply that mr ray had two days leave and was somewhere uptown he as yet had not been found a young officer of artillery volunteered the information that late the previous evening somewhere about ten mr ray had called at the cuartel de meysic far over on the north side he was most anxious to find a soldier named connelly who he said was at the presidio at the time the lieutenants quarters were entered and robbed and lieutenant abercrombie had taken mr ray off in search of the soldier ray not appearing the examination of assistant surgeon brick began brick was the first medical officer to reach the scene of the murder benton was then stone dead and brief examination showed the hole of a bullet of large calibre probably pistol right over the heart the coarse blue uniform shirt and the fine undergarment of lisle thread showed by burn and powderstain that the pistol had been close to or even against the breast of the deceased the bullet was lodged he believed under the shoulderblade but no postmortem had yet been permitted a circumstance the doctor referred to regretfully and it was merely his opinion based on purely superficial examination that death was instantaneous the result of the gunshot wound referred to dr brick further gave it as his professional opinion that postmortem should be no longer delayed and then at last came stuyvesants turn to speak for himself and in dead silence all men present faced him and listened with bated breath to his brief sorrowful words he was the officer halted by the sentry on number and called upon to come back the sentry did not catch his name and had to have it spelled he frankly admitted his impatience but denied all anger at the enforced detention the information about the fire at colonel brents had caused him anxiety and alarm and as soon as released by the sentry he had run had passed the patrol on the run but there had been no altercation no misunderstanding even the sentry had carried out his orders in a soldierly way that compelled the admiration of the witness and before leaving him stuyvesant had told him that he had done exactly right the news that the sentry was found dead five minutes thereafter was a shock lieutenant stuyvesant declared he carried no firearms whatever that night and was utterly innocent of the sentrys death he recognized he said the revolver exhibited by major macneil he did not hesitate to admit that he had seen and examined it late the previous afternoon at the quarters of colonel brent that he had actually put it in his trousers pocket not two minutes before he left the house to go in search of lieutenant ray but he solemnly declared that as he left the veranda he placed the pistol on a little table just to the right of the broad entrance to the salon within that apartment and never saw it again until it was produced here frank candid open and aboveboard as was the manner of the witness it did not fail to banish in great measure the feeling of antagonism that had first existed against him in the crowded throng but in the cold logic of the law and the chain of circumstantial evidence they plainly saw that every statement even that of stuyvesant himself bore heavily against him a lawyer had he been represented by counsel would have permitted no such admissions as he had made a gentleman unschooled in the law preferred the frank admission to the distress of seeing mrs brent and perhaps others called into that presence to testify to his having had the pistol with him when he left the gallery brent in his bewilderment had blurted out his wifes words in the hearing of the provostmarshals people late the night before and he and his household were yet to be called and when called would have to say that though they passed and possibly repassed through the salon between the moment of stuyvesants departure and that of their going out to dinner not one of their number noticed even so bright and gleaming an object as maidies revolver true the lights were not brilliant in the salon true the little table stood back against the wall five or six feet from the doorway still that pistol was a prominent object and a man must have been in extraordinary haste indeed to leave a loaded weapon lying round loose in the hall that was the way thinking bayonets argued it and soldiers by the score crowding the sidewalk and entrance and unable to force their way in or even to make room for a most importunate female struggling on the outskirts hung on the words of an orderly who despatched in further search of lieutenant ray was forcing a way out how is it going said he why that young fellers just as good as hanging himself he admits having had the pistol that did the business ten minutes later a filipino servant went to answer an imperative rap at the panel in the massive door of no calle san luis dr frank had been early to see his patient and had enjoined upon mrs brent and miss porter silence as to last nights tragedy not until she was stronger was miss ray to be allowed to know of the murder of private benton by that time said he we shall be able to clear up this mystery i hope the colonel had gone round to the policestation mrs brent nervous and unhappy had just slipped out for ten seconds as she said to miss porter to see an old army chum and friend who lived only three doors away miss porter who had been awake hours of the night had finally succeeded as she believed in reading maidie to sleep and then stretching herself upon the bamboo couch across the room was the next thing she knew aroused by voices sandy ray had entered so noiselessly that she had not heard but maidie had evidently been expecting him in low earnest tone he was telling the result of his search the night before she heard the words connelly is down with some kind of fever in hospital and hasnt seen or heard anything of any one even faintly resembling foster then i found your old friend the brakeman general vinton has got him a good place in the quartermasters department and he tells me he knows nothing has seen and heard nothing now im going to division headquarters to find stuyvesant and then said miss porter my heart popped up into my throat and i sprang from the sofa but too late an awful rasping voice at the doorway stilled the soft kentucky tones and filled the room with dread then youve no time to lose young man its high time somebody besides me set out to help him that other young man you call foster lies dead at the policestation killed by your pistol miss ray and mr stuyvesant goes to jail for it chapter xvii in so far as human foresight could provide against the cabling to the states of tremendous tales that had little or no foundation the commanding general had been most vigilant the censorship established over the despatches of the correspondents had nipped many a sensation in the bud and insured to thousands of interested readers at home far more truthful reports of the situation at manila than would have been the case had the press been given full swing yet with hongkong only sixty hours away there was nothing to prevent their writing to and wiring from that cosmopolitan port and here at least was a story that would set the states ablaze before it could be contradicted and away it went fast as the esmeralda could speed it across the china sea and the wires with it wellnigh girdle the globe a gallant young volunteer walter foster of ohio serving in the regulars under the assumed name of benton foully murdered by lieutenant gerard stuyvesant of new york a love affair at the bottom of it all rivals for the hand of a fair army girl daughter of a distinguished officer of the regular service lieutenant stuyvesant under guard terrible wrath of the soldiers comrades lynching threatened speedy justice demanded the maiden prostrated identification of the victim by miss zenobia perkins vicepresident and accredited representative for the philippine islands of the society of patriotic daughters of america army circles in manila stirred to the bottom etc etc joyous reading this for friends and kindred in the fardistant states admirable exhibit of journalistic enterprise the hong kong papers coming over in course of another week were full of it and of appropriate comment on the remarkable depravity of the american race and chicago journals notably the palladium bristled with editorial explosions over the oftrepeated acts of outrage and brutality on part of the american officer to the friendless private in the american ranks and thousands of honest wellmeaning men and women who had seen year after year lie after lie one stupendous story after another punctured riddled and proved a vicious and malignant slander swallowed this latest one whole and marvelled that the american officer could be the monster the paper proved him to be but one woman at last and at least was happy perched now on a pinnacle of fame and in the patriotic daughters of america as represented by their vicepresident and accredited representative in the philippines virtue and rectitude reigned triumphant zenobia perkins was in her glory of all the citizens or soldiers of the united states in and about manila male or female staff or supply signal or hospital corps red cross or crossed cannon rifles or sabres this indomitable woman was now the most sought after the most in demand her identification of the dead man had been positive and complete i suspected instantly she declared in presence of the assembled throng when i heard lieutenant stuyvesant had shot a soldier just who it might be i remembered the young man who disappeared from the train before we got to oakland i suspected him the moment the corporal told me about the mysterious young man trying to see miss ray i had my carriage chase right after him to the nozaleda and caught him halfrunning halfstaggering and i took him driving until he got caamed down and told him he neednt worry any more he was among friends at last and the p d as would take care of him and guard his secret and see him done right by oh yes i did we werent going to see an innocent boy shot as a deserter when he didnt know what he was doing he wouldnt admit at first that he was walter foster at all but at last when he saw i was sure it was him he just broke right down and as much as owned right up he said hed been slugged or sandbagged three weeks before and robbed of money and of papers of value that he needed to help him in his trouble he asked me what steps could be taken to help a poor fellow accused of desertion he didnt dare say anything to any of the officers cause the men he trusted at all one or two welleducated young fellows like himself found out that hed be shot if found guilty the only thing he could do was make a good record for himself in the infantry and having done that he could later on hope for mercy he asked a heap of questions and i just told him to keep a stiff upper lip and wed see him through and he plucked up courage and said he believed hed be able to have hope again at all events hed go on duty right off when i asked him how he dared go to colonel brents where at any time lieutenant ray might recognize him he said he never did except when he knew lieutenant ray was out of the way then i tried to get him to tell what he expected to gain by seeing miss ray and he was confused and said he was so upset all over he really didnt know that he had been there so often he thought if he could see her and tell her the whole story she could have influence enough to get him out of his scrape he was going to tell me the whole story but patrols and sentries were getting too thick and he had to get somewhere to change his dress for rollcall and i gave him my address and he was to come and see me in two days and now hes killed and it aint for me to say why or who did it bentons murder was certainly the sensation of the week in manila for there were features connected with the case that made it still more perplexing even mysterious major farquhar who must have seen young foster frequently at fort averill had been sent to survey the harbor of iloilo and could not be reached in time but dr frank called in course of the day to identify the remains long and carefully studied the calm waxen features of the dead soldier and said with earnest conviction this is undoubtedly the young man who appeared at colonel brents and whom i sought to question but who seemed to take alarm at once and with some confused apology backed away he was dressed very neatly in the best white drilling sackcoat and trousers as made in manila with a fine straw hat and white shoes and gloves but he had a fuzzy beard all over his face then and his manner was nervous and excitable his eyes alone showed that he was unstrung bodily and mentally i set him down for a crank or some one just picking up from serious illness the city is full of newcomers and as yet no one knows how many strangers have recently come to town i saw him only that once in a dim light but am positive in this identification two or three noncommissioned officers of bentons regiment were examined their stories were concise and to the point the young soldier had come with the recruits from san francisco along late in august he was quiet wellmannered attended strictly to his own business and was eager to learn everything about his duties they sized him up as a young man of education and good family who hadnt influence enough to get a commission and so had enlisted to win it he had money but no bad habits he helped in the office with the regimental papers and could have been excused from all duty and made clerk but wouldnt be he said hed help whenever they wanted him but he didnt wish to be excused from guard or drills or patrol or picket said he wanted to learn all there was in it even the rough fellows in the ranks couldnt help liking him he had a pleasant word for everybody that didnt bother him with questions he made one or two acquaintances but kept mostly to himself never got any letters from america but there were two from hong kong perhaps more if he wrote letters himself he posted them in town they never went with the company mail from the cuartel everybody seemed to know that benton wasnt his own name but that was nothing the main thing queer about him was that he got a pass whenever he could and went by himself most generally out to paco where the cavalry were yet he said he didnt know anybody there it was out paco way on the calzada herran close to the corner of the singalon road the patrol picked him up with his head laid open and hed been flighty pretty much ever since and troubled about being robbed seemed all right again however when reporting for duty and perfectly sane and straight then two very bright young soldiers clark and hunter were called in for their statements they too had enlisted in a spirit of patriotism and desire for adventure never knew benton till the voyage was nearly over then they seemed to drift together as it were and kept up their friendship after reaching manila benton was not his real name and he was not a graduate of any american college he had been educated abroad and spoke french and german no they did not know what university he attended he was frank and pleasant so long as nobody tried to probe into his past never heard him mention lieutenant stuyvesant all three of them benton clarke and hunter had observed that young officer during the month as he drove by barracks sometimes with the general sometimes alone but they did not know his name and nothing indicated that benton had any feeling against him or that he had seen him they admitted having conveyed the idea to comrades that they knew more about benton than they would tell but it was a bluff everybody was full of speculation and curiosity and well just for the fun of the thing they let on as they said that they were in his confidence but they werent leastwise to any extent they knew he had money knew he went off by himself and warned him to keep a look out or hed be held up and robbed some night the only thing of any importance they had to tell was that one day just before his misfortune benton was on guard and posted as sentry over the big krupps in the spanish battery at the west end of the calle san luis clarke and hunter had a kodak between them and a consuming desire to photograph those guns the sentries previously posted there refused to let them come upon the parapet said it was gainst orders benton said that unless positive orders were given to him to that effect he would not interfere so they got a pass on the same day and benton easily got that post men didnt usually want it it was such a bother but unluckily with the post benton got the very orders they dreaded so when they would have made the attempt he had to say no they came away crestfallen and stumbled on two sailorlooking men who from the shelter of a heavy stone revetment wall were peering with odd excitement of manner at benton who was again marching up and down his narrow post a very soldierly figure that young feller drove you back did he inquired one of them a burly thickset hulking man of middle height puttin on considerable airs aint he whats he belong to th infantry answered clarke shortly not liking the strangers looks words or manner and then pushed on but the stranger followed out of sight of the sentry now and wanted to continue the conversation sure he aint in the cavalry asked the same man cocksure was the blunt reply whats it to you anyhow oh nothin thought id seen him before know his name names benton far as i know come on hunter said clarke obviously unwilling to stay longer in such society and little more was thought of it for the time being but now the provostmarshals assistant wished further particulars was there anything unusual about the questioners teeth and a hundred men looked up in surprise and suddenly rearoused interest yes sir said clarke one tooth was missing upper jaw next the big eyetooth and as the witness stood down the general and the questioning officer beamed on each other and smiled an adjournment was necessitated during the early afternoon lieutenant rays statement was desired also that of private connelly of the artillery and an effort had been made through the officers of the cavalry at paco to find some of the recruits who were of the detachment now quite frequently referred to in that command as the singed cats but it transpired that most of them had been assigned to troops of their regiment not yet sent to manila only half the regiment being on duty foot duty at that in the philippines the only man among them who had travelled with foster from denver as far as sacramento was the young recruit mellen he was on outpost but would be relieved and sent to ermita as quickly as possible connelly said the surgeon at the cuartel de meysic was too ill to be sent thither unless on a matter of vital importance and sandy ray hastening from maidies bedside in response to a summons was met by the tidings that a recess had been ordered and that he would be sent for again when needed everywhere in malate ermita paco and for that matter the barracks and quarters of manila the astonishing story was the topic of all tongues that day among the regulars by this time the tale of fosters devotion to maidie ray was well known while that of stuyvesants later but assiduous courtship was rapidly spreading men spoke in murmurs and with sombre faces and strove to talk lightly on other themes but the tragedy with all the honored names it involved weighed heavily upon them stuyvesant came to them to be sure a total stranger but vinton had long known him and that was enough his name his lineage his high position socially all united to throw discredit on the grave suspicion that attached to him yet here they were brought face to face rivals for the hand of as lovely a girl as the army ever knew it was even possible that foster was the aggressor reillys reluctant words gave proof that discussion of some kind had occurred and stuyvesant broke away and was apparently wrathful at being compelled to go back then more words longer detention then a swiftrunning form stuyvesants away from the scene then the fatal pistol and against this chain of circumstances only the unsupported statement of the accused that he left that revolver on the table in the salon left it where it was never afterwards seen no wonder men shook their heads it was three in the afternoon when the examination was resumed meantime from all over manila came the correspondents burning with zeal and impatience for the esmeralda was scheduled to leave at five and a stonyhearted censor at the ayuntamiento had turned down whole pages of thrilling copy that would cost three dollars a word to send to the states but sell for thirty times as much when it got there despite the positive identification of the remains wrote one inspired journalist by such an unimpeachable and intelligent woman as zenobia perkins who attended the murdered lad after he was so severely burned upon the train despite the equally positive recognition by that eminent and distinguished surgeon dr frank this military satrap and censor dares to say that not until the identity of the deceased is established to the satisfaction of the military authorities will the report be cabled how long will the people of america submit to such tyrannical dictation when the provostmarshal himself with his assistants and vinton and stuyvesant returned at three and found zenobia the vortex of a storm of questioners the centre of a circle of rapidwriting scribes these latter could have sworn did swear some of them that far from expediting matters in order that a full report might be sent by the esmeralda the officials showed a provoking and exasperating disposition to prolong and delay them and even at this time and at this distance with all his regard personal and professional for the official referred to the present chronicler is unable entirely to refute the allegation out in the street a score of carriages and as many quilez and carromattas stood waiting by the curb and gallant captain taylor of the esmeralda could have added gold by the hundred to his wellearned store would he but have promised to hold his ship until the court not the tide served but an aide of the commanding general had driven to the ship towards two oclock and said something to that able seaman no power of the press could tell what and all importunity as to delaying his departure there was but one reply five sharp and not a second later it was after three yes long after that witnesses of consequence came up for examination dr brick had got the floor and was pleading postmortem at once in this climate and under such conditions decomposition would be so rapid said he that by tomorrow his own mother couldnt recognize him but the provostmarshal drawled that he didnt see that further mutilation would promote the possibility of recognition and brick was set aside it was quarter to four when young mellen was bidden to tell whether he knew and what he knew of the deceased and all men hushed their very breath as the lad was conducted to the blanketshrouded form under the overhanging gallery in the open patio the hospital steward slowly turned down the coverlet and mellen wellnigh as pallid as the corpse was bidden to look look he did long and earnestly the little weights that some one had placed on the eyelids were lifted the soft hair had been neatly brushed the lips were gently closed the delicate clearcut features wore an expression of infinite peace and rest and mellen slowly turned and facing the official group at the neighboring table nodded you think you recognize the deceased came the question if so what was his name i think so yes sir its foster at least thats what i heard it was had you ever known him to speak to he was in the same detachment on the train dont know as i ever spoke to him sir was the answer but you think you know him by sight where did you first notice him think it was ogden sir i didnt pay much attention before that a man called murray knew him and got some money from him thats how i came to notice him the rest of us hadnt any to speak of ever see him again to speak to or notice particularly after you left ogden did he sit near you was the somewhat caustic query no sir only just that once but you are sure this is the man you saw at ogden mellen turned uneasily unhappily and looked again into the still and placid face that meeting was on a glaring day in june this was a clouded afternoon in late october and nearly five months had slipped away yet he had heard the solemn story of murder and had never up to now imagined there could be a doubt in mute patience the sleeping face seemed appealing to him to speak for it to own it to stand between it and the possibility of its being buried friendless unrecognized its its him or his twin brother sir said mellen one question more had you heard before you came here who was killed yes sir they said it was foster and now with pencils swiftly plying several young civilians were edging to the door james farnham was called and a sturdy young man with keen weatherbeaten face stepped into the little open space before the table three fingers were gone from the hand he instinctively held up as though expecting to be sworn his testimony was decidedly a disappointment farnham said that he was brakeman of that train and would know some of that squad of recruits anywhere but this one well he remembered talking to one man at ogden a tall finelooking young feller something very like this one this might have been him or it might not he couldnt even be sure that this was one of the party he really didnt know but there was a chap called murray that hed remember easy enough anywhere and then it was after four and the race for the esmeralda began it was utterly unnecessary said certain bystanders to question any more members of the guard but the provostmarshal did and not until did he deign to send for the most important witness of all the brother of the young girl to whom the deceased had been so devotedly attached they had not long to wait for sandy ray happened to be almost at the door the throng seemed to take another long breath and then to hold it as the few preliminaries answered mr ray was bidden to look at the face of the deceased pale composed yet with infinite sadness of mien the young officer campaign hat in hand stepped over to the trestle and the steward again slowly withdrew the light covering again exposing that placid face the afternoon sunshine was waning the bright glare of the midday hours had given place within the enclosure to the softer almost shadowy light of early eve ray had but just come in from the street without where the slanting sunbeams bursting through the clouds beat hot upon the dazzling walls and his eyes had not yet become accustomed to the change reverently pityingly he bent and looked upon the features of the dead an expression first of incredulity then of surprise shot over his face he closed his eyes a second as though to give them strength for sterner test and then bending lower once more looked carefully studied the forehead eyebrows lashes mouth nose and hair then straightening up he slowly faced the waiting room and said i never set eyes on this man in my life before today chapter xviii to say that mr rays abrupt announcement was a surprise to the dense throng of listeners is putting it mildly to say that it was received with incredulity on part of the soldiery and concern if not keen apprehension by old friends of sandys father who were present is but a faint description of the effect of the lads emphatic statement to nine out of ten among the assembly the young officer was a total stranger to more than nine out of ten the identification of the dead as walter foster maidie rays luckless lover was already complete and many men who have made up their minds are incensed at those who dare to differ from them true mr stuyvesant had said that the sentry number did not remind him except in stature form and possibly in features of the recruit he knew as foster on the train he did not speak like him but when closely questioned by the legal adviser of the provostmarshals department the officer who conducted most of the examination with much of the manner of a prosecuting attorney mr stuyvesant admitted that he had only seen foster once to speak to and that was at night in the dim light of the sacramento station on what might be called the offside of the train where the shadows were heavy and while the face of the young soldier was partially covered with a bandage yet vinton attached importance to his aidedecamps opinion and when ray came out flatfooted as it were in support of stuyvesants views the general was visibly gratified but except for these very few ray had spoken to unbelieving ears sternly the military lawyer took him in hand and began to probe no need to enter into details in ten minutes the indignant young gentleman who never in his life had told a lie found himself the target of ten score of hostile eyes some wrathful some scornful some contemptuous some insolent some only derisive but all save those of a few silently observant officers threatening or at least inimical claiming first that he knew walter foster well and indeed it seemed to him he did for his mothers letters to the big horn ranch had much to say of maidies civilian admirer though maidie herself could rarely be induced to speak of him ray was forced to admit that he had met him only twice or thrice during a brief and hurried visit to fort averill to see his loved ones before they moved to fort leavenworth and then he owned he paid but little attention to the sighing swain questioned as to his opportunities of studying and observing foster sandy had been constrained to say that he hadnt observed him closely at all he didnt want to exactly they first met it seems in saddle the winter weather was glorious at averill they had a fine pack of hounds coursing for jackrabbit was their favorite sport and despite the fact that foster had a beautiful and speedy horse his seat was so poor and his hand so jerky he never managed to get up to the front said sandy it was not brought out in evidence but the fact was that sandy could never be got to look on foster with the faintest favor as a suitor for his sisters hand a fellow who could neither ride shoot nor spar whose accomplishments were solely of the carpet and perhaps the tenniscourt the boy had no use for he and maidie rode as though born to the saddle he had seen foster in an english ridingsuit and english saddle and an attempt at the english seat but decidedly without the deft english hand on his fretting hunters mouth the one day that they appeared in field together and the sight was too much for sandy that night at dinner and the later dance fosters perfection of dress and manner only partially redeemed him in sandys eyes and well really that was about all he ever had seen of foster questioned as to his recollection of fosters features stature etc sandy did his best and only succeeded in portraying the deceased almost to the life except he said foster had long thick curving eyelashes and this man hasnt but it was remembered that brows and lashes both were singed off in the fire so that point failed questioned as to whether he realized that his description tallied closely with the appearance of the deceased sandy said that that all might be but still this isnt foster questioned as to whether if the deceased were again to have the color and action the life that foster had a year ago might not the resemblance to foster be complete sandy simply couldnt tell nearly an hour was consumed in trying to convince him he must or at least might be mistaken but to no purpose he mentioned a card photograph of foster in ranch costume that would convince the gentlemen he thought that there was no such very strong resemblance and a note was written to miss porter asking her to find and send the picture in question it came a cabinet photo of a tall slender wellbuilt young fellow with dark eyes and brows and thick curving lashes and oval attractive face despite its boyishness and nine men out of ten who saw and compared it with the face of the dead declared it looked as though it had been taken for the latter perhaps a year or so agone ray had hurt his own case and when excused to return to his sisters side went forth into the gathering twilight stricken with the consciousness that he was believed to have lied in hopes of averting scandal from that sisters name and on the morrow with that postmortem so insisted on by brick no longer delayed the dead again lay mutely awaiting the final action of the civilmilitary authorities and to the surprise of the officers and guards before going to the daily routine that kept him from early morn till late at night in his beleaguered office drayton came and bowed his gray head and gazed with sombre eyes into the sleeping features now before him a pinched and tired look was coming over the waxen face that had been so calm and placid as though in utter weariness over this senseless delay drayton had been told of young rays almost astounding declaration and officers of the law half expected him to make some adverse comment thereon but he did not alert correspondents amazed to see the corps commander at such a place and so far from the ayuntamiento surrounded him as he would have retaken his seat in his carriage and clamored for something as coming from him in the way of an expression of opinion which with grave courtesy the general declined to give but could not prevent appearing a week later in a thousand papers and in a dozen different forms ferried over to hong kong by the shogun or some other ship and cabled thence to waiting christendom drayton had his own reasons for wishing to see the remains then vinton and later ray and as his movements were closely followed the wits of the correspondents were sorely taxed but the examination was to be resumed at nine a rumor was running wild that miss ray herself was to be summoned to appear and drayton had to be dropped in favor of a more promising sensation it began with dreary surgical technicalities the heavy bullet had traversed the ascending aorta near its bifurcation said brick who though only an autopsical adjunct was permitted to speak for his associates death said he had resulted from shock and was probably instantaneous no other cause could be attributed no other wound was discovered no marks of scuffle except some unimportant scratches on the shoulder the bullet was found to weigh exactly the same as those of the unexploded cartridges in poor maidies prized revolver and though brick would gladly have kept the floor and told very much more the provostmarshal as gladly got rid of him for despite the unwillingness of the medical officers at the cuartel de meysic connelly had been trundled down to ermita in a springy ambulance and was presently awaiting his turn the moment his coming was announced connelly was ushered in and brick shut off short a nurse and doctor were with the sturdy little irishman and he needed but brief instruction as to what was wanted taken to the trestle and bidden to look upon the face of the deceased and say if he could who it was connelly looked long and earnestly and then turned feebly but calmly to the attentive array if it wasnt that this looks much thinner said he id say it was a man who listed with our detachment at denver last june about the first week the name was foster he disappeared somewhere between sacramento and oakland and i never saw him again questioned as to whether there was any mark by which the recruit could be known connelly said that he was present when foster was physically examined and he never saw a man with a whiter skin there wasnt a mark on him anywhere then that he could remember bidden to tell what he knew of foster the young artilleryman was given a seat and somewhat feebly proceeded foster was bound to enlist he said was of legal age and looked it gave his full name his home and business said he owned a ranch down in new mexico near fort averill didnt know enough to go in for a commission and was determined to enlist and serve as a private soldier in the cavalry he had good clothes and things that he put in a trunk and expressed back to averill keeping only a valise full of underwear etc but that was burned up on the car afterwards two days later before they started for the west a man who said his name was murray came to the rendezvous and asked for foster who was then being drilled a detachment was to start the next day and anybody could see that foster wasnt glad to welcome murray by any means but on that very evening murray said that he too wished to enlist and go with his friend he squeezed through the physical examination somehow and they took him along though nobody liked his looks then connelly told what he could of the fire and of fosters subsequent disappearance also of murray and murrays misconduct they asked connelly about lieutenant stuyvesant and here connelly waxed almost eloquent certainly enthusiastic in stuyvesants praise somebody went so far however as to ask whether he had ever seen any manifestation of illwill between stuyvesant and recruit foster whereat connelly looked astonished seemed to forget his fever and to show something akin to indignation no indeed said he there was nothing but goodwill of the heartiest kind everywhere throughout the detachment except for that one blackguard murray they all felt most grateful to the lieutenant and so far as he knew theyd all do most anything for him all except murray but he was a tough he was a biter and here the sick man feebly uplifted his hand and pointed to the bluishpurple marks at the base of the thumb murray did that said connelly simply he was more like a beast than a man but the examiners did not seem interested in murray general vinton who had again entered and was a close listener and was observed to be studying the witness closely presently beckoned to one of the doctors and said a word in undertone to him the medico shook his head there was a lull in the proceedings a moment connelly was too sick a man to be kept there long and his doctor plainly showed his anxiety to get him away the crowd too wanted him to go he had told nothing especially new except that murray and foster were acquainted and murray enlisted because foster had everybody said by this time this must be fosters body what everybody wanted was to get connelly out of the way now then perhaps another fever patient might be summoned for they couldnt expect to keep those remains another day there was widespread if unspoken hope among the score of correspondents that the provostmarshal would feel that he must summon miss ray but before the examiners could decide there came an unexpected scene vinton went over bent and whispered to the provostmarshal who looked up nodded and glanced towards the witness sitting flushed and heavyeyed but patient across the room vinton was plainly asking something and to the manifest displeasure of many of the crowd the little irishman was again accosted you say murray was a biter and bit you so that the marks last to this day did you take note of any peculiarity in his teeth yes sir one of em was gone near the front righthand side next to the big yellow eyetooth would that make a peculiar mark on human flesh yes sir answered connelly holding up his hand again and showing the scar now nearly five months old steward said the officer placidly uncover the shoulder there and let connelly look at the mark dr brick referred to connelly did he studied the purplish discolorations in the milky skin and excitement not altogether febrile suddenly became manifest in his hot flushed face then he held forth one hand palm uppermost eagerly compared the ugly scars at the base of the thumb with the faint marks on the broad smooth shoulder and turned back to the darkened room with hand uplifted he cried major and now he was trembling with mingled weakness and eagerness i knew that man murray was following this young feller to squeeze money out of him and when he couldnt get it by threats he tried by force hes followed him clear to manila and thats his mark sures this is sures theres a god in heaven chapter xix there came a time of something more than anxiety and worry for all who knew gerard stuyvesant for those who loved marion ray and sandy was a sorrowladen man vinton could not stand between his favorite aidedecamp and the accusation laid at his door frank and his most gifted fellowsurgeons were powerless to prevent the relapse that came to marion and bore her so close to the portals of the great beyond that there were days and nights when the blithe spirit seemed flitting away from its fragile tenement and november was half gone before the crisis was so far past that recovery could be pronounced only a question of time oh the strain of those long long sleepless days of watching waiting hoping praying yet days wherein the watchers could nurse and help and act oh the blackness the misery of the nights of watching waiting in helplessness wellnigh in despair for the coming of the next cable the consciousness of utter impotence to help or to do the realization that a priceless life is ebbing away while they who gave it they to whom it is so infinitely precious are at the very opposite ends of the earth oh the tremulous opening of those fateful messages the breathless reading of the cipher the awful suspense of the search through cable code pages that dance and swim before

they have lived gentle women sway and totter at last until relief comes to them through godgiven tears in a feverstricken camp in southern swamplands a father waked night after night walking the hospitals where his brave lads lay moaning seeing in their burning misery hearing in their last sigh the sufferings of a beloved child by the bedside of her youngest her baby boy as she would ever call the lad who lay there in delirium knelt a mother who as she nursed and soothed this one prayed without ceasing for that other that beloved daughter for whom the death angel crouched and waited under the tropic skies of the far philippines ah there were suffering and distress attendant on that strange eventful epoch in the nations history that even the press said nothing about and that those who knew it speak of only in deep solemnity and awe today it was midnovember before they dared to hope it was december when once again maid marion was lifted to her loungingchair overlooking the bagumbayan and little by little began picking up once more the threads that were so nearly severed for all time and as health and strength slowly returned hearing the tidings of the busy bustling world about her others too had known anxiety as sore as that which had so lined the face of colonel ray and trebled the silver in the soft hair of marion his wife wellnigh distracted a mother sped across the continent to the pacific there to await the coming of her sons remains from the night of walter fosters disappearance at carquinez no word of his existence came to give her hope no trace of his movements until late in august there was brought to her the cabled message alive well but in trouble have written and this was headed yokohama not until october did that longedfor prayedfor letter come a selfish letter since it gave no really adequate excuse for the long weeks of silence and only told that the boy had been in hiding almost in terror of his life while still dazed by the shock of the fire and smarting from his burns wrote walter he had wandered from the cars at port costa he had encountered most uncongenial persons he said among the recruits and never realizing that it was desertion wartime desertion at that had determined to get back to sacramento and join some other command yes there was another reason but one mother couldnt appreciate unknown to all but one of his comrades on the train he had abundant money realized from the sale of horses and cattle at the ranch it was in a buckskin belt about his waist and this money bought him friends who took him by water to sacramento found him secret lodgings procured suitable clothing and later spirited him off to san francisco but these moneybought friends showed the cloven hoof threatened to give him over to the military authorities to be tried for his life unless he would pay a heavy sum they had him virtually a prisoner he could only stir abroad at night and then in company with his jailers there was a man he wrote who had a grudge against him a man discharged from the ranch who followed him to denver and enlisted in the same party a man he was most anxious to get rid of and the first thing he knew that fellow who he supposed had gone on to manila turned up in disguise and joined forces with his tormentors that drove him to desperation nerved him to one sublime effort and one night he broke away and ran he was fleet of foot they were heavy with drink and he dodged them among the wharves and piers took refuge on a coast steamer and found himself two days later at portland here he bethought him of an old friend and succeeded in finding a man he well knew he could trust despite his mothers old dislike for him a man who knew his whole past of his desertion of his danger a man who was himself about enlisting for service in the philippines and who persuaded him that his surest way to win exemption from punishment was to hasten after the detachment beat it if possible to manila and join it there at his own expense he still had some hundreds left they went to san francisco where walter took steamer at once for honolulu to await there the coming of the recruit detachment the infantry finally came his friend with them but no sign of more cavalry to walters dismay he had seen among the passengers landed from the doric the disguised rough whom as sackett he had so unfavorably known before who as murray had followed him into the army it would never do to fall into his clutches again the man would betray him instantly walter kept in hiding until he heard that sackett was accused of stabbing a staff officer of general vinton and had fled the island later when the next troopship came bringing his friend with it he again took counsel as the lad fully admitted his friend was the same old chum of freiburg days the friend to whom his parents had so much objected the fortunes of war had thrown them together willard as impecunious as ever and the damon and pythias the orestes and pylades the two ajaxes of the old days were in close and intimate touch once more damon as of old the banker for the twain the troopships were to proceed as soon as coaled there were reasons now why walter wished to stay in honolulu but willard urged his moving at once on to hong kong and there awaiting the result of his negotiations at manila at hong kong it was his hope to receive the word come over all is well and finally as his funds would soon run out he closed his letter with the request that his mother cable him five hundred dollars through the hong kong and shanghai bank the money she cabled at once then in dread she had wired colonel martindale who was gadding about with old army chums when most she needed him at home and that gentleman with a sigh again went sisterward saying he knew the boy was sure to turn up to torment him and wondering what on earth young hopeful had done now he looked grave enough when he read the letter asked for time to communicate confidentially with a chum at washington and was awaiting reply when all on a sudden the papers came out with this startling despatch telling of the murder of private walter foster while on his post as sentry at manila and then came weeks of woe despite draytons cable from manila that the identification of the remains was not conclusive to him at least mrs foster was convinced that the murdered lad was her only boy and all because of that heartless flirt that designing that demoniac army girl who had bewitched him and then brought his blood upon her own head if it isnt walter who lies there slain by assassin rival the innocent victim of that creatures hideous vanity would i not have heard from him do you suppose my blessed boy would not instantly have cabled to tell me he was alive if he wasnt dead and indeed that was a hard question to answer and so the remains of private willard benton that had been viewed by many a genuinely sorrowing comrade and stowed away with solemn military honors in a vault at paco cemetery were sealed up as best they could do it at manila and though unconvinced as to their identity despite the convictions of others in authority the commanding general yielded to cables from the war department and ordered their shipment to san francisco they were out of sight of all signals from corregidor when martindales cable came suggesting search for private benton willard zenobia perkins sniffed contemptuously and scoffed malignantly when told that the doubting thomases were gaining ground and numbers that though mr stuyvesant might be brought to trial for killing a man it would not be for killing foster until more was ascertained regarding the actual victim private connelly recovered from his fever was forever hunting up farnham the brakeman and devising schemes for the capture of that blackguard murray day and night he maintained that murray was the man who had accosted clarke and hunter at the battery that it was probably he who with his pals had waylaid and robbed the lone recruit returning from his quest in east paco that it was he who must have struggled with him again before firing the fatal shot but not a trace of murray or his sailor mates could the secret service agents find and matters were in this most unsatisfactory state when at the end of november came the queen of the fleet despatched several weeks before to fetch along the troops sidetracked at honolulu just as the commanding general and his chief surgeon were in consultation as to what on earth to do with zenobia perkins the woman had become a public nuisance it seems that the patriotic daughters of america were now out of patience and the vicepresident out of funds it seemed that her brief ascendancy had carried the lady to such an altitude as to dizzy her brain and rob her of all sense of proportion it seems that the surgeons in charge of three hospitals had complained of her meddling that colonels of several regiments had discovered her to be the author of letters to the home papers setting forth that neglect abuse and starvation were driving their men to desertion or the grave it seems that the red cross had protested against her as the originator of malignant stories at their expense and it was evidently high time to get rid of her yet how could they if that case was to be tried zenobia perkins knew they could not and conducted herself accordingly she came this day to the ayuntamiento to demand pay for what she termed her long detention at manila you compel me to remain against my will because im an indispensable witness said she to the saturnine adjutantgeneral beyond whom she never now succeeded in passing she was volubly berating him to his grim amusement when the lattice doors from the corridor swung open and two officers entered for nearly two minutes they stood waiting for a break in her tempestuous flow of words but as none came the senior impatiently stepped forward and the adjutantgeneral looking up sprang from his chair just as the chief himself came hurrying out from the sanctum sanctorum and greeted the newcomers with cordially clasping hands the lady too had risen this was another of those stuckup starwearers who at san francisco as much as told her she was a nuisance and who wouldnt send her by transport to manila yet here she was in spite of them all and the most important woman on the island zenobias face was flushed with triumph that the starwearer should be made to feel and see before she would consent to leave the room well i shall have to interrupt you gentlemen said she for my business wont keep if you propose to keep me i want to know right here and now general drayton whether im to get my pay or not if not i dont propose to wait another day in manila and you can get out of the scrape the best way you know how no one here but me could swear that young man foster was dead and you know it youve sworn to what isnt so madame interposed the new arrival placidly heres that young man foster and as he spoke the lattice doors again swung open and very pale a tall youth in civilian dress was ushered in at sight of whom major farquhar fairly shouted howd i get him said the newcomer five minutes later found him aboard the coptic when she met us as we were pulling out from honolulu he was going back to the states left hong kong before the story was published didnt want to come of course but had to wasnt there time to write his mother they surely would have cabled and the coptic must have got into san francisco a week ago certainly letter was sent right on by the steamer addressed to cincinnati o lord said drayton and she was at frisco all the time colonel he added to his chiefofstaff whats the first transport home zealandia sir tomorrow sorry for the zealandia but zenobia must go with her chapter xx of course we had not heard the last of her honolulu correspondents of the press had little to write of in those days but made their little long and zenobias stories were the biggest things yet brought from manila those stories were seven days getting from honolulu to san francisco which was less than half the time it took their author to bring them to listening ears anybody aboard the zealandia could have told the scribes the lady was a fabricator of the first magnitude but what live correspondent wants to have a good story spoiled in just twentyseven days from that on which zenobia bade farewell to manila her winged words were flashed all over the states and by thousands were the stones swallowed that death disease pestilence and famine bribery and corruption vice and debauchery desertion and demoralization ran riot in the army at manila all due to the incapacity if not actual complicity of officers in high position but mercifully were they spared the knowledge of these astonishing facts until the papers themselves began to reach the eighth corps some ten weeks after zenobia had left it to its fate and by that time every fellow had his hands full for the longlookedfor outbreak had come at last and the long thin yankee fighting line was too busy making history to waste ink or temper in denying yarns that after all were soon forgotten then too we had been hearing stories that could not be denied right there in the southern suburbs and having excitement that needed no zenobia to enhance it to begin with walter fosters tale was of itself of vivid interest and though only the general and farquhar and ray actually heard it and only two or possibly three staff officers were supposed to see it after it had been reduced to writing every steamer and transport now was bringing officers families and men must tell their wives something once in a while otherwise they might never know what is going on and so will believe all manner of things that are not walter fosters mother learned by cable that the remains she awaited and that reached port almost the day she got the despatch were not those of her only son but of one who had practically died for him and even in the joy of that supreme moment the woman in her turned after all in pity to weep for the motherless lad who had been her boys warmest friend in his hours of doubt and darkness and despair a weak vessel was wally as farquhar had intimated and so easily cowed and daunted that in the dread of the punishment accorded the deserter he had skulked in disguise at hong kong leaving all the burden of scouting pleading and planning for him to willard his oldtime chum who had even less knowledge and experience of army official life than himself willards early letters to hong kong gave foster little hope for at first the only people the recruit could sound were private soldiers like himself then foster read of the arrival of the sacramento at manila of the presence there of maidie ray and then he wrote urging his quondam chum to endeavor to see her to tell her of his desperate straits to implore her to exert influence to get him pardoned and in order that she might know that his envoy was duly accredited he sent willard his chief treasure that little cartedevisite together with a few imploring lines then not a word came from willard for three mortal weeks but fosters daily visits to the bank were at last rewarded by a despatch from home bidding him return at once by first steamer sending him abundant means and assuring him all would be well and when the news of his own murder was published in the hong kong papers without the faintest intimation to the officials of the bank as to his intentions he was homeward bound and never heard a word of it all until recognized by an officer aboard the queen as the coptic floated into honolulu harbor there he was arrested and turned back among billy bentons few effects no letters no such picture had been found nothing in fact to connect him with foster colonel brent knew what had become of the cartedevisite but how happened it in other hands than those of benton that too was not long to be a mystery one day in late december a forlornlooking fellow begged a drink of the bartender at the alhambra on the escolta said he was out of money deserted by his friends and took occasion to remind the dispenser of fluid refreshment that a few weeks ago when he had funds and friends both he had spent many a dollar there the bartender waved him away awe give the feller a drink said boys in blue in the largeness of their nature and the language of the ranks whatll you take johnny have one with us and one of the managers hastened over and whispered to some of the flannelshirted squad but to no purpose the boys were bent on benevolence and beat though he might be the gaunt stranger was made welcome shared their meat and drink and growing speedily confidential in his cups told them that he could tell a tale some folks would pay well to hear and then proceeded to stiffen out in a fit this brought to mind the event on the bagumbayan and somebody said it was the same feller if not the same fit and it wouldnt do to leave him there they took him along in their cab and across to their barracks by the puente colgante and a doctor ministered to him for it was plain the poor fellow was in sore plight and a few days later a story worth the telling was going the rounds the good chaplain of the californians had heard his partial confession and urged him to tell the whole truth and that night the last vestige of the crumbling case against gerard stuyvesant came tumbling to earth and connelly from the cuartel de meisic nearly ran his sturdy legs off to find farnham and tell him the tale my real name said the broken man is of no consequence to anybody i soldiered nearly ten years ago in the seventh cavalry but that fight at wounded knee was too much for my nerve and the boys made life a burden to me afterwards i took on in another regiment after i skipped from the seventh but luck was against me we were sent to fort meade and there was a gambler in deadwood sackett by name who had been a few months in the seventh but got bobtailed out for some dirty work and he knew me at once and swore hed give me away if i didnt steer fellows up against his game after payday i had to do it but captain ray got onto it all and broke up the scheme and ran sackett off the reservation and then he blew on me and i had to quit again he shot a man over cards for he was a devil when in drink and had to clear out and we met again in denver each could give the other away by that time said he and so we joined partnership the rest was soon told sackett got a job on young fosters ranch and fell into some further trouble but when the war came all of them were enlisted foster and sackett in the regulars and he in the first colorado but they discharged him at manila because he had fits and that gave him a good deal of money for a few days travel pay home and all that then who should turn up but sackett with money to burn and a scheme to make more they hired a room in ermita and next thing he knew sackett and some sailor men held up and robbed a soldier and sackett was in a tearing rage because no moneybelt was found on him they only got some letters that little photograph and perhaps forty dollars mex the photograph he recognized at once his former captains daughter and he begged for it and kept it about him until one evening he was taken with another fit and when he came to the picture was gone that night he found sackett nearly crazy drunk at their lodgings in ermita they had a filipino boy to wait on them then and sackett had told the boy where he could find money and jewelry while the family were at dinner around at colonel brents the boy was willing enough he was an expert but he came back scared through said that the soldiers were close after him he had some jewelry and a pretty revolver sackett told him to keep the jewelry but took the watch and pistol and that night the sentries and patrols were searching everywhere and sackett and the sailors said they must get away somehow they drank some more and finally thought they had a good chance just after the patrol left and the sentry was talking to an officer on the calle real they sneaked downstairs and out into the faura and there sackett ran right into the soldiers arms there was a short terrible battle the soldier against sackett and his sailor friend the sailor got the sentrys gun away and sackett and he wrestled as far as the corner when there was a shot the soldier dropped all in a heap and sackett and the sailor ran for their lives around the corner the last he had ever seen or heard of them up to this moment so that was how poor maidies pistol happened to be picked up on the calle real and why one or two assertive officers lately connected with the provostmarshals and secretservice department concluded that it might be well for them to try regimental duty awhile that was how it happened too that lieutenant stuyvesant was prevailed on to take a short leave and run over to hong kong but he came back in a hurry for there was need of every man and trouble imminent at the front the dawn of that memorable february day had come that saw manila girdled by the flame of forty thousand rifles and shrouded in the smoke that drifted from the burning roofs of outlying villages from whose walls windows and church towers the insurgent islanders had poured their pitiless fire upon the ranks of the american soldiery in front of a stonewalled enclosure bordering the principal street in an eastward suburb two or three officers were in earnest consultation from the ambulance close at hand the attendants were carefully lifting some sorely wounded men up the street farther east several little parties coming slowly haltingly from the front told that the incessant crash and rattle of musketry in that direction was no mere feudejoie while every now and then the angry spat of the steelclad mauser on the stony road the whiz and whirr about the ears of the few who for dutys sake or that of example held their ground in the highway gave evidence that the tagal marksmen had their eyes on every visible group of americans in the side streets at right angles to the main thoroughfare reserve battalions were crouching sheltered from the leaden storm and awaiting the longedfor order to advance and sweep the field at the front from the grim gray walls of the great church and convent which for weeks had been strictly guarded by order of the american generals against all possible intrusion or desecration on part of their men came frequent flash and report and deadly missile aimed at the helpless wounded the hurrying ambulances even at a symbol as sacred as that which towered above its altars the bloodred cross of geneva it was the tagals return for the honor and care and consideration shown the church of rome as another ambulance came swiftly to the spot its driver swayed clasped his hands upon his breast and with the blood gushing from his mouth toppled forward into the arms of the hospital attendants it was more than flesh and blood or the brigade commander could stand burn that church was the stern order as the general spurred on to the front and a score of soldiers leaping from behind the stone walls dashed at the barricaded doors a young staff officer galloping down the road reined in at sight of the little party and whirled about by the generals side its perfectly true sir said he right across the bridge in front of the blockhouse you can hear him plainly its a white man giving orders to the filipinos the general nodded well get him presently do they understand the orders on the left everywhere sir all are ready and eager and even the native pony ridden by the aide seemed quivering with excitement as horse and rider they fell back and joined the two officers following their chief hot in front stuyvie queried the first in undertone as a mauser zipped between their heads to the detriment of confidential talk and a great burst of cheers broke from the blue line crouching just ahead across the open field why d n it man youre hit now hush answered stuyvesant imploringly as he pressed a gauntleted hand to his side dont let the general know i want to join vinton in a moment its only a tear along the skin but blood was soaking through the serge of his blue sackcoat and streaking the loose folds of his ridingbreeches and the bright color in his clear skin was giving way to pallor tear indeed here quick orderly help me there on the other side and the captain sprang from saddle a soldier leaped forward turning loose his pony and as the general with only one aide and orderly rode on into the smokecloud overhanging the line gerard stuyvesant fainting slid forward into the arms of his faithful friends a few hours later lined up along the riverbank a great regiment from the far west panting and exultant stood resting on its arms and looking back over the field traversed in its first grand charge here there everywhere it was strewn with insurgent dead and sorely wounded here there and everywhere men in american blue were flitting about from group to group tendering canteens of cold water to the wounded friend and enemy alike far back towards the dusty highway where the ambulances were hurrying and close to the abutments of a massive stone bridge that crossed a tributary of the pasig three officers a surgeon and halfadozen soldiers were grouped about a prostrate form in the pale blue uniform with the gold embroidery and broad stripes of a filipino captain but the face was ghastly white the language ghastly anglosaxon with the blood welling from a shothole in his broad burly chest and the seal of death already settling on his ashen brow he was scowling up into the halfcompassionate halfcontemptuous faces about him here lay the capitan americano of whom the tagal soldiers had been boasting for a month a deserter from the army of the united states a commissioned officer in the ranks of aguinaldo shot to death in his first battle in sight of some who had seen and known him in the blue lieutenant stuyvesant revived by a long pull at the doctors flask his bleeding stanched had again pressed forward to take his part in the fight but now lay back in the low victoria that the men had run forward from the village and looked down upon the man who in bitter wrath and hatred had vowed long months before to have his hearts blood the man who had so nearly done him to death in honolulu even now in sacketts dying eyes something of the same brutal rage mingled with the instant gleam of recognition that for a moment flashed across his distorted features it seemed retribution indeed that his last conscious glance should fall upon the living face of the man to whom he owed his rescue from a fearful death that night in faraway nevada but badly as he was whipped that brilliant sunday johnny filipino had the wit to note that uncle sam had hardly a handful of cavalry and nowhere near enough men to follow up the advantages and hence the long campaign of minor affairs that had to follow in that campaign sandy ray was far too busy at the front to know very much of what was going on at the rear in manila he listened with little sympathy to farquhars brief disposition of poor fosters case they could remove the desertion and give him a commission but they couldnt make wally a soldier he went home when the fighting had hardly begun somebody was mean enough to say if he hadnt his mother would have come for him there was no question as to the identity of the soldier who died in filipino uniform not only did stuyvesant recognize him but so did ray and trooper mellen and connelly fetched over from the north side to make assurance doubly sure it was sackettmurray gambler horsethief houserobber deserter biter murderer and doubledyed traitor he had fled to the insurgents in dread of discovery and death at the hands of bentons comrades and perhaps it was just as well foster knew of his hapless end before he took steamer homeward knew too of stuyvesants wound and possibly it had something to do with his departure of the disposition made of that fortunately wounded officer miss ray it seems was regularly on duty now with other red cross nurses and stuyvesant went to the first reserve and stayed there a whole week and even dr wells came and smiled on him and miss porter beamed and still he was not happy for maidie came not she was busy as she could be at the farther end of the other wards and so stuyvesant grew impatient of nursing declared he was well and still was far from happy for at that time foster was still hovering about the premises and stuyvesant could see only one possible explanation for that they moved him back to his breezy quarters at malate but presently a trap was sprung mainly through mrs brents complicity for once or twice a week it was maidies custom to go to her old friends roof for rest and tea and one evening seems to me it was valentines day just before sunset they were in the veranda the colonel and his kindly wife while maid marion the second was in her own room donning a dainty gown for change from the red cross uniform when a carriage whirled up to the entrance underneath and mrs brent leaning over the rail smiled on its sole occupant and nodded reassuringly stuyvesant came up slowly looking not too robust and said it was awfully good of mrs brent to take pity on his loneliness and have him round to tea other nice women younger more attractive personally than mrs brent had likewise bidden him to tea just so soon as he felt able but stuyvesant swore to himself he couldnt be able and wouldnt if he could yet when mrs brent said come he went though never hoping to see marion whom he believed to be engrossed in duties at the first reserve and on the verge of announcement of her engagement to that young man foster presently brent said if stuyvesant had no objection hed take his trap and drive over intra muros and get the news from macarthurs front for mac was hammering at the insurgent lines about caloocan and stuyvesant had no objection whatever whereupon mrs brent took occasion to say in the most casual way in the world oh you might send a line to colonel martindale dear you know mr foster goes home by the sonoma oh hadnt you heard of it mr stuyvesant oh dear yes hes been ready to go ever since the fighting began but there was no boat and then she too left stuyvesant left him with the new york moon bottom topmost in his hand and a sensation as of wheels in his head she proceeded furthermore to order tea on the back gallery and maidie to the front but tea was ready long before maidie far out at the lines of san pedro macati dyers guns had sighted swarms of rebels up the pasig and with placid and methodical precision were sending shrapnel in that direction and dull booming concussions in the other an engagement of some kind was on at san pedro and stuyvesant twitched with nervous longing to get there despite the doctors and sat wondering was another engagement off at manila just what to do he had not decided the moon and his senses were still upsidedown when sing came in with the transferred tea things and mrs brent with the last thing stuyvesant was thinking to see maid marion all smiles congratulation and cool organdie ten minutes time in which to compose herself gives a girl far too great an advantage under such circumstances i im glad to see you said stuyvesant helplessly i thought you were wearing yourself out at nursing oh it agrees with me responded maidie blithely i suppose it must you certainly look so merci du compliment monsieur smiled miss ray with sparkling eyes and the prettiest of courtesies she certainly did look remarkably well it was time for stuyvesant to be seated again but he hovered there about that teatable for mrs brent made the totally unnecessary announcement that she would go in search of the spoons you had no time i suppose to look in on anybody but your assigned vict patients i mean hazarded stuyvesant weakening his tentative by palpable display of sense of injury well you were usually asleep when i cal inquired i mean one or two lumps mr stuyvesant and the dainty little white hand hovered over the sugarbowl you usually chose such times i fancy one lump thanks there was another not of sugar in his throat and he knew it and his fine blue eyes and thin sad face were pathetic enough to move any womans heart had not miss ray been so concerned about the tea you would have been able to return to duty days ago said she tendering the steaming cup and obviously ignoring his remark had you come right to hospital as dr shiels directed instead of scampering out to the front again you thought more of the brevet of course than the gash what a mercy it glanced on the rib only such wounds are ever so much harder to stanch and dress you knew about it then he asked with reviving hope of course we all knew responded miss ray well aware of the fact that he would have been unaccountably and infinitely happier had it been she alone that is our profession but about the brevet surely you ought to be pleased captain in your first engagement oh its only a recommendation he answered and may be as far away as any other engagement of mine that is and in saying it poor stuyvesant realized it was an asinine thing so alack did she an instant agone she was biting her pretty red lips for letting the word escape her but his fatuity gave her all the advantage in spite of herself it was the play to see nothing that called for reply in his allusion so there was none a carriage was coming up the luneta full tilt and though still six hundred yards away she saw and knew it to be stuyvesants returning but he saw nothing beyond her glowing face mrs brent began to sing in the salon a symptom so unusual that it could only mean that she contemplated coming back and was giving warning time was priceless yet here he stood trembling irresolute would nothing help him you speak of my engagement he blundered blindly on i wish youd tell me about yours mine oh with the red cross you mean and shame be to you maidie ray you knew you well knew he didnt i mean to mr foster mrs brent has just told me mrs brent interposes miss ray in a flutter of amaze that carriage is coming nearer every instant driving like mad brent on the back seat and a whiplashing demon on the box there will be no time for lovetales once that burly warrior returns to his own yet she is fencing parrying holding him at bay for his heart is bubbling over with the torrent of its love and yearning and pleading what are bulletwounds and brevets to this one supreme sublime encounter his heart was high his voice rang clear and exultant his eyes flashed joy and fire and defiance in the face of a thousand deaths two weeks ago but here in the presence of a slender girl he can do naught but falter and stammer and tremble crack crack spatter clatter and crash comes the little carriage and team whirling into the san luis he hears it now he knows what it means to him brent back and the pentup words still unspoken it nerves him to the test it spurs him to the leap it drives the blood bounding through his veins it sends him darting round the table to her side penning her as it were between him and the big bamboo chair and now her heart too is all in a flutter for the outer works were carried in his impetuous dash the assailant is at the very citadel marion he cried tell me was there tell me there was no engagement tell me there is a little hope for me oh you are blind if you do not see if you have not seen all along that ive loved you ever since the first day i ever saw you tell me quick too late up comes brent on the run and marion springs past the wouldbe detaining arm wheres mrs b pants the warrior hullo stuyvie i was afraid youd got the news and gone out in a cab mria i want my belt and pistol where you going bursts in the lady of the house the spoons forgotten out to san pedro its only three miles our fellows are going to drive em out of guadaloupe woods ready sty of course you want to see it drivell do you good too come on indeed you dont stir a step colonel brent not a step what business have you going into action you did enough fighting forty years ago brent deaf to her expostulation is rushing to the steps buckling his belt on the run but mria grabs the slack of the khaki coat and holds him stuyvesant springs for his hat it has vanished marion her hands behind her her lips parted her heart pounding hard has darted to the broad door to the salon and there leaning against the framing she confronts him at the rear of the salon thisbe has grappled pyramus and is being pulled to the head of the stairs at the head beatrice with undaunted front concealing a sinking heart defies benedick my hat please he demands his eyes lighting with hope and promise of victory you have no right she begins you are still a patient but now with bowed head she is struggling for he has come close to her so close that his heart and hers might almost meet in their wild leaping so close that in audacious search for the missing headgear his hands are reaching down behind the shrinking slender little form and his long sinewy arms almost encircling her the war of words at the back stairs now trebly thundering swelled the gale but it is not heard here at the front his hands have grasped her wrists now his blond head is bowed down over hers so that his lips hover close to the part of the dusky hair my hat maidie he cries or ill ill take what i want both hands tugging terrifically at those slender wrists now and yet not gaining an inch do you hear ill ill take you shant gasps miss ray promptly burying her glowing face in the breast of that happy khaki and thereby tacitly admitting that she knows just what he wants so much more than that hat and then the long white hands release their hold of the slim white wrists the muscular arms twine tight about her almost lifting her from her feet the bonny brown head bows lower still his mustache brushing the soft damaskroselike cheek i must go maidie darling he whispers without the hat if need be but not without this and this and this and this and the last one lingers long just at the corner of the warm winsome rosy lips she could not prevent it perhaps she did not try the end
