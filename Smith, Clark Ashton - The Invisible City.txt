the invisible city clark ashton smith confound you said langley in a hoarse whisper that came with effort through swollen lips blueblack with thirst youve gulped about twice your share of the last water in the lobnor desert he shook the canteen which furnham had just returned to him and listened with a savage frown to the ominously light gurgling of its contents the two surviving members of the furnham archaeological expedition eyed each other with newborn but rapidly growing disfavor furnham the leader flushed with dark anger beneath his coat of deepening dust and sunburn the accusation was unjust for he had merely moistened his parched tongue from langleys canteen his own canteen which he had shared equally with his companion was now empty up to that moment the two men had been the best of friends their months of association in a hopeless search for the ruins of the semifabulous city of kobar had given them abundant reason to respect each other their quarrel sprang from nothing else than the mental distortion and morbidity of sheer exhaustion and the strain of a desperate predicament langley at times was even growing a trifle lightheaded after their long ordeal of wandering on foot through a land without wells beneath a sun whose flames poured down upon them like molten lead we ought to reach the tarim river pretty soon said furnham stiffly ignoring the charge and repressing a desire to announce in mordant terms his unfavorable opinion of langley if we dont i guess it will be your fault the other snapped theres been a jinx on this expedition from the beginning and i shouldnt wonder if the jinx were you it was your idea to hunt for kobar anyway ive never believed there was any such place furnham glowered at his companion too near the breaking point himself to make due allowance for langleys nervewrought condition and then turned away refusing to reply the two plodded on ignoring each other with sullen ostentatiousness the expedition consisting of five americans in the employ of a new york museum had started from khotan two months before to investigate the archaeological remains of eastern turkestan illluck had dogged them continually and the ruins of kobar their main objective said to have been built by the ancient uighurs had eluded them like a mirage they found other ruins had exhumed a few greek and byzantine coins and a few broken buddhas but nothing of much novelty or importance from a museum viewpoint at the very outset soon after leaving the oasis of tchertchen one member of the party had died from gangrene caused by the vicious bite of a bactrian camel later on a second seized by a cramp while swimming in the shallow tarim kver near the reedy marshes of lobnor that strange remnant of a vast inland sea had drowned before his companions could reach him a third had died of some mysterious fever then in the desert south of the tarim where furnham and langley still persisted in a futile effort to locate the lost city their mongol guides had deserted them they took all the camels and most of the provisions leaving to the two men only their rifles their canteens their other personal belongings the various antique relics they had amassed and a few tins of food the desertion was hard to explain for the mongols had heretofore shown themselves reliable enough however they had displayed a queer reluctance on the previous day had seemed unwilling to venture further among the endless undulations of coiling sand and pebbly soil furnham who knew the language better than langley had gathered that they were afraid of something were deterred by superstitious legends concerning this portion of the lobnor desert but they had been strangely vague and reticent as to the object of their fear and furnham had learned nothing of its actual nature leaving everything but their food water and rifles to the mercy of the drifting sands the men had started northward toward the tarim which was sixty or seventy miles away if they could reach it they would find shelter in one of the sparse settlemeats of fishermen along its shores and could eventually make their way back to civilization it was now afternoon of the second day of their wanderings langley had suffered most and he staggered a little as they went on beneath the eternally cloudless heavens across the glaring desolation of the dreary landscape his heavy winchester had become an insufferable burden and he had thrown it away in spite of the remonstrance of furnham who still retained his own weapon the sun had lowered a little but burned with gruelling rays tyrannically torrid through the bright inferno of stagnant air there was no wind except for brief and furious puffs that whirled the light sand in the faces of the men and then died as suddenly as they had risen the ground gave back the heat and glare of the heavens in shimmering blinding waves of refraction langley and furnham mounted a low gradual ridge and paused in sweltering exhaustion on its rocky spine before them was a broad shallow valley at which they stared in a sort of groggy wonderment puzzled by the level and artificiallooking depression perfectly square and perhaps a third of a mile wide which they descried in its center the depression was bare and empty with no sign of ruins but was lined with numerous pits that suggested the groundplan of a vanished city the men blinked and both were prompted to rub their eyes as they peered through flickering heatwaves for each had received a momentary impression of flashing light broken into myriad spires and columns that seemed to fill the shallow basin and fade like a mirage still mindful of their quarrel but animated by the same unspoken thought they stared down the long declivity heading straight towmd the depression if the place were the site of some ancient city they might possibly hope to find a well or waterspring they approached the basins edge and were puzzled more and more by its regularity certainly it was not the work of nature and it might have been quarried yesterday for seemingly there were no ravages of wind and weather in the sheer walls and the floor was remarkably smooth except for the multitude of square pits that ran in straight intersecting lines like the cellars of destroyed or unbuilt houses a growing sense of strangeness and mystery troubled the two men and they were blinded at intervals by the flash of evanescent light that seemed to overflow the basin with phantom towers and pillars they paused within a few feet of the edge incredulous and bewildered each began to wonder if his brain had been affected by the sun their sensations were such as might mark the incipience of delirium amid the blasts of furnacelike heat a sort of icy coolness appeared to come upon them from the broad basin clammy but refreshing like the chill that might emanate from walls of sunless stone it revived their fainting senses and quickened their awareness of unexplained mystery the coolness became even more noticeable when they reached the very verge of the precipice here peering over they saw that the sides fell unbroken at all ponts for a depth of twenty feet or more in the smooth bottom the cellarlike pits yawned darkly and unfathomably the floor about the pits was free of sand pebbles or detritus heavens what do you make of that muttered furnham to himself rather than to langley he stooped over the edge staring down with feverish and inconclusive speculations the riddle was beyond his experience he had met nothing like it in all his researches his puzzlement however was partly submerged in the more pressing problem of how he and langley were to descend the sheer walls thirst and the hope of finding water in one of the pits were more important at that moment than the origin and nature of the square basin suddenly in his stooping position a kind of giddiness seized him and the earth seemed to pitch deliriously beneath his feet he staggered he lost his balance and fell forward from the verge halffainting he closed his eyes against the hurtling descent and the crash twenty feet below instantly it seemed he struck bottom amazed and incomprehending he found that he was lying at full length prone on his stomach in midair upborne by a hard flat invisible substance his outflung hands encountered an obstruction cool as ice and smooth as marble and the chill of it smote through his clothing as he lay gazing down into the gulf wrenched from his grasp by the fall his rifle hung beside him he heard the startled cry of langley and then realized that the latter had seized him by the ankles and was drawing him back to the precipice he felt the unseen surface slide beneath him level as a concrete pavement glib as glass then langley was helping him to his feet both for the nonce had forgotten their misunderstanding say am i bughouse cried langley i thought you were a goner when you fell what have we stumbled on anyhow stumbled is good said furnham reflectively as he tried to collect himself that basin is floored with something solid but transparent as air something unknown to geologists or chemists god knows what it is or where it came from or who put it there weve found a mystery that puts kobar in the shade i move that we investigate he stepped forward very cautiously still halffearful of falling and stood suspended over the basin if you can do it i guess i can said langley as he followed with furnham in the lead the two began to cross the basin moving slowly and gingerly along the invisibie pavement the sensation of peering down as if through empty air was indescribably weird they had started midway between two rows of the dark pits which lay fifty feet apart somehow it was like following a street after they had gone some little distance from the verge furnham deviated to the left with the idea of looking directly down into one of these mysterious pits before he could reach a vertical vantagepoint he was arrested by a smooth solid wall like that of a building i think weve discovered a city he announced groping his way along the airclear wall which seemed free of angles or roughness he came to an open doorway it was about five feet wide and of indeterminable height fingering the wall like a blind man he found that it was nearly six inches thick he and langley entered the door still walking on a level pavement and advanced without obstruction as if in a large empty room for an instant as they went forward light seemed to flash above them in great arches and arcades touched with evanescent colors like those in fountainspray then it vanished and the sun shone down as before from a void and desertheaven the coolness emanating from the unknown substance was more pronounced than ever and the men almost shivered but they were vastly refreshed and the torture of their thirst was somewhat mitigated now they could look perpendicularly into the square pit below them in the stone floor of the excavation they were unable to see its bottom for it went down into shadow beyond the westering sunrays but both could see the bizarre and inexplicable object which appeared to float immobile in air just below the mouth of the pit they felt a creeping chill that was more insidious more penetrant than the iciness of the unseen walls now im seeing things said langley guess im seeing them too added furnham the object was a long hairless lightgrey body lying horizontally as if in some invisible sarcophagus or tomb standing erect it would have been fully seven feet in height it was vaguely human in its outlines and possessed two legs and two arms but the head was quite unearthly the thing seemed to have a double set of high concave ears lined with perforations and in place of nose mouth and chin there was a long tapering trunk which lay coiled on the bosom of the monstrosity like a serpent the eyes or what appeared to be such were covered by leathery lashless and hideously wrinkled lids the thing lay rigid and its whole aspect was that of a wellperserved corpse or mummy half in light and half in shadow it hung amid the funereal fathomless pit and beneath it at some little distance as their eyes became accustomed to the gloom the men seemed to perceive another and similar body neither could voice the mad eerie thoughts that assailed them the mystery was too macabre and overwhelming and impossible it was langley who spoke at last say do you suppose they are all dead before furnham could answer he and langley heard a thin shrill exiguous sound like the piping off some unearthly flute whose notes were almost beyond human audition they could not determine its direction for it seemed to come from one side and then from another as it continued its degree of apparent nearness or distance was also variable it went on ceaselessly and monotonously thrilling them with an eeriness as of untrod worlds a terror as of uncharted dimensions it seemed to fade away in remote ultramundane gulfs and then louder and clearer than before the piping came from the air beside them inexpressibly startled the two men stared from side to side in an effort to locate the source of the sound they could find nothing the air was clear and still about them and their view of the rocky slopes that rimmed the basin was blurred only by the dancing haze of heat the piping ceased and was followed by a dead uncanny silence but furnham and langley had the feeling that someone or something was near them a stealthy presence that lurked and crouched and drew closer till they could have shrieked aloud with the terror of suspense they seemed to wait amid the unrealities of delirium and mirage haunted by some elusive undeclared horror tensely they peered and listened but there was no sound or visual ostent then langfey cried out and fell heavily to the unseen floor borne backward by the onset of a cold and tangible thing resistless as the launching coils of an anaconda he lay helpless unable to move beneath the dead and fluid weight of the unknown incubus which crushed down his limbs and body and almost benumbed him with an icy chill as of etheric space then something touched his throat very lightly at first and then with a pressure that deepened intolerably to a stabbing pain as if he had been pierced by an icicle a black faintness swept upon him and the pain seemed to recede as if the nerves that bore it to his brain were spun like lengthening gossamers across gulfs of anesthesia furnham in a momentary paralysis heard the cry of his companion and saw langley fall and struggle feebly to lie inert with closing eyes and whitening face mechanically without realizing for some moments what had happened he perceived that langleys garments were oddly flattened and pressed down beneath an invisible weight then from the hollow of langleys neck he saw the spurting of a thin rill of blood which mounted straight in air for several inches and vanished in a sort of red mist bizarre incoherent thoughts arose in furnhams mind it was all too incredible too unreal his brain must be wandering it must have given way entirely bot something was attacking langley an invisible vampire of this invisible city he had retained his rifle now he stepped forward and stood beside the fallen man his free hand groping in the air encountered a chill clammy surface rounded like the back of a stooping body it numbed his fingertips even as he touched it then something seemed to reach out like an arm and hurl him violently backward reeling and staggering he managed to retain his balance and returned more cautiously the blood still rose in a vanishing rill from langleys throat estimating the position of the unseen attacker furnham raised his rifle and took careful aim with the muzzle less than a yard away from its hidden mark the gun roared with deafening resonance and its sound died away in slow echoes as if repeated by a maze of walls the blood ceased to rise from langleys neck and fell to a natural trickle there was no sound no manifestation of any kind from the thing that had assailed him furnham stood in doubt wondering if his shot had taken effect perhaps the thing had been frightened away perhaps it was still close at hand and might leap upon him at any moment or return to its prey he peered at langley who lay white and still the blood was ceasing to flow from the tiny puncture he stepped toward him with the idea of trying to revive him but was arrested by a strange circumstance he saw that langleys face and upper body were blurred by a grey mist that seemed to thicken and assume palpable outlines it darkened apace it took on solidity and form and furnham beheld the monstrous thing that lay prone between himself and his companion with part of its fallen bulk still weighing upon langley from its inertness and the bulletwound in its side whence oozed a viscid purple fluid he felt sure that the thing was dead the monster was alien to all terrestrial biology a huge invertebrate body formed like an elongated starfish with the points ending in swollen tentacular limbs it had a round shapeless head with the curving needletipped bill of some mammoth insect it must have come from other planets or dimensions than ours it was wholly unlike the mummified creature that floated in the pit below and furnham felt that it represented an inferior animallike type lt was evidently composed of an unknown order of organic matter that became visible to human eyes only in death his brain was swamped by the mad enigma of it all what was this place upon which he and langley had stumbled was it an outpost of worlds beyond human knowledge or observation what was the material of which these buildings had been wrought who were their builders whence had they come and what had been their purpose was the city of recent date or was it perhaps a sort of ruin whose builders lay dead in its vaults a ruin haunted only by the vampire monster that had assailed langley shuddering with repulsion at the dead monster he started to drag the stillunconscious man from beneath the loathsome mass he avoided touching the dark semitranslucent body which lapsed forward quivering like a stiff jelly when he had pulled his companion away from it like something very trivial and far away he remembered the absurd quarrel which langley had picked with him and remembered his own resentment as part of a doubtful dream now lost in the extrahuman mystery of their surroundings he bent over his comrade anxiously and saw that some of the natural tan was returning to the pale face and that the eyelids were begging to flutter the blood had clotted on the tiny wound taking langleys canteen he poured the last of its contents between the owners teeth in a few moments langley was able to sit up furnham helped him to his feet and the two began to cross their way from the crystal maze they found the doorway and furnham still supporting the other decided to retrace their course along the weird street by which they had started to cross the basin they had gone but a few paces when they heard a faint almost inaudible rustling in the air before them together with a mysterious grating noise the rustling seemed to spread and multiply on every hand as if an invisible crowd were gathering but the grating soon ceased they went on slowly and cautiously with a sense of imminent uncanny peril langley was now strong enough to walk without assistance and furnham held his cocked rifle ready for instant use the vague rustling sounds receded but still encircled them midway between the underlying rows of pits they moved on toward the desert precipice keeping side by side a dozen paces on the cold solid pavement and then they stepped into empty air and landed several feet below with a terrific jar on another hard surface it must have been the top of a flight of giant stairs for losing their balance they both lurched and fell and rolled downward along a series of similar surfaces and lay stunned at the bottom langley had been rendered unconscious by the fall but fornham was vaguely aware of several strange dreamlike phenomena he heard a faint ghostly sibilant rustling he felt a light and clammy touch upon his face and smelled an odor of suffocating sweetness in which he seemed to sink as into an unfathomable sea the rustling died to a vast and spatial silence oblivion darkened above him and he slid swiftly into nothingness it was night when furnham awoke his first impression was the white dazzle of a full moon shining in his eyes then he became aware that the circle of the great orb was oddly distorted and broken like a moon in some cubistic painting all around and above him were bright crystalline angles crossing and intermingling the outlines of a translucent architecture dome on dome and wall on wall as he moved his head showers of ghostly irises the lunar yellow and green and purple fell in his eyes from the broken orb and vanished he saw that he was lying on a glasslike floor which caught the light in moving sparkles langley still unconscious was beside him doubtless they were still in the mysterious oubliette down whose invisible stairs they had fallen far off to one side through a mйlange of the transparent partitions he could see the vague rocks of the gobi twisted and refracted in the same manner as the moon why he wondered was the city now visible was its substance rendered perceptible in a partial sort of way by some unknown ray which existed in moonlight but not in the direct beams of the sun such an explanation sounded altogether too unscientific but he could not think of any other at the moment rising on his elbow he saw the glassy outlines of the giant stairs down which he and langley had plunged a pale diaphanous form like a phantom of the mummified creature they had seen in the pit was descending the stairs it moved forward with fleet strides longer than those of a man and stooped above furnham with its spectral trunk waving inquisitively and poising an inch or two from his face two round phosphorescent eyes emitting perceptible beams like lanterns glowed solemnly in its head above the beginning of the proboscis the eyes seemed to transfix furnham with their unearthly gaze he felt that the light they emitted was flowing in a ceaseless stream into his own eyes into his very brain the light seemed to shape itself into images formless and incomprehensible at first but growing clearer and more coherent momently then in some indescribable way the images were associated with articulate words as if a voice were speaking words that he understood as one might understand the language of dreams we mean you no harm the voice seemed to say but you have stumbled upon our city and we cannot afford to let you escape we do not wish to have our presence known to men we have dwelt here for many ages the lobnor desert was a fertile realm when we first established our city we came to your world as fugitives from a great planet that once formed part of the solar system a planet composed entirely of ultraviolet substances which was destroyed in a terrible cataclysm knowing the imminence of the catastrophe some of us were able to build a huge spaceflier in which we fled to the earth from the materials of the flier and other materials we had brought along for the express purpose we built our city whose name as well as it can be conveyed in human phonetics is ciis the things of your world have always been plainly visible to us and in fact due to our immense scale of perceptions we probably see much that is not manifest to you also we have no need of artificial light at any time we discovered however at an early date that we ourselves and our buildings were invisible to men strangely enough our bodies undergo in death a degeneration of substance which brings them within the infraviolet range and thus within the scope of your visual cognition the voice seemed to pause and furnham realized that it had spoken only in his thought by a sort of telepathy in his own mind he tried to shape a question what do you intend to do with us again he heard the still toneless voice we plan to keep you with us permanently after you fell through the trapdoor we had opened we overpowered you with an anesthetic and during your period of unconsciousness which lasted many hours we injected into your bodies a drug which has already affected your vision rendering visible to a certain degree the ultraviolet substances that surround you repeated injections which must be given slowly will make these substances no less plain and solid to you than the materials of your own world also there are other processes to which we intend to subject you processes that will serve to adjust and acclimate you in all ways to your new surroundings behind furnhams weird interlocutor several more fantasmal figures had descended the halfvisible steps one of them was stooping over langley who had begun to stir and would recover full consciousness in a few instants furnham sought to frame other questions and received an immediate reply the creature that attacked your companion was a domestic animal we were busy in our laboratories at the time and did not know of your presence till we heard the rifle shots the flashes of light which you saw among our invisible walls on your arrival were due to some queer phenomenon of refraction at certain angles the sunlight was broken or intensified by the molecular arrangement of the unseen substance at this juncture langley sat up looking about him in a bewildered fashion what the hell is all this and where the hell are we he inquired as he peered from furnham to the people of the city furnham proceeded to explain repeating the telepathic information he had just received by the time he had ceased speaking langley himself appeared to become the recipient of some sort of mental reassurance from the phantomlike creature who had been furnhams interlocutor for langley stared at this being with a mixture of enlightenment and wonder in his expression once more there came the still superauditory voice fraught now with imperious command come with us your initiation into our life is to begin immediately my name is aispha if you wish to have a name for me in your thoughts we ourselves communicating with each other without language have little need for names and their use is a rare formality among us our generic name as a people is the tiisins furnham and langley arose with an unquestioning alacrity for which afterwards they could hardly account and followed aispha it was as if a mesmeric compulsion had been laid upon them furnham noted in an automatic sort of way as they left the oubliette that his rifle had vanished no doubt it had been carefully removed during his period of insensibility he and langley climbed the high steps with some difficulty queerly enough considering their late fall they found themselves quite free of stiffness and bruises but at the time they felt no surprise only a drugged acquiescence in all the marvels and perplexities of their situation they found themselves on the outer pavement amid the bewildering outlines of the luminous buildings which towered above them with intersections of multiform crystalline curves and angles aispha went on without pause leading them toward the fantastic serpentine arch of an open doorway in one of the tallest of these edifices whose pale domes and pinnacles were heaped in immaterial splendor athwart the zenithnearing moon four of the ultraviolet people the companions of aispha brought up the rear aispha was apparently unarmed but the others carried weapons like heavybladed and bluntpointed sickles of glass or crystal many others of this incredible race intent on their own enigmatic affirs were passing to and fro in the open street and through the portals of the unearthly buildings the city was a place of silent and fantasmal activity at the end of the street they were following before they passed through the arched entrance furnham and langley saw the rockstrewn slope f the lobnor which seemed to have taken on a queer filminess and insubstantiality in the moonlight it occurred to furnham with a sort of weird shock that his visual perception of earthly objects as well as of the ultraviolet city was being affected by the injections of which aispha told him the building they now entered was full of apparatuses made in the form of distorted spheres and irregular disks and cubes some of which seemed to change their outlines from moment to moment in a confusing manner certain of them appeared to concentrate the moonlight like ultrapowerful lenses turning it to a fiery blinding brilliance neither furnham nor langley could imagine the purpose of these devices and no telepathic explanation was vouchsafed by aispha or any of his companions as they went on into the building there was a queer sense of some importunate and subtle vibration in the air which affected the men unpleasantly they could not assign its source nor could they be sure whether their own perception of it was purely mental or came through the avenues of one or more of the physical senses somehow it was both disturbing and narcotic and they sought instinctively to resist its influence the lower story of the edifice was seemingly one vast room the strange apparatuses grew taller about them rising as if in concentric tiers as they went on in the huge dome above them living rays of mysterious light appeared to cross and recross at all angles of incidence weaving a bright everchanging web that dazzled the eye they emerged in a clear circular space at the center of the building here ten or twelve of the ultraviolet people were standing about a slim column perhaps five feet high that culminated in a shallow basinlike formation there was a glowing ovalshaped object in the basin large as the egg of some extinct bird from this object numerous spokes of light extended horizontally in all directions seeming to transfix the heads and bodies of those who stood in a loose ring about the column furnham and langley became aware of a high thin humming noise which emanated from the glowing egg and was somehow inseparable from the spokes of light as if the radiance had become audible aispha paused facing the men and a voice spoke in their minds the glowing object is called the doir an explanation of its real nature and origin would be beyond your present comprehension it is allied however to that range of substances which you would classify as minerals and is one of a number of similar objects which existed in our former world it generates a mighty force which is intimately connected with our lifeprinciple and the rays emanating from it serve us in place of food if the doir were lost or destroyed the consequences would be serious and our lifeterm which normally is many thousand years would be shortened for want of the nourishing and revivifying rays fascinated furnham and langley stared at the eggshaped orb the humming seemed to grow louder and the spokes of light lengthened and increased in number the men recognized it now as the source of the vibration that had troubled and oppressed them the effect was insidious heavy hypnotic as if there were a living brain in the object that sought to overcome their volition and subvert their senses and their minds in some unnatural thralldom they heard the mental command of aispha go forward and join those who partake of the luminous emanations of the doir we believe that by so doing you will in course of time become purged of your terrestrial grossness that the very substance of your bodies may eventually be transformed into something not unlike that of our own and your senses raised to a perceptional power such as we possess half unwillingly with an eerie consciousness of compulsion the men started forward i dont like this said furnham in a whisper to langley im beginning to feel queer enough already summoning his utmost will power he stopped short of the emanating rays and put out his hand to arrest langley with dazzled eyes they stood peering at the doir a cold restless fire alive with some nameless evil that was not akin to the evil of earth pulsated in its heart and the long sharp beams quivering slightly passed like javelins into the semicrystalline bodies of the beings who stood immobile around the column hasten came the unvocal admonition of aispha in a few moments the force in the doir which has a regular rhythm of ebb and flow will begin to draw back upon itself the rays will be retracted and you will have to wait for many minutes before the return of the emanation a quick daring thought had occurred to furnham eyeing the doir closely he had been impressed by its seeming fragility the thing was evidently not attached to the basin in which it reposed and in all likelihood it would shatter like glass if hurled or even dropped on the floor he tried to suppress his thought fearing that it would be read by aispha or others of the ultraviolet people at the same time he sought to phrase as innocently as possible a mental question what would happen if the doir were broken instantly he received an impression of anger turmoil and consternation in the mind of aispha his question however was apparently not answered and it seemed that aispha did not want to answer it that he was concealing something too dangerous and dreadful to be revealed furnham felt too that aispha was suspicious had received an inkling of his own repressed thought it occurred to him that he must act quickly if at all nerving himself he leaped forward through the ring of bodies about the doir the rays had already begun to shorten slightly but he had the feeling of one who hurls himself upon an array of lancepoints there was an odd indescribable sensation as if he were being pierced by something that was both hot and cold but neither the warmth nor the chill was beyond endurance a moment and he stood beside the column lifting the glowing egg in his hands and poising it defiantly as he turned to face the ultraviolet people the thing was phenomenally light and it seemed to burn his fingers and to freeze them at the same time he felt a strange vertigo an indescribable confusion but he succeeded in mastering it the contact of the doir might be deadlier to the human tissues than that of radium for aught he knew he would have to take his chances at any rate it would not kill him immediately and if he played his cards with sufficient boldness and skill he could make possible the escape of langley if not his own escape the ring of ultraviolet beings stood as if stupefied by his audacity the retracting spokes of light were slowly drawing back into the egg but furnham himself was still impaled by them his fingers seemed to be growing translucent where they clutched the weird ball he met the phosphoric gaze of aispha and heard the frantic thoughts that were pouring into his mind not only from aispha but from all the partakers of the doirs luminous beams dread unhuman threats desperate injunctions to return the doir to its pedestal were being laid upon him rallying all his will he defied them let us go free he said mentally addressing aispha give me back my weapon and permit my companion and me to leave your city we wish you no harm but we cannot allow you to detain us let us go or i will shatter the doir will smash it like an egg on the floor at the shaping of his destructive thought a shudder passed among the semispectral beings and he felt the dire fear that his threat had aroused in them he had been right the doir was fragile and some awful catastrophe whose nature he could not quite determine would ensue instantly upon its shattering step by step glancing frequently about to see that no one approached him by stealth from behind furnham returned to langleys side the tiisins drew back from him in evident terror all the while he continued to issue his demands and comminations bring the rifle quickly the weapon you took from me and give it into my companions hands let us go without hindrance or molestation or i will drop the doir when we are outside the city one of you one only shall be permitted to approach us and i will deliver the doir to him one of the tiisins left the group to return in less than a minute with furnhams winchester he handed it to langley who inspected the weapon carefully and found that it had not been damaged or its loading or mechanism tampered with in any way then with the ultraviolet creatures following them in manifest perturbation furnham and langley made their way from the building and started along the open street in the general direction of the tarim river they went on amid the fantastic towering of the crystalline piles and the people of the city called as if by some unworded summons poured from the doorways in an everswelling throng and gathered behind them there was no active demonstration of any overt kind but both the men were increasingly aware of the rage and consternation that had been aroused by furnhams audacious theft of the doir a theft that seemed to be regarded in the light of actual blasphemy the hatred of the tiisins like a material radiation dark sullen stupefying stultifying beat upon them at every step it seemed to dog their brains and their feet like some viscid medium of nightmare and their progession toward the gobi slope became painfully slow and tedious before them from one of the buildings a tentacled starfish monster like the thing that had assailed langley emerged and lay crouching in the street as if to dispute their passage raising its evil beak it glared with filmy eyes but slunk away from their approach as if at the monition of its owners furnham and langley passing it with involuntary shivers of repugnance went on the air was oppressed with alien unformulable menace they felt an abnormal drowsiness creeping upon them there was an unheard narcotic music which sought to overcome their vigilance to beguile them into slumber furnhams fingers grew numb with the unknown radiations of the doir though the sharp beams of light by accelerative degrees had withdrawn into its center leaving only a formless misty glow that filled the weird orb the thing seemed latent with terrible life and power the bones of his transparent hand were outlined against it like those of a skeleton looking back he saw that aispha followed closely walkiag in advance of the other tiisins he could not read the thoughts of aispha as formerly it was as if a blank dark wall had been built up somehow he had a premonition of evil of danger and treachery in some form which he could not understand or imagine he and langley came to the end of the street where the ultraviolet pavement joined itself to the desert acclivity as they began their ascent of the slope both men realized that their visual powers had indeed been affected by the injection treatment of the tiisins for the soil seemed to glow beneath them faintly translucent and the boulders were like semicrystalline masses whose inner structure they could see dimly aispha followed them on the slope but the other people of ciis as had been stipulated by furnham paused at the juncture of their streets and buildings with the infraviolet substances of earth after they had gone perhaps fifty yards on the gentle acclivity furnham came to a pause and waited for aispha hoiding out the doir at arms length somehow he had a feeling that it was unwise to return the mystic egg but he would keep his promise since the people of ciis had kept their part of the bargain so far aispha took the doir from furnhams hands but his thoughts whatever they were remained carefully shrouded there was a sense of something ominous and sinister about him as he turned and went back down the slope with the fiery egg shining through his body like a great watchful eye the beams of light were beginning to emanate from its center once more the two men looking back ever and anon resumed their journey ciis glimmered below them like the city of a mirage in the moonlit hollow they saw the ultraviolet people crowding to await aispha at the end of their streets then as aispha neared his fellows two rays of cold writhing fire leaped forth from the base of a tower that glittered like glass at the citys verge clinging to the ground the rays ran up the slope with the undulant motion of pythons following langley and furnham at a speed that would soon overtake them theyre double crossing us warned furnham he caught the winchester from langley dropped to his knees and aimed carefully drawing a bead on the luminous orb of the doir through the spectral form of aispha who had now reached the city and was about to enter the waiting throng run he called to langley ill make them pay for their treachery and perhaps you can get away in the meanwhile he pulled the trigger missing aispha but dropping at least two of the tiisins who stood near the doir again steadily he drew bead while the rays from the tower serpentined onward pale chill and deadlylooking till they were almost at his feet even as he aimed aispha took refuge in the foremost ranks of the crowd through whose filmy bodies the doir still glowed this time the highpowered bullet found its mark though it must have passed through more than one of the ultraviolet beings before reaching aispha and the mystic orb furnham had hardly known what the result would be but he felt sure that some sort of catastrophe would ensue the destruction of the doir what really happened was incalculable and almost beyond description before the doir could fall from the hands of its stricken bearer it seemed to expand in a rushing wheel of intense light revolving as it grew and blotting out the form of the ultraviolet people in the foreground with awful velocity the wheel struck the nearer buildings which appeared to soar and vanish like towers of fading mirage there was no audible explosion no sound of any kind only that silent everspinning everwidening disk of light that threatened to involve by swift degrees the whole extent of ciis gazing spellbound furnham had almost forgotten the serpentine rays too late he saw that one of them was upon him he leaped back but the thing caught him coiling about his limbs and body like an anaconda there was a sensation of icy cold of horrible constriction and then helpless he found that the strange beam of force was dragging him back down the slope toward ciis while its fellow went on in pursuit of the fleeing langley in the meanwhile the spreading disk of fire had reached the tower from which the ray emanated suddenly furnham was free the serpentine beams had both vanished he stood rooted to the spot in speechless awe and langley returning down the hill also paused watching the mighty circle of light that seemed to fill the entire basin at their feet with a soundless vortex of destruction my god cried furnham after a brief interval look whats happening to the slope as if the force of the uncanny explosion were now extending beyond ciis boulders and masses of earth began to rise in air before the white glowing maelstron and sailed in slow silent levitation toward the men furnham and langley started to run stumbling up the slope and were overtaken by something that lifted them softly buoyantly irresistibly with a strange feeling of utter weightlessness and bore them like windwafted leaves or feathers through the air they saw the bouldered crest of the acclivity flowing far beneath them and then they were floating floating ever higher in the moonlight above leagues of dim desert a faintness came upon them both a vague nausea an illimitable vertigo and slowly somewhere in that incredible flight they lapsed into unconsciousness the moon had fallen low and its rays were almost horizontal in furnhams eyes when he awoke an utter confusion possessed him at first and his circumstances were more than bewildering he was lying on a sandy slope among scattered shrubs meager and stunted and langley was reclining not far away raising himself a little he saw the white and reedfringed surface of a river which could be no other than the tarim at the slopes bottom half incredulous he realized that the force of the weird explosion had carried langley and himself many miles and had deposited them apparently unhurt beside the goal of their desert wandering furnham rose to his feet feeling a queer lightness and unsteadiness he took a tentative step and landed four or five feet away it was as if he had lost half his normal weight moving with great care he went over to langley who had now started to sit up he was reassured to find that his eyesight was becoming normal again for he perceived merely a faint glowing in the objects about him the sand and boulders were comfortably solid and his own hands were no longer translucent gosh he said to langley that was some explosion the force that was liberated by the shattering of the doir must have done something to the gravity of all surrounding objects i guess the city of ciis and its people must have gone back into outer space and even the infraviolet substances about the city must have been more or less degravitated but i guess the effect is wearing off as far as you and i are concerned otherwise wed be traveling still langley got up and tried to walk with the same disconcerting result that had characterized furnhams attempt he mastered his limbs and his equilibrium after a few experiments i still feel like a sort of dirigible he commented say i think wed better leave this out of our report to the museum a city a people all invisible in the heart of the lobnor that would be too much for scientific credibility i agree with you said furnham the whole business would be too fantastic outside of a superscientific story in fact he added a little maliciously its even more incredible than the existence of the ruins of kobar
