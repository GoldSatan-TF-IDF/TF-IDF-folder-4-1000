i dont much like writing special occasion stories for particular purposes to be saddled with somebody elses theme or settings comports very poorly with the undisciplined and stochastic way i think i am best able to write so its hard work if editors as a race had group awareness they wouldnt ask me either because all too often i have dutifully done what some editor asked me to do only to find about the time i finished the story that some higherup had canceled the special issue or the magazine or project itself kiss of death fred one editor called me and she was at least in this respect right this story is one such it represents one of my very few involvements with the united nations specifically with unicef i got a call from a man who said that unicef had decided to publish a book of what the children of the next generation would make of their world in all the parts of the world the united nations covered and would i care to write one for the united states i could not say no with all its nasty and conspicuous faults the united nations has greatly bettered the world we live in and of all the things it does unicef is the most clearly unequivocally good so i wrote this story and hardly had i finished it when the word came that highlevel consultations had voted to torpedo the whole plan and the book would never appear sometimes when rememberer awoke in the morning he was crying not for long just for a minute out of a dream he didnt like when his mother peg heard him she came into his small cheerful room and stood in the doorway smiling at him until she was sure he was altogether awake she worried about him he was ten years old and she thought he was too old for that she gave him his breakfast and sent him off to school on his bicycle by then he was cheerful again in the afternoons he helped the grownups when peg was housecleaning rem mopped and brushed and helped prepare the food when burt his father was working at home on his analyses burt was something like a public accountant in charge of the southern new york regional energy budgets rem checked his figures on a pocket calculator on tuesdays and fridays he went out in catamarans with his uncle marc to help harvest mussels from the long island sound nurseries the mussels grew on long knotted manila lines that hung from floats each day hundreds of cords had to be pulled up and stripped of the grown mussels and reseeded with tiny mussel larvae and put back in the water it was hard work rem was too small to handle pulling up the ropes but he could strip and reseed and pick up the mussels that fell in the bottom of the boat so the men wouldnt crush them with their feet and generally be useful it was tiring but it felt good to be tired after three hours in the catamaran and the water was always warm even when the air coming down off connecticut was blustery and cold in all but the worst weather marc would wink and nod toward the side and rem would skin out of his outer clothes and dive overboard and swim down among the dangling cords looking to see how the mussels were growing sometimes he took an airpack and his uncle or one of the other men came with him and together they would go clear down to the bottom to look for stray oysters or crabs or even lobsters that had escaped from the pens out around block island then he would go home and meet his father bicycling back from the sands point railroad station if the weather was nice theyd dig in the garden or toss a ball around then they would have dinnerwherever they were having dinner that night they rotated around from home to home most nights of the week so that each family had the job of cooking and cleaning up only two or three times a week one of the grownups usually helped the children with their homework after dinner rem liked it when it was his fathers turn particularly when the homework assignment was about ecology he was always popping up with questions dont hog the floor son his father would say give the others a chance its always the same dumb questions too his cousin grace complained she was eight still pretty much a brat why dont we get sick from eating sewage what a dumb question his father laughed well its not all that dumb the thing is we dont eat sewage we just use it to grow things all the new york city sewage goes into the settling ponds and then the algae tanks who knows what algae is rem knew the answer of course but he was polite enough to let one of the younger ones answer even grace what they make bread out of she said thats one thing algae is used for yes but most of the algae is piped into long island sound the mussels live on it so do the fish but the mussels are the big crop we grow threequarters of the protein for the whole united states here just on that algae and of course on the waste heat from the power generators around hell gate that warms up the sound so the mussels grow all year round and so do the potatoes grace crowed rems father said yes they do thats a little different though they take the sludge from the algae tanks and spread it over the fields along the island did you know they used to be covered with houses well we got rid of the houses and we began growing the best potatoes in the world there again but we use some of the warm water piped underground to keep the soil warm and we get two crops a year then rem asked another question always the same one or one like it but he persisted arent those bad things sewage and sludge and all people used to think so then we learned that some bad things are actually good things in the wrong place how did we learn his father looked at his watch that happened almost a hundred years ago the people who lived then made some very good decisions grace said indignantly they did bad things in a way but then they did better ones we all know about the bad things they drove around in cars that burned gasoline they dumped sewage in the ocean and ruined it for fifty years all up and down the coast they used radioactive materials that poisoned places forever just because they wanted more and more electric thises and automatic thats but then they realized they were being too greedy they learnedwhat did they learn all the kids chanted use it over put it back thats right they learned not to waste things and that decision made all the difference in the world they decided not to be greedy and now he said looking at his watch again its time for everybody under the age of thirtytwo to go to bed he looked around the room with a surprised expression why thats all of you good night and rem went back to his own room and to bed he didnt mind going to sleep after all he was pleasantly tired he did mind the dreams he remembered them clearly and they were always the same and always so real not as though he were falling asleep but as though he were waking he woke up happy with the vanishing clouds of a happy dream in his mind then the rattle and rasp of the air conditioner in his room chased the last of the dream away by the time he got up and turned his little light onhe always needed one even in the summer because the skies were almost always dingy darkhe could remember the dream but he couldnt feel it anymore his mother peg worried about the way he always seemed to dream the same wishful dream but when rem realized that he just stopped telling her about it he did ask her if he could please leave the air conditioner off at least in the winter so that he could wake up more slowly and enjoy the dream more i wish you could honey she said but you know dr dallinger said you had to have something filter the air because of your asthma im sorry about the noise maybe we can get you a new one although i dont know how with the payments on the cars and the way heats going up and you wouldnt believe what i spent in the supermarket yesterday just for three little bags of groceries then she laughed and hugged him and said a noisy air conditioner isnt so bad what if you had to live in new york city she was the one who drove him in to school every day his father had to leave an hour earlier because of the traffic school wasnt bad rem liked to learn and he liked being with the other children he even liked recess at least in the winter when the storm winds from canada blew some of the sulfursmelling smog away and the reek from the slow iridescent waves of long island sound was not so strong he didnt mind the cold he did mind being kept inside so much of the time when the air index was unsatisfactory or dangerous to health or even which had happened two or three times the previous summer condition red no burning no driving on days like that everybody was stuck wherever he happened to be everything stopped rem and his mother would take turns in the shower and then sit playing cards or talking or just resting waiting for the time to pass if his father was lucky he would be doing the same thing in his office in the city if he wasnt he might be caught in the long unmoving snarl of cars on the freeways waiting for permission to start again that was how rems uncle marc had died two years before when he had another heart attack sitting at the wheel and got out of the car for help and died there but then after a while the rain would come it was worse than the dry heat at first because the drops would come down as sticky black blobs that stained all the houses dirtied the windows and killed the grass where there was any grass but after a while there might be a real storm with luck even a hurricane and then for a few days long island might look queerly green and fresh for a while what rem liked best was the one or two evenings a week when his father got home before his bedtime they would talk about grownup things rems father burt was very proud of him he told his wife rems really interested in thingsimportant things i think hes going to be somebody the world will be glad to have when he grows up one of the important things was why the sound was dead and unhealthy another was why everybody drove their own cars instead of riding trains or buses or even working near where they lived his father tried to answer them as well as he could well son he said people like having their own cars youll see when you grow up and get your own license when you get behind the wheel youre on your own you can shut out all the unpleasant things what things dad burt looked suddenly remorseful oh not things like here rem you and your motherwell i wouldnt change places with anybody in the world but there are a lot of problems burt was a tax accountant for the new york state government he shook his head we need so much he said and its hard to know where the moneys going to come from lets see what was the other question oh about waste heat and sewage well thats one of the problems rem theres so much pollution and it costs too much to get rid of it i suppose that of course you could theoretically use the heat from the factories and power plants and so on to heat homes or even to warm up some sort of farmstheyd have to be greenhouses actuallyso you could grow more things but the capital cost rem would be immense he hesitated trying to find the words to explain economics to a tenyearold we just dont have the money maybe if wed started a long time ago but we didnt you cant drive cars without freeways to drive them on do you see i guess the government could have built piping systems and recirculation plants but then where would the money have come from for the highways we did the best we could i think we used up all the lowsulfur fuels first and we kept on dumping sewage until it was too late to stop and it got harder and harder to make the fertilizer to grow the food i suppose he said thoughtfully that if some people had made different decisions a century or so ago the world would be quite a different place some ways it would be pretty nice but they didnt and its too late now he smiled and squeezed rems shoulder speaking of being late its about time for you to be off to bed so rem would take his pills and drink his glass of soymilk and go off to sleep he wasnt unhappy about that he remembered the dream and knew he would dream it again and that was something to look forward to it was so very pleasant and so very real he wasnt always sure which was the reality and which was the dream
