dominium in excelsis by clark ashton smith exalt thyself be more than man be saint or be magician and where the burning sword awaits defy the old seraphic ban thy will that climbs from dark estates shall divinize the godless fates this fiery ecstasy of dream melt down the grim forbidden gates that open into spheres extreme beyond the starrybubbled stream beyond capella past altair where amaranthine gardens gleam thy feet shall tread the scorpions lair thy hands shall catch the comets hair or over endor thou shalt ride unfrighted on the tamed nightmare and thence go down where ghosts have died and famished ghouls and vampires glide or tarry in years behind the tomb or in the multiple futures bide thou shalt respire the flame and fume of beltis altars drowned in gloom under her sharded fanes or share the fabled atlantean doom and rise unharmed to light and air out of old death once more to death with antinomian deed and thought the planet of thy slain despair till stones and atoms shadowwrought dissolving shall return to naught or into fairer shapes be brought
