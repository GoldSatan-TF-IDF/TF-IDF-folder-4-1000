chapter metria it wasnt always easy being the son of an ogre and a nymph sometimes the ogre started smashing things just for the joy of it or squeezing the juice from stones onehanded making an awful mess sometimes the nymph was rather emptyminded or threw a tantrum that was why esk had made this cosy hideout that no one else knew about whenever things became too difficult at home he came here to relax and unwind he loved his parents but there was virtue in solitude too he paused to look about and listen carefully he didnt want any creature of xanth tame or wild seeing him enter because then the location would be no secret and sooner or later his folks would learn of it and his privacy would be lost his hideout was in the hollow trunk of a dead beerbarrel tree he had been lucky he had been in the vicinity in the month of awghost when barrel trees gave up the ghost if they were going to and had seen the spirit departing aw ghost he had exclaimed in the classic ogre manner and that had enchanted the tree so that he could take over the busk without creating a local commotion he had cut a door in the fat trunk that sealed tightly so that it didnt show from outside and made vents so that the steamy beer smell could dissipate his mother tandy would never understand if he came home reeking of beer then he had set straw in the bottom and brought in pillows from a nearby pillow bush and carved decorative scenes in the walls and made it perfect he was rather proud of himself his only regret was that he could not afford to boast of his accomplishment because of the necessity for secrecy all seemed clear he hooked his nails into the crevice and pulled the door open it was a small door with an irregular outline so that its contour was not obvious he ducked down to step through then drew it carefully closed behind he stepped across the floor and dropped onto his nest of pillows vale of the vole ouch esk jumped who said that he demanded get your fat mule off me the voice came from below he looked but saw only pillows my fat what your fat donkey the voice snapped pony horse jackass whatever offl esk finally got a glimmer of the word that was being sought he got quickly off the pillows where are you the pillow shifted outline a mouth formed in its center here you oaf what did you think you were doing putting gross anatomy like that in my face well i never mind just dont do it again moron but pillows are supposed to be oh did you ever ask the pillows opinion about that well actually no but so there imbecile now get out and let me sleep esk got out then as he wended his way home he pondered how had he been able to talk to a pillow he knew of only one person who could talk to an object and that was the king of xanth dor since it was generally understood that talents did not repeat except in the case of the curse fiends that meant that it wouldnt be esks talent beside that he already had a talent that of protesting sometimes his mother said he protested too much but she did not deny it was magic since no one had two magic talents that too eliminated the possibility of talking to inanimate things finally he worked it out he was not the smartest person being quarter ogre but he never let go of a problem being half human and usually was able to come to some kind of settlement however crude it wasnt his magic but the pillows magic he must have picked a special pillow without realizing one that was alive all he needed to do was take it back out to the pillow bush and exchange it for another and his problem would be solved reassured he continued on toward home having forgotten whatever problem had brought him to his hideout as he neared it he smelled the delicious odor of purple bouillon that meant that his father smash had gone into his full ogre guise and foraged for the makings smash was actually only half ogre for esks grandparents on that side had been crunch ogre and an actress from the curse fiends but when smash got ogreish no one could tell him from a full ogre he swelled up horrendously and burst out of his trousers tandy however being of nymphly vale of the vole stock preferred smash as a man so usually that was what he seemed to be esk could not voluntarily turn ogre but when he got mad enough or desperate enough he did develop some ogre strength it never lasted long but of course it didnt need to one strike by an ogreishlypowered fist could pulverize the trunk of a rock maple tree similarly he was normally inept at acting but when he really had to he could become temporarily proficient that was his heritage from his curse fiend grandmother most of the time it was his human heritage that dominated since he was part human through both of his parents he was a pretty ordinary person with gray eyes and nondescript brown hair he often wished he were otherwise but really had no choice he was obviously not destined for any sort of greatness but there was no use worrying about that there was purple bouillon to be eaten two days later being bored esk returned to his hideout he entered and checked the pillows they all looked normal which one of you is the live one he inquired but had no answer he shrugged he picked up the whole mass of them and took them out to the pillow bush unceremoniously dumping them beside it then he picked several new ones he had to do this periodically anyway so they didnt get dirty and stale he carried these to his tree and plopped them down inside he hesitated then eased himself down on them contrary to what the living pillow had said his posterior was not fat in retrospect he wished he had corrected the pillow about that matter but he always thought up the smart responses way too late that again was part of his heritage neither ogres nor nymphs were known for their quickness of wit he was hungry so he brought out a pie he had picked some time ago it was a humble pie and they were always best when properly seasoned this one was decked with sodden raisins and had a crust that was rocklike while its main body seemed to be decomposing it was definitely ready for consumption he brought it to his mouth and took an ogreish bite his teeth came down dug inand the pie erupted in his face raisins popped out and flew at his eyes and the crust writhed against his lips get your ugly cat out of here the pie exclaimed my ugly what esk asked startled your ugly kitten feline grimalkin tabby oh you mean my ugly puss he inquired catching on vale of the vole your ugly whatever the pie agreed forming a wide mouth just what did you think you were doing ogreface ogreface esk repeated appreciating the compliment then he realized that the pie probably hadnt meant it that way i was trying to oh you were were you well dont do it agan but you never asked the pie whether it wanted to be chewed on did you but its humble pie its meant to be eaten a likely story now get your dimwitted face out of here so i can rest listen pieface this is my hideout esk said developing a smidgeon of heat i just tossed out an obnoxious pillow and ill do the same with you you sure arent very humble you just try to toss this cookie and youll be sorry beanbrainl that did it esk carried the pie to the door pushed the door open and skated the disk out into the forest then he plumped down on his bed of pillows for a snooze it was a moderately cool day and while true ogres loved cold weather esk didnt he cast about until he found the tattered old blanket he had salvaged for this purpose and drew it over him the blanket writhed and wrapped itself around his feet then it squeezed his legs and inched up his torso constricting as it did hey esk exclaimed hay yourself moobrain the blanket said forming a mouth on its surface but it did not pause in its squeezing esks legs were getting uncomfortable abruptly concerned he thrust his legs apart the ogre strength coming to him the blanket torebut then it fogged and rose up as a flying thing hovering before him listen dunghead its mouth said now im really going to make you sorry but esks ogre dander was up he grabbed the blanket with both hands well see about that threadface then he tore it asunder the pieces fogged again the whole thing became vapor this time it reformed into the shape of a demoness youre stronger than you look bugwit but how long do you think you can oppose me what wit esk asked confused again fleawit antwit chiggerwit oh nitwit whatever why dont you answer the question vale of the vole now at last esk caught on the pillowthe piethey were all you you assumed their forms of course i did genius she agreed i was trying to get rid of you gently but now its no more miss nice gal im going to twist you into a pretzel and feed you to a dragon in her natural form she had arms and hands which were now reaching for him dragons dont eat pretzels he said realizing he was in trouble demons were notorious they had inhuman strength and no conscience and they could pass right through solid walls if he had realized what he was dealing with he would have left her alone now it was too late ill jam you down its mouth anyway she said grimly maybe it will forgive me in a century or two the hands closed on his neck and squeezed but this stimulated his ogre strength to full potency contrary to popular lore ogres didnt really like getting twisted into pretzels whatever they might do to others esk grabbed her wrists and wrenched them apart who are you he demanded i am the demoness metria she replied fogging again her arms and hands reappeared at his throat leaving his own hands empty demetria for short who are you esk grabbed her wrists again and wrenched them outward again i am eskil ogre and im not going to let you choke me thats what you think mortal she said her substance fogged yet again and reformed and this time her arms were linked by a length of thin rope she hooked this over his head and looped it around his neck you cant get this off before youre done for no esk gasped now she seemed startled no her grip relaxed esk balled a fist and smashed her in the face the blow was solid but her head simply folded back on the neck as if hinged then snapped back into place as he withdrew his arm she looked slightly aggravated no he repeated i protest it she reconsidered well maybe not i suppose it would be pointless to kill you your body would only stink up the region and i dont care to haul it far enough so the smell wouldnt carry the cord dissolved into vapor and coalesced about her arms it was evidently part of her substance well im going to throw you out of here esk said his ogre aspect still in force id like to see you try it mundaneface vile of the vole mundanefacel her insults were getting more effective that kept his ogre aspect in force ill try it he tried it he grabbed her about the middle and hauled her off her feet then he paused her body was humanoid and naked and voluptuous and was now tightly pressed against him he had been distracted by her words and actions but now was noticing her shape this was a new experience well now she said smiling i didnt realize that you wanted to be friendly just let me get your clothes off he dropped her just get out he exclaimed disgruntled forget it junior i found this place and its mine i made it and its mine he retorted she arched an eyebrow you made a beerbarrel tree well not that but i adapted it after it gave up its spirit thats close enough well i like it but i dont like you so im going to get rid of you no she paused studying him ah thats your magic isnt it when you say no you stop a creature from doing what she intends thats why im changing my mind against my better judgment yes his talent was not exactly magician class but it served him in good stead when he needed it so id better not make any more threats because youll just say no to them she continued but ill bet it isnt all inclusive you cant say no to the whole category of what i might try to do to get you out but you can say it to each individual thing as i try it yes she was catching on with dismaying rapidity obviously there was no ogre blood in her lineage so ill just have to find a way to make you want to leave she concluded i cant hurt you directly but you cant hurt me either so were even for now why are you here he asked plaintively because its getting too annoying back where i come from she said the hummers you know the what never mind mortals cant hear them generally but they drive demons crazy theyve gotten really bad recently there in the vale of the vole despite all weve done to eradicate them so ive had enough ive moved to where i can be comfortable after my fashion but youre trying to take the place where can be comfortable after my fashion he protested vale of the vole so sue me what its a mundane term it means what are you going to do about it stinknose i dont understand is sue a girl she laughed her whole torso jiggling i suppose were stuck here together junior might as well make the best of it maybe well even get to like each other though that may be stretching a point come let me initiate you into the ways of demon sex she advanced on him no he exclaimed she stopped theres that magic of yours again i really wasnt going to hurt you you know this time i can be very affectionate when i pretend to be let me demonstrate no he was afraid of her now as he had not been before and ashamed for his fear it wasnt because he thought she would use a pretext to get close to him and then try to choke him again it was because he was afraid she would do exactly what she threatened and that he would like it he didnt trust a demonstration she eyed him speculatively how old are you esk sixteen and im a hundred and sixteen but whos counting youre old enough in mortal terms and im young enough in immortal terms why dont you let me buy this den from you and pay for it with experience i can show you exactly what its all about so that you will never have to embarrass yourself by being clumsy with a mortal girl esk barged by her dived out the door and headed for home only when he was well away from the hideout did he ask himself why was he afraid that she would somehow lead him into some much worse embarrassment than he could guess or that he thought that what she offered was simply wrong but was it wrong he wasnt sure he thought about asking his parents about the matter but then hed have to tell them about his hideout which he didnt want to do also he suspected that they just wouldnt understand his mother had never said much about it but he understood that a male demon had once approached her and that she had been horrified he could guess how she would react to news of a demonesss approach to her son she might even throw one of her tantrums at him and that would hurt his father loved those tantrums because they reminded him of ogre slaps but an ogre slap could knock a grown tree askew or put a network of cracks in a rock vale of the vole so he kept silent maybe metria would tire of his hideout and go away demons were known to be inconstant after all several days later he ventured again to the hideout he entered cautiously there was no sign of the demoness but he knew that she could be concealed as anything only time would tell whether she really was gone he sat on the pillows and there was no outcry he shook out his blanket with no protest he found a piece of redberry pie and ate it without event he began to hope it was surprising how quickly boredom set in one thing about his experience with metria it had been interesting in more than one way now that it was too late he wondered whether he had been mistaken in turning down her oifer she might have provided him with some phenomenal experience he dug out his game of pebbles his collection of stones had served well in past times to while away dull hours they were of several different colors and he had fashioned a game by drawing them out of the bag one at a time and setting them down on the floor in patterns each stone had to be set next to one of its own color to form a line or curve the object was for one color to circle another he might draw several red stones in succession not looking at each until it was clear of the bag and red would make progress against white then white would produce several and reverse the advantage blue and green and gray were also in there fighting sometimes the colors made alliances ganging up against each other the game could get quite exciting as he animated the personalities of the colors in his mind the patterns could become quite convoluted he brought out the first stone it was glistening black he set it down starting the game hey freak what do you think youre doing the stone asked he snatched it up and thrust it back into the bag and twisted the opening tight trying to seal it in but smoke issued through the material and swirled before him and soon metria was there i thought youd given up and left it to me she remarked i thought youd given up he retorted demons never give up unless they want to come on i really want this place cant we deal no but then his foolish curiosity overcame him why are you so insistent on this place instead of just becoming a bird and perching on a branch or something this place is secluded and comfortable and other creatures dont vale of the vole know about it we demons need to spend most of our time in solid state and its easiest to do it while sleeping so a good private place is valuable i thought demons didnt need to sleep we dont need to sleep mortal but we can sleep if we choose and often we do this is a perfect sleeping place so i mean to have it well i dont mean to let you have it her lips formed a pout im trying to be nice about it esk its an effort suppose i give you two great experiences two sex and death you already tried to kill me i mean the other way around you can kill me after you enjoy me demons cant be killed but he found himself guiltily intrigued we cant die but we can do extremely realistic emulations of dying you can choke me and ill gag and turn purple and my eyeballs will bulge way out and ill struggle with diminishing force until finally i sag down and stop breathing and my body turns cold it will be just like throttling a living woman ugh esk said revolted well what do you want then three great experiences name your stupid price he was tempted to ask about the third experience but decided that he probably would not like it any better than the second no ill even throw in the first one free she said just so you can fully appreciate what i offer i can assume any form you wish just to make it interesting is there any particular mortal girl youve been wanting to no he cried look theres no obligation i just want to demonstrate my good faith i really want this den without getting bothered all the time i know an awful lot that you could hardly learn in a year let alone in a day and no dont be so stuffy she inhaled making her breasts stand out splendidly and leaned toward him i said no three times esk said querulously why arent you stopping because im not doing im persuading she said and you want to be persuaded dont you esk he was afraid that anything he said at this point would be a lie he lurched out of the hideout ashamed of himself he had to get rid of the demoness before she succeeded in corrupting him vale of the vole he stayed away a full ten days this time but he felt out of sorts without the use of his hideout and realized that he was actually giving it up to her without a fight he had to go there and pester her until she left instead of allowing her to do it to him he braced himself and went to the beerbarrel tree all was quiet outside and in but he knew this was no certain indication of her absence he sat on the pillows shook out the blanket ate a scrap of cheese dumped all the colored stones out on the floor and poked everything he could think of there was no response from any of it could she really be gone this time or was she merely lying low waiting until he relaxed before appearing with some new offer how many such offers could he resist before he succumbed to the temptation how many did he want to resist already she was corrupting him and she wasnt even trying still if she never manifested then the hideout was his even if she was here except that if she should be watching and listening to everything he did here how could he ever really relax he had to be sure she was gone and not just out doing some temporary mischief elsewhere he heard something faint in the distance outside the tree he held his breath listening eskil eskil that was his mothers voice she was searching for him calling his name and if he didnt show up soon she was apt to discover this hideout he scrambled out and ran to her not directly but in a roundabout way so as not to give away the location of his secret place what is it mother he called when the direction was suitable tandy turned to face him she had kept much of her nymphly figure and was a pretty figure of a woman there was the corruption of the demoness again how could he presume to notice such a thing about his own mother oh eskil she said you must come home right away its horrible he was gripped by sudden alarm whats horrible your fathersome other ogre smashed him i think and his alarm became horror hes hurt he may not survive the hour we have to get some healing elixir before its too late i know where theres a spring he cried ill go get it he took the little bottle she carried and charged off through the forest his heart pounding from more than the exertion his father dying vale of the vole he reached the spring and swooped with the bottle dipping out the healing elixir then he ran back toward the house he charged in where is he he cried panting tandy turned from the table where she was preparing leftover soup where is who dear she inquired mildly father smash ogre i have the elixir smash emerged from another room he was in his human mode you called me son esk looked from one to the other youyoure not hurt tandys brow furrowed whatever gave you the idea your father was hurt esk but you were just telling me out in the forest i have not left the house all afternoon dear she said reprovingly but but obviously it was true his mother never interrupted leftover soup for anything short of a dire emergency and it seemed there had been not even a mild emergency how could he have thought then he understood metria she could emulate anything or anyone she had pretended to be his mother and he had been completely fooled ii guess i had a dream he said awkwardly i thought father was hurt so i fetched some elixir that was nice of you dear tandy said and returned her attention to her soup but save the elixir smash said never can tell when that stufltll be handy uh sure esk said looking for a stopper for the vial but now the vial fuzzed into vapor and the elixir spilled to the floor what a fool he had been next day he returned to the hideout metria he bawled show yourself you damned demoness she appeared why i do believe you are having a change of mind she said you never complimented me like that before you made me think my father was dying he accused her of course esk if one thing doesnt work i try another how else am i to be left in peace here you mean youre going to keep on doing things like that making me think my folks are in trouble why of course not esk obviously that didnt work either because here you are again he didnt trust this then what vale of the vole ill just have to do something real to your folks so you wont have time to bother me it took only a moment for him to grasp that despite his quarterogre heritage no thats a category denial esk you know you cant enforce that ill get your folks one way or another in time you cant watch them both all the time he leaped at her she started to dematerialize then reconsidered instead she met him flinging her arms about him but im still willing to deal for the den and even to give you the free sample if the force of his leap was carrying them on and now they landed together on the pillows metria wrapped her legs about his body and her arms about his head hauling him in to her for a kiss im really being more than reasonable for my kind she whispered against his cheek all i want is to be left alone in my den my den he gasped which i am offering a generous price for she said most men would grasp most eagerly at the chance not to mention the flesh now just let me get these clothes off you he wrenched himself away from her no she sighed well no one can say i didnt try i really have nothing against your folks because they dont even know about the den but if thats what it takes to no illill leave you alone you leave them alone why how nice of you esk she said you are becoming reasonable i shall be glad to leave all of you alone as long as you do not come here esk got to his feet turned around and walked away from her he knew he had lost and it galled him but there seemed to be no other way could he trust her to leave his folks alone the more he thought about it as he walked the more he distrusted it the demoness might decide she liked the house better than the tree and act against the family anyway demons had no conscience that was their great strength and weakness he had to get rid of metria only then could he be quite sure that his family was safe but how every time he tried to make her move she tried to seduce him or worse and she seemed a lot closer to victory than he where could he find the answer then he realized where he would go ask the good magician humfrey humfrey knew everything and for one years service would answer vale of the vole any question it was a steep price but would be worth it to save his family from the possible malice of the demoness his decision made esk felt better tomorrow he would start his trip to the good magicians castle chapter chex andy hadnt wanted to let him go of course and he had been unable to tell her that it was to protect her and smash and their house that he was doing it so he had told another aspect of the truth that it was time for him to take his ogreish rite of passage and perform some mighty act of destruction to become an adult and so he wanted to go to the good magician to get advice smash had endorsed that enthusiastically so tandy really couldnt prevent it and in a sense it was true it was time for him to assert himself and he did need advice but the great act of destruction he contemplated was reversed he actually wanted to prevent it by getting rid of metria before she hurt someone he hoped that wasnt too great a stretch of the reality but the good magician requires a year of service for each answer tandy had protested i know because i served that year when when he put you together with me smash had reminded her that had ended that of course she wasnt going to claim that the good magician had served her ill he had indeed solved her problem by providing her with a companion who could stand up to the demon who threatened her and what companion could enable esk to stand up to metria he wondered what he really needed was a spell to make her simply go away and stay away no questions asked he would ask for it at the outset so that he could banish her immediately then he would serve out his year satisfied that there was no threat to his folks now he hiked west through the brush garbed in the gray shirt and trousers his mother had insisted he wear which matched his gray eyes such things were important to mothers he was seeking one of the magic paths that led to the good magicians castle they were enchanted to protect all travelers so the trip should be easy enough here near home he was familiar with the land so readily avoided problems but when he vale of the vole hit strange territory he wanted to be on a path even as minor a nuisance as the curse burrs could be bad if one stumbled into a bed of them unaware major threats such as large dragonswell it was best just to avoid those he found a path but distrusted it because it was too convenient sure enough it led directly to a tangle tree a full ogre might tramp down it anyway being too stupid to know the difference and bash the tree being too strong to care but esk was only a quarter ogre and had to exercise some discretion so he shunned the pathand sure enough he blundered into a patch of curse burrs confound you he exclaimed as one dug into his leg that one hesitated then dropped off his curse had been pretty mild too bad he didnt have any harpy blood a harpy could curse so villainously that the foliage around her dirty body smoked curse burrs never bothered harpiesl three more burrs were pricking him go jump in the lakel he exclaimed and one fell off reluctantly your parent is a weed and another loosened may a dragon roast you and the third let go his problem was that he had never learned to curse effectively tandy being a gentle creature had not been any suitable role model in this respect and smash was not all that verbal when annoyed he simply turned ogre and bashed whatever bothered him esk knew that his education had been neglected in this respect but it was rather late to do much about it there were two more burrs pricking his ankles they were difficult to reach because when he bent over his backpack tended to shift so he sat down unfortunately there were more burrs below and what the demoness had termed his mule landed solidly on them ј ј he bawled sailing up the burrs flew from him like zzapping wiggles leaving little vapor trails behind esk stared after them he hadnt realized that he knew language like that of course he had been stung hard in an indelicate place so had reacted involuntarily still he tried to recall what he had said but could not apparently this was like his ogre strength or his curse fiend acting that came only in extreme need too bad he resumed his trek and in due course encountered a promising path it did not lead to a tangle tree or a dragons lair so seemed good he wasnt sure how to tell whether it was enchanted but if no hostile creatures appeared on it he would assume that it was he stopped for lunch tandy had made him blueberry sandwiches his favorite and current pie his teeth received a pleasant little shock when vale of the vole he bit into the pie and caused the current to flow the sandwiches were delightfully cold because the berries had been harvested when blue with cold in the month of feblueberry and retained their frigid nature tandy had a special touch with food which she said she had learned while serving the good magician well maybe he would pick up useful skills too while serving his term by all accounts the service the magician required was not arduous and was often beneficial to the server in unanticipated ways the monsters that came with questions served as guardians and tandy had served as a housekeeper smash ogre had performed a task in lieu of a year traveling with tandy and guarding her from danger esk would be willing to perform alternate service especially in the company of some young woman resembling his mother in certain respects but that reminded him of metria who had offered him entirely too much companionship he still wondered why he had so resolutely refused her offer it wasnt because he really valued his hideout he could have fashioned another in a different region of the forest probably it was because he simply wasnt ready for the type of experience she offeredat least not with a creature who was totally cynical about it a real girl with real feelings and sensitivities and concernsthat would have been most interesting but a centuryold unhuman creature who did it purely as a matter of bargainingthat was frightening she could have gotten him fairly into it then changed into a harpy or something and laughed her demoniac head off he did not trust her at all there maybe was the real key trust demons were absolutely untrustworthy because they had no souls everyone knew that the only safe way to handle a demon was to stay away from it because there was no telling what it might do next metria had first tried to kill him then to seduce him now she threatened his family and that only confirmed the popular wisdom he hoped he reached the good magicians castle soon so that he could set that matter right he completed his lunch and resumed walking he did not know how far distant the good magicians castle was but doubted that it was far he knew a little geography of course his folks lived in the heart of xanth and to the southeast was lake ogrechobee and lake wails to the east and the great gap chasm to the north the only direction remaining was west where there was the good magician and beyond him castle roogna where king dor lived the king was a friend of smash ogre but they hadnt been in touch for a while apparently king dor had a child or two and a pet dragon that was about the extent of what was known vale of the vole there was a noise ahead esk paused listening that sounded like a small dragon but it couldnt be because it was on the path but what else could pound and hiss like that now he smelled smoke and that too suggested dragon dragons came in a number of varieties adapted for land water and air some were firebreathers some steamers and some smokers suddenly he wished he were armed but all he had was a walkbig staff the thing came into sightand it was a dragon a small brown smoker with bright claws and dusky teeth because of staining by the smoke this was not the worst variety of dragon but any variety was trouble because all dragons were tough and hungry what was it doing on the enchanted path esk had no time to ponder because the dragon was charging him mouth agape he hefted his staff but it seemed feeble even in the face of this rather small dragon one chomp would break the staff in two he thought to jump out of the way but here the path was lined with curse burrs and worse the dragon scrambled right up to him puffing smoke it was about esks own mass and however small that might be for a dragon it was big enough to be a real threat to the tender flesh of a man the jaws were big and the teeth like little daggers those jaws and those teeth snapped at him no esk said the dragons snout moved aside and the teeth chomped on air the smoky eyes looked startled it was wondering how it could have missed so ready a target it reset itself and aimed another chomp no again the bite missed an angry plume of smoke issued from the monsters mouth bathing esk and making him cough he fanned the air with his hands dissipating the smoke but it clung to his clothing now he would smell like a smoker the dragon slow to grasp the nature of the opposition made a third attempt its jaws opened wide no esk repeated poking at the mouth with his staff the jaws froze in their open mode they could not bite down on the staff because of esks magic disgruntled the monster backed away and then it was able to close its mouth the dragon pondered just as the thought that perhaps it should try once more started to percolate through the somewhat dense substance of its head esk said no once more this time the thought itself was balked out of sorts the little dragon moved on down the path giving up on this particular prey vale of the vole esk resumed his hike disturbed if this path was enchanted against predators why had the dragon been on it if it was not was it the right one he didnt want to be on the wrong one yet it was the only path he had found if it was wrong where did it lead he sighed for now he would continue along it possibly it was an unenchanted tributary and in due course it would intersect the enchanted one if notwell then he would simply have to scout crosscountry for the right one as the day waned the path gave no sign of merging with any other it curved along contours and around large trees and crossed small streams just as if it had every business doing so it certainly extended too far to be justified as a false path then another little dragon appeared naturally it charged him no he told it firmly several times and finally it gave up and smoked on down the path two dragons one might have been a fluke but two of a similar type the enchantment was definitely flawed now there was a notion the spell might indeed exist but have a glitch in it so that a certain type of creature could slip through that would mean that this was after all the right path but as evening drew nigh he worried even if it was the right path there were dragons on it how could he lie down and sleep if a dragon might come upon him he could only tell them no while he was awake if he got chomped in the night he could cry no and stop it but the original damage would still have been done if he got chomped badly enough before he woke he could be dead even a little dragon was nothing to ignore he concluded that he could not afford to sleep not until he knew it was safe then he heard a commotion ahead go away shoo shoo away it sounded like a woman he ran toward it soon he discovered not a woman but a centaura filly with helplessly flapping wings and an ineffectively wielded staff in her hands another little dragon was attacking her being held off only by the staff the dragon evidently knew it could get by the staff before long smoke was puffing from it as its internal fires heated esk readied his own staff get out of here he yelled at the dragon startled it whipped around to face him its smoke cutting off for a moment as it held its breath then deciding that this was a possible rival for the prey it let out its smoke with a ferocious growl and leaped at him no esk cried the jaws snapped in air as the dragon drew its snout vale of the vole aside it landed disgruntled beyond him it started to turn back no he repeated and it traveled on away from him too stupid to realize that this had not been its own decision oh thank you traveler the filly said i dont know what i would have done if uh sure he said looking at her more carefully she had gray eyes and a brown mane and the wings were gray matching the eyes she wore a petite knapsack across which a sturdy bow was hung the points of several arrows projected beside the knapsack evidently the dragon had come upon her so suddenly that she had not had a chance to set up with her bow her head was somewhat higher than his this was because the human aspect of a centaur began above the equine aspect her shoulders were actually narrower than his now he did a double take wings dont stare at me as if im a freak she exclaimed i uh just never sawthat is my father is a hippogryph she said i inherit my wings from him uh yes of course he said but why didnt you just fly away she put her face in her hands and burst into tears completely discomfited esk stood on one foot and then the other uncertain what to do in a moment her mood shifted somewhat i cant fly she said despairingly these wings just dont have enough lift uh sorry he said awkwardly anyway thank you for rescuing me from the dragon i didnt expect anything like that here the path is supposed to be safe thats what i thought esk said but thats the third little smoker ive seen on it she brushed back her mane which was just like the tresses of a human woman and took a deep breath which accentuated a bosom that also resembled that of a human woman only more so centaurs of course did not wear clothing they considered it to be a human affectation hello she said brightly im chex im esk did you notice that we match hair and eyes he agreed and wings he added mentally they matched his suit in color and to a moderate but reasonable extent in texture my father is xap hippogryph my mother is chem centaur she was making the introduction easy enough my father is smash ogre my mother is tandy nymph vale of the vole so youre a crossbreed too she exclaimed happily quarter ogre half human quarter nymph he agreed the human portion is half curse fiend technically im going to see the good magician why so am i what a coincidence well we are on the same path only one of us must be going the wrong way well i live east of his castle so im going west esk said and i live west of it so im going east they stood there considering maybe theres a turnoff one of us missed esk said after a pause that must be so chex agreed i was traveling pretty fast i could have trotted past one i was traveling slowly i dont think i did then lets go west she said brightly and look to the sides you are easy to get along with he remarked they walked west with him parallel to her front section this was a little crowded on the path but there didnt seem to be any better way to do it im just mostly tired of traveling alone she confessed that dragon how did you get rid of it so easily i couldnt make it quit i just told it no thats my talentto protest things the effect doesnt last long but dragons arent very smart so it works well enough i wish i had a talent she said it used to be that centaurs werent supposed to have magic but now its acceptable for the younger ones my female parent is a mapmaker she can project a map of anything she told me how to reach the good magicians castle its hard to imagine that she could have been mistaken geography changes he said tangle trees make new paths all the time when the old ones get too familiar and streams change their courses when their old beds get too rocky the path must have changed since your mother surveyed it that must be it she agreed and you probably have a talent it just hasnt manifested yet youre pretty easy to get along with yourself she remarked with a smile that became her marvelously i suppose im tired of traveling alone too they laughed together esk realized with a tinge of guilt that he was finding it much easier to relate to this filly than to a real girl perhaps this was because nothing much was expected of a relationship between a man and a centaur it was strictly convenience and company vale of the vole now night was closing perhaps we should stop for supper and a place to sleep chex said do you think there will be other dragons esk had been thinking the same thing his legs were tired i had feared i couldnt afford to sleep maybe now we can take turns watching yes she agreed gladly they foraged for fruit then set their watches chex would stand guard until she got sleepy then would wake him for a similar spell she assured him that she would not fall asleep without knowing it some centaurs slept on their feet but her legs tended to buckle waking her esk retreated to some bushes for natural functions which modesty chex found amusing then piled some leaves beside the path and lay down but though he was tired he was not yet sleepy are you going to the good magician to ask what your talent is he inquired she swished her tail as if snapping off a fly no im afraid i would have to serve a year for news that i have none my concern is more well awkward oh i didnt mean to pry its all right i can talk to you it isnt as if youre a centaur im not a centaur he agreed how well her sentiment echoed his own its to find out how to fly of course he should have guessed you know your wings dont seem as big as those of the big birds he said im not sure they could support you in the air even if they worked perfectly i mean they might lift a smaller creature but not a centaur thats obvious she said somewhat coldly ive been practicing flapping them for months developing my pectoral muscles and as you can see they have filled out but i just dont have the lift i require esk was too embarrassed to tell her that he had taken her front muscles for breasts and rather wellformed ones too centaurs wore only occasional harnesses or protections against heat or cold and never concealed their sexual attributes the breasts of female centaurs tended to be impressive by human standards perhaps because they were structured to provide enough milk for offspring whose mass was several times that of human babies chex appeared to be no older than he was but her breasts would have been considered more than generous on any human woman obviously he had let himself be deluded by a preconception what i meant to say was he said somewhat awkwardly could it be that your magic talent is flying that your muscles and wingspan only provide a small part of it and magic the main part vale of the vole if it is then why cant i fly well if you were flapping your wings instead of doing your magic then it wouldnt work but how would i work my magic she asked plaintively i have thought of that and tried to will myself into flight but nothing happens i dont know i think youre right you must ask the good magician maybe he will be able to tell you some spell you can invoke that will make it work that is my hope she said why are you going to see him i have to find out how to get rid of a demoness who threatens my family he explained the rest of it except for the business of metrias amatory offerings that matter was too embarrassing im surprised she didnt try to tempt you sexually chex said human males are known to be vulnerable to that kind of inducement and demons are unscrupulous he felt himself blushing in the darkness uh well oh thats rightyou humans are sensitive about that sort of thing arent you how quaint quaint he agreed then not wishing to discuss the matter further he closed his eyes and in a moment he slept she woke him in deep darkness esk esk she whispered urgently it took him a moment to get oriented oh yes my turn to guard no i think a dragons coming suddenly he was completely alert where from ahead i smell the smoke after my prior experience i am more sensitive to that signal now esk smelled it too thats dragon all right i wish i could see it so i could know when to tell it no use your staff she suggested ill use mine too but i cant hit the dragon if i cant see it i mean as a sensing device hold it out in front of you and when right he hefted his staff and pointed it toward the smell of smoke now they listened as the dragon huffed closer was his staff pointed correctly suppose the dragon slid under it or climbed over it the monster seemed very close the odor of the smoke was strong if he waited too long and got chomped before he no he cried the huffing paused its still some distance away chex murmured reprovingly does your protest work at a distance no esk said chagrined vale of the vole the dragon seemed to have paused because of the sound of his voice now it had a good notion where he was it growled and charged no esk cried again nononononono the dragon made a disgusted noise and retreated they heard the scrabble of its claws on the path one of those nos must have scored chex said um he agreed embarrassed he knew he had panicked and come reasonably close to making a fool of himself again im glad you are here she said i could not have diverted it in the dark and perhaps not in the daytime either i would have had to run and that has its own hazards in the dark my turn to keep watch he said preferring to change the subject as you wish he heard a gentle thunk as she lowered her body to the path he wondered how the forepart of a centaur slept did it lie flat on the ground or remain vertical but he didnt care to inquire it turned out that she had kept watch for most of the night before very long the sky to the east lightened and dawn was on the way as the morning arrived he saw that neither surmise was quite right chexs humanoid torso was neither upright nor flat as she slept but halfleaning back on her equine torso above her folded wings her arms were clasped below her breastsher pectoral muscles he corrected himself her brown hair merged prettily enough with her mane she was right he thought the hue of her hair matched his exactly as if they were brother and sister could there be siblings of different species perhaps not directly but if they had been born at the same time when the order for deliveries was for brown hair and gray eyes well with magic anything was possible at any rate she was a very pretty figure in this repose a beam of sunlight speared down through a gap in the foliage and touched her face chex woke blinking oh its morning she exclaimed lifting first her upper section then her remaining body let me urinate and we can get moving she stood at the side of the path spread her rear legs and did it while esk stood startled he knew that such things were unimportant to centaurs and that he should simply accept her ways without reaction but he knew he was about to flush embarrassingly then he had a bright notion me too he said and quickly made his way to a concealing bush and did his own business she would think it was because of his quaint human modesty and that was true but it was mainly to give himself a chance to clear his flush before rejoining her you really ought to do something about that foible she remarked vale of the vole innocently as she plucked a pie from an overhanging tree her greater height in the front section caused her breasher pectoral muscles to lift to his eye level as she reached up esk did not respond because he wasnt sure to which foible she referred but he suspected she was right and he resolved to try to learn how to perform natural functions in her sight without blushing after all each culture had its own ways and he wasnt among human beings now certainly he never wanted to be caught staring at what he wasnt supposed to notice anyway she handed him the pie and reached for another thank you he said fixing his gaze on the pie but he didnt even notice what kind it was he just bit into it and chewed they resumed their walk and after an hour came to an intersection there it is chex exclaimed happily seeming not at all dismayed at this proof of her prior oversight the path i missed but there are two esk pointed out which should we takethe one going north or the one going south that depends on whether the path were on passes north or south of the good magicians castle i know the gap chasm is north but i dont know how far esk said maybe if the north path leads there then the south one leads to the castle she finished so lets try the south and if its wrong why well just go north it cant be far now they turned south the trees grew larger putting the path in the gloom of perpetual shade then they grew smaller letting the sun shine down hotly i hope we encounter water soon chex said fm sweating esk hadnt realized that females of any persuasion sweated but certainly her brown coat was glistening maybe if you fanned yourself with your wings he suggested why i never thought of that she said i need to exercise them anyway she spread her wings and moved them generating a draft whose fringe he could feel yes thats much better thank you the way opened out further and now they came to a small lake the path crossed it passing right along the surface of the water they exchanged a glance can a path go on water chex asked if its an enchanted path esk replied doubtfully well well see she stepped forwardand her front hooves passed through the visible path and sank into the water with splashes immediately there was a stir in the lake a wake appeared behind something huge and dark that was speeding toward them no part of it vale of the vole quite broke the surface and its outline was obscured by the refraction of the water but it seemed exceedingly sure of itself chex quickly stepped back i think we should go around the lake she said if it was enchanted to enable travelers to cross over the water that magic has been lost good thought esk agreed they started around but the reeds at the edge twisted and bent toward them showing moist surfaces that looked somewhat toothy esk knocked several away with his staff and they withdrew with faint ugly hissesbut those on the other side leaned closer esk i think we had better move rather quickly through this section chex said the footing beneath seems fairly firm i believe i could carry you if you would not consider this to be an indiscretion on my part then i could gallop another good thought he said quickly he gave her his staff to hold then she put her right hand back over her torso and he took hold of it from her left and she helped draw him up onto her back take good hold of my mane she advised he got a double handhold up between her wings then she moved out quickly advancing from walk to trot to gallop while he hung on somewhat desperately water splashed up from her hooves about halfway around the lake chex turned her head around to face him esk was startled by the elasticity of her torso from what would have been the human waist she was able to twist halfway and her neck twisted the other half so that she was abruptly facing him with her chest in profile i wonder if you could take your staff she inquired then he saw her concern several rather mean looking birds were winging toward them their necks were crooked and their beaks curved and they looked hungry if you go slowly ill try to fend them off he said as he unclenched his fingers from her mane and took back his staff she slowed to a walk using her own staff to knock at the leaning reeds he balanced himself and squinted at the ugly birds he thought he could stop them if they came down singly but about five of them folded their wings partway and dived at him together their beaks looked very sturdy and sharp no he cried as they converged it was almost too late for them to change course two birds plummeted into the water two more swooped just overhead striving desperately to rise the fifth did a crazy wiggle in air using its wings to brake vale of the vole and barely managed to reverse course before colliding with chexs shoulder the wake in deeper water was coming toward them again esk tucked the staff under one arm and grabbed new holds on the mane resume speed he said chex resumed flapping her wings to assist her progress they made it around the rest of the lake without further event rejoining the path esk slid down i think we make a fair team he said you have the go and i have the stop thats a nice way to put it she agreed i was terrified well youre a filly youre supposed to be frightened of violence and you arent yes im not supposed to be he smiled just dont ask me how it really is no questions she agreed the more he got to know her the better he liked her despite their differences of culture she tended to understand the fundamentals well enough they walked again soon they encountered a mountain the path went through it forming a dark tunnel around itself they paused its supposed to be safe esk said but after the dragons and the lake im nervous suppose we went inand it wasnt safe lets not go in i like your thinking but how do we get around it i see tangle trees on the slopes and dozens more of those birds roosting on the upper slopes she said you know i am quite sure there was no such mountain or tunnel on the map my dam showed me your damn what he asked disgruntled by her language my dam myyou would call it mother i wouldnt call my mother a damn anything she laughed i suspect we have a barrier of communication i mean that my mothers map did not have this particular feature of geography on it so this must be the wrong path oh yes then we shouldnt have to try to pass this damnthis mother of a mountain she looked at him somewhat curiously evidently the barrier was still in operation but they were agreed they would turn back and try the north fork he did not relish the return trip around the lake but at least that was a known hazard chapter volney he lake wasnt fun but this time they were prepared and they made it around without damage they celebrated by pausing for lunch and drink chex had a cup she produced from her pack with which she dipped water from the fringe of the lake and drank delicately then they traveled at a more leisurely pace north in due course they reached the intersection and this time proceeded along the north extension yet another little dragon appeared im fed up with this esk exclaimed he charged forward wielding his staff feeling his ogre strength manifesting unbidden he struck the dragon on the head then rammed the staff under its body picked it up and heaved it into the forest the dragon was not actually hurt but was so surprised that it scuttled for cover elsewhere chex was amazed that dragon weighed as much as you she exclaimed yet you tossed it like a toy i told you im quarter ogre he said relaxing every so often something triggers it and i do something ogreish evidently so she agreed i cant say i was ever partial to ogres but i must confess it was a pleasure watching that dragon fly it would be more of a pleasure if i could summon that power at will he said but its involuntary like a sneeze and it doesnt last long my father is much more of an ogre than i am and my grandfather crunch im happy with you she said quickly after all an ogres intellect is inversely proportional to his strength and his strength is directly proportional to his ugliness he added and to his taste for violence she agreed well of course a good ogre can make a medium dragon turn tail just by smiling at it a good ogre would do the same for me while a good ogress can sour milk by looking at it vale of the vole and turn it to petrified cheese by breathing on it she concluded enough of ogres lets see if we can reach the good magicians castle before nightfall they resumed their trek the path wound onward finding its way into craggy country that hinted of the great gap chasm to come this isnt promising chex muttered esk didnt comment because he agreed since this was the fourth direction they were exploring one way or another and there were no more it had to be the one there was a sound ahead not yet another dragon chex exclaimed impatiently those little monsters are positively swarming its not growling esk pointed out true but its not walking like a man or a centaur they stopped waiting for whatever it was to come into view in a moment it did so surprising them both it was a creature larger in mass than esk but smaller than chex it had a lemonshaped gray body a small snout m front and tiny feet why thats a huge mole esk said but chexs mouth was striving to fall open i thought they were extinct she said oh no there are many moles underground esk assured her ive seen them thats no mole she said impatiently thats a vole a what but now the creature had spied them it lifted its head showing tiny eyes just beneath its fur the eyes were brown eh it inquired where are you from chex asked the creature she did not seem to be afraid so esk judged it to be harmless eh a ventaur it said thats centaur chex said pnmiy i am chex centaur who are you it peered more closely at her i am volney vole pleav allow me to paw dont you know youre supposed to be extinct she asked volev dont vttnk it retorted indignantly it has trouble with esses esk said catching on the snout turned toward him and who are you vir i am esk hello evk pleav allow me to paw we arent trying to prevent you chex said just to learn about you vale of the vole i have important buvinew with the good magivmn pleav let me paw but were looking for the good magician too esk exclaimed we thought he was up this path not thiv path the creature assured him only the gap chavm but then the good magician is nowhere chex said despairingly we have looked along all the other paths the vole studied them brown and gray it remarked good colorv thats right we all match chex said only youre brown in the eyes not the fur thiv iv my vurfave vuit chex paused translating it this is your surface suit thatv what i vaid chekv i reverve it below and the vole performed a sudden convolution becoming brown the most surprising thing was that its eyes turned gray now the three of them aligned as perfectly as they were able volney i think we should have a talk chex said i think we are all in trouble because we cant find the good magician but i muvt find the magivian the vole said sounding desperate it iv movt important its important to us too chex said i think well find him faster if we compare notes and make common cause volney considered common cauve he agreed then he convoluted again changing back to his surface outfit eyes and all you see esk came looking for the good magician from the east chex said i came looking from the west we both followed a path to the south but it wasnt there so now we were trying the north path and i came from the north the vole finished it iv not there so we seem to have a problem she concluded we all need to see the good magician but none of us can find him have you any notion how we should proceed what did you find to the vouth a mountain with a tunnel that wasnt on the map my dam showed me your damn what the vole asked never mind im sure the map was accurate but featurev change yes still we muvt go to the end of that path the vole decided that iv where it hav to be vale of the vole chex sighed i suppose youre right but we really dont find the prospect of going through that tunnel appealing there have been signs that the enchantment on the path has been unpaired so that it is no longer completely safe for travelers if the tunnel were to collapse a vole hole never collapvev volney said with certainty thats rightyou were a burrowing species she said you must know about tunnels all about them the vole agreed if that tunnel iv not vafe i will vimply make another chex glanced at esk do you concur she asked shall we try the south path again i guew wed better he said she shot him a marvelously dark look and he realized that it really wasnt very funny his efforts at humor like his efforts at original thought tended to fall flat they proceeded back south chex leading then the vole then esk but it was now late in the day and they realized that it would be night by the time they reached the tunnel and that did not appeal at all so they paused at the cross paths and ate some more fruit fruit was new to volney because he was not a climbing or reaching creature but he liked it then he sniffed out some edible roots that were new to esk and chex but that were similarly palatable after being washed in the fluid from some water chestnuts chex plucked while they ate they conversed esk and chex told of their backgrounds and missions to the good magician and volney told of his the civilized voles were not he explained extinct they had merely departed for a greener pasture some centuries ago the larger family of voles comprised burrowing creatures ranging from the tiny vicious wiggle larvae to the huge amiable diggles with many varieties of squiggles between because the civilized voles avoided publicity most other creatures hardly knew of them and regarded the squiggles as the dominant representatives of the type the region of xanth between castle roogna and the gap chasm had been getting crowded so the voles had in due course traveled into the wilderness to the east where they had settled by the meandering shores of the friendly kissmee river yes i saw that on mothers map chex said the kissmee river connects lake kissmee with lake ogrechobee it is an almost unexplored region of xanth and little is known about the details of its geography which iv the way we like it volney responded for centuriev we have burrowed there in private comfort but now vale of the vole something happened esk asked getting interested geography was not his favorite subject but happenings had greater appeal divavter volney agreed it iv that horror i have come here to ameliorate i wav choven to make thiv divreputable journey becauve of my ekvellent command of the vtrange language of the vurfave folk yes you speak it very well chex said quickly forestalling the somewhat less sensitive remark esk was about to make however i note you have vome difficulty with your ewev the vole said discreetly some dif esk started but was cut off by a flick of chexs tail that stung his mouth with uncanny accuracy the strike was not hard but made him feel strangely lightheaded sometimes she understood him almost too well we all must do the best we can chex said gently even those of us who have difficulty with our esses just what is this disaster you have come to ameliorate the very devtrucvion of the vale of the vole he pronounced with feeling the vale of the vole chex repeated what a marvelously evocative name but the foul demonv devavtated it volney said sadly esk lifted his head i smell smoke he said sure enough another little smoker was coming along the path from the west it spied them and let out a hungry puff get on the south path esk snapped chex and volney scrambled for it leaving the eastwest path clear esk stationed himself just south of the intersection and waited as the dragon charged up he murmured no the dragon tried to stop but esk said no again therefore the creatures feet kept going carrying it right on by the intersection in a moment it was out of sight still traveling east very nice chex said first you stopped its attack then you stopped its reversal it had to keep on going by which time it had lost track of what it had been after she understood his effort almost better than he did that iv uvful magic volney agreed i regret i have no vuch talent dont voles have magic esk asked nothing vignificant we merely dig you were about to tell us what happened to the vale of the vole chex said vale of the vole ah yev and a vad vtory it iv volney said sadly he went on to describe how the foul demons who had previously shared the vale almost unnoticed decided to destroy the friendly kissmee river apparently its meandering contours displeased them so they invoked monstrous magic and pulled the river straight no more curves chex asked shocked she was of course a creature of many esthetic curves does it matter esk asked somewhat duller about the esthetics he was a creature of irregular lines and bumps of course it matters chex exclaimed her eyes almost flashing just how friendly do you suppose a straightline river is it iv unfriendly to the land too volney said he explained how the water now coursed directly down the straight channel not pausing to support the fish isolated by its loss of loops and eddies and was leaving many waterloving plants dry the lush vale was becoming a barren valley the lovely moist soil that the voles had dug in was now turning to dry sand and dust and their tunnels were eroding paradise was converting to wasteland indeed the remnant of the waterway was now known as the killmee but cant you dig out new curves for the river to kiss chex asked cant you restore it to its natural state it turned out that the voles could not because the demons maintained guard and harassed anyone who tried to tamper with their inimical design the voles were diggers not fighters and were helpless before the violence of the demons if they could not restore the river they would have to leavebut they knew there was no other region of xanth as good as the vale of the vole had been so volney was now coming to ask the good magician for the answer to their problem how to stop the demons from interfering with the restoration of the kissmee river thats funny esk said chex stared at him i find nothing humorous about the situation she said severely i mean im looking for the good magician to learn how to stop another demon he explained she came to take my hideout because things werent so nice back where she came from if the demons live in the vale of the vole and they have fixed it up to suit themselves why did she have to leave maybe she came from some other area chex said no she mentioned the vale or maybe the kissmee im sure of that i remember it clearly because she but he didnt want to talk about the vale of the vole kisses the demoness had offered him because it hadnt been exactly kisses proffered perhapv vhe iv an unlovely demonew volney said vo the otherv vent her away no shes a lovely creature esk said that is i mean she can assume any form she wants and that includes lusciousi mean sexy uh that is we are getting a notion what that is chex remarked dryly she did vamp you didnt she well she offered butbut ii am trying to get rid of her anyway what would be ugly to a demon who can assume any shape i dont think she would have left for that reason actually she said it was the hummers that drove her away hummingbirds chex asked perplexed no these are something that mortals cant hear but that drive demons crazy so she left so maybe its ironic that they straightened out the river but still arent satisfied hummerv volney repeated musingly we may have heard of them one of us overheard a demon say it was to get rid of them that they straightened the river but we dont know what they are well it seems to me that if you could just find out what they are chex said you might use them to make all the demons move out then you could restore the river and the vale of the vole would be friendly again yev maybe the good magivian will tell uv that they moved on south along the path through the big trees but they had used up time resting and talking and darkness was looming up from the gloom below the forest we had better make a good camp for the night esk said maybe we can set up some stakes to hinder the dragons there was a crack of thunder well need more than that to keep from getting soaked chex said esk squinted at the looming clouds we wont get soaked thats a color hailstorm she looked more carefully why so it is we had better get under cover theres no telling how large those hailstones will be and of course well still get wet when they melt a storm iv bad volney asked it can be bad chex agreed it is best to play safe and find suitable cover but there seems to be little loose wood here to fashion a shelter we may have to lean against the lee side of trees vale of the vole why not go under under what esk asked underground we never vtay up when it iv uncomfortable above in fact we veldom vtay long above anyway i cant go underground chex protested indeed it would take a giant tunnel to get her below but the storm was looming closer and a veil of pastel colors was drawing down they were certainly in for it esk spied a fallen trunk abruptly he strode over to it his ogre strength surging he picked it up and swung it against the trunk of a giant standing tree it splintered he picked up the largest fragment and broke it against the tree then took several of the remaining pieces and wove them together forming a crude platform he jammed the stoutest fragments into the ground vertically then heaved the platform onto them then his strength receded and he was normal again and tired youll have to finish it he gasped thats just the frame that is good enough chex exclaimed she swept up an armful of brush and heaved it onto the platform that should stop the hailstones she said as she gathered more when they melt it will drip though but i can stand getting wet thank you esk meanwhile volney was digging where he had been there was now a mound of dirt and a hole in the ground he was fast all right the storm struck yellow hailstones crashed down through the foliage and bounced on the ground leaving little dents chex got under her shelter she had to duck her head and finally lie down because it wasnt high enough but it did provide protection volneys snout appeared in the hole evk he squeaked here there iv room esk scrambled for the hole as the hailstones bounced around him they were becoming blue now and he knew that those were colder and therefore harder than the yellow ones they would hurt he half slid into the hole it descended for a body length then curved descended some more and curved again hailstones were following him rolling down then it rose and debouched into a larger section he could tell by the widening of the walls but could not see anything in the dark he moved into this and came up against warm fur there iv room for both volney said the stonev and water vtay below this was a nice cozy design the vole had hollowed out a den that was vale of the vole bound to remain dry unless there got to be so much melt that it filled the whole tunnel but suppose a dragon comes he asked then i vtrike the vupport and the tunnel collapvev the vole replied confidently no predator ever caught a vole in a hole and of course the dragons would not be foraging far during the storm esk realized they didnt like getting battered any more than other creatures did that meant that chex should be safe enough too after a brief time the storm passed on esk sought to return to the surface but the tunnel was entirely blocked by hailstones have no convern volney said i will make a new ekvit in moments he did so tunneling down then around and up the excavated dirt piled into one side of the main chamber evidently intended for such storage esk followed the vole amazed by the velocity of the digging how do you do it so fast he asked volney paused in the darkness turning within the tunnel though it was only his own body width in diameter my vilver talonv he explained feel esk felt cautiously and found cold metal it seemed that the vole donned the talons as a man would gauntlets where do you carry such things i never saw them before i have a pouch for nevevvary toolv volney explained then he turned again and resumed his digging esk had to crowd to the left to avoid the dirt flying on the right soon they broke surface a shower of melting hailstones came down they scrambled up through them and stood kneedeep on esk waistdeep on volney in the forming colored slush much had fallen in that brief span chex was under her shelter almost hidden for the stones were mounded above and around it i was worried you would drown down there she called no volney has a really cozy den below esk said he is a truly amazing digger no only average the vole demurred it is merely my volivh nature nevertheless esk was discovering volney to be as interesting and useful a companion as chex this group of travelers was random but seemed about as good as could have been chosen for such a journey they set up a threeway guard roster with esk taking the first watch and chex the last in deference to the amount of time she had spent the vale of the vole prior night esk doubted that any dragons would appear until the slush had subsided but he didnt care to gamble and neither did the others volney disappeared into his hole and chex settled down on a nearby elevation she cleared of slush the shelter was useless for the time being because of the mass of dripping slush on top he walked up and down the path keeping himself alert as long as he could the stars came out and flickered at him through the waving foliage it was pleasant and he was not at all lonely he knew he would have been by himself it was nice making new acquaintances who had a similar mission and dissimilar talents too bad they would soon find the good magicians castle and have to separate when sleep threatened to overtake him despite his efforts he went to the vole hole and called down it volney volney are you ready for your watch there was a subterranean snort as the vole woke ready evk the snout poked into the starlight esk crawled down and around and into the den and curled up hi the warm spot left by the vole the den was rounded in such a way that the earth tended to support a curled body and was really quite comfortable he had hardly completed that realization before he slept when he woke there was a warm body next to him volney was back and esk realized that the vole had finished his shift and turned it over to the centaur he crawled out and discovered it was dawn chex was picking fruits and setting them on the platform no dragons she said briskly as she saw him esk had a call or two of nature to answer he nerved himself to do it hi her presence knowing that the sooner he navigated this social hurdle the better it would be he started to take down his trousers dont do it here she said we dont want the smell in our breakfast oh well he had made the gesture such as it was with relief he retreated to a more distant site and did his business he didnt have to actually do it in her presence he just had to be able to if the need arose they ate and drank some meltwater chex had saved in a pair of cups then volney emerged bringing out some tubers he had found somewhere underground and they traded some of the remaining fruit for these it was surprising how good the tubers were the vole evidently had a fine nose for such things they resumed their walk along the path when they reached the lake volney was taken aback i cant crow that water he protested vale of the vole obviously he couldnt esk wasnt certain whether voles could swim but it hardly mattered the giant monster out there made swimming hazardous if the vole tried to splash around the edge the way chex had he would be half floating because his little legs were too short to achieve good purchase beneath the water the reeds would eat him alive if he tried to tunnel under he would simply encounter muck that filled in as fast as he dug there was no question water was a formidable barrier he looked at chex no it didnt seem feasible for her to carry the vole volney was too big and not constructed for riding also how would he esk get around the lake if she carried someone else i think we should construct a raft chex said there is driftwood at the shore some fairly substantial pieces and if we use vines to bind it together and long poles to move it it should serve a raft volney asked what is thiv its like a boat only clumsier esk said what iv a boat chex looked at esk then back to volrtey your folk arent much for water are they we have great revpect for water the vole protested we drink it we bathe in it we guide it into our burrowv for the nourivhment of root farmv the meandering kivvmee river wav the lifevevvel of our vale his whiskers drooped but now of courve the killmee river poivonv uv but you dont go on it she persisted you dont swim or sail vail a boat is a craft that floats on the surface of the water carrying folk across it a raft does this too a sailboat is propelled by a sheet stretched out against the wind you do not know of these things it voundv like movt intriguing magic she smiled well well try to demonstrate this magic for you so you can tell your folk when you return it should facilitate your use of the river but tell me how do you cross the kissmee we have bridgev over it and tunnelv under it volney explained they were much labor to convtruct but give good vervice unfortunately when the demonv vtraightened it these crowingv were left vtranded by vacant channelv and now are uvelew the volev on the far vide are unable to join thove on the near vide couldnt you make new bridges or tunnels esk asked not while the demonv guard the channel they permit no activity of that nature chex sighed you need the good magicians counsel certainly well vale of the vole lets get to it we must gather as much wood as we can as large and dry as we can and tie it together we should be able to fashion a raft large enough to support us all you wivh dry wood volney asked will it not get wet when it touchev the water dry so that it isnt waterlogged and will float better she found a piece and picked it up we can make a pile here beside the path now at lavt i comprehend volney said he set off in search of wood there was more driftwood and fallen wood in the vicinity than had been at first apparent and before long they had a huge pile they found strong vines some of which they used to make a harness so that chex could haul the largest pieces then they used that vine to tie the wood together by noon they had a large ungainly structure that most resembled a pile of refuse but when they heaved it into the water and shoved it to the deep region it floated they climbed aboard with esk and chex wielding long poles and by dint of pushing at the nether muck caused it to travel out toward the center of the lake an island volney exclaimed a floating island so it seems chex agreed shouldnt that be ivland esk asked both stared at him whatever for chex inquired uh no reason he said embarrassed what could he have been thinking of the monster of the lake coursed close go fry in the sun chex called to it impolitely you cant get near us the monster irritated charged the raft its bulk loomed huge but chex simply poked at one of its eyestalks with her pole and it retreated bullies have no courage when they face anything as large as they are she remarked with satisfaction oooooo volney moaned whats the matter esk asked that monster cant touch us i feel ill the vole said indeed his fur seemed to be developing a greenish tinge youre seasick chex said here i have a pill for that she produced a green tablet from her knapsack volney swallowed the pill in a moment his fur turned gray again much better he said i dont like being veavick they continued poling and made steady slow progress across the lake they paused midway for a lunch break chex had thoughtfully vale of the vole harvested some fruit and put it aboard then they completed the voyage bumping up against the far shore they splashed to land and hauled the raft as high as they could so that it would not drift away they knew that they might need it again they resumed travel along the path heading for the mountain but the building of the raft and the voyage across the lake had taken much time and strength and they decided to spend another night on the road before tackling the mountain they were now becoming seasoned travelers and no storm approached so they had no significant problems this time chapter mystery hey arrived at the mountain it loomed as massively as before with its deep dark tunnel through chex shuddered i dislike confessing this but i am slightly claustrophobic i dont think i can walk that passage even if it is guaranteed safe im afraid the mountain will collapse on me volney sniffed at the rising bank but there iv no mountain he protested you cant see the mountain esk asked surprised i vee it but it ivnt there youre not making sense i will vhow you the vole moved forward into the bankliterally his body disappeared into it what esk and chex said together volneys snout poked out of the slope it iv illuvion he explained illusion chex exclaimed she reached out with one hand and the hand passed into the apparent substance of the mountain why so it isl we never touched it esk said chagrined we just assumed it was real that explains why it wasnt on my dams map what type of map volney asked confused an evil one never mind i just knew there wasnt supposed to be a mountain here and there wasnt what a relief does this mean we can walk right through it esk asked evidently so chex said walking into it for a moment her equine forepart was hidden while her human upper portion remained in view and disconnected her equine rump then the rest of her disappeared and the shaggy slope of the mountain was unbroken esk reached out to touch the visible surface his hand encountered nothing it vanished in the rock vale of the vole this was one persistent illusion they knew it for what it was yet it remained as clearly as before but its dark in here chexs voice came darknevv divturbv you volney asked i have no problem with it suppose theres a wall or something she demanded im not worried about a mountain of illusion falling on me but i dont want to bang my face i can lead you volney said volev never go bump in the night they set up a column with volney leading and esk at the rear they marched along the approximate route of the path but it didnt matter since there was no mountain at times esk saw the light that shone down the tunnel and highlighted the contour of the rock with chexs body passing in and out of it the effect remained eerie but as they penetrated more deeply the light diminished until all was dark vtop volney exclaimed abruptly there iv a chavm a chasm chex echoed can we go around i will ekvplore they waited while the vole moved along first to one side then the other no it crowev the full region youre sure its not an illusion esk asked half facetiously quite vure i cannot tell how deep or wide it iv but it iv definitely prevent perhaps i can fathom it chex said i can explore it with my staff there was the sound of the staff tapping it is too deep i cant find the bottom then but i can find the far side it is not too far i could hurdle it i cannot jump volney said but i could tunnel under it if there iv rock below maybe thats best chex agreed there was the sound of rapid digging then there was the noise of splashing oopv i cannot tunnel through water well we got you across the lake she said we should be able to get you across the chasm after all its not exactly of the scope of the gap chasm cant tell esk said the gap chasm has extensions that jag a long way north and south this could be one of those you are not much help she said maybe we could help him cross esk said we have our staffs if we made a temporary bridge no they arent long enough i touched the far side only at full extension well if we tied them together vale of the vole they would bend in the middle and then the ends would slide off but if we stood on either side and held on to them she considered perhaps but we would have to be very sure of our hold you truvted me to lead you volney said i will truvt you to hold me they used the length of vine chex had thoughtfully saved to bind the ends of the two staffs together as securely as was feasible then she made a leap in the dark and landed on the far side of the chasm then esk poked the lengthened pole across and she caught hold of it now volney donned his gripping talonsit seemed he had several sets for different applicationsand took hold of the staff he was not as he had said before a climber but he could cling to a small root and this was similar in diameter he moved carefully out over the chasm while esk clung tightly to the end the pole sagged for the voles weight was formidable then an end slid toward the brink as the staffs formed a v in the center esk now regretted his notion he was afraid that something would break and volney would be dumped into the dark depth fortunately he felt his ogre strength coming into play he would not let volney fall then the pull changed esks staff angled further toward the horizontal the voles weight was now on chexs staff i tire volneys voice came i cannot climb esk let go your end chex called but im going to haul him up let go hoping he was doing the right thing esk let go his staff immediately slid over the brink and clattered down but now there was the sound of motion chex was using her centaur strength to pull her pole up the vole along with it there was a rasping and a clatter how was it going then volneys voice came i am here it was from esks level the vole had reached the far side im glad chex gasped by the sound of it she had been tiring too her human arms were weak compared to her equine legs the rest was routine chex made sure volney was all right then leaped back across the chasm esk got on her back and she made one more leap carrying him across then they proceeded on through the mountain and finally emerged into daylight on the south side esk knew that his relief was no greater than that of his companions vale of the vole before them stood the castle it had a moat and a solid outer wall the drawbridge was down and on it was a big empty cage they stopped just before the moat the good magicians castle is always beset by challenges chex said that is because the magician doesnt want to be bothered by querents who arent serious but i dont see what kind of a challenge an empty cage would be ive heard that the challenges are always slanted toward the visitors esk said does an empty cage mean something to one of us they exchanged glances none of them had a notion i suppose we could just go on in chex said but i distrust this it is never supposed to be easy to get in and if it seems so then that must be a false impression i would much rather understand the situation before committing myself esk could only agree but how are we to understand it if we dont go farther oh we should be able to reason it out to some degree she said the intellect is always superior to blind action thats not the ogre view esk said we have uved vome intellect and vome acvion volney said if one doev not work now we can try the other but i find it odd that we have encountered vo many challengev on the way to the cavtle and none now that were here that is strange esk agreed its almost as if the challenges were in the wrong place or were they chex asked her wings flapping in her excitement could that be the way the good magician planned it but arent they supposed to be at the castle we assumed so but how do we know the good magician makes his own rules he could have put the challenges anywhere along the route but if they are slanted for particular visitors how would the right ones be there for the right visitors there are three of us but her excellent centaur mind was operating now i think he knew we were coming and from which directions we were coming so he could have set things up for each of us that the others wouldnt encounter but he didnt esk pointed out we all encountered the little dragons she looked at the cage lookthere are dragon droppings in there and the bars are soiled with soot those little smokers were in there but they got out they were let out volney said that cage hav a clavp only a human paw could operate mine couldnt vale of the vole why would they be let out before they were used esk asked chex shook her head i dont have the answer to that but lets see if we can work it out we three arrived together and we helped each other get here does that seem usual no esk said i thought it was supposed to be one at a time well lets pattern it if things hadnt gone wrong who would have come here first you would you overshot the intersection otherwise you would have arrived first and then me and finally volney so it seems reasonable that the good magician was setting up for me first now what would have been good challenges for me the mountain esk exclaimed youre claustrophobic so you were afraid to go into the tunnel until you realized that it was all illusion and that could have been my first challenge she said to figure out the nature of the mountain as i certainly should have done because of my dams map but i failed that challenge and turned back then i failed it too because i was with you but if you had come alone you would have gone on through the tunnel because you arent claustrophobic she said so it wasnt a challenge for you it didnt matter whether you caught onto its nature but that chasm insidethat would have stopped me if i didnt fall into it whereas i had no trouble with that she said excitedly so maybe those were two challenges one for each of us set up together because we were likely to arrive so close together that there wasnt time to set up complete alternates it is making sense the lake volney said i could not crow the water that wav my challenge and the chavm too becauve there was more water below it ekvending down and down yes because we were with you we got you across just as you got us through the mountain we helped each other past each others challenges i doubt we were supposed to but what about the little smokers esk asked we did not release them she contemplated the open cage i think that collection of dragons would have been a formidable challenge for any of us how could we have gotten by that i might have esk said i could have climbed over the cage and said no to any that tried to grab me through the bars true so that wasnt your challenge after all but it would have been much more difficult for me or for volney because we dont climb just vale of the vole hanging onto our staffs across the chasm was all he could do i suppose i might have tied a line to the cage and hauled it out of the way but he i fear i would have had to turn back the vole said unlew i had thought of your idea to uve a raft then uved the branchev to fill hi the chavm vo i could crow that too but as it happened someone released those dragons and we encountered several along the paths she said we really must fathom that mystery before we can make sense of the larger picture obviously something is wrong esk said those smokers werent meant to be loose they were meant to be caged and only get loose if the challengee messed up someone cut off the challenge before it started so it seems she agreed would the good magician himself have done it i dont see why if he didnt want the dragons here he would not have brought them the gorgon then she wouldnt mess up what he set up i agree she said could someone else have done it it doesnt seem likely so we are left with the inexplicable she concluded perhaps now it is time to enter the castle expecting the unexpected esk nodded consent nervously volney did not look any more comfortable they stepped on the drawbridge they hauled the empty cage off then crossed on over suddenly an ogre loomed up before them the thing was monstrous and hairy and ugly and both chex and volney retreated in alarm but esks reaction was opposite grandpa he exclaimed but it was not crunch ogre it was some other male not quite as ugly but still quite formidable it blocked their way were only coming to talk to the good magician esk said strongly suspecting that this would not provoke any reasonable response will you let us by he was correct the ogre oped his ponderous and marbled maw and made a bellow of rage that shook the castle how was he to get past with his companions esk realized that this was a challenge and it was his to meet and solve but almost nothing could make an ogre stand aside he was in a position to know that nothing except except another ogre there was the key wale of the vole but esk could not invoke his ogre self just because he wanted to it came of its own accord when triggered by erratic circumstances still sometimes it was possible to arrange the trigger it was risky but so was standing before an ogre as if ready to be eaten wish me luck esk muttered back to the others then he strode forward directly into the ogre for a moment the ogre was startled by this temerity then it grabbed for him with a ham hand esk saw that meat hook coming and his ogre nature reacted suddenly he roared his ogre strength surging go way me say he bellowed and bit at the others paw the other reacted astonishingly it shrank away literally as it retreated it became smaller until it looked very much like a man and esk towered over it but esk his ogre dander up wasnt satisfied he smashed at it with his own ham fist something shattered fragments of glass flew out and the other ogre was gone esk stood before a mansized frame from which jags of glass projected it was a mirror chex exclaimed except esks ogre nature left him as he returned to the human condition his intelligence increased and he understood a reverse mirror he said it showed only the other side of methe side that i wasnt so when i was a man it was my ogre self and when i turned ogre it turned human only i was ogrishly stupid and aggressive and broke it when i didnt have to chex approached i dont think it was just a mirror she said volney and i saw it too and it looked and sounded like a real ogre your state may have governed it but it was real enough in its fashion like the illusion of the mountain it was enough to do the job if you hadnt cowed it esk shrugged maybe so certainly it was my challenge not anybody elses this one wasnt let out early it wasnt alive she pointed out the inanimate challenges remain in place only the dragons are loose and maybe whatever other animals were supposed to be used it wasnt alive so it didnt leave he agreed understanding so we still dont know whether anyone is in charge of the challenges i dont like this neither do i she said unlew thiv iv the challenge volney suggested vale of the vole chex paused thoughtfully this mystery this is the true challenge meant for all three of us to solve together i do not know i only guew the vole said it is a most interesting conjecture she said we knew to expect the unexpected and thats about as unexpected as anything could be it seems reasonable to conjecture that a more sophisticated challenge would be required to handle three dissimilar querents simultaneously but why should there be three at once esk asked we would have come separately if we hadnt met on the paths true it does seem largely coincidental she quivered her wings pondering is it possible that our missions are linked that we did not arrive coincidentally but that the three of us are destined to cooperate in some greater endeavor so that a single answer will serve us all but you knew nothing of the kiwmee river volney protested yet esk did encounter the sultry demoness from that region chex pointed out so his mission may have a common motivation with yours i confess however that my own mission does not seem to connect i think this is too speculative to be taken as fact at least at this stage maybe the good magician will tell us soon esk said maybe she agreed but she seemed dubious they proceeded on into the castle proper it was silent no more challenges manifested halooo esk called anybody home there was no answer they passed into the residential section of the castle this should be beyond the region for challenges ordinarily but no one met them maybe they stepped out for a bite to eat esk suggested facetiously but the humor if any existed fell flat they walked through chamber after chamber all were cluttered with artifacts of magic and household existence none had living folk in the kitchen was a table with a petrified cheese salad in the process of composition evidently the gorgon had been making it when she abruptly departed the greens were hardly wilted she could not have left more than a day before in a bedroom were toys and bins of assorted fruits evidently the work of the magicians son hugo who chex had heard could conjure fruits but no sign of the boy upstairs in a crowded cubby of a study was a high stool by a table with a huge open book the magicians book of answers over which he was said to pore constantly but no sign of the magician himself there was even a marker showing the particular bit of information he had been contemplating it seemed to relate to vale of the vole the aerodynamic properties of the third left central tail feather of the midget roc bird i didnt know there was a midget roc bird esk remarked youre not the good magician chex reminded him obviouvly he was juvt finding hiv plave volney said he wav about to revearch the propertiev of ventaur wingv chex and esk stared at him that must be right esk said to answer your question chex looked stricken but why did he go then i need that answer that veemv to be our challenge to divcover it was the same situation throughout the castle everywhere there were evidences of recent and normal activity but nowhere did any person or creature remain all servants if there had been any had departed all creatures had been released in the same manner as the little smokers at the moat indeed they now realized that the moat itself was empty the moat monsters were gone that was almost unheard of for a castle yet there was no sign of violence it was as if the good magician and his family had simply stepped out for a momentand not returned what could account for this one region remained to be checked the dungeon that was said to be the region of major activity for some castles could they have gone down to check something there and somehow gotten trapped below but the stair down was not blocked and no door was locked it could not have been any simple entrapment if something happened down there chex said nervously it could remain dangerous if for example he had a demon there that sent a chill down esks back a demon could account for it he agreed some of them are just nuisances like the one i encountered but i understand that some are truly terrible if he meant to keep it confined but it got out then it could have rampaged through the castle and smashed everything and everyone in it chex finished exvept there wav no rampage volney pointed out no vign of violenve not all demons are violent chex said some are merely mischievous they assume other forms and tempt mortal folk into trouble if the demon became a damsel in distress right outside the castle they all might have hurried out to help and the good magician should never have been fooled by a demon esk protested hes the magician of information he knows everything vale of the vole she sighed i agree its a weak hypothesis lets gird ourselves and see whats down there they descended the stone stair there was no sign of disturbance on the nether level either and no sign of anything intended to confine a demon small vials crowded the shelves of storage chambers all of them carefully stoppered any severe activity should have shaken some vials so that they fell to the floor this level was the same as the others normal for its nature except for one small chamber behind a closed door chex peered through the tiny barred window activity she murmured tersely esk felt that cold shiver again what is it it seems to be aan experiment of some sort she said its hard to make it out properly theres a container on a hearth and its boiling and the vapors are overflowing across the floor he must have been cooking up a potion esk said and forgot to turn it off when he left then we had better turn it off she said there is no sense letting it boil away to nothing volney sniffed the air beware he said that vmellv like when he did not continue chex prompted him like what what the vole asked in return what does it smell like what doev what vmell like that potion she said impatiently povion the one you just smelled she said how could you have forgotten it already iforget volney said seeming confused what am i doing here what are you she repeated indignantly volney this is no time for games for what suddenly esk caught on an amnesia ambrosia he exclaimed volneys nose is more sensitive than ours and hes closer to the floor those fumes must be spreading out and leaking under the door so he got the first dose amnesia she cried alarmed we must get away from here come on volney esk said we are going back upstairs where the vole asked up up to get out of the fumes before they get us all the vole balked who are you he asked hes forgetting everything chex said weve got to get him out vale of the vole were friends esk said we must talkupstairs come with us the vole hesitated but remembered nothing contrary so followed them up they slammed every door behind them and wedged strips of cloth from the sewing room under the last to halt the creep of the vapor now i think we know what happened to the magician and his family chex said that concoction got out of hand and they forgot what they were doing but the magician was upstairs esk said those vapors sink how could they have reached him there they havent even left the dungeon yet and would have been less extensive a day ago she nodded true true i was thinking carelessly those fumes are a consequence of his departure not a cause probably but we had better turn that pot off they were agreed on that but how were they to do it maybe theres a counterpotion esk said something we can mix up and pour into the dungeon that will neutralize it the book of answers might list it they hurried up and checked the book what would it be listed under esk asked turning the ancient pages m for memory perhaps chex said he found the ms magic he read what a lot there is on that subject he turned more pages ah here memory but he frowned as he tried to read the detail i cant understand this its so technical technical chex asked yes what does mnemonic enhancement enchantment mean she pursed her lips its technical all right she agreed probably only the good magician can interpret it thats why he is the magician we dont have time he said we need something we can understand right now we need a sudden bright idea she agreed i know little about magic volney said evidently recovering from his whiff of amnesia but ivnt there a kind of wood that changev the magic polev magic poles esk asked blankly vo that whatever it iv it iv not and vive verva whatever it is it is not chex said piecing it out and vice versa esk concluded i dont know i think itv called reverve wood reverse wood esk and chex exclaimed together thats it one or the other added they hurried downstairs checking shelves found it esk called as vale of the vole he opened a kitchen cupboard the gorgon must have used it for cooking so that everything she looked at wouldnt be stoned he fetched down the chip of wood but are you sure its the right kind chex asked we can test it he said come toward me if it reverses my magic i understand she strode toward him he held up the chip no he said as she drew close she leaped at him suddenly her rather soft front was pinning him against the wall oops she said backing off i didnt mean to do that i told you no on your advance he gasped but you accelerated it so it is reverse wood she said i hope its enough he looked at the chip thinking of the chamberful of amnesia fumes below it will have to be she said firmly they took it down to the sealed door unsealed the door and hesitated we need to get it in the pot i think she said but if we get close well forget not vo volney said who holdv the wood will reverse the amnesia esk exclaimed ill do it he hurried down the steps holding the chip ahead of him when he reached the bottom he strode to the closed chamber wrenched open the door waded through the pooling vapors and dumped the chip of wood in the boiling pot the effect was dramatic not only did the amnesia reverse as he could tell by his abruptly sharpened memory the pot halted its boiling and froze he returned to the residential floor mission accomplished he announced except that we still dont know what happened to the good magician chex reminded him so we still dont have the answers we came for maybe a magic mirror can tell us where he went esk suggested they located a mirror but as they approached it flickered castle roogna calling magician hurnfrey it said come in humfrey over hes not here esk said to the mirror castle roogna calling magician humfrey it repeated come in humfrey over how do i turn this thing on to answer esk asked the mirror formed an eye and eyed him you cant ogresnoot it vale of the vole said i respond only to authorized personnel tell the good magician to get his dinky posterior down here and answer the king but the good magicians not here chex exclaimed i didnt ask for excuses nymphnoodle the mirror retorted just get him here listen glassface esk said raising a fist uhuh mundanebrain it said im worth a lot more than you are its a capital offense to break a mirror just put the king through to us and well tell him whats happening here chex said angrily sorry you dont have proper clearance ponytail and the mirror went blank i can see why mirrors get broken esk muttered its just the perversity of the inanimate chex said i greatly fear well just have to go on to castle roogna ourselves and tell them what we have found here and see what they can do about it cavtle roogna volney asked it may be the only way we can make any progress toward the solutions to our problems she said so indeed it seemed chapter ivy hey spent the night in the magicians castle and headed out for castle roogna in the morning they brought along a ladder they found in a storage shed chex hauled it along by holding one end under an arm and resting the other end on her rump the ladder interfered somewhat with her tail so that the biting flies were more of a nuisance than usual but the distance was not far they forged into the mountain of illusion volney leading the way when he announced the chasm chex unshipped the ladder and pushed it out over the void then she secured one end while esk walked across it on hands and feet at the other end he sat and held it while volney crossed finally they hauled the ladder the rest of the way across and chex made a running leap and hurdled the chasm as before the whole business was accomplished much more swiftly and comfortably than their prior crossing they walked on out the north side and resumed the path you know i wonder how those little smokers got across esk remarked could they hurdle that distance theyre pretty active chex said i suspect they could perhaps they charged forward blindly and some made it while some did not we dont know how many were in that cage he nodded her surmise seemed reasonable enough perhaps they had been lucky that only a fraction of the dragons had surmounted the hurdle then they came to the lake and how did they cross this esk asked do dragons swim and if they do does the water monster let them pass chex glanced at the open water where the monster waited then at the side where the carnivorous reeds waited they must have had some other way volney sniffed the end of the path at the waterline if the mountain vale of the vole wav illuvion could thiv be illuvion too he asked or could it be another avpect another aspect of illusion chex asked puzzled the vole walked out across the water esk and chex stared its real esk cried chex slapped her own flank resoundingly a oneway causeway she exclaimed i think not volney said but they were already racing for the path both stepped on itand both sank through it and into the muck yet volney remained above the water how esk demanded somewhat miffed i keep my eyev cloved the vole explained eyes closed chex asked blankly as she hauled herself out if what we vee iv not volid volney said then vometimev what we do not vee iv volid what we do not see is solid esk repeated thoughtfully chex nodded another reversal the good magician seems very fond of that sort of thing very fond esk agreed in no better mood than she had they realized this before they could have saved themselves an enormous amount of difficulty but if the lake monster should encroach she said it iv an enchanted path iv it not the vole asked proceeding forward she nodded trueit should be secure the dragons were on it because they were travelers the good magician let them go home early for a reason we do not yet grasp other monsters should still be barredand indeed we have encountered no others on it so the water monster should be barred she shivered yet i begin to feel claustrophobic again i am by no means eager to trust myself on that path blindly though i hardly relish the mucky trip around the lake esk pondered suppose you earned me as you did beforeand i kept my eyes open would the path become illusory because of me or remain solid because of you she smiled lets find out i wouldnt do this with just anyone but i trust you esk esk found himself flustered by the compliment centaurs were notoriously distrustful of the judgment of others chex closed her eyes while esk mounted then he directed her toward the path straight aheadno slightly to your right he said vale of the vole thats too clumsy she said just gesture with your knees my knees press with the one on the side you wish me to turn from thats much more efficient oh he tried it and sure enough she moved quickly in response in a moment he was directing her wordlessly he guided her onto the path and the path held it was indeed the walkers vision that determined it as long as she kept her eyes closed her footing was firm when she drifted toward one side or the other he kneed her gently and she moved immediately back to the center the lake monster eyed them but did not approach the path was indeed enchanted the trip across was surprisingly easy well chex said as they arrived at the far side that is indeed a relief esk dismounted and they walked on along the path their spirits restored perhaps at castle roogna they would discover the answer to the good magicians strange disappearance but as they drew closer to the castle chex became increasingly nervous is something wrong esk finally inquired she sighed im not sure it is a personal matter oh not my business then perhaps it is your business because it may affect your reception and volneys the voles little ears perked up there iv trouble at roogna in a way i shall have to rehearse some history to make it clear esk shrugged well listen he was more curious than he cared to admit what could bother a creature who was completely open about natural functions i am as you have noted a crossbreed she said so am i esk reminded her we might even have a common human ancestor somewhere way back she smiled briefly we might but the centaur species whatever its origin considers itself a pure stock and does not look kindly on adulteration oho so they may not like you much some may not she agreed wanly unfortunately the ones who may look least kindly on my mixed ancestry are my grandsire and grandam on the centaur side your grandparents dont know esk asked surprised my dam chem centaur did not find a mate of her own species centaurs are not common beyond centaur isle so this problem can arise vale of the vole sheassociated with a hippogryph this is why i have wings but because she was aware that such a liaison might not be approved she did not inform her sire and dam of the matter only her brother chet with whom she was closer thus to the indiscretion of the liaison was added that of deceiving her sire and dam such things are not necessarily light matters with centaurs but it really was her own business wasnt it esk asked i mean she wasnt under any obligation to report to her parents was she that was chems conclusion chex agreed it is possible that other centaurs might disagree and yourgrandparentsare at castle roogna esk concluded getting the picture i believe that they are and when they see you with your wings i am uncertain of the nature of their reaction maybe you can wait in the forest while volney and i go on in she sighed no thank you esk i believe it is time to face the melody if that is the way you want it i believe it is the way it must be i do not like deception and to the extent that my very existence represents a deception i owe it to myself to eliminate it i suppose that makes sense esk said centaurs were known to have an impervious sense of ethics which had both advantages and disadvantages for others who dealt with them they moved well encountering no more dragons it seemed that the little smokers had finally gotten wherever they were going and left the path as night approached they judged that they were near castle roogna they set up an overnight watch system as before not quite trusting the safety of the path nothing happened and in the morning they feasted on fruits and tubers and resumed walking there was the sound of hooves ahead thats a centaur chex exclaimed oh im nervous esk could understand her feeling he was nervous too but for a diflferent reason he had never been to castle roogna and wasnt certain how the king would feel about a humanogre crossbreed of course he was only bringing a message at this point about the absence of the good magician still he worried volney vole did not look any more comfortable they drew to the sides of the path so as to let the centaur pass if it had vale of the vole a mind to but now volney was sniffing the lowlying air nervously ventaurand dragon he announced chex immediately unslung her bow and nocked an arrow and esk moved to stand before the vole so that he could say no if the dragon attacked and human volney added a party of threecentaur dragon and human how strange then he realized that their own party of centaur vole and human was equivalently strange the centaur came into sight it was a stout male with a little girl on his back a truly formidable dragon whomped along behind esks nervousness increased this could be a great deal of trouble uncle chet chex exclaimed delighted the centaur slowed startled graywing he exclaimed he calls me that she murmured flushing slightly with pleasure he doesnt mind my who the little girl asked as chet stopped before them and the dragon whomped to a halt behind puffing steam ill introduce ours and you introduce yours chet said briskly i am chet centaur foaled of chester and cherie centaur this is ivy human daughter of king dor and queen irene and beyond is stanley steamer formerly known as the gap dragon esk almost swallowed his tongue the daughter of the king and the gap dragon but chex was doing her side of the introduction i am chex centaur filly of chem centaur and xap hippogryph this is esk human son of smash ogre and tandy nymph and this is volney vole from the kissmee river valley otherwise known as the vale of the vole the kissmee river ivy exclaimed excitedly id love to visit that she seemed to be ten or eleven years old pretty in an elfin way with very little green hair and eyes to match is it really true that anyone who touches its waters gets so affectionate she just has to kiss the first person she meets not anymore volney said grimly it hav been ruined by the demonv now it iv called the killmee river and anyone who touchev it feelv like killing hiv neighbor say volney do you have trouble with your ivy started we three met on the way to the good magicians castle chex explained quickly we all have questions but the magician wasnt there so why we were just on our way to see magician humfrey ourselves vale of the vole chet said he hasnt been answering his mirror so we decided to go and see if there was any problem perhaps we should find a place to settle more comfortably so we can compare notes chex said we seem to have much to discuss evidently so cute niece chet said he eyed her up and down you have filled out nicely since i saw you last ive been exercising to develop my pectoral muscles but it hasnt enabled me to fly i can fix that ivy exclaimed let me ride you instead of chet and wait ivy the male centaur said first lets get to a better place as she suggested then we can discuss everything and try everything without blocking traffic traffic esk almost laughed there was no other traffic on this path tanglemans close by ivy said he has a nice glade who chex asked tangleman hes a tangle tree a tangle tree but dont worry the child continued brightly hes reformed since grandpa trent turned him into a jolly green giant they made their way to tanglemans grove they had to cut through the jungle but the dragon whomped ahead any potential predators vacated the region in a hurry the two centaurs walked side by side and esk and volney brought up the rear tanglemans glade was indeed nice maintained as only the tangle trees knew how tangleman himself was a huge green man with writhing tentacles for hair and barklike clothing he looked formidable indeed but grinned broadly when he saw ivy and her party obviously they had maintained cordial relations for years there was another round of introductions then stanley and tangleman settled down to a game of dumpings and dragons which looked more like a battle than a friendly contest but since ivy wasnt concerned the others werent they compared notes and details so nobody remains in the good magicians castle chet said perplexed we wondered when we couldnt get through but sometimes those mirrors get perverse so we decided to check ivy likes to visit hugo and the gorgon anyway and stanley has a thing with the moat monster so the moat monsters gone too chet said all the creatures have been released that is very strange chet said the good magician can be taci vsale of the vole turn but he takes good care of his environs and he almost never lets a creature go before its term of service is done its as though they have moved out permanently yesbut on very short notice she said things were interrupted in progress we shall have to tell king dor of this chet said but it will have to wait a few days because he and queen irene are away on business up at the water wing we were going to take a few days for the trip but there doesnt seem to be much point now dont you want to verify what we have told you esk asked verify a centaurs report whatever for chex smiled he has not had much contact with centaurs uncle oh chet turned to esk a centaurs accuracy of observation is perfect and a centaurs word is inviolate it would be a waste of time to recheck my nieces findings they represent the same information i would obtain oh then i guess we can go on to castle roogna esk said out of sorts he had known about centaur accuracy but as usual hadnt been thinking clearly sometimes he regretted his ogreish descent that too is pointless until the king returns he said you mean we should just wait here esk asked of course not chet said that would be wasting time then chex laughed we shall simply have to find something else to do for a few days she said lets figure out where magician humfrey is ivy said brightly then we can tell my father where to find him you have a map that locates lost magicians chet inquired wryly well no not exactly but i know who does chem she has maps for everything my dam chex exclaimed i havent seen her in a year and my sibling chet said it has been longer than that for me she doesnt come around castle roogna often now because of me chex said casting down her gaze because our dam is just a bit conservative chet said i believe it is time to face that issue directly that was my conclusion chex said of course that gives us two reasons to go to see chem but we need three three ivy asked centaurs need three reasons for doing things esk told her he felt a vale of the vole mild and foolish gratification at this chance to show that he did know a bit about the breed the child considered thats right id forgotten we were going to magician humfreys castle because he didnt answer his mirror and i wanted to share another punwheel cookie with the gorgon and stanley wanted to wrestle the moat monster three reasons now we know humfreys gone so we dont have three reasons anymore where iv the mapmaking centaur volney asked oh shes doing a detail map of the gap chasm chet said it is very convoluted stanley needs to see the gap chasm ivy exclaimed hes going to take it over again any year now so he needs to keep updated chet nodded that is true and thats three she cried jubilantly cause chems at the gap chasm she does have a point uncle chex said smiling we need a map and to fetch my dam and to take the dragon to the gap chasm so it seems he agreed and we can learn all bout each other on the way ivy said oh this is fun never become temporary guardian for a little sorceress chet said with resignation and now let me see if i can make chex fly ivy continued with unabated enthusiasm she ran to chex lift me up chex bemused assisted the little girl in mounting now flap your wings ivy directed real hard really hard chet and chex said together oh pooh you centaurs are all alike just do it chex spread her wings and flapped them there was indeed muscle on her chest esk tried not to stare at the way her breasts rippled as she made the effort thats it ivy cried harder chex flapped harderand an expression of surprise crossed her face i have more lifting power she said sure you do cause thats my talent enhancement now take off it almost seemed that it was going to happen chexs front legs lifted from the ground but no matter how hard she flapped she could not get the rest of her body up she remained standing on her hind legs thats enough she gasped dropping back down im winded awww ivy said disappointed maybe you need to exercise some more vale of the vole perhaps i do chex agreed flushed with her effort but for the first time i came close it was a wonderful feeling it does seem odd that you should have functioning wings that dont quite do the job chet said perhaps they require magic enhancement i thought the good magician would know chex said sure he does ivy said surely chet and chex said together ivy didnt even bother to say pooh she jumped down and skipped off to the gaming monsters time to get moving boys she cried wading into the melee were going to the gap that got stanleys attention immediately the engagement broke up and the two lined up for the trip the party proceeded north again cutting its own trail once a sleeping flying dragon woke belching fire tangleman leaned over it and opened his mouth the dragon gazed at the huge wooden teeth and scooted away another time a small tangle treeone in the vegetative state menaced them as they passed stanley reared up and puffed steam at it and the tree quickly wilted back i could get to like this sort of travel esk mumured yeah its real fun with them ivy said yes its really both centaurs called ivy stuck out her tongue esk buried a smile he liked the little girl even if she was a princess by nightfall they were near the gap they camped by a spring and posted no guards they needed none in the present company esk noted with private satisfaction that ivy was just as secretive as he was about natural functions the centaur way was not the only way in fact ivy was a fine antidote to the centaur attitudes in the morning they reached the gap it was a monstrous crevice whose faces descended clifflike to a narrow base far far below esk felt dizzy just peering into it we shall have to travel along it until we find a way down chet said that may require some time there are bridges across it but my sibling should be down inside it volney sniffed the ground no need to vearch he said the old vole holev remain a large one will take uv down voles are very good with tunnels esk explained to the others as volney moved along but hes going away from the chasm ivy protested vale of the vole then volney found what he was sniffing for the cavelike entrance to a large tunnel you may wivh light he said as he plunged on in i saw some lightning rods close by ivy said she dashed off to pick them they glowed more brightly as she held them enhanced by her magic soon everyone who wanted one had a glowing rod even tangleman they trooped down after the vole the tunnel was long and dank and branched many times but they followed volney with confidence and eventually came out at the base of the gap the vole hole had saved them a good deal of trouble now to find chem chet said stay with us stanley we dont want stella to find us and take us for prey stacey ivy said smugly what her name is stacey steamer ivy said but shes listed as stella but i named her same as i named stanley i cant help it if the ass who made the lexicon got it wrong the ass didnt get it wrong he listed both chex said theres an ambiguity thats all but when im here my name is right ivy said chet shrugged unable to refute that again the little princess had gotten the best of the centaur esk enjoyed that privately again volneys nose simplified things they went that way movt revently he announced pointing west they traveled west and in due course came upon stacey and chem they were exploring an offshoot of the chasm one with jagged walls angling upward chem was projecting an image of it and comparing the details to the real one so as to match them perfectly she was a lovely brownmaned browneyed creature with a family resemblance to chex chex embraced her dam my how youve grown dear chem exclaimed i exercised but whatever brings you here i thought you were trying to learn how to fly thats why i finally went to the good magician she proceeded to that story and to their need for a suitable map but i cannot show the magician on a map chem protested i dont know where he is we thought you might be able to show a detailed map of where he might be chex explained vale of the vole i suppose i could do that certainly i can detail any of the geography of that region for anyone who wishes to search for him so chem reluctantly agreed to accompany them back to castle roogna her sibling and her filly understood her reticence she had no more desire to brace her sire and dam on the matter of mixedbreed offspring than did chex but they all agreed that the time had come to do it stanley decided to stay in the gap awhile and visit with stacey ivy pouted but yielded to necessity she could not keep the gap dragon out of the gap forever they were now near one of the enchanted crossings so would need no protection once they got to the upper level there was no vole hole in this particular section but chem had mapped it and knew a good way out it was along a side crevice on the north slope they trooped up the jagged v of it following only the branches chem indicated and made their way through the puzzlelike labyrinth to the surface then they took the invisible bridge across which was a novel experience for esk he peered down beyond his seemingly unsupported feet and felt dizzy after that he followed volneys example and closed his eyes tangleman departed for his glade leaving just the three centaurs two human beings and one vole they camped for the night and when it rained they moved under a large umbrella tree volney didnt need it of course he simply dug one of his cozy burrows ivy insisted on spending the night there to esks annoyance until chem projected a map of this region that showed where a good pillow bush grew then esk gathered a fine pile of pillows and settled down in comfort they did not hurry in the morning centaurs were creatures of integrity but somehow none of these three found reason to rush on to the castle actually there was no reason king dor and queen irene were not due to return for another day chester and cherie were supervising the grounds during the royal absence as it happened and keeping an eye on ivys little brother prince dolph that chet remarked was challenge enough for little dolph could change form instantly to anything and tended to become a mouse and sneak out when he was supposed to be studying boring xanth history but being the centaurs they were they did not dawdle unduly either thus at midday they arrived at castle roogna esk was impressed he had seen the good magicians castle so knew the general nature of such structures but this was on a grander scale its walls towered above the moat and the moat had not one but several monstrous monsters the grounds were girt about with an orchard con vale of the vole taming every kind of exotic tree and beyond were more aggressive trees that were able to move their branches to block unwanted trespassers to one side was the zombie graveyard whose occupants would rise up in all their sodden horror when required in defense of the estate there were even chet assured him several ghosts in the castle though these were relatively harmless merely waiting for their stories to be told a tiny manshape stood at the drawbridge a horse rear with wings the figure exclaimed wait till the caretakers see that go tell them grundy ivy cried happily she was not aware of the gravity of the situation the golem ran swiftly into the castle in a moment a pair of older centaurs appeared male and female they spied chex together great the male exclaimed appallingi the female breathed sire dam this is my issue chem said gesturing to chex who stood as if expecting to be struck and she can almost fly ivy said chexs granddam said no further word she turned and went back into the castle her grandsire hesitated this may take a little time he said then hurried after his mate the three centaurs turned with similar looks of pain and walked away from the castle ivy looked at esk does this make any sense to you not any i like he replied i thought cherie would be glad to meet her granddaughter i gather that centaurs dont approve of crossbreeding oh pooh everybody crossbreeds in xanth esk shrugged i fear cherie centaur doesnt see it that way she doesnt like magic much for centaurs ivy said thoughtfully chesters better about that hes got a talent and so does chet chet found a place for chem and chex to stay the night and esk and volney joined them none of the three said anything about what had happened but the pall of gloom was almost tangible esk realized that they had really hoped that cherie would accept the situation but centaurs as esk was coming to understand were the most stubborn of creatures the next day king dor and queen irene arrived back and in the afternoon they had a audience with the three travelers it was evident that they had no prejudice against crossbreeds indeed they openly ad vale of the vole mired chexs wings ivy was there now dressed in robes like the little princess she was and so was her little sixyearold brother prince dolph they listened gravely to esks report of the magicians mysterious absence then they listened to volneys story of the vale of the vole it was apparent that they had already learned something of both these matters and had come to a decision before holding the audience ordinarily we would do our best to help the voles king dor said but this matter coming as it does at the time of the crisis with the good magician must wait our first priority is to locate magician humfrey oh daddy ivy exclaimed indignantly arent you going to help them just a little not at this time ivy when we recover the good magician then he should be able to help the voles as volney has come to ask him to do but the bad demons are hurting that friendly river right now ivy protested at least let me go with them no king dor said but daddy queen irene turned to her daughter no she repeated and the tone seemed mild but the girl shrank back as if severely rebuked that was it there was to be no help of any kind from castle roogna esk couldnt help but wonder whether cherie centaur had anything to do with this cruel decision they filed out now volney was as dejected as chex what could they do all their missions were balked until the good magician was found as they departed the castle ivy dashed after them but maybe someone else will help she cried the other centaurs or maybe the ogres or someone maybe you could ask them maybe you three could do something yourselves esk brightened his own mission to the good magician seemed relatively minor now surely he had been rationalizing when he thought that the demoness would harm his family all she wanted was to be left alone in his hideout he had made this trip for himself really to try to make himself important or at least worthwhile in some way i am related to the ogres and the curse fiends and the nymphs and fauns he said i dont think my own problem is nearly as important as the voles problem i could ask those other folk and maybe they would help get rid of the demons in the vale of the vole i am related to the centaurs and to the flying monsters chex said brightening similarly i want to learn to fly but until the good magician is found i might as well do something to help others i think the vale of the vole voles need more help than i do and i could ask those folk certainly i dont have much to keep me here and i am related to the creaturev of the greater family of volev volney said the digglev the vquigglevi could avk and maybe they would help vertamly it iv pointlevv for me to wait for the good magivion while my folk vufter lets do it esk said lets all go and ask our distant relatives and see what help we can get maybe we dont need the good magician or castle roogna thats the way ivy said brightly somehow in her presence it all made sense they would solve the problem of the kissmee river themselves chapter centaur trotted south along the trail that her dams map had shown she expected to reach centaur isle in two days and to spend one day there and return in two that should be plenty of time to complete the rendezvous with esk and volney who were questing in other directions they had agreed to meet in seven days hoping that at least one of them had obtained help for the vale of the vole and the distressed kissmee river a twoday margin for error seemed sufficient centaurs were efficient creatures who seldom if ever made errors in contrast to the bumbling human beings the trail wended parallel to the west coast of xanth it was neither well marked nor well maintained but the protective enchantment was on it so there should be no trouble with predators also there was ivy gee this is fun ivy exclaimed she was on chexs back and everything was fun to her ivys magic was enhancement and it was of magician caliber since she perceived chex as a wonderful creature who could almost fly chex was now moving at a trot that exceeded in velocity her normal full gallop the childs magic buoyed her phenomenally it was indeed like flying because her strength was so great and her feet so light also the girl was good company she made no unreasonable demands and was an excellent rider chexs granddam cberie had been tutoring her in more than academic subjects obviously the thought of cherie centaur sobered chex however by all accounts cherie was a fine centaur but she was conservative she had tutored king dor and queen irene and now was tutoring the next generation but certain matters were beyond her acceptance such as magic in centaurs and crossbreeding chester centaur in contrast had the reputation of a roughneck always ready to fight rather than reason but he was quite tolerant about magic and crossbreeding uncle chet had said this was because of chesters uncle herman the hermit who had had the magic ability to commune with willothewisps and had died bravely vale of the vole in the defense of xanth from the wiggles also chester was unable to perceive evil in anything his offspring might do but though chester had the muscle cherie had the will and that will was manifesting now chex was subtly not welcome in the region of castle roogna but little ivy was another matter and a power in her own right when they had made their decision to get other help for the voles ivy had insisted on participating she could help persuade the centaurs of the isle to help she said besides which she needed more education and visiting centaur isle was part of it even cherie had not been able to deny that logic so ivy had her way she was coming along just for this one trip but you seem awful quiet ivy said after a bit is something wrong not with you dear chex reassured her i was just thinking about cherie ivy said wisely true chesters working on her but you know how centaurs are nothings more stubborn whenoops no offense meant none taken chex said we prefer to call it steadfastness maybe if you do something great like saving the kissmee then shell change her mind say is it true that just drinking from that river is like getting smooched the child had broached this matter before but evidently remained intrigued by it that vernacular is nonstandard usage ivy finished you centaurs are too stuffy but it is supposed to be true that the river historically has been very affectionate however it seems that it has suffered a radical personality change recently that is why we wish to restore it to its natural state yeah so now its the killmee thats funny then exactly in time with chexs correction yes then ivy laughed and chex had to laugh with her they were well along making even better time than chex had projected thanks to the enhancement would her hooves never tire apparently not while she was carrying the little sorceress whats that stink ivy asked then as chex opened her mouth smell how the child loved to tease chex sniffed the air decay she said some small animal must have died recently we will pass by this soon but as they proceeded south the odor intensified ooo ugh ivy said holding her pert nose that must be a big animal so it seems chex agreed all living creatures eventually die not the good magician ivy said vale of the vole well he is missing and we cannot rule out the possibility that oh pooh he just went somewhere sos not to be bothered chex wished they could be sure of that she did not argue the case the smell intensified into truly awful scope a monster ivy gasped it was all chex could do to keep from gagging herself she had never before encountered miasma like this a monster she agreed weve got to get by it soon but they did not the stench became almost palpable ivy was coughing now what a stink she cried i cant even see chex drew to a halt too distracted to protest the naughty word this time she was having trouble with her own vision they seemed to be swimming hi the putrid vapor well have to go around it she said castle zombie ivy exclaimed its near here thats the odor zombies no they smell but not like this i mean we could go there and theyll tell us how to get around cause they know about death and all that rot chex decided not to try to correct that usage either zombies were creatures of death and rot she was not enthusiastic about visiting such a castle but it was obvious that something had to be done chems map had shown the castle the girl was correct about its proximity she turned back and trotted toward an intersection she had noted some way back this alternate path would lead them to castle zombie as they proceeded along it the awful odor diminished that was a relief she felt as if there were foul sludge coating her lungs ivy was right there was a smell about castle zombie but it was quite bearable after what they had experienced perhaps the zombies conserved their rotting flesh better not allowing much of it to escape as gas there were a number of them working on the grounds evidently tending the putrid vegetation the castle itself looked as if it were decomposing but chex knew this was mostly illusion it was of comparatively recent construction its moat was filled with slime and a zombie water monster stewed in it hi sleaze ivy called out cheerfully and the moat monster actually nodded everybody liked ivy the lady of the castle came out to greet them she showed no sign at all of zombieism hi millie ivy called exactly as before hello ivy the woman replied who is your friend this is chex chems her mothher dam shes got wings i had noticed the woman smiled at chex you are welcome here chex if you care to come in vale of the vole chex was in doubt about what the interior of the castle might be like but ivy was not we care she cried clapping her hands millie smiled again you are so like your mother at that ageand so unlike too i know ivy said she was more serious and moreher she made a gesture with her hands to indicate voluptuousness be young while you can dear millie said but when will get all plushy and be able to fascinate men the way you do the girl asked plaintively by the time you find the one you want to fascinate you will be able millie assured her and what about me chex asked with a quirk of a smile i am one of a kind so is rapunzel millie replied but shes married now to grundy golem ivy said which reminds me when is snortimer coming back this jump was too much for chex who is snortimer and what does he have to do with unique creatures finding mates hes my monster under the bed ivy explained grundy borrowed him and never returned him and now its awful quiet under my bed then after the briefest of pauses awfully quiet oh chex was more confused than before theres a zombie monster under lacunas bed millie said i think hes lonely now that shes grown up oh goody ill go play with him ivy dashed off millie turned to chex i presume this is not purely a pleasure visit its a coincidental visit chex confessed we were going to centaur isle to seek help for the voles who have a serious problem but theres such a horrendous smell on the path that oops that must be the sphinx jonathan said it looked ill jonathan my husband the zombie master sphinxes live a very long time but on occasion they do die that would account for it chex said can anything be done oh yes of course jonathan wants to find that sphinx and make a zombie of it before its too far gone now that we know where to look hell go with a contingent of zombies and convert it the process will take a few days because a sphinx is a very large creature but i know he will be grateful to you for the information but i have a limited tune to reach centaur isle and return chex vale of the vole said i cant wait a few days ivy thought you might know a way around there is a way but it is difficult you would need a guide i would be happy to have a guide if one is available a zombie guide chex paused she had not had prior experience with zombies and was not enthusiastic i would have to carry a zombie oh no of course not we can give you a centaur a zombie centaur this did not appeal either ordinary folk do have some difficulty accepting zombies as legitimate creatures in their own right millie said chex remembered the difficulty some folk had accepting crossbreeds too a zombie guide will be fine she said making an abrupt decision very well ill ask horace then millie raised her voice ivy you must be on your way now aww ivy called back zomonsters fun millie winked at chex unless you would like to stay and have a meal with the zombies dear suddenly ivy was running downstairs im ready to go now thanks all the same millie but we have such really rotten food millie protested smiling the very best mold and even a few dead maggots are you sure quite sure thank you ivy said with urgent politeness perhaps another time then millie said with seeming regret she had evidently had prior experience with children she led the way out horace turned out to be a nottoofar gone centaur his body was patched where hair had fallen out and his face was somewhat wormeaten but otherwise he was all right please show chex the alternate route to centaur isle millie said to him and wait for her return do you understand yesh millie ghosht horace said speaking as well as he could with a rotten lip and tongue chex helped ivy mount thank you millie i really appreciate this anything in a good cause millie said it was nice to meet you chex then horace was moving off and chex had to hurry to catch up with him bye millie ivy called waving frantically bye zombies millie and several zombies waved back millie certainly didnt look like a zombie chex remarked oh no shes a ghost ivy said vale of the vole a ghost chex exclaimed but then she remembered what horace had called her ghosht well she isnt really a ghost anymore ivy explained but she was one for eight hundred years so we still call her millie the ghost eight hundred years yes and then she won a prize or something and was made alive again and she took care of daddy when he was little and then she married the zombie master and lived happily ever after shes real nice ivy paused then really nice in time with chexs correction and a laugh horace turned his head watsch niche millie the ghosht ivy replied promptly stifling a giggle yesh the zombie agreed they arent too bright ivy confided but they really are nice when you get to know them they defend castle roogna you know chex had known because of the zombie graveyard there nevertheless she was picking up a lot of interesting material from this child the path they were following was easy to discern chex wondered why millie had considered it to be so difficult as to require a guide then horace drew to a halt zragon nesht ahead he announced losing a discolored tooth that would make it difficult chex unslung her bow a big one many bigh onze he said vwe go around i thought we were already going around but he was leading the way into a thick tangle of vegetation it seemed to consist of truly monstrous vines theyre growing in dragon dung ivy remarked that must be why theyre so big but you know these look like abruptly they came up to the biggest gourd chex had ever imagined but thats a she started shocked hypnogourd ivy finished as horace leaped into the giant peephole we cant chex protested appalled no one escapes on his own from a gourd there isnt even supposed tobe any physical entryits all in the spirit but he just i guess thats why we need a guide ivy said chex nodded maybe it did make sense if she wanted to keep thenguide in range she had to act promptly she nerved herself and leaped into the peephole she landed in thick vegetation much like that she had just left but this had one important difference it was zombie vegetation the leaves of the plants were rotting and the stems were mottled nevertheless vines were extending toward the depressions of what appeared to be sunken grave vale of the vole sites the vines were trying to tunnel into the ground here rather than springing from it in the normal fashion but she couldnt pause to figure out this anomaly horace was disappearing on the winding trail ahead she galloped after him funnytheyre growing the wrong way ivy said but you know thats not scary the way it was when i was in here before you were in the gourd before chex asked amazed yes there was a whole big lake of castor oil triple ugh and a bug room i hated it but here its only plants growing into zombie graves its a zombie horror chex exclaimed catching on things that frighten zombieslike plants boring into their graves and sapping their vitality or whatever it is they have that must be it ivy agreed happily zombie haunts there was a sharp hiss ahead it was a venomous snake striking at horaces leg but the centaur leaped clear and the fangs closed instead on a sickly rose plant immediately the plant changed color becoming healthy and vigorous beautiful red roses formed but whats so bad about that ivy asked if it had bitten horace he wouldve been healthy again wouldnt he which might be the ultimate horror for a zombie chex said just as getting bitten and turning zombie would be a horror for us but it certainly was strange horace drew up at a new threat a region of slashing knives there seemed to be no creature wielding them the knives merely cut of their own volition this was as awkward for living creatures as for zombies how were they to pass horace drew a rusty knife from his backpack he hurled it into the melee immediately the other knives attacked it sparks flew as metal rasped against metal soon the magic knives their blood frenzy aroused were slashing each other not long thereafter all the knives were broken having destroyed each other it seemed safe to proceed through this region now whereupon horace turned and proceeded back the way they had come startled chex followed what kind of a maze was this the path behind had changed now the zombie vegetation was zombie mineral decaying stones rusting metal and dissolving plastic horace threaded his way through it touching nothing except the grounduntil abruptly he brought a front hoof down on a sodden green rock the rock fragmented the chips fell to the ground and burned their vale of the vole way into it sinking from sight the ground itself caught fire burning with a sickly greenish flame zombie fire gradually a wooden underpinning was revealed as the earth above it burned away the wood oddly was untouched by the flame which flickered out horace set his front hoof against the near end of the wood and it descended the far side lifted the panel was hinged hi the center beneath was revealed a flight of wooden steps leading to a lighted cellar gee ivy whispered intrigued horace turned and walked back the way he had come ignoring the steps chex bemused followed again the setting had changed now it consisted of zombie animals ratlike things that scurried haphazardly around shedding fragments of themselves horace stepped among them taking care that his hooves crushed none chex followed taking equal care she could guess what would happen next the centaur would select one creature to crush and then a new way would open and he would ignore it this was a strange place even in its predictability horace kicked a rat the creature squealed immediately the others rose up and squealed too then they changed into numbers and rose into the air the ground became a grid on whose squares the shadows of the numbers danced horace lay down his body covering a number of the squares the numbers above those squares keened angrily and attacked they spun so that their ends formed cutting surfaces and plunged at his body chex doubtful and not a little worried lay down too i hope that zombie knows what he is doing she murmured i hope so too ivy whispered i dont like those numbers indeed the numbers were attacking the two of them now as well they buzzed down like aroused beesand passed right through their flesh without impact chex laughed they must be imaginary numbers what ivy asked numbers used in mathematics that arent real chex explained but sometimes it is necessary to use them anyway that doesnt make much sense to me ivy grumbled im sure it doesnt but this must be the home of those numbers they are probably the bad dreams of mathematicians horace leaned his humanoid torso back and went to sleep chex hesitated did the zombie really know what he was doing or had vale of the vole he given up if so could she afford to follow his example there were certainly dangers here and this was the gourd they could be in real trouble if i guess we dont have much choice ivy said for once not enthusiastic so it seems dear chex agreed they both settled back and closed their eyes to their surprise they slept immediately chex opened her eyes it was day and she lay on a beach across the open water she saw the distant outline of a large island she blinked could that be centaur isle she asked aloud yesh horace said from behind her ivy woke were here she exclaimed but how did we get here we went to sleep in the gourd chex said hardly believing it herself i can only surmise that to sleep in the realm of dreams is to wake in the realm of ordinary consciousness i guess maybe we did need a guide the little girl said i guess maybe we did chex agreed gotcha ivy exclaimed you spoke my language after what we just experienced your language seems easier chex hefted herself up is this really centaur isle she asked horace or merely a dream of it it really ish he assured her shorten cut so it seemed chex decided to accept things as they seemed and get on with her mission ivy slid off her back i gotta feel solid sand under my feet she said chex understood the experience in the gourd had been unsettling even for a little sorceress now she had to cross the water to the isle there should be a ferry where the trail arrived ill scout around for the crossing chex announced ill rest here ivy said itll be safe enough with horace anyway mom gave me a protective charm chex made sure you will wait here for me she asked horace yesh he said she set off along the beach trotting east because the closest approach to the isle seemed to be in that direction soon enough her judgment was confirmed there was a raft with a sail at a landing she trotted up halloo she called a centaur of middle age emerged from a shelter someone for crossing he asked vale of the vole yes i need to go to centaur isle and then to return she broke off because the other was staring at her wings oh a crossbreed he said with deep disgust forget it but i have to talk to the centaur elders about we dont talk to crossbreeds he said curtly now get away from here before someone sees you but he reached for his bow now look she protested i have a right to be heard the bow was in his hands crossbreeds have no right to exist let alone be heard he said no one will talk to you youd be executed without trial if you set foot on the isle now fly away before im put to the trouble of burying your body appalled chex realized that he was serious her granddams attitude was merely the echo of the prejudice of the larger community of centaurs they were unable to tolerate any deviance from their norm for a moment she was tempted to stand her ground and put him to that trouble of burying her but she knew it would not accomplish anything the position of the centaurs was sealed as ivy had said centaurs were stubborn she turned and trotted away frustrated and disgusted now she appreciated why her dam had raised her largely isolated from her own kind uncle chet had been around often showing her his magic with boulders and pebbles and some of the hermitlike forest centaurs had visited on occasion but never any centaurs from either the village north of the gap or from centaur isle her education was coming hard centaurs were supposed to be the most brilliant and consistent creatures of xanth but her belief in this had been shaken how could a species that was an obvious crossbreed between humanoids and equinoids be so restrictive about further crossbreeding yet as she considered the matter she knew if centaurs accepted unrestricted crossbreeding as the equines did they would eventually be fragmented as a species as the equines were there were no longer any true horses in xanth only in mundania where they couldnt interbreed with other species in xanth there were night mares and pookas and werehorses and seahorses and hippogryphs and centaurs and unicorns and flying horses and the original stock had been crossbred out of existence now the centaurs were preserving their variant as a viable species and were doing what they had to do in that effort still there were even more crossbreeds involving the human stock than there were of the equine stock ranging from elves to ogres to multi of the vole tnergings like the sphinxes yet the original stock remained viable humans did tend to discourage crossbreeding but were reasonably tolerant of what did occur thus centaurs were welcome at castle roogna and other variants such as the golem and an ogre or two so the restriction did not have to be absolute but she reminded herself in an effort to retain centaur objectivity the human stock had a major source of replenishment mundania there had been many waves of colonization from mundania each one adding to the straight human population of xanth centaurs could not be reinforced similarly for they existed only in xanth so the situations were not precisely analogous all of which did not make her feel much better she could understand the position of the centaurs without appreciating it what she really needed was a species of her own she laughed to herself somewhat bitterly she was as far as she knew the only one of her kind in xanth some species she arrived back at the spot where ivy and horace waited any luck the little girl asked brightly no luck chex said heavily they will not even talk to me because i am a crossbreed ivy pursed her lips the way cherie wont yes maybe i could do it chex considered ivy was a child but she was also the kings daughter and a sorceress the centaurs might give her an audience but she would have to go to the isle alone and that would violate chexs commitment to guard her also if the centaurs would not even talk to a variant of their own kind would they help a completely different species the voles this was highly doubtful i think we should write this off as a bad job dear she said i underestimated the resistance of the centaurs to our effort ivy shrugged okay maybe we can get help from your sires folks instead the winged monsters chex considered finding this alternative more interesting now that her major hope had been dashed well certainly i could go to my sire and ask but he lives closer to central xanth we shall have to return to castle roogna first and i can compare notes with esk and volney perhaps one of them has already found help urn ivy agreed glancing at her expectantly chex waited and ivy waited finally chex surrendered and said vale of the vole yes in correction and ivy said it with her then laughed the odd thing was that this made chex feel better horace led them into the jungle following another trail that showed signs of disuse chex realized that other creatures tended to avoid the paths used by zombies prior to this experience she would have avoided it too but after her rebuff by the living centaurs she found the zombie centaur better company the zombies were providing what help they could and indeed had enabled her to cut many hours off her trip south when the trail passed through looser forest she drew up abreast of him may i ask you a question horace yesh how did you come to be a zombie i zdied evidently he wasnt much for detail how did you die peopleschooz i beg your pardon parzon not much for social niceties either but these could hardly be expected of those whose brains were rotten how did you die she repeated zome call it horschschooz i dont understand i think he said horse ivy started dont say that word manure ivy finished contritely a princess doesnt even know the other word lets hope not but how could anything like that account for his death im sure he can explain it if i ask him ivy said confidently here let me ride him i really dont think oh he can hold my weight all right i talked to him while we were waiting for you hes nice enough for a zombie she leaned across and chex had to move close to facilitate the transfer lest the girl fall between them ivy scrambled across and settled on horaces back horace youre pretty strong she said and indeed the zombie seemed to be in better physical condition than before you can talk well too i just know it zthank you horace said and his voice did sound better it was the childs magic enhancing him how did you die ivy asked vale of the vole people zhooz people shoes ivy exclaimed what they call horseshoes in mundanial where you throw these metal shoes yez the pronunciation was less slushy but still not perfect there was only so much enhancement could do when lips were decayed and teeth missing but how did a game kill you horace ivy asked hit by a boot oh an accident chex exclaimed one of those hard metal shoes hit you on the head yez a heavy people zboot with hob nailz and then the zombie master revived you as a zombie yez how do you feel being a zombie itz not zbad but my oldz friendz wont play with me im afraid the living arent too fond of the undead chex said theyre prejudiced she had just had a good lesson in prejudice yez but zora zombies nice ivy said transferring back to chex shes almost alive zora is a friend of yours yes she helped mom learn about zombies then she married xavier xavier chex exclaimed i know him he rides xap yes xaps great hes a hippogryph i know hes my sire oh ivy squealed with delight i didnt realize thats how you got your wings thats how chex agreed i know xavier because hes been with xap but i didnt know he was married he never mentioned it i guess thats less important to males than to females ivy said unless he was ashamed of having a zombie wife i dont think so ivy said he always seemed realreally proud of her when he was with her then perhaps he was afraid that others would have the wrong picture of her if they learned she was a zombie without meeting her maybe youd hardly know shes a zombie thats how i know zombies arent bad cause shes babysitted me and shes great horace veered to the side gourd he announced there was another of the huge variety that grew in dragon dung horace plunged into its peephole and chex followed vale of the vole inside it seemed exactly the same as it had been on then prior entry chex had thought they would be in the region of imaginary numbers that they had left but they were in the first stage with the zombie vegetation they negotiated the region of knives the same way as before i wonder whats beyond those knives ivy asked perhaps nothing chex said it may be only a ritual where a particular action is required to change the setting of the maze an intruder not knowledgeable about this matter might take the wrong direction they came to the buried trap door id sure like to see whats down there ivy said chex was getting quite curious too the steps seemed very inviting but she was sure it was a trap if she deviated from the route of their guide she would perhaps be trapped within the gourd they reached the numbers and again lay down and sleptand woke not far beyond castle zombie there was no giant gourd here just as there had not been at the southern beach they had emerged by some other mechanism now night was approaching they had been to the verge of centaur isle and back in a single day a journey that would otherwise have taken three chex faced the prospect of returning to castle roogna two days early that would be fine if esk and volney were back early but not good if they were not she considered as the castle came into view then made her decision ivy if millie and the zombie master are willing how would it be if we stayed here for two days ooo goody ivy exclaimed clapping her hands i can play with zomonster all i want so it was decided that simply castle zombie seemed positively attractive now chapter gateway risk brought out the pill somewhat doubtfully ivy had brought three of them from the castle roogna armory telling him that there were plenty of them and that she used them all the time when she was in a hurry he had hardly wanted to suggest that the child was not telling the truth so he had accepted them but now that chex had trotted off south with ivy and volney was tunneling to his mission he was worried suppose they didnt work well in that case he would have to proceed the oldfashioned way hoping he could make it in time he had slogged by foot from home to castle roogna he could slog down to lake ogrechobee but he hoped the pills worked he put one in his mouth and swallowed it nothing changed it was supposed to enable him to travel almost masslessly so that he could cover a great distance without impediment or fatigue but maybe its enhancement only worked on the child whose talent was enhancement he took a stepand shot through a tree he had paused on the path that started out toward the lake it curved so a tree was ahead of him some distance ahead now it was behind could his step have taken him through the tree he reached slowly back and touched the trunk and met only slight resistance the tree seemed to have become an illusion which was the way the pill was supposed to work the tree was as solid as ever it was esk himself who had become very much like an illusion his mass had been nulled out though he looked and felt the same as before ivy had told him true if chex had pills like these she would be able to fly but of course she wanted to fly regularly not just during the span of one dose he faced southeast and started walking his feet touched the ground and sank into it slightly giving him necessary traction his body zoomed along as if it weighed no more than a feather obviously that was the vale of the vole case though he felt the same his leg muscles primed to propel his full mass had only a tiny fraction of it to move now so had a great deal of extra strength he tended to leap when he intended only to push off and to sail through the air far further than he could normally have jumped he had trouble keeping his balance because what he thought were trifling corrections became powerful shoves he careered through trees with impromptu abandon lunging through a seeming forest of phantoms soon he got it under control however and concentrated on rapid forward progress it hardly mattered whether he stayed on the path he could pass through brush and other obstacles with almost equal ease when he tried to go through a hill he slowed though because the resistance of the ground against his body was greater than that against his feet he had to go into a swimming motion and this was less efficient so he stayed above and avoided trees when he conveniently could so that they would not drag against him he admired the whizzing scenery the nearer trees were passing so rapidly that they blurred while distant ones were slower and far mountains hardly changed at all he tended to plow into hills then to sail when descending their far slopes he saw wild creatures who were unable to move out of the way before he was upon them but he was beyond them before they decided what to do he spied a snoozing griffin and kicked at its nose without effect the creature shifted its head startled as he left it behind this was fun he was traveling rapidly but he did have a good distance to go so it was near nightfall before he came to the broad shore of lake ogrechobee at last the pill was wearing off and his normal mass was returning now he wished he had been less wasteful in the expenditure of his energy his foot and leg muscles were tired in unusual ways because he had not been walking in the normal manner the more the pill wore off the less comfortable he became he was good and sore he set about eating and making camp for the night not too close to the water because he didnt like the look of the green reptilian creatures in it he was lonely now he had gotten used to company and decided that he preferred it he finally settled in a tree for sleep it wasnt comfortable but it was relatively safe he could tell any creature no but he had to be awake to do it he should be able to hear anything that tried to climb the tree in the night or anything that landed in its foliage in the morning cramped he took care of routine needs then addressed the problem of entry into gateway castle the problem was that it was under the water the only surface entrance was via a great whirl vale of the vole pool and he didnt trust that he could take another pill and become less dense than the water and walk down through it and the castle wallbut then he would be inside in no state to talk with the inhabitants and when the pill wore off they might not appreciate the manner of his intrusion it would be better to apply at the front gate and be admitted legitimately but where was the front gate well there must be a route for supplies the curse fiends were said to be insular caring little for outsiders but they had to go out for food wood and other necessities he would locate that supply route and intercept someone on it and explain his mission since he was related to these people it should be possible to get some attention he walked along the shore looking carefully for signs of activity but the lake was huge and the walk was long the chobees came out scrambling toward him on fat green legs their teeth were plentiful and he didnt trust them so he retreated into the forest until they did not follow eventually he did discover evidence of activity there was a region with cultivated trees and that meant that someone was cultivating them there were blue trees and red trees and orange trees their fruits ripening nicely there were yellow green and blue berry bushes there were many different kinds of pie trees and blanket trees and all the other agricultural staples that a community of human beings required he was definitely in the right region sure enough before long he heard voices and came across young women harvesting an assortment of slippers from a grove of shoe trees they wore simple blouses and skirts evidently harvested from other trees at other times in an assortment of pastel colors matching kerchiefs bound their tresses fetchingly he approached them excuse me he called i am looking for gateway castle eeeek a man they cried with flattering alarm then they began counting one two no he exclaimed realizing what they were up to the curse fiends unlike other creatures shared a common talent that of cursing a massed curse could be devastating even his mothers tantrums which were related were bad enough he did not want to be hit by a severalgirl curse his no of course stifled that they lost their count and did not try to curse him still they backed away from him distrustfully dont hurt us sir we are only working girls they exclaimed i am only a traveler looking for gateway castle he repeated but i dont know how to get in vale of the vole are you sure youre harmless one asked him quite harmless he assured her then we will take you in with us when we go she said but you will have to check in with the authorities i shall be glad to he said meanwhile may i help you harvest they giggled and decided to let him help so for the next two hours he helped them select ripe shoes it was important that there be pairs that matched in size and type and color many excellent ones had to be left because they had no mates thus this was not as easy a job as it had seemed indeed in some cases it seemed that it would have been about as easy to make the matching shoes as to find them it was fun doing this work not because esk had any particular affinity for work but because the girls were of his own age and flirted with him constantly making remarks about lady slippers without mates esk realized that there might be more for him at gateway castle than just his mission after all his grandmother had been a curse fiend then the time came for them to reenter the castle they trooped along with their baskets of shoes and esk went with them he had been tired when he encountered them but did not feel so now in fact he was feeling very positive they came to a pier that projected some distance into the lake they walked out on this and waited and soon a thing appeared rising from the deep water it resembled a boat and seemed to be made of wood but it managed to sail under the water rather than on it this was decidedly strange to esk but the girls crowded toward it without hesitation the top opened and there was a hole down into the boat the girls stepped across in turn clinging to the handholds set inside the hole and passing their baskets of shoes across then they called to esk and he crossed too and found that there was a ladder he descended it until he was well below the surface of the lake his feet finally touching the floor then one of the girls climbed back up he glanced up to see what she was doing and had to look away before he embarrassed himself by blushing he had seen right up her skirt get it tight doris a girl called tight then the light diminished and he realized what she was doing pulling closed the lid to the boat in the abrupt darkness someone hugged him and another kissed him on the cheek giggling then a lantern came on and all the girls were standing sedately around him not one giving evidence of having done anything untoward vale of the vole it was a stern woman with the lamp coming from another chamber in the boat everybody aboard she asked briskly yesm plus one there was another giggle the woman brought the lamp about and spied esk a man she exclaimed disapprovingly we found him hi the shoe trees doris said may we keep him matriarch certainly not hes going right back where he no esk murmured the woman looked nonplused well the authorities will have to decide put him in the hold for now so esk was conducted to the hold which was simply the cargo compartment of the boat he settled down among the baskets of shoes while the girls sneaked winks at him from the adjacent compartment the boat began to move first it sank so that he knew it was under the water even the entrance hatch and that was eerie then it slid forward propelled by some unknown mechanism he couldnt tell whether there were men hi another chamber poling it along as he and chex had poled their raft or whether it was magic in due course the boat bumped to a stop a girl climbed up to the hatch and opened it and fresh light descended now the girls picked up their baskets and hauled them out of the craft bye esk each murmured as she passed in low tones that the matron was not supposed to hear when all were gone the matron strode up come on intruder she snapped youll be seeing the magistrate he went where directed climbing up and out of the hatch he found himself inside a room whose floor was water the boat was sitting hi this its hatch beside another pier this time esk could see down around it as the water was illuminated and clear now the mechanism for the crafts travel was apparent there was a winch and a rope attached to it the boat had simply been hauled in to the underwater city as it had probably been hauled out to the edge of the lake obviously there would be no people sneaking in by night the boat would not be sent out for strangers he was lucky he had cultivated the girls not that he had minded that particular diversion he had not realized before how pleasant such an association could be the matron marched him upstairs to a grim office here the magistrate frowned from his desk what do you mean by intruding where you arent welcome the man demanded esk was tempted to say that the girls had made him welcome but vale of the vole suspected that would not be smart my grandmother was a curse fiend he said i came to ask a favor from my relatives a favor a favor the man demanded reddening we dont do favors for anyone we curse not even for relatives the magistrate huffed indignantly but evidently felt obliged by his office to investigate this matter who was your grandmother well i dont know what she was called here because she gave up that name when she married my grandfather but maybe you know of the case she was an excellent actress all of us are excellent thespians he said stuffily the theater is our vocation who impersonated an ogress esk finished my grandfather is an ogre an ogre the man demanded outraged none of our citizens would touch so brutish a beast i understand he abducted her from a set but she married him from choice the man turned to a shelf behind him and pulled down a massive tome he set it on the desk opened it and turned the pages running his forefinger down the margins ogre ogre he muttered as he searched crunch ogre esk said helpfully the magistrate grimaced yes here it is helpless damsel abducted by villainous ogre we blasted him with a massive curse that killed all the trees of the region but apparently the brute escaped he became a vegetarian esk said the curse couldnt find him because it was looking for a bone cruncher a loophole the magistrate said with withering disgust they had a son named smash who married a nymph named tandy and i am their son esk said so i am related to the curse fiends and now come to ask a favor of my relatives you may be related barely in a distasteful technical sense but that gives you the right only to visit not to make demands on us i will grant you a twoday visa after that you will be banned oh i dont intend to stay longer all im asking is help for dont tell me your business the man exclaimed you have no right even to ask unless you earn it earn it how do i earn it by providing something we need what can you do esk considered obviously they would not be impressed by his ogre mode even if he could invoke it and he doubted that his sometime acting vale of the vole ability would be anything remarkable here then he remembered something his grandmother had mentioned that had seemed like a joke i can be an audience he said someone must have told you the magistrate grumped my curse fiend grandma esk agreed smugly though he was surprised that this had worked you have everything you need except advance audiences right you need to try out your plays on ordinary folk before your season commences to be sure they register correctly well im about as ordinary as they come ill grant you that youngster very well it is evident that you do have curse fiend lineage even if you are a bad actor here is your visa you have two days to be a good enough audience to warrant our consideration of your plea dont waste them i wont esk promised if you will just tell me where to go to get to work first you must clean up did you expect to perform as an audience in that condition the magistrates nose wrinkled he snapped his fingers and a girl appeared esk recognized her she was doris the one he had seen on the ladder take this person to a guest room and clean and dress him appropriately the magistrate said yes sir the girl said meekly she turned to esk if you will follow me person his name is esk the magistrate said he will be a sample audience for two days only yes sir doris repeated please follow me desk esk the magistrate roared cant you servants get anything straight no sir doris said esk followed her intrigued doris knew his name why was she pretending not to as soon as they were alone in the hall he found out i subbed for the girl on duty doris confided if the magistrate caught on hed have me flayed but why youve already put in a days work harvesting shoes i think youre cute i thought if i showed you my legs youd like me now i get to wash you that will be fun youon the ladderon purpose he asked almost choking wasnt i naughty she giggled i knew youd look but now the other part of this situation registered you are going to wash me vale of the vole its part of the duty were servant girls until we serve our apprenticeship then those with proper promise get to try out for parts unless we manage to marry above our station whats your station now it was clarifying she was looking for a way to get a better position her interest in him was little more than an act taking advantage of an opportunity he had been fascinated by what he had seen of her legs but he found her motive less appealing my station is very low he said im a crossbreed she gazed at him appalled what a dirty word yes so you dont want anything more to do with me thats true you can wash yourself she pointed to an open door thank you esk said entering the chamber he was sure he had done what was best but somehow he was disappointed her legs had been quite stunning by trial and error he figured out how to use the cleaning facility it was a kind of miniature waterfall that came on when he turned a handle and stopped when he turned the handle back this was a new kind of magic when he emerged from the waterfall room he found new clothing where he had left his old his other belongings were neatly set beside he had not lost his two remaining travel pills or his hand knife that was a relief he donned the new clothing which was evidently what a sample audience was supposed to wear it was a light blue set of trousers and a matching longsleeved shirt both fit him well enough the curse fiends evidently knew how to entertain a guest or an audience he stepped out of the chamber looking around immediately a girl appeared she was not doris this must be the regular one on duty she was not as pretty or flirtatious which was perhaps just as well he didnt want to forget why he had come here he really did want to help the voles if he could now you must eat the girl informed him she guided him to a cubby where a decent meal of fruits and cakes was waiting esk ate going along with the local custom though not entirely comfortable with it then the girl wiped his face and combed his hair for him and took him to a quiet darkened chamber was she going to show him her legs he wondered but she merely indicated the chair he was to sit in which was wooden with a single brown cushion on it and armrests the play will begin in a moment she said and departed well so far so good he realized that he would have to watch and listen carefully and form some kind of opinion so that he could make a fele of the vole competent audience report what would happen if he didnt like the play would they throw him out he hoped he liked the production music sounded coming from an adjacent chamber there seemed to be a number of instruments strings and winds and percussions operating together harmoniously esk had never been much for music but now he realized that he simply had not been exposed to competent music this was very impressive and it induced a positive mood there was a stage before him mostly concealed by a large curtain suspended from the ceiling now that curtain brightened seemingly lighted from below it rose showing the rest of the stageand esk leaned forward interested his interest heightened by the drama of the music the stage was a model of castle roogna there was the castle in miniature in the center suggesting the fullsized castle at a distance there was the front gate and the moat with a model of the serpentine monster to one side a young man of about esks own age walked to the center he wore ordinary clothes but also a small headband resembling a crown there seemed to be plenty of room to stand despite the presence of the moat esk realized that the moat could be painted so that there was no danger of the actors falling into the water but it certainly looked real this was a clever stage hows things moat the young man asked speaking clearly and with good force so that esk heard him very well the monster peed in me again dor the moat complained esk laughed the joke had caught him completely by surprise suddenly he realized that the young man was supposed to be king dor who could talk to the inanimate and have it respond that was the magiciancaliber magic that had qualified him for the office not the king as he was today but as he was when young before he assumed the throne well thats what monsters do when theyre not biting people dor said reasonably how do you expect me to keep clean the moat demanded im not a sewer and the music made a blah sound im sure you can handle it dor walked around the stage exchanging greetings with the other objects on it including the door of the castle just as the novelty was wearing off a young woman walked onstage she was rather pretty with bright green hair and wore her dress provocatively though she looked a year or so younger than dor she was evidently a major character because the music became excited as she entered with little frills hi dorl she exclaimed her voice well vale of the vole enunciated and carrying just as well as his did esk wished that real people spoke as clearly oh hello irene dor said with obvious lack of enthusiasm that was another thing it was easy to read the feelings of the folk onstage lets go somewhere and kiss irene said and the music went into a naughtysounding theme esk was reminded of doris though this was a different girl that started him on a chain of thought could doris have been named after king dor the curse fiends obviously had some interest in the folk of castle roogna since their play related no ive got to go talk to more things dor said you care more about the inanimate than you do about me irene flared there was a rumble of musical anger well sure i do he retorted youre only a girl im a woman she exclaimed ha he said with withering contempt esk found himself trying to repeat the syllable himself to get the exact inflection what a way to cut someone down ill show you she exclaimed she wrapped her arms around him heaved him up and threw him into the moat there was a splash esk almost jumped out of his chair there was real water there after all and dor was in it sopping wet what a surprise he realized that the sound of the splash had been enhanced by the music contributing to his reaction ill get you for that dor sputtered climbing out ha her use of the word was as effective as his you cant touch me cause im a girl indeed she was and she bared a bit of cleavage to prove it oh yeah dor advanced on her threateningly she stood her ground the picture of feminine certainty yeah more bosom showed affecting esk more than dor dor grabbed her and threw her into the moat oooo esk found himself breathing surprised again he had thought dor was bluffing evidently the music had thought so too it was now a jangle of amazement youyouman you irene screamed her hair was matted about her head and neck and looked like seaweed now ill get you for that i was just getting even dor pointed out she climbed out her dress clung to her enhancing contours that were more voluptuous than they had seemed before thats no excuse dor alarmed started to walk offstage but irene ran after him and caught him she hauled him back toward the moat vale of the vole no you dont dor said struggling to escape that fate they got tangled together and both fell in youyou irene cried tearing at his clothes thats what you say dor retorted attacking her clothes now they were fighting in the moat their clothing coming apart flashes of irenes body showed and esk gaped that girl was supposed to be only fifteen years old now they were locked in the struggle chest deep in the water while the mock moat monster watched suddenly irene changed her tactics she put her face up against dors and kissed him the music made a naughty flourish oooo esk breathed as he saw dor stiffen then relax then begin kissing back it was easy to imagine himself in such a situation hed kiss back too if a girl as lovely as that did that to him a new figure clomped onstage this was a centaur evidently mocked up by two human actors hi a centaur suit it was female because of the two enormous breasts mounted on front the music became somber this was a person not to be taken lightly dor she said holding up a sheet of paper i have graded your essay i want to comment on your spelling let me read this to you as you have it dor and irene continued kissing in the moat oblivious of the centaur esk smiled he understood how this could be the centaur cleared her throat and read and as she did the words appeared on a scroll that two arms held from offstage showing the spelling eye live inn the land of zanth witch is disstinked from mundania inn that their is magic inn zanth and nun inn mundania then the centaur glanced into the moat and for the first time realized what was happening dor what are you doing with that girl the kiss broke with a guilty start the music abruptly ceased leaving awkward silence the two bedraggled youngsters stood in the moat their tops half exposed just uh quarreling dor said shamefacedly quarreling in that case id like to see what you consider being friendly were getting to that cherie irene said with a marvelously obscure and unrepentant smile indeed you are not cherie centaur said severely she reached down and took dor by the ear you are coming to see the king young man as poor dor was hauled out of the water the curtain came down the scene was finished esk relaxed he had expected to be somewhat bored by the curse fiends art but instead he had been fascinated they were very good he vale of the vole wondered whether this play was an accurate replication of history had dor really torn off irenes clothing in the moat the king and queen had seemed quite sedate when he had had audience with them but perhaps they had been different when young and vital would little ivy become conservative and dour when she grew up would esk himself what an awful prospect soon the curtain rose on the second scene this was the throne room of castle roogna the king sat on the throne and the queen stood beside him both were every bit as dour as their generation seemed to be the music was now grand and somber as befitted royalty dear we shall have to do something about our daughter irene the queen said they dont call me king trent for nothing the king said grandly and somberly whats wrong with the girl shes lonely shell get used to it iris we did after all loneliness is good for royalty i think we need to send her somewhere where there will be other girls her age she has no one to play with here what about dor hes only a year older than she is he pays no attention to her hes too busy talking to things he should be busy on his homework hes supposed to be king after me you know he has to learn things i know dear but at this point the king launched into a lengthy and somewhat dull lecture on the responsibilities of kingship and why a prospective king had to learn it all esk became impatient then bored he had no prospect of ever being a king so had little interest in this subject then cherie centaur trotted in hauling dor along by the ear do you know what i found this wretch doing your majesty she demanded righteously you will surely tell me at length king trent muttered and esk smiled he knew the feeling he was stripping off your daughters clothes cherie said indignantly esk frowned that did not ring true the centaurs hardly cared about exposure of bodies as they did not wear clothing themselves even if dor and irene had done more than kiss the centaur wouldnt have minded centaurs regarded sexual interplay as another natural function it was dors poor spelling that should have excited cheries ire what the king demanded vale of the vole in the moat cherie continued if i had not arrived when i did the king fixed a steely glare on bedraggled dor well what do you nave to say for yourself young man she started it dor protested and his spelling is atrocious cherie concluded that does it king trent exclaimed i hereby banish this wretch to mundania no please dor wailed sinking to the floor in wretched supplication the king has spoken queen iris said with satisfaction i never did like the way that boy frittered away his time with objects she shouldnt call her daughter an object dor muttered to himself his voice nevertheless carrying clearly to the audience the music made a snide laugh a guard came in and marched dor out as the curtain dropped esk concluded that he didnt like this scene as well as the first after all irene had started it and started the kissing too dor had been relatively innocent now he had just discovered how interesting irene could beand he was being banished to the worst of regions drear mundania were the curse fiends trying to show how unfair human beings sometimes were the curtain lifted on the third scene the play continued showing dor in mundania unable to use his magic miserable while irene was miserable at castle roogna love deniedand esk did feel it though he knew this was only an imitation of history something that might or might not have happened a generation ago he wished he could reach even the first stage of this tragedy having a girl to love finally in the play dor had a revelation i love her he declared then he marched back to xanth and charged in to face king trent i love your daughter and im going to marry her he said sweeping irene into his arms it was amazing how conveniently near she happened to be well why didnt you say so before king trent demanded grumpily as the scene closed esk knew it was all arranged and rehearsed but dor had married irene and they now had two children so it could have happened somewhat like this at any rate he felt exhilarated by the conclusion being glad that the two had finally gotten together now a man appeared very good he said i believe you will make a credible sample audience i have only one question how did i like the play esk said for him well i did i will ask for the information i require the man said curtly vale of the vole but im trying to tell you that is unnecessary but how can you find out how i liked the play if i dont tell you we know how you liked the play it is only a technical matter i am concerned with a technical matter i see i must explain the man said gruffly very well pay attention we do not need to ask you how you reacted to the play because you were under continuous observation your reactions were catalogued and matched against the standard reaction chart we now know that they are essentially normal for your sex and age and culture you will make an adequate audience you were watching me i didnt see naturally not its a oneway curtain we recorded every fidget every nose scratch every smile and frown and vocal expression we know which parts you enjoyed and which you did not now that we have aligned your individual reactions to this standard presentation we can verify their applicability to those plays we have not yet put on tour we have zeroed you in zeroed me in esk repeated wondering how many times he had scratched his nose while watching the play you say this was an old play standard boymeetsgirl boylosesgirl boyrecoversgirl always good for a simple audience now the only question i have for you is why you frowned at the wrong place in scene two when cherie centaur was reporting how dor had stripped irenes clothing from her did you find that historically inaccurate the man had been watching certainly that was exactly where esk had objected centaurs arent like that he said they dont care how much of a persons body shows she wouldnt even have noticed and wouldnt have cared if they had gone completely naked in the moat you are conversant with the attitudes of centaurs well some i do know that much how many centaurs have you known well well only one really but she is cheries grandfilly only one the man repeated coldly on this basis you extrapolate an attitude for the entire species it sounded inadequate now you asked me why i frowned esk reminded him thats why a note shall be made the man turned away that will be all your next audience will be in the morning the wench will conduct you to it vale of the vole the wench esk asked somewhat blankly the servant who brought you here the man snapped his fingers and immediately the girl appeared the man departed and the girl showed esk back to his room that was just as well because he would have been lost in the maze of passages by himself was it rough the girl asked ill survive esk said she flashed him a quick smile i will wake you in the morning then she was gone she was evidently no vamp just one of the nothing folk of this realm the next two days were full of plays esk enjoyed them generally and soon was used to the knowledge that he was being scrutinized as closely as he scrutinized the plays he did feel that he was performing a useful service for this community and that his reactions would help them to refine their plays for their outside tours for it seemed that the curse fiends though largely selfsufficient economically had a desperate need for the approval of others in their chosen art form they wanted their plays to be recognized as outstanding and to have their audiences eager for the next seasons offerings promotion within their hierarchy was based on this an effective actor became a leader of their society well why not it was a system he could live with he regretted turning doris off a girl like that in a comfortable place like this but he had a mission to accomplish and another society to help save thoughts of remaining here were idle the curse fiends would not accept him anyway they were treating him nicely now only because they valued his input as an ignorant audience and soon that would be done as he completed their current repertoire of plays the final play impressed him for a reason other than the fiends intended however it was about a mans interaction with a demon abruptly intent esk watched it closely it was as the fiends put it a standard pactwithdemon narrative a young man with whom esk readily identified went to good magician humfrey with a question how could he safely tame a demon he served his term of servicethe intermission between scenes served to abbreviate that year for the audienceand received his answer a talisman a diagram a verbal spell and a parchment on which was written a contract now this will only work once because the elements are selfdestructing the good magician cautioned him but this combination will summon and control a demon vale of the vole and the demon will then have to negotiate with you for its freedom you can compel it to do anything you wish anything the lad asked eagerly anything within its capability what i have provided will handle one of the most powerful demons so it will be able to do a great deal but it is not omnipotent however it will not be able to deceive you so you may ask it what its capabilities are before you decide just make sure that it signs this contract after you have filled in the details of your deal i will the youth exclaimed esk felt as if he were there himself talking to the good magician how nice it would have been if he could have asked a similar question but of course the problem in the vale of the vole was that there were many demons controlling one demon wouldnt do the job still he was really caught up in the play perhaps he would learn something helpful the boy took the things home and set the process in motion first he traced the diagram which was a strange fivesided affair onto his floor and when he had it exactly right he painted it there so that it could not be scuffed out then he took the talisman and held it aloft demon of the day i summon you he intoned by this spell appear in the pentagram and he spoke the spell which sounded incomprehensible to esk but potent all the same the stage darkened the music swelled ominously sparks flashed the air above the pentagram filled with smoke there was a horrendous roar making esk wince he was sure that the one watching him was making a note special effects were being effective for the audience the smoke dissipated and within the pentagram stood a glowing demon esk could see that this was an actor in a demon suit not a true demon but of course no real demon would have cooperated unless truly compelled by such magic at any rate the figure was suitably horrendous and esk wondered how it had been brought onstage in this manner maybe the smoke had concealed a trapdoor entry ha gotcha the boy exclaimed now you have to do my bidding in response the demon roared and a flame shot out of its mouth esk was delighted that was another marvelous special effect metria had never done that now he wondered whether she could have dragons of the right variety could breathe out flame but he wasnt sure whether demons could do likewise this might be an error the lad visibly daunted by this displaythings were delightfully visible onstagerallied his courage you cant get out of that pentagram until i let you out then as the demon swelled up angrily can you the demon pounded its fist at the air above the pentagram and made vale of the vole it look just as if there were an invisible wall there it tramped around poking at the floor and at the ceiling but met resistance everywhere so determined was it that esk found himself worrying that it would discover some trifling gap in the magic shape so that it could get out and go on a destructive spree but the pentagram was tight the demon could not escape finally it stood still defeated and outraged what do you want dunghead it demanded of the boy esk smiled it was always fun to hear language on stage that it would not be feasible to use in life i want a fine house to live in for the rest of my life a cornucopia that never grows empty and a totally beautiful woman to love me utterly the boy said bravely what this is impossible no its possible i verified it a demon of your power can do these things and i wont let you go until you sign the contract that specifies that you will do them all never the demon swore then stay there forever the lad said and turned his back as if to depart be reasonable the demon cried it takes time and expertise to make a fine house and i know nothing about construction you dont have to make it just get it for me i dont care how you do it esk appreciated the fine point but was losing sympathy for the boy evidently he didnt care who else suffered as long as he got what he wanted cornucopias dont grow on trees you know the demon continued the only one i know of is being used by an orphanage to feed its children i dont care where you get it just bring it to me the boy said esk lost further sympathy and beautiful women dont love folk like you the demon said i may be able to do some physical things but i cant change the heart of a woman find a way the boy said coldly i tell you there is no way i might get a woman to say she loved you but her heart would still be her own esk nodded that demon was making some sense he was almost having some sympathy with it the lad considered on further thought i dont really care whats in vale of the vole her heart just have her completely beautiful and willing to do anything i ask anytime with a smile on her face and her heart can be whatever it wants ah so you will settle for the semblance of a woman provided she performs to your specifications exactly no questions asked then perhaps we can do business the boy passed in the contract and the demon signed the deal had been made the curtain dropped esk spent the brief time between scenes pondering his own situation with the demoness metria he had not summoned her she had come unbidden to his hideout setting off this whole adventure she too had offered him the semblance of a woman a deal to get him to vacate his premises should he have made that deal perhaps this play would help him to come to a conclusion when the curtain lifted again the youth reclined within the openface mockup of a fine house the demon entered from the side carrying a huge cornucopia from which fresh fruits tumbled in the distance came a cry as of a hungry orphan child the demon put the horn of plenty into the youths hands well the youth demanded sir the demon asked respectfully well wheres the woman the semblance of a woman the demon muttered i dont care what you call her the deals not complete until you deliver her and then leave us alone forever you cant do a thing to me because of the contract true sir the demon said i will send in the woman by this time esks sympathy had transferred pretty much to the demon the youth was a spoiled brat while the demon was honoring the letter of his contract the demon walked offstage while the boy pulled luscious fruits from the cornucopia bit once into each and tossed them away reveling in the horns plenty in a moment a truly striking woman walked onstage she undulated in her revealing gown she almost flowed from her long golden tresses to her dainty slippers she was the most luscious creature esk had seen in all his life he was half smitten with her himself foolish as he knew this to be the curse fiends had produced an actress to portray the most totally beautiful woman aliveand she was that vale of the vole i have come to please you you handsome man the woman announced in a sensuous tone the youth looked at her his eyes widened appreciatively youre the one i am the one she said doing a little pirouette that flung her gown out showing a flash of her awesome legs the semblance of the perfect woman youll do anything i want anything she breathed take off your dress as you wish o virile man she said and opened the upper section of her gown as the light dimmed and the curtain came down esk strained to see her body but could catch only the most tantalizing glimpse as the scene was cut off when the curtain lifted again the two were in bed having evidently completed a scene esk wished he could have watched but this was a familyrated play where suggestion was prevalent over reality the youth was asleep the woman awake she stagewhispered in his ear is the contract safe is the contract safe the youth stirred the contract he muttered blearily he lurched up in his nightclothes and lumbered to a cabinet where he drew out the scroll is it the right one is it the right one the woman whispered the youth peered at it i cant read it in this light he exclaimed if anyone stole it and put another paper here he fumbled for a candle and lit it from a live coal in the fireplace almost singeing his fingers he held the candle above the parchment yes its the right one he said peering down does it protect you from the demon does it protect you from the demon the woman whispered he looked more closely finding his place the candle tilted precariously it says said demon shall not harm said beneficiary in any way nor seek to have any other party do so thats tight the demon cant touch me are you sure are you sure the woman whispered sure im sure he said irritably see right here it saysoops for a drop of wax had fallen from the tilting candle landing with a splat on the parchment there was a puff of smoke as the hot wax interacted with the ink with a curse of annoyance the youth grabbed at the solidifying wax vale of the vole with his fingers and yanked it off a bit of the parchment adhered only a spot he muttered where did it strike where did it strike whispered the woman damn it blotted out a word now it says said demon shall harm said beneficiary the word not is gone well now isnt that a coincidence the woman said but she wasnt the woman anymore from the bed rose the horrendous shape of the demon i wonder how that drop of wax could have landed right at that particular spot the youth looked at it with appalled realization you did it he cried you used your magic to make the wax fall right there you cheated i did not harm you the demon said i only guided a little wax so that it would not burn your hand i honored the contract and shall continue to do so you will the youth asked with sudden hope then turn back into the woman but now the wording of that contract has a new directive for me the demon said it directs me to harm you so the youth screamed as the demon advanced menacingly on him but the curtain dropped concealing what happened next the play was over suddenly esk was glad he had not made the deal with metria demons were too clever too slippery the youth in the play had deserved his fate but it was still a scary reminder and the vale of the vole was overrun by demons now esk appreciated volneys quest much more directly they had to get those demons out your visa has expired the magistrate informed him you must now depart but first i must ask my favor esk reminded him oh that very well lets hear it i want the curse fiends help in ridding the vale of the vole of demons get rid of the demons why so that the voles can restore the nice curves to the kissmee river the magistrate laughed what do we care about the voles we have problems enough right here at gateway castle the level of the lake rises and falls erratically alternately flooding our farmlands and dehydrating them our crops suffer and wild animals run amuck we are hardly about to sacrifice valuable manpower to help stupid animals put curves in a stupid river vale of the vole but i served as a good sample audience for two days esk reminded him now you folk know how to tailor those new plays more precisely to your audiences dont you feel you owe me anything the magistrate frowned perhaps there is a small debt owing very well we shall assign you a person to investigate the situation a person esk asked doubtfully im sure she can do what is required the magistrate said with a quirk of a smile she her name is latia she will meet you at the exit esk groaned inwardly how could a single woman help against demons but it seemed that this was the best he could get thank you he said with what grace he could muster the effort strained his own acting ability you will depart these premises in the morning i am authorized to extend to you the appreciation of gateway castle for your service gateway castle is welcome esk said shortly his ability exhausted he had some spare time so he took a tour of the castle the servant wench was happy to guide him the castle was entirely underwater with windows that showed the fish swimming by and in its center was a massive glass wall that circled a depression in the water in fact this was a whirlpool that spun its way savagely down to unseen regions beneath the bottom of the lake but where does it go esk asked no one knows the girl said that was it not only did she not know she was not curious apparently that quality had been largely bred out of the curse fiends the woman was waiting for him at the dock she was ancient her body was stooped and ugly her hair stringy and gray her skin so wrinkled that it almost buried her features well lets get going youngster she snapped uh do you know what i asked for no does it matter esk sighed perhaps it didnt she was unlikely to be of much use regardless they climbed down into the boat and took seats soon a bevy of girls joined them their legs flashing prettily as they descended the ladder say its esk one exclaimed and crone latia another added with distaste dont let it bother you wench the old woman snapped im leaving gateway vale of the vole oh the girl was disconcerted well good luck i guess dont be facetious that dampened things and they rode in silence as the cable hauled the boat to the outer pier then the girls climbed out and headed off to their harvesting duties of the day and esk and latia started on the way to castle roogna i have two pills esk said they will enable us to travel without much resistance so that we can cover the distance in a single day hrnph she remarked ill believe it when i see it so he gave her a pill and took the last one himself and she believed they traveled rapidly northwest but she was old and unable to move as rapidly as he could so they did not get the whole way after all esk tried to hurry her along knowing that their trek on the following day would be much slower he wanted to cover as much as possible while it was easy but she would not be hurried and when the evening came they were still some distance from castle roogna they stopped at a suitable glade near a spring making camp latia mellowed some now that they were well clear of the home of the curse fiends do you know why they assigned me to go with you she asked no i admit to being curious its because they wanted to get rid of me anyway and they believe that i am unlikely to return from such a wild mission she glanced sidelong at him what is the mission to get rid of the demons so that the kissmee river can be made curvy again so that the vale of the vole will be nice she snorted that figures mortals cant do anything about demons unless they get the right talisman and spell and diagram and contract those are known only to the good magician who is as grumpy as i am and they dont necessarily work as advertised i know i saw the play well ill try to help you because thats what im here for but i am obliged to advise you of the risk the risk esk asked you know how we curse fiends all have the same talent that of cursing yes i havent actually seen it in action but i understand it can be pretty bad my grandmother was a curse fiend she was the old woman showed greater interest what was her name vale of the vole i dont know her curse fiend name she married my grandfather an ogre oh that onel i remember her a fine actress but impatient with convention you knew her esk asked amazed of course i knew her how young do you think i am im glad she managed to make a good life for herself you consider marrying an ogre good certainly ogres have their points esk was getting to like this woman better so you dont look down at me because im the grandson of an ogre not if you dont look down on me because of my defective talent defective talent i was about to tell you my liability my curses have become erratic one in three turns out to be a blessing esk laughed a blessing whats wrong with that it interferes with a regular existence once when we were stunning a marauding dragon and combined to hit it with the strongest possible curse my blessing played havoc with the curses and the dragon not only survived it got stronger we were lucky we were close to the pier so that we could escape underwater oh i can see how that would be a problem so if something attacks and i curse it that may only make the situation worse of course the malfunction is fairly regular my last two efforts were good strong curses so i have refrained for six months from making another the magistrate was aware of that and eager to get me away from gateway smart of him esk said cynically maybe you can bless us and make the rest of our journey easy i cant curse or bless myself only others well maybe you should curse me then and if as you say it is really a blessing that would be dragon roulette she said i cant be absolutely sure its a blessing it is merely a strong probability whatever it is it will be extremely powerful because of the accumulated backlog but now esk was thoroughly intrigued ill risk it curse me no there is that element of risk but if you curse me and its a blessing then youll know your next two curses will be true curses and you can depend on them for protection that would be an advantage because we have some rough country still to cover vale of the vole she was thoughtful there may be something in what you say consider it overnight and if you still wish to experiment in the morning ill do it they slept and in the morning it still seemed intriguing to esk so he repeated his request latia hesitated but finally wound up and delivered a round curse there was a wash of something across him that made his hair lift slightly but it wasnt painful thats it esk asked i dont feel better or worse thats strange latia said as mystified as he it never misfired like that before maybe my talent has finally gone into complete remission and i can neither curse nor bless anymore maybe esk agreed with mixed relief and regret well let me do something private then well get moving she nodded curse fiend conventions were akin to the human ones hi this respect rather than the centaur ones and he was just as glad he made his way to a private copse and got ready to do his business the ground gave way beneath his feet too late he realized that the thick brush concealed a sinkhole he flailed trying to catch hold of something to support him but failed then he plunged down into the hole it was a longterm sink not a new one light came down and vines grew everywhere esk slipslid on the smooth enamel surface to the bottom rolling he saw the drain fortunately it was clogged with vines finally he fetched up with his face wedged against a cool surface he blinked and looked it was a hypnogourd and his right eye was right by the peephole before he realized esk had looked inand was caught there his consciousness locked within the gourd only interference in his line of sight to the peephole could break his trance for that was the nature of the gourd it was unlikely that latia would find him in this hidden recess of the ground the sinkhole was invisible from a short distance beyond its rim now at last the nature of latias effort seemed clear it was after all a potent curse its action delayed just long enough to make it truly effective esk was stuck here for the duration chapter diggle v olney swallowed one of the strength pills ivy had given him donned his heavyduty talons and started digging the result was amazing the earth flew back and he made progress at twice his normal rate if he had had a pill like this when they were trying to pass the chasm in the illusory mountain on the way to the good magicians castle he would have been able to bore way down below the level of the water and pass under it how nice of the little human girl to do him this favor he was not really partial to human folk but he did like esk and now this child he was headed for the realms of the lesser voles the kingdom of voles in xanth comprised all manner of digging creatures ranging from the monstrous diggles to the minuscule wiggles larvae with various shades of squiggles between back in the dawn of creation so it was said the demon l ho maker of earth devised all the species to inhabit the fertile region between the flighty surface and the depressive depths the huge diggles took the large expanses of rock far down and the swift squiggles took the loose superficial earth and the wiggles took the limited veins of superhard metallic stone lithos chosen creatures were the voles and they were granted their choice of all the regions of the earth and they prospered beyond any of the others so while all the digging creatures were technically voles the voles of the vale were the archetypes the envy of all others but litho had reckoned without the demons just as the voles differed in type and degree so did the demons the original demons were omnipotent entities but the lesser demons were mere nuisances bearing about the same relation to litho as a worm did to a vole unfortunately both worm and demon could be a lot of mischief in the wrong place that was of course what had started volney on his quest for assistance if only the good human magician had been home volney made excellent progress but he had a way to go for first he sought the largest creatures the diggles they tunneled without using vale of the vole claws boring through the rock magically they could leave a tunnel behind or leave the rock as solid as it was before depending on their mood normally they left it solid so that they could have the pleasure of boring through it again and again if they agreed to come to the vale and bore the demons would be unable to prevent them because a tunneling diggle was physically insubstantial indeed the diggles would be able to bore new and curvaceous channels for the river faster than the demons could straighten them the demons would have to give up the futile effort and find another place to reside he reached the deep level of the diggles now all he had to do was intercept one and ask it to take him to its leader easier thought than done he had no notion of the schedule on which individual diggles traveled he would just have to wait until one passed within hailing range meanwhile time to eat he had brought some fruit from above he was developing a taste for it when the vale was restored he would have to see about harvesting fruits and nuts there he doffed his heavy digging claws and ate after a bit his little ears perked voles did not depend to a great extent on sound but at times it could be important there was some type of scraping in the tunnel he had left behind he listened carefully trying to identify the source of that sound if some predator from above had happened on his tunnel and was pursuing him he would have to fight he had of course plugged the end of it so that no creature would encounter it by chance but a predator such as a big serpent could sniff it out actually the advantage would be volneys here deep in the rock because the predator could not maneuver and volneys artificial talons could gouge flesh as readily as stone very few creatures preyed on voles in the deep earth it would be another matter on the surface where space was unlimited and predators could grow to enormous size that was why voles normally stayed clear of the surface besides the light was too bright up there he wondered how the surface creatures were able to stand it only his volish ability to change his fur and eyes for the surface conditions permitted him to handle it now in his brown subterranean coat and gray lenses for maximum effect in near darkness he was more comfortable but this did not sound like a snake it seemed to consist of many tiny scrapings as of insect legs suddenly he realized what it was nickelpedes this was disaster he could not use his talons effectively against those little predators nickelpedes were too small and numerous they would vale of the vole scramble under his defense and start gouging nickelsized disks from his tender anatomy it was not possible to reason with them all they knew was hunger his tunnel down must have passed close to one of their nests so that they heard him and scouted about until they found his hole now they were on his trail following the tunnel to its end which was where he was he could not hope to escape them by dashing back up his tunnel they would swarm over his body as he passed he could not hide from them in the darkness for they needed no light indeed bright light killed them they were guided by touch and smell as he was and they could go anywhere he could dig he would have to go forward if he intersected another tunnel he could go along it and outrun them for they were too small to travel rapidly but what other tunnel would there be here he was below the normal vole level into the diggle level and the diggles had left this rock solid he could tell by the sound of it when he tapped he would have to dig his own tunnel and that would slow him down to nickelpede velocity eventually he would tire even if he took another strength pill and they would catch him and feed on him his situation was abruptly desperate the noise grew louder one nickelpede had outdistanced the pack and was homing in on him volney donned his enhanced talons oriented and struck savagely down his sonarlocation was accurate the claw speared the nickelpede killing it the things were hard to kill the strike had to be just right and with sufficient power or it merely bounced off their hard shells one downthousands to go he had to move he took another pill immediately the strength spread through him he resumed digging knowing that this would only prolong the chase he was too far from the surface to reach it before tiring and slowing and getting caught and indeed the pedes might well be faster than he traveling up but he couldnt just wait to get eaten alive if only a diggle would come then he could hitch a ride and be phased through the rock as if it were air and the miniature monsters would just have to clack their pincers emptily and remain hungry but there was a characteristic sound the diggles made when traveling and that sound was not here he could not depend on finding a diggle the rock fairly flew out behind him normally he let the debris accumulate behind blocking the tunnel loosely but the nickelpedes would have no trouble navigating this they would simply scramble through the crevices between the fragmented rocks a serpent he could have balked vale of the vole somewhat by packing the plug more tightly and then striking at its emerging nose small size was an advantage to the little gougers if only he could pack it so tightly as to make it completely solid againbut that was beyond his power it was a maxim among his kind only magic could restore bored rock he paused for a moment listening the sound was there pursuing all he had done was maintain his lead or perhaps improve on it a little he had to have some better way but what better way was there his thinking was going in circles circles then he had a notion he wasnt sure it would work but it might certainly he had to try it he resumed his digging forging through the rock not even trying to make a plug behind he wanted velocity even though the nickelpedes might gain he dug in a curve bearing left he stayed on the same level that was important in due course he could tell by his sense of location and the manner the rock ahead vibrated that he was about to intersect his own tunnel he dug until only the thinnest wall separated the two then he reached up and excavated a hole in the top forming a vertical tunnel he made this go straight up for a short distance then curved it to the level above the original tunnel he worked as quickly as he could though he was tiring he had little time to spare then just as the first of the nickelpedes caught up to the end of the lower tunnel he scooted back down he speared the nickelpede with a claw and threw its body back then he resumed digging quickly breaking through the thin wall and making a complete intersection of tunnels at the bottom level there were nickelpedes massed in the other tunnel of course they turned smelling him and poured back into his new opening but volney scrambled up and away the moment the breakthrough was complete into his vertical hole he made the turn to the horizontal level then stuffed refuse into it plugging it behind him so that what remained was a hole up that dead ended now he settled down and waited resting if this worked he had saved himself if not it worked the nickelpedes were not the smartest of creatures they were tracking him mostly by following the tunnel as long as it smelled of him they would pursue it to its end it was a system that was normally effective but now the tunnel was a loop and so it never ended they were going around and around forever if any tried the hole in the ceil vale of the vole ing they stopped when they discovered that it went nowhere obviously he wasnt there some few might work their way through the plug and reach his hideout but those few he could spear with the talon the great majority were stuck in the trap he had devised circularity volney rested recovering his strength it was important that he not attract attention to himself if he moved too much the nickelpedes might feel the vibration and start searching for it a few did come through to him and these he did quietly spear when he was sure he was sensitized to their entry he slept any coming through would wake him long enough for spearing then finally he heard a diggle his wait was over it no longer mattered if the nickelpedes became aware of him he started digging going in a direction that would put him directly hi the path of the diggle when he got there he waited the diggle was traveling slowly its wormlike nose projected into the chamber volney had formed ho dig he cried in the language common to all the members of the great family of voles the magic of xanth made communication intelligible to all the members of a particular group such as the voles or the humanoids or the dragons unfortunately it did not do the same between groups which was why volney was unusual he had learned the humanoid mode it had been a terrible struggle to master the peculiar conventions of the alien system but he had persevered and succeeded better than the other voles hi the class they had known that the good magician was humanoid so this study had been a necessity if only they had also known that the good magician would be absent meanwhile the diggle had been considering diggles were not especially rapid of wit now it responded ho vole it replied take me to your leader it considered again where is your song oh yesdiggles liked songs unfortunately that was not volneys strength what should he do a nickelpede scrambled up behind him his activity had attracted their attention and now the little monsters were working up another horde song volney cried in the humanoid mode song song sooongg and the diggle was satisfied it was too slow to realize that this was not a very good song volney climbed onto the diggles cylindrical back and dug in his talons this was necessary to hold his position the diggles skin was so vale of the vole thick and tough that it suffered no discomfort songsongsoonnggsong volney continued getting into the swing of it the diggle resumed its motion phasing through the rock and the crowding nickelpedes as if both were fog it made a turn orienting on the diggle leader soon they were there the leader being old no longer phased readily through rock so preferred to remain in a network of physical diggings volney was well satisfied with this it put him on the same footing i come to ask diggle assistance for the voles he said in voletalk but the voles talk only to themselves the leader protested indeed it was said among the digging species that the squiggles talked only to the diggles and the diggles talked only to the voles and the voles ignored them that situation has changed slightly volney explained he went on to tell of the problem in the vale of the vole so you wish us to go and bore out new curves to make the river friendly again exactly the demons cannot stop you because you are insubstantial when you bore the diggle leader pondered after the fashion of his type after an hour he replied we diggles have no quarrel with the demons and would not wish to antagonize them therefore we shall not interfere in this business disappointment smote volney he knew that this decision was final i thank you for your consideration he said heavily but perhaps the squiggles will have another attitude the diggle said they are smaller than we and move more rapidly so their minds are more flexible i will give you a guide so that you may seek their leader i thank you for that notion volney replied he had planned to ask the squiggles next anyway but this would make it easier the diggle gave him a pebble the taste will guide you volney took the pebble and put it in his mouth he made a circle when he faced one way the taste became increasingly good when he faced another it became bad no problem understanding this guide he bid parting to the diggle leader and set off toward the good taste the route to his surprise was level rather than upward the squiggles normally lived very close to the surfaceso close that they often deposited their refuse dirt on the surface instead of having it plug the tunnel deep rock wasnt their specialty as they liked to bore with blinding speed the light dirt and unplugged tunnels contributed to their velocity dense hard rock inhibited them well maybe there was a deep valley or vale of the vole an offshoot from the gap chasm that brought the surface down to this level the squiggle leadership might indeed prefer to reside in such a secluded region it was growing warmer volney found himself panting surface creatures such as humanoids and centaurs had a crass way to dissipate heat they exuded moisture from their skin and this liquid evaporated and cooled them this led to residues on their bodies and in their fur or clothing that built up a typical and not necessarily delightful odor voles like most other creatures did it more delicately by sticking out their tongues and letting the breeze take the heat however it had to be conceded that there were times when the humanoids allover bath of sweat might do the job better he paused so as to abate his bodys generation of excess heat but the heat remained it was radiating at him from the stone that was surprising this was supposed to be a cool level where was it coming from surely the squiggles didnt like it this hot he turned awaybut immediately the pebble in his mouth turned foul that was not the direction so he faced forward again and resumed boring the heat increased and now there were rumblings in the rock whose nature he didnt trust he had heard of volcanoes which were great local upheavals from the heated depths could one of those be in the vicinity yet why would the squiggles choose to live in such a dangerous region as he finally felt the pattern of an opening in the rock the heat was almost unbearable just in time he broke through and popped into a large subterranean cavern he paused again there was no sign of the squiggles the arches and chambers were entirely natural as were the irregular grooves in the floor which seemed to have been nade by the dripping of hot liquid from the ceiling the floor was actually cooler than the ceiling the drippings had solidified into layers of colored stone that in light would surely be rather pretty the source of the heat was above yet that was where the pebble indicated the squiggles were when he lifted his head it turned sweet when he sniffed the floor it turned sour this was strange indeed well either he accepted the validity of his guidestone or he didnt volney lifted himself on his hind feet and reached up to dig into the ceiling the stone here was relatively soft and his talons quickly gouged out a fairsized hole in fact the digging became easier as he progressed and soon he was able to lift himself into the new hole wedge his hind feet against the stone sides and pull out big globs from above vale of the vole but it was also getting hotter volneys tongue was lolling against his fur inadequate he could not remain in this environment much longer he gave one final swoop with his talons then slid back down he had to cool the rock above sagged then melted a gob of it dropped volney barely dodged it this stuff was molten he landed on the relatively cool floor panting more hot rock dropped from the hole splatting against the floor it was getting worse surely there could be nothing up there fit for a living creature to exist in something gave way then lava poured out of the hole so hot it glowed illuminating the cavern the layered stone was indeed pretty the moment before it was buried under congealing lava volney scooted back and the pebble hi his mouth gave him a nasty taste something was definitely wrong that pebble was guiding him into a scorching death hi a pool of molten rock had he not quickly retreated from the hole he was boring he would have been fried aliveand now that he was retreating to safety the pebble was objecting but the lava gave him no time to consider the implications more of it was pouring down hotter yet and increasingly liquid and bright it flowed across the floor filling a channel volney decided to forget the foul taste of the pebble and retreat the way he had come but by a most unfortunate mischance the lava was now flowing hi a channel between him and his hole it had cut him offl should he try to tunnel under it the floor was cooler than the ceiling so he might do this but the way the stuff was flowing he had no certainty that it wouldnt flow into the hole he bored and catch hull there he couldnt risk that had he been a jumping creature like chex centaur he could have hurdled it and gotten away but he was not that channel narrow as it was had become an absolute barrier to him he would get severely burned just approaching it he looked back at the hole in the ceiling it had become a fountain of lava the fluid splattering down and spreading out along several channels like the tentacles of a glowing kraken soon he would be blocked off from escape in any other direction he hurried in the only direction he could go past the glowing column of falling lava and down the slight incline of the floor of the cavern there was a bright channel of lava on his right picking its way along suddenly the lava veered toward him volney froze alarmed had he not stopped the lava would have singed his feet for it had gone right into vale of the vole the channel he was in then feeling the renewed heat of its closeness he stepped left to get around it the lava flowed left cutting him off volney paused again that was almost as if the lava flowed back toward him volney came as close as a vole could to jumping he lifted his front feet clear of the reaching lava and stretched to the left then dropped his front feet and sort of hunched his rear feet into them the lava puddled where his feet had been a tiny patch of shed hair puffed into smoke as the molten rock touched it he ran on getting around the lava but now a new channel was converging from the left he dodged right and the first string of lava resumed its forward flow about to intercept him again it was the lava was actively seeking him out trying to catch him it was limited because it had to flow downhill or on the level but so was he volney scrambled between the converging channels and managed to get beyond just before they met this was getting very uncomfortable he ran on down but the several channels of fire paced him they were definitely trying to trap himand if this cavern ended he would have no way to escape there was no time to cut a new hole for himself assuming he could reach a wall there were lava lines between him and any wall he saw if he tried to dig out through the floor the lava would simply pour in after him he had no further doubt of that the ceilingno he could not risk thatl he saw a flicker ahead oh nomore lava in fact more lines of lava coming from the other direction he was caught between them doomed then he realized that the fire ahead was a reflection there was water therea subterranean lake it filled a depression in this part of the cavern and bubbled gently and volney couldnt swim he came to the lip of it and dipped a paw the water was pleasantly cool the bubbling was from air coming up through it not from boiling it wasnt deep the light of the lava shone right through showing that this was really only a large puddle he could just about wade through it if he had to the lava poured down twin tentacles stretching forth to hiss against the lake to his left and right now he had no choice he had to wade he waded in and the lava did not it didnt like the water and drew back angrily at the brink hardening he felt the bubbles passing up around his body innocently tickling him reprieve at last then the light brightened volney looked back and saw with horror vale of the vole that a huge sheet of lava was sliding down behind him it intended to press right on through the lake boiling it away so that it could finally nail its prey he had to get beyond but he could not already streamers of lava were flowing around the lake to either side enclosing it volney tried to wade faster but saw that he was too slow by the time he crossed the lava would meet itself at the far side and the escape route would be gone if only he could swim then he could move rapidly enough through the water he tried splashing valiantly but only succeeded in causing an enraged hissing at the rim as the splashes landed it was no good he could not make sufficient progress he had lost this race he looked up that was worse not only was the ceiling out of his reach here it was beginning to glow on its own that meant that the main mass of this molten monster was closing in from its horrendous pool ready to melt through and drop directly on him was there no escape above and around was doom below was water he would drown if he tried to hide under the surface he would burn if he did not but there was one chance volney didnt even pause to consider how well it might work since it was his only course he plunged in literally he took a breath and ducked below the water one of the reasons he couldnt swim was that he was too dense to float his feet were always on the bottom voles had to be dense in order to bore through rock now this property of his body served him well he was able to dig in the bottom much as if he were digging into dry ground he scooped out the muck and soon encountered the firm stone below this pond was a mere puddle an accumulation at a low spot but the bubbles were still coming up the stone was porous and water and air extended down into it that was now important he did as much as he could on one breath then flipped over and poked his head out of the water the ring of fire was flaring higher and the ceiling was glowing not much time remained volney took another breath and ducked down again he bored down farther stirring up muck so that the water was cloudy it was fortunate that he required only the sensation of touch not vision he got as far as he could then shot up again for more air this continued breath by breath the hole deepened rapidly but the deadly lava loomed closer the edge of the pool was hissing steadily as the lava encroached destroying it in steam soon the lava would make its major move and overwhelm the pond entirely volney dug as deep as he could then curved his tunnel as he had vale of the vole when leaving the circle for the nickelpedes he dug horizontally then slanted up it was getting harder to make progress on a breath because of the time it took him to crawl along but if this worked it worked the bubbling air was catching in the upper part of the new tunnel forming a bubble rather than pushing on through the rock right away air like water generally took the easiest course each time volney returned there was a larger bubble until at last it was large enough for him to fit his snout into and breathe now he no longer had to retreat all the way to the surface of the pond he could recharge right here that was just as well because at last the lava was striking there was such a horrendous hissing that he heard it right through the rock he could no longer go back there volney continued his boring operating from his new base the work was faster now because of his closer air supply he had a lot of work to do yet and he was not yet safe from the lava but he knew that the corner had been turned he was on his way to escape now he pondered the matter of the guide pebble it had led him exactly wrong how could that be had the diggle leader betrayed him and sent him to his death in the riving lava he found that hard to accept diggles were slow but honest if only because the complexities of deception were too much for them to manage this pebble was an example a diggle could not understand intricate directions and would inevitably get lost if it depended on instructions but the pebbles were easy to understand just proceed toward the good taste even the most wormwitted diggle could follow that system when it got where it was going it could take a new pebble that would guide it to the new destination the smarter diggles would see to the distribution of the pebbles thus directing traffic the diggle leader had done for volney what it did for its own kind given him a pebble oriented on his particular destination how then could it have directed him so badly he really needed to understand because he wanted no more encounters with lava flows was it a bad stone yet it seemed to be working well just wrong it had guided him to doom not to his destination to the very place diggles as well as voles should avoid at all costs the pebble must be operating in reverse it must have sweetened on the forbidden region and soured on the proper one yet why should this be he considered and concluded that he must have run afoul of a difference in taste diggles were wormlike and their idea of a feast was a vein of coal voles were more like the surface creatures and they preferred sweet foods so to a diggle bitter or sour might be positive while sweet vale of the vole could represent spoilage the pebble had been warning him with an eversweeter taste that he was going wrong but he had misunderstood what a difference taste could make this minor distinction between diggles and voles had very nearly killed him volney oriented on the bad taste it was an awful experience but he was glad to do it now at last he was going right he hoped soon enough he arrived at the squiggle headquarters here the creatures were as much smaller than he as the diggles had been larger they were correspondingly more alert he did not have to wait for one to come along they tunneled out to meet him what brings you here o volish one they inquired quivering their whiskers expectantly at him volney explained that he was seeking help for the vale of the vole their leader was apologetic but explained that though he personally would like to help he hardly knew how and that there were elements among them that thought that it was high time the lordly voles were brought down to smaller tunnels he was the soul of discretion but it was evident that there was considerable resentment of the voles historically by those who had had to yield the best pastures to them and that history extended into the present thus the squiggles probably would not have helped had they had the ability to volney really couldnt blame them however the squiggles said they would be happy to give him a pebble to guide him to the nearest wiggle who happened to be a female in quest of a mate volney demurred voles had no truck with wiggles take the pebble anyway they urged in case he changed his mind so volney avoiding rudeness accepted the pebble and put it in his travel pouch then with heavy gizzard because of his failure to find help volney bored toward the surface he broke ground some distance from his starting place deep in the surface jungle and changed to his surface suit and eyes because he had a good sense of direction he knew where castle roogna was he did not really enjoy pottering along on the surface but it was faster than tunneling and he did not have a great deal of time left his nether excursions had taken most of his week he reached the agreed rendezvous spot in the orchard on schedule chex was already there and so was little ivy who it seemed was always to be found where things were happening heress volney ivy cried gladly running up to give him a hug he wasnt sure how she managed that but she did wheres esk he asked vale of the vole chex spread her hands there hass been no ssign of him she said with the hiss of the surface folk but im ssure hess on the way they exchanged stories of their searches volney was amazed to learn that she had not only entered the gourd but had done so physically i did not think that was possible he remarked oh ssure ivy said eagerly ive done it i had a night mare sshoe that let me go in and i came out at the good magicianss casstle but i losst it lost the castle volney asked startled the mare sshoe dummy too bad causse itss ssort of interesting in the gourd if you can sstand the icky sstuff like the bug housse and the lake of casstor oil theress a garden of candy and that sshould be no horror to you chex exclaimed well it wass causse i think if i ate any id maybe get caught forever in there so i had to pass it by and that was the awfullesst thing i ever did chex smiled understanding the gourd iss the repossitory of bad dreamss she reminded ivy yeah then as chex began to speak yess and a giggle time passed but esk did not return now the tune for rendezvous was past and they were getting alarmed if ssomething happenednot that anything could have chex said nervously yes volney agreed as nervously we might go out to meet him if hess a little late where for esk could have taken any route to lake ogrechobee and any route back they had virtually no chance of intercepting him then an old woman staggered up ah a winged ccentaur and an exxtinct vole she exclaimed you musst be esskss friendss we are the three of them chorused i am latia of the cursse fiendss i curssed him without meaning to and now hess losst i looked all over but could not find him sso finally i came here hoping that you would know how to locate him volney looked at chex esklost theress a finder sspell in the arssenal ivy exclaimed ill get it for you volney relaxed maybe it would be all right after all chapter gourd csk found himself in a tangled mixture of glade and jungle that was strange in ways he could not quite fathom about one thing he was not confused he was in the world of the gourd he had never been here before but his father had warned him about it when a person looked into the peephole his spirit entered the gourd and could not escape it until some other person came and broke his line of sight if no one came he would remain indefinitely and his body would slowly starve according to smash it could be a lot of fun in the gourd but smash was half ogre and what an ogre thought was fun was not necessarily what esk would he had been smitten by the curse and fallen in a sink and landed against a gourd that meant that latia would have trouble finding him and might fail since her curse really had been a curse instead of a blessing and it was by her own estimate a singularly potent one it meant she probably would fail he was in deep trouble could he escape on his own he struggled to remember what else smash had said about the gourd it was the home of the night mares who were the couriers of bad dreams the mares delivered them to deserving sleepers and could pass freely in and out no other creature could except by means of the peephole well perhaps he could find a night mare and ask her to help him if she went out and put a dream in latias head that showed exactly where he was then the old woman could locate him this would take time but at least it was a chance it seemed to him that there was some terrible price that a mare required for such assistance though what was it he couldnt remember well he would find out in due course where could he find a night mare smash had said something about a pasture where they grazed somewhere beyond a haunted house and a city of moving buildings where the brassies lived esk didnt know what a vale of the vole brassy might be but hoped he would recognize it if he saw it so he would start looking for those things now he examined his environment more closely he perceived an assortment of paths all tangled together like a helping of spaghetti did one of them lead to the haunted house or the brassies or the night mares there was one way to find out he set foot on the clearest path and walked along it the tangled terrain seemed to retreat slightly reorienting to accommodate the perspective of the path he had chosen but esk was cautious he distrusted as a matter of principle any path that was too easy because that was exactly the kind that could lead to a and there it was a tangle tree just as he had feared esk backed offand discovered that this was a oneway path it was clear and open ahead and did not exist behind the brush had closed in girt with glistening thorns and slimecoated leaves in normal xanth such foliage would be dangerous here in the gourd it was surely worse he hesitated certainly he did not wish to go forward into the tangler but he couldnt go back and the sides looked no more inviting the tangle tree had no such concern already it was reaching for him with its tentacles they were stout and green and moved with a dismaying sinuousness this was the largest and most aggressive tangle tree he had encountered the stuff of a bad dream a bad dream of course the gourd was the repository of horrible dreams the night mares surely came here to pick up the dreams of tanglers which they then carried to the xanthside sleepers dreams like other forms of art required effective original models maybe this would be a good place to stay so that when a mare came he could ask her to take his message the first tentacle reached for his face esk ducked but it pursued him the tip of it caught in his hair and coiled it tight drawing him up esk drew his hunting knife he reached up and sliced off the tip of the tentacle freeing his hair green goo spurted from the severed tentacle ooo the tree groaned then wrathfully it intensified its effort six more tentacles swooped in esk knew he couldnt fight all these off with his knife so he ducked under and ran in the direction that surprised the tree straight down the path toward it behind him the path dissolved and the jungle closed in just in time to get grabbed by the tentacles that had aimed at esk suddenly the tangler was in a struggle with the thorn vines and poison slime leaves horror against horror esk ran on directly into the embrace vale of the vole of the tree while the tree was distracted by the outside action tanglers like most vegetation were not unduly bright once launched into a grab they tended to fight it through without regard to the nature of what they had grabbed the path led right to the huge wooden maw of the tree which was now grimacing with concentration above it was a bole that opened into a giant eye normal tanglers did not have eyes as far as he knew but this was no normal plant this was a bad dream esk stopped hoping the eye would not spy him there was the sound of tearing the tentacles ripped out the thorn and slime plants by their pallid roots and hauled them into the wooden orifice the tree took a big biteand of course got a mouthful of thorn and slime now was as good a time as any to sneak away esk sheathed his knife and started out on another path one of several that led in to the tree but the moment his foot touched it it vanished these were all one way in how could he get out he would have to use his magic he chose another path and as his foot came down on it he murmured no this balked the paths natural inclination and it remained as it was esk had not thought to use his talent quite this way before and hadnt been sure it would work in the gourd he was now reassured the path gradually diminished as it got farther from the tree and finally petered out amidst a confusion that was similar or identical to the one he had started at he had accomplished next to nothing apart from ascertaining that the easiest path was not necessarily the best he looked at the other paths that now offered they couldnt all lead to tangle trees because tanglers were notoriously isolationist they reserved hunting territories and resisted encroachment by others of their kind he shrugged and stepped across to the best looking of the other paths it couldnt lead to a worse evil than the last again the surroundings reformulated to accommodate the new perspective and it seemed that this was the only natural path for any person to take but esk was more cautious than before he turned around and followed it back the way he had come it did not vanish it was a twoway path good he turned again and proceeded in his original direction soon enough he discovered its bad dream this was a monstrous kraken the nefarious seaweed monster that snared unwary swimmers but this one was swimming in the air above the path its vale of the vole tentacles were just as long and sinuous as those of the tangle tree and had saucershaped suckers even as he spied it it spied him it floated toward him tentacles reaching esk drew his knife again knowing that this was hardly a threat to a creature such as this he ran along the path knowing that escape would not be feasible either he was correct on both counts the kraken paced him without seeming effort its tentacles extending toward him in a leisurely manner it knew it had him it was supremely unworried about his effort either to fight or to escape he could tell it no of course but esk was annoyed by these troubleleading paths and now that annoyance burst into anger as the tentacles touched him he sheathed his knife and tackled them barehanded his ogre strength manifested he caught one tentacle and squeezed it and its sucker to a painful pulp he caught another and yanked violently the kraken reacted as had the tree keening in momentary pain then throwing half a dozen more tentacles into the fray this time esk did not avoid them he grabbed them and tied them into knots he knew he was talcing out his private frustration on a weed that was only trying to do its job but his ogre nature didnt care nothing in its right mind messed with an ogre very soon the kraken had had enough the bad dream had turned on it it jerked away and fled leaving esk in command of the path he relaxed feeling a bit guilty he should have told the weed no and passed on unmolested he should not have taken out his frustration at being trapped in the world of the gourd on a relatively innocent creature soon he came to the end of the path it simply stopped and the mess of thorns and poison slime resumed so he reversed and followed it to its other endwhich terminated similarly this was a path that went nowhere it was simply the krakens run again he had gained nothing well there were other paths he walked back toward the center of the limited one he was on casting his gaze about until he saw another that departed at right angles he found a stick and used it to push the thorns and slimes to one side and stepped carefully across the perspective shifted again centering on the new path the one he had just left was now almost invisible and what he could see of it seemed twisted while it had been fairly straight before the floating kraken was nowhere to be seen this was certainly a deceptive region this present path wound pleasantly around and down following a vale of the vole contour he had not noted before soon it presented a clear spring whose water sparkled without moving if esk had not known that this was the region of bad dreams his experiences with the other two paths would have warned him he did not trust this water at all obviously the traveler was intended to drink from it what was the trap what could be so bad about it that it was part of the source region for sleeping horrors he heard a commotion something was coming down the path he stepped carefully off it avoiding the big thorns and made himself as inconspicuous as he could it was a desperate bunny fleeing a gross slavering wolf the bunny hopped down the path its soft pink ears thrown back by the wind of its velocity its little nose quivering the wolf charged straight after fangs bared esk would have stopped the wolfs pursuit by telling it no but the pair was moving so fast that both animals were by him before he worked up the thought he simply had to watch as the bunny made it to the spring and leaped in barely avoiding the wolf who screeched to a halt at its brink apparently baddream wolves did not like water so the bunny was safe but the bunny having plunged into the water suffered a transformation its appearance didnt really change but its aspect did it emitted a peculiar keening growl then swam purposefully toward the waiting wolf who seemed hardly to believe its luck the crazy bunny was returning to its jaws the bunny scrambled to shore and shook itself it growled again and its eyes blazed red it bared its teeth then it leaped on the wolf who was so surprised it didnt move the bunnys teeth snapped closed on one of the wolfs ears and its two feet thumped hard against the wolfs nose the bunny was savagely attacking the wolf the wolf amazed leaped back the ear tore free of the bunnys teeth leaving a splatter of blood the bunny leaped again toward thewolf teeth snapping the wolf should have been able to dispatch the bunny but its confusion was such that it turned tail and fled the bunny pursuing esk watched as amazed as the wolf what was in that water the bunnys nose wiggled the creature paused winding esk it stopped turning toward him it growled again and its eyes ignited it leaped no esk cried the bunny was in midair so could not change course but it did change its mind instead of biting esk it simply landed against his chest and vale of the vole immediately jumped off then it resumed its progress up the path following the wolf esk looked at the spring there was only one thing he could think of to account for what he had seen he knew of love springs that caused any creature drinking them to fall violently in love with the next creature of the opposite sex it encountered it was understood that the most prominent crossbreeds had arisen because of the intercession of love springs centaurs harpies merfolk and so on but here in this realm of bad dreams this must be the opposite a hate spring thus the bunny had imbibed and been filled with such hate that it had lost all fear of the wolf it had hated esk too it was no longer gentle and frightened now it was vicious and bold its personality had changed radically esk concluded that he did not want to drink from that spring he walked slowly back along the path seeking some other route he had tried three obvious wellformed paths and each had led him to mischief it was time to change his approach what about a hidden devious path he almost missed it the path was so inconspicuous that it was virtually lost in the tangle it might not be a path at all but he decided to try it he stepped carefully across once more the perspective shifted and the path became more evident but it was in poor repair and was so convoluted as to seem to make loops in places brush overhung it and stones intruded on it he had to watch his step every step was it worth it he decided that it was after all if nothing had used this path recently then it probably was not being maintained by some monster for a bad dream its very difficulty made it safer he proceeded with improving confidence then abruptly he encountered a human skeleton it lay athwart the path its skull on one side its leg bones on the other there was no flesh remaining on it at all esk sighed obviously this path is not safe either he said this poor fellow he touched a hipbone with the toe of his boot the skeleton stirred esk leaped back though he knew that he had probably just caused the bones to shift and collapse after all bones could not move on their own the skeleton twisted around and sat up esk retreated farther it was moving the skeleton got to its feet somewhat unsteadily all right esk exclaimed ill vacate your pathl i dont need to fight another bad dream vale of the vole the skull turned on the neck bones and the hollow eye sockets oriented on him you found me the toothy jawbone asked i found you and now ill leave you esk agreed really im not looking for trouble just for a way out of here no need to chase me please keep me the skeleton said its lower jaw moved as it spoke esk wasnt sure how it could speak with no flesh to guide the air but it did keep you esk asked blankly what for so i will no longer be lost you are lost i thought you were dead no im lost the skeleton said firmly this is the lost path how can a path be lost when no one finds it the skeleton said please i must find my way back to the haunted garden but i cannot unlose myself take me by the hand and help me be found esks initial horror of the skeleton was fading after all this was the place of bad dreams and the skeleton was no worse than others but im lost too no i can see you are of mortal vintage you must be peeping uh yes esk agreed i fell and my eye came up against a hypnogourd im trying to find a night mare so she can take a message out so that my line of sight can be broken but until then im stuck here yes you are only temporarily mislaid but i am properly lost therefore i must plead for your help if you do not unlose me i may never recover my station your station i am part of the skeletal set adjacent to the haunted house some horrendous ogre came through and that was my father esk exclaimed remembering what smash had said the skeleton drew away from him with alarm oh no i thought you might be a rescuer wait skeleton esk said quickly i suppose if my father was the cause of your getting lost i should try to get you found whats your name marrow the skeleton said my names esk then somewhat awkwardly he extended his hand the skeleton took it oh thank you esk i will make it up to you i am lost but i do know something of the environs if there is any way i can be of assistance vale of the vole i think you have already helped me esk said disengaging from the bones of the hand as quickly as he could do so without affront i was looking for the haunted uh set because my father mentioned it if i can find that maybe i can follow his route to the pasture of the night mares that certainly might be true marrow said with bony enthusiasm i cannot tell you the way because i am lost but i can tell you anything else about it and im sure my associates will have information good lets get going but the skeleton hung back you must take my hand i can not unlose myself oh esk took the hand again realizing that he had to follow the strange rules of this place actually the bones were firm and dry not slimy as he had feared do you know the proper direction alas no marrow said when that ogre started throwing bones no offense intendedi fled and i lost track of location i tried to find my way back but somehow i had stumbled onto this path and that was it i have remained lost ever since finally i just lay down to rest my weary bones so to speak and then you came but once you were on the path it wasnt lost any more esk said so you should have been able to find your way out not so once i was on it i became part of it because i did not find it i merely stumbled on it im not sure i did much better i tried three other paths and all were bad so then i looked for a different kind and found it marrow exclaimed so you are not lost even though you cannot directly escape this world you can find your way from this path are you sure of that no marrow confessed esk shrugged the thesis made as much sense as anything else and it was more encouraging to believe in the chance of escape than in the lack of any chance the jungle thinned becoming more like a forest that was a relief esk felt more at home in forest perhaps he was finding the way out if he returned marrow to the garden of the walking skeletons and if one of the others did know the way to the pasture of the night mares something bounded away startling him it looked like a mundane deer but it was bright red what was that only a roe marrow said didnt you see the color yes thats why i couldnt be sure what it was roes are red marrow said i thought everyone knew that vale of the vole i happen to be a stranger here esk said somewhat shortly they came to a potted plant it was bright blue and had knobs on the ends of its stems as they approached it lifted the knobs menacingly obviously it intended to punch at anyone who came too close what is that a violent marrow said didnt you note the color oh i see esk said irritated roes are red violents are blue i think hes got it marrow exclaimed just who are you talking to the violent of course didnt you hear i guess i dont speak the local dialect what does it say it says it isnt its fault it got lost they were planting violents on the median strips between major paths but they rejected this one and threw it away esk began to have some sympathy for the blue plant why did they reject it because they didnt want any more violents on the media oh he should have known that no explanation would make much sense here they continued along the path in due course they had to pass under a kind of woven vine that seemed to have eyeballs set into it say isnt that an eye queue esk asked my father encountered one of those it made him very smart for a while whats it doing here maybe i can find out marrow said he reached out caught the vine and set it on the top of his skull it says it was lost from the lexicon he reported the lexicon whats that the eye queue says that some ass from mundania came through with a secretary and listed all the things of xanthexcept the eye queue vine so the vine is lost too bad esk said now nobody will be smart marrow stepped out from under the vine and it fell back into place over the path apparently it could not become a part of the skull probably because there was no brain to enhance farther along was a little squiggly thing hardly large enough to see whats that esk asked a lost vitamin i think let me see marrow put out a finger bone to touch the thing yes vitamin f whats it for oh it has potent fect potent effect vale of the vole f you make the right fort lets find vitamin x instead esk said grimly then maybe we can become xpert in finding the xit if it xists xactly marrow agreed not catching esks irony they continued past other lost items a lost fossil bone that marrow greatly admired as it was of a species of creature unknown in xanth or mundania whose discovery would revolutionize the understanding of both a lost band of the rainbow more wonderful than any other a lost stream of consciousness and a lost dire strait esk would have found all these things considerably more interesting if he hadnt been so acutely concerned about finding his way out of the gourd before his body got into trouble in xanth suppose a dragon sniffed it out he could wake up to find himself chomped then they came to a young woman sitting in a bath she was of metallic hue and quite nicely proportioned esk could tell because her only clothing seemed to be a metallic halter covering her front she jumped up as they approached oh good she exclaimed found at last uh hello esk said trying to keep his eyes above the level of her chest he knew that chex centaur would have called his attitude foolish but the attitude was one of the things that had not gotten lost i am esk and this is marrow hello esk and marrow she said brightly im bria brassie youre a brassy esk exclaimed thats brassie she corrected him im female as you evidently hadnt noticed a male is brassy oh sorry i uh noticed but thats not much of an apology she muttered esk plowed on ive been looking for you well you have found me have we met before she gave her brass hair a shake so that it glinted prettily i mean i was looking for where you live because i think thats near the night mares pasture do you know where no im hopelessly lost i thought you knew didnt you come to get me out of here i came by accident esk admitted glancing down then wrenching his eyes up again that wasnt much better because her bosom was full and her brassiere was scanty hes a peeper marrow explained esk felt himself starting to flush though he knew that the skeleton was referring to the gourd not what esk was trying not to stare at yes ble of the vole yes he said quickly i fell and landed against a gourd before i knew and now im stuck here he swung his gaze around to indicate the surroundings are you having trouble with your eyes bria inquired uh some maybe do you have any information about the terrain anything that might help us get er unlost she turned looking away from him in the process she showed her pert brass bottom that flexed exactly as if made of living flesh im afraid i dont i like to explore and was seeking a way to visit the outer world but as you can see i got lost she completed her turn and esk hauled his eyes up once again are you sure youre well she asked solicitously you seem flushed which i understand is a signal of distress among living folk uh yes i am distressed esk agreed quickly my body is stuck in that pit and im very much concerned that something will happen to it before i get rescued if i can just get to a night mare yes it must be quite a problem being alive bria said is it true that you have to eat and eliminate just to keep going brassies dont of course not why bother with all that inconvenience and mess if you dont have to i suppose you have to wear all that clumsy clothing to keep you warm too you shouldnt embarrass him by remarking on his weaknesses of the flesh marrow reproved her oh thats right she agreed i apologize esk she stepped into him put her arms around him and kissed him on the mouth is that enough stunned esk just stood there for the moment as still as a metal statue himself it seems it is not marrow said ill just have to try harder then she said brightly esk i apologize for anything i may have said to offend or embarrass you and hope you will forgive me that transgression then she embraced him so closely that he started to lose his balance and made an involuntary grab for support reaching around her then she kissed him again deep and long she was made of metal but her lips were warm and soft and firm and so was her body finally she drew back her head a little is that enough she asked again esk felt as if he were floating at treetop height all that anchored him vale of the vole was his grip on her body then a mound flexed under his hand and he realized where that grip was he froze again apparently you are not putting enough into it marrow said bria made a cute little grimace apparently not well ill make sure it takes the next time she inhaled preparing for the supreme effort nono esk stammered iii accept your aapology she cocked her head at him and her hair shifted with a coppery sheen are you sure you still look flushed ababsolutely sure he said uncertainly thats a relief be sure to tell me if i embarrass you again uh yes certainly he agreed as she disengaged and his hand finally slipped from her buttock apologizing is such a chore marrow said i dont know whether it is worse for the offender or the offendee now it was not just his gaze but his fancy that had to be sternly reined esks experience with women was quite limited but he was discovering that the nuances of such interaction could carry a formidable charge he had met bria only a few minutes ago but already she had opened a dramatic new dimension to his imagination we had better just walk along the path bria said since esk is not part of our world he should be able to unlose us if we maintain contact with him my sentiment exactly marrow said bria took esks right hand and marrow his left and they walked on along the path which was wide enough at this stage to accommodate them in this formation esk suffered himself to be guided for his thoughts were not properly on the subject how could a creature of metal be so soft the oath jigged and jogged becoming narrow and then wide again but they maintained their linkage and advanced resolutely along it bria spied something in the path perhaps a tiny pebble and bent quickly to pick it up with her free hand just what ive always wanted she exclaimed oh what is it esk asked she glanced sidelong at him nothing of consequence perhaps just another lost item i think ill save just in case i should one day need it esk shrugged of course she could pick up anything she wanted a stone as small as that was hardly worth the eifort though the scenery was changing so they knew they were getting somewhere now they seemed to be approaching a region of more orderly plants that vale of the vole light flared interrupting his observation in mid thought oh im so glad we found you in time chex exclaimed are you all right eskt whatv thiv volney asked a barebottomed hussy latia exclaimed and a bundle of bones esk snapped alert dont say anything embarrassing he cried these are my acquaintances in the gourd for marrow and bria were with him still holding his hands thats right chex said whatever a visitor to the world of the gourd is in contact with when he departs it accompanies him these are gourd folk the skeleton and the brassie seemed dazed now it was esks turn to take charge on my right hand is bria brassie he said on my left marrow bones they wereon the lost path bria and marrow these are my friends in xanth normal chex centaur volney vole and latia curse fiend the several named parties nodded in turn then chex assessed the situation i believe we can return marrow and bria to their own world esk you have simply to hold their hands and look into the peephole then inside release them and we shall break your eye contact so that you return alone and where will that leave us bria demanded indignantly on the lost pathwhere we cant escape but this is not your world chex protested everything is different here i wanted to explore this world anyway bria said marrow shrugged i think i am no more lost here than i was on the lost path at such time as some one of you peeks in a gourd and locates the haunted garden you can return me there directly but the gourd is locked onto the same scene chex said each time esk peeps he will find himself exactly where he was before agreed marrow said but you others will have different scenes and perhaps one of them will be the one i require chex nodded agreement yes we can do that now ordinarily i would not voluntarily look into a hypnogourd but this seems to be a constructive exception she reached down and picked up the gourd free me after only a moment please she said and put her eye to the peephole she froze in place esk disengaged from bria and marrow and put his hand over the peephole interrupting chexs vision the centaur resumed animation i was in a region of paper objects she said some exceedingly elaborate constructions i had no idea that paper could achieve such configurations vale of the vole wrong set esk said he took the gourd and held it down for volney the vole looked and froze then esk covered the peephole and volney returned to life an endlew vheet of fluid he reported very pretty but i think not correct for theve folk esk held the gourd up for latia she looked and froze then when esk broke the line of sight she grimaced a great wide plain with black equine shapes on the horizon she said the pasture of the night mares esk exclaimed just what i was looking forbut no longer need it seems that we cannot help these visitors at the moment chex said perhaps if they do not mind remaining with us for a time we can find some other person whose gourd orientation is more relevant thats fine bria said i shall be happy to spend some time here but you will have to dress decently latia said what different conventions esk said quickly to bria she only means that here it will be better if you wear a dress thats right marrow said you do wear clothing here i dont chex said humanoids wear clothing mostly esk said i suppose we shouldnt embarrass the world we visit bria said reluctantly there is a broadcloth tree close by latia said i can readily make you clothing from that she glanced at marrow and if i can find some herringbone material that should do nicely for you latia set off for the fabric trailed by the two from the gourd broadcloth and herringbone chex murmured she has a special sense of alignment the curse fiends are very conscious of the proprieties esk agreed i gather she rendezvoused with you and volney and then volney sniffed me out exactly we did not realize that you would return with company but perhaps it is for the best i gather you were unsuccessful in your quest for a solution to the problem of the kissmee river unfortunately yes but i can still ask the ogres for help we must eat and compare notes she said then decide what to do in the morning yes i am eager to hear how the two of you fared indeed he was glad to be back with familiar company but still his mind kept flirting with the experience he had had with brias mode of apology he had vale of the vole returned from the gourd his body intact but his mind had hardly settled yet he wished he could talk to someone about that she seems like a nice enough girl and quite well formed chex remarked as if reading his mind but she is not of your world esk chapter cheiron hex trotted south carrying marrow on her back she was headed for her sires region and the skeleton would not have been able to keep up afoot actually marrow did not look like a skeleton now latia had worked up an effective suit of herringbone cloth and picked him a pair of stout slippers and a pair of thick gloves that extended well up past his wrists he looked very much like a living man except for his skull and even that could be masked by the hat and scarf fortunately he did not weigh very much even bundled up like this because he was all bone they had discussed it the prior night after exchanging stories of recent adventures they had decided to distribute the new additions to the group among the original members with the fiend woman and brass girl accompanying esk and the skeleton accompanying chex the vole was tunneling alone again it was too difficult for any of the others to keep pace with him deep underground perhaps this time they would be able to obtain some more solid commitment of assistance they would meet in seven days as before and see where they stood one way or another they intended to rescue the kissmee river from its unhappy plight it was possible that marrow would not remain with her long for they had agreed to ask any other folk they met to look in a gourd and to conduct marrow there if either the horror house or the haunted garden were found because the two were adjacent meanwhile she was happy to talk with him because like all centaurs she was curious about anything that was out of the ordinary how is it that you hold together without flesh or tendons she inquired that is the nature of skeletal magic he explained the toe bone is connected to the foot bone and the foot bone is connected to the ankle bone and the ankle bone is connected to the leg bone vale of the vole i grasp the connection she cut in wryly i suppose it is that same magic that animates you of course just as the magic of life animates your flesh doesnt it become quite hot in there with such a ponderous mass of flesh encasing you we have become acclimatized to it she said with a private smile how is that you are able to speak when you have no lungs no throat no mouth it is just part of the magic certain motions of the jaw produce certain sounds and we learn to control these when young until we become proficient the full process takes several years but we consider it part of the art of growing up of growing up you mean there are child skeletons too of course did you suppose we were fashioned whole from air i thought you were the remains of formerly living folk the remains of living folk what an appalling notion no offense was intended marrow she said quickly we of the outer world dont have much direct contact with you of the gourd so are ignorant about many things i apologize if no apology required he said quickly of course you did not know that is why you asked chex remembered something that esk had mentioned in passing about apologyis it true that your kind does it by kissing of course notl whatever gave you that idea perhaps i misconstrued a reference esk said something about the brassies they do it their way of course bria embarrassed esk so she kissed him skeletons dont do it that way this was interesting certainly not how could we kiss i see your point yet in that case we knock skulls doesnt that hurt hurt she realized that pain would be a foreign concept to creatures who had no soft flesh i think i understand that it does not but suppose a skeleton embarrassed a brassie would they kiss or knock heads how could a skeleton embarrass a brassie he asked that stumped her so she moved on to another subject you said there were small skeletons how do skeletons reproduce very simple he strikes her so hard she flies apart that is known as vale of the vole knocking her up then he selects some of the smaller bones and assembles them into a baby skeleton but doesnt she need those bones for herself well how does a living creature reproduce he inserts his seed in her and she grows a foal from her flesh doesnt she need that flesh for herself chex considered she concluded that marrow had made his point in due course they reached xaps stamping ground the hippogryph was there snoozing he had the body of a centaur and the forepart of a griffin with great golden wings and a golden birdofprey head he was evidently past his prime but still a powerful figure of a winged monster hello sire chex called xap snapped his head out from under his wing and squawked he doesnt talk much chex explained to marrow but i understand him well enough then to the hippogryph sire this is marrow bones from the gourd he would like to return if he can find a normal person oriented on his region xap squawked again chex turned to marrow who remained on her back swathed in his herringbone sorry my sire says the last time he looked in a gourd all he saw was a lake of purple manure i dont think youd care to go there the skeleton nodded agreement manure made bones smell bad sire she continued i am looking for help for a friend i would like to ask the winged monsters for that help do you suppose i could meet with them xap squawked who cheiron she asked no i dont know him or of him but i doubt that i need to sire i wish youd stop matchmaking ive told you before that no ordinary centaur wants to mate with a winged one most wont even speak to me my centaur granddam wont and shes typical i feel more comfortable with the winged monsters at least they dont treat me like a freak thats why im hoping they might help when the centaurs refused xap squawked again but i cant go up there chex protested its inaccessible to landbound creatures but it turned out that the winged monsters had a firm policy they would not deal with any creature who would not meet them on their turf xap could help by notifying them of her coming appearance but she would have to get herself to the turf chex nerved herself she dreaded the effort but knew it was the only way she knew the route but doubted she could travel it about the best she could do was to die trying vale of the vole she explained this to marrow as she started for the mountain trail but isnt dying awkward for fleshly creatures he inquired very does it require courage for a fleshly creature to risk it then i suppose so she agreed fortunately centaurs are noted for their courage but her tongue was drying up in her mouth how she wished she had been able to find the good magician and had learned how to fly at the foot of the mountain she paused to defecate and urinate there was no sense carrying any inessentials up marrow found this process quite interesting his kind had no experience with it life seems like such an inconvenient business he remarked the trail proceeded steeply soon it came to a rushing torrent of water the mountains own process of urination hold on she warned marrow there is no bridge ill have to ford this marrow hung on and she waded into the stream the water was frigid in a moment her legs were getting numb then the current intensified doing its best to dislodge her footing but she maintained it then in the center the channel abruptly deepened she was unable to find proper footing and the rush of water was too fierce to permit her to swim frustrated shivering she backed out i cant pass she said uncertain whether the droplets on her face were from river spray or her eyes allow me to inspect the situation marrow said he climbed off her back doffed his clothing and walked along the bank swinging his skull from side to side yes as i thought there is a cave a cave here she asked how do you know skeletons have a sense about things underground he explained there is water in this cave not as cold as the river with very little current and it is large enough for your body i can guide you through it if you wish yes she exclaimed gratified then realizing that there was a detail he might have overlooked but i have to breathe you know is there any air marrow angled his skull orienting on the hidden cave some in bubbles several paces apart i can guide you chex decided to take the plunge then guide me just remember i need to breathe every minute or so if i dont ill drown what is drown dying because of insufficient air oh yes you dont find that comfortable i will try to remember that air every minute fale of the vole exactly where is this cave she inquired not completely at ease about this but seeing no better alternative just a few paces upstream it is quite convoluted another problem occurred to her that means you will have to direct me constantlybut if it is underwater you wont be able to speak oh i can speak you merely may have difficulty hearing i appreciate the distinction let me explain to you how to direct me without words she proceeded to drill him as she had esk so that he could guide her accurately with his knee bones and feet bones now the interference of his speech would not put her at risk of drowning perhaps marrow did not properly appreciate her concern about this detail but she was greatly relieved anyway whoa his leg bones said chex halted here but i dont see it turn the left knee said marrow was already good at this she turned to the stream caution his knees said he was getting very good she hadnt known that that directive existed she stepped into the river experiencing the deadly chill of it the bed fell sharply away it was surprisingly deep here guided by his leg bones she made her way around and down discovering a big hole below the waters surface slanting back under the bank and curving to be parallel to the river here was the cave she had to duck her head to get completely into it but it was big enough to accommodate her before she did that she turned one last time to face the skeleton remember you must direct me to air within a minute how good is your time sense it is excellent he assured her we must have precise timing when we dance just as we need thorough coordination when we gamble you gamble how do you do that we roll the bones of course its a great way to pass the time between gigs gigs assignments when an order for a bad dream comes in and we have to perform they never give us enough advance notice so it can be a real scramble so our existence consists of long periods of boredom punctuated by brief flurries of terror its just like war terror what are you afraid of not us the recipients of the bad dreams well just dont gamble with your timing im about to undergo a brief period of terror myself and i dont need any help in that the first air bubble is just fiftytwo seconds distant he said vale of the vole chex realized that she would just have to trust that she inhaled deeply causing a local fish to goggle at her chest and held her breath and ducked under the surface and into the cave now she remembered her claustrophobia she was heading into a confined region but it was filled with water she told herself that was different the cave would not collapse because it wasnt under pressure the water sustained it she had to believe that she tended to float so that walking was difficult she had to reach up with her hands and more or less pull herself along the roof of the cave marrows firm knee pressure guided her so that she encountered no dead ends or tight squeezes he was correct about its temperature not being as cold as the river though it was still uncomfortable her wings also helped their feathers were insulative and protected that part of her torso but she worried had he assumed that she would be walking at her landbound pace when he judged the time to the air bubble if so it would take her several times as long and that would be a disaster should she turn back while there was still time she decided to gamble after all if the air turned out to be too far away she would have no way to cross the river besides if she turned back now her claustrophobia would think it had the victory and would never let her try it again so it was this or nothing the bubble had to be within range precisely fiftytwo seconds after her start her head poked into a bubble of air she took an eager breath her emotional relief greater even than her bodily relief marrow had been right about his excellent sense of timing the air was quickly turning bad this was not a big bubble she held her breath again and moved on this time remembering to expel the spent air slowly from her mouth that would save time when she hit the next bubble and also give her a gradually increasing density so that her hooves would have slightly more traction the chill of the water was now numbing her eyeballs causing blurring vision it was so dark here that she really wasnt seeing anything so she got smart and closed her eyes protecting them now she was completely dependent on the skeletons guidance this oddly decreased her fear of enclosure it was as if she were no longer herself but a mere vehicle answering to directives in fortyone seconds she came to another bubble of air this one was larger so that she was able to breathe more thoroughly before moving on vale of the vole now marrow guided her in a sharp turn to the right the cave descended then hooked up just hi time to give her another bubble she realized that they were not necessarily following the most direct route but rather the one that guaranteed an air bubble within every minute the skeleton was doing an excellent job just about the time she feared she would lose control of her limbs because of the deepening cold the cave angled up and her head broke the surface of the river near the other bank they had made it across chex stumbled out and stood shivering her body was in an awful state but there was a warm core of gratitude to marrow for getting her through she had just navigated an otherwise impassable barrier she had mastered not only the challenge of the river but of the cold and her own claustrophobia that was in its fashion a triple victory you know she gasped as her neck thawed if we find someone up on the mountain who orients on the haunted garden we may have to wait to return you to the gourd so that you can guide me back through this cave marrow shrugged why not it is a very pleasant cave a pleasant cave but of course the skeleton was immune to cold and accustomed to operating in darkness they resumed their trek up the mountain very little time had passed it had merely seemed like an eon to her as she had progressed bubble by bubble through the cave already she was wanning with the exertion maybe she really could make it to the top time just how much did she have it had taken one days travel to reach her sire and another to reach the base of the mountain if she made it to the top in one day that would leave her one day there to convince the winged monsters to help then the threeday trek back to the rendezvous with esk and volney she was on schedule so far the thought of esk reminded her of the manner he had missed their prior rendezvous that had been an ugly occasion had the curse fiend latia not had the wit to seek them herself it could have been the end of esk all because he had foolishly asked her to curse him thinking that it would be a blessing human beings did have an erratic streak that caused them to act in irrational ways some blessing yet he had survived it and even brought out a denizen of the gourd who was proving to be of considerable assistance to her now what might have been a curse to esk was ironically a blessing for chex but the other party he had brought out was the brass girl her kind it had turned out atoned for incidental offenses by kissing and evidently she had performed such an atonement for esk human beings tended to vale of the vole be unduly influenced by appearance and action rather than being guided by practical and intellectual considerations as centaurs were that was another of the human liabilities sometimes she wondered just how the human species had survived so well in xanth on the other hoof they did have some endearing qualities esk had accepted her immediately and used his magic talent to help safeguard her from mischief in fact he had been more generous to her than the centaurs had been so she was not about to condemn the human folk probably their assets did balance out their liabilities in the long run so bria brassie had kissed him and the boy was obviously smitten that was a curse indeed yet with a further and exquisite irony esk evidently did not perceive this as an aspect of the curse could it be that his entry into the gourd really had been a blessing if so it had to be a powerful one because latia had explained the manner in which her curses strengthened when allowed to accumulate this intellectual riddle was intriguing so she continued to divert herself with it as she progressed up the steep trail assume that esk had been struck by a very potent blessing then her advantage of marrows help was only peripheral part of that blessing facilitating her mission and therefore esks mission and briashe could be a good deal more important to that mission than they had supposed but she was a creature of the gourd that meant that she had to return to it for her existence in this world was no more substantial than esks had been in the gourd she had to rejoin her world or she would eventually perish what then of her interaction with esk assume that such an interaction was feasible after all bria did look human when allowance was made for her metal suppose esk did not want to give her up that was where the zombies huge gourd came in esk could enter that physically and go after her and perhaps bring bria out physically noif marrow and bria remained physically in the gourd then it should not be feasible to return them to their home regions within it merely by having some person or creature of the outside realm look in through a peephole and take them along so they must be physically outside but chex was sure that no denizens of the gourd had settled outside it historically her dam would have informed her of anything like that so there had to be a reason that they could not survive indefinitely outside what could that be well she had a source of information marrow what would be the consequence if you did not manage to return to your realm in the gourd vale of the vole i would slowly fade away he said promptly i am after all merely the stuff of bad dreams then if bria to take a random example wished to remain here she could not she could notunless she got access to a soul access to a soul we creatures of the dream realm have no souls of course that is our primary distinction from you living folk if we had souls we would come alive and be able to survive normal terms here now chex remembered there was a great demand for souls in the gourdl the reason was suddenly clear my dam gave up half her soul to the night mare imbri yes half a soul becomes a whole soul as it fills out this takes time but is done on occasion so if someone were to give you half a soul you would be able to live here indefinitely true but of course i have no wish to live i am surprised that you folk put up with the awkwardness and occasional messiness of it chex nodded she believed she had worked out a solution to esks problem if it developed if she survived this mountain hike she was sure that esk would not be able to devise a solution on his own he lacked centaur rationality she came out of her reverie to discover the trail narrowing they were well up the mountain now and the slope was becoming sheer there was barely room for her hooves on the slightly diminished slant that was the path then it became too slight for her the girth of her body caused her center of gravity to be too far out from the face of the mountain to remain stable if she tried to go any farther she would inevitably fall she stopped she had to the suggestion of the trail continued on around the curve of the mountain with an awesome height of wall above and a mindblanking depth of drop below she could not climb that cliff and would certainly die if she fell what could she do i dont suppose you know of a nearby cave she asked marrow no cave the skeleton replied then i fear we cannot continue this is as far as i know the only trail and it is too narrow for my body the skeleton considered it does not appear to be too narrow for my body that may be true but i am the one who must reach the meeting vale of the vole plateau and address the winged monsters they would not listen to you as you are not winged still i think i might assist you could you manage that path if you had a line to cling to yes i suppose i could but i dont carry a line im a bow and arrow centaur my arms arent strong enough to sustain my full weight on a line you see my grandsire chester has very strong arms he could do it but not me she clenched her teeth with frustration oh how i wish i could fly but you could hold on with support for your feet yes but even if i had a line i could not attach it because i cant even see the other end of the trail i shall look marrow dismounted and walked along the trail as the ledge narrowed he had to turn sidewise and step carefully but it was evident that he had no fear of heights or of falling that seemed to be another advantage of being nonalive he moved on around the curve and disappeared from sight after a while he returned there is a rock that i could cling to he announced how nice for you chex said trying not to be cutting so if you will just kick me apart then swing me around so that i can grasp on with one hand it will be all right chexs dismay received a jolt was marrow proposing suicide in his fashion what just let me take hold here so i dont fall off the ledge he said now kick me hard but that would destroy you she exclaimed appalled oh no we can reform readily when prepared kick me apart then i will explain the next step chex had considerable difficulty accepting this but finally did what he asked she retreated along the trail until it widened turned around and backed up to the place where he was holding on to a solid rock then she gave him a tremendous kick on the hipbone with a hind foot the skeleton flew apart the bones sailed into the air disconnecting but then something strange happened the bones did not disconnect all the way instead they formed into a line that flopped down the mountainside now haul me up marrows voice came she walked back to the turnaround point then came forward again she braced herself and peered down over the ledge vale of the vole the line of bones extended well down the slope about halfway along it was the skull haul me it repeated this was strange magic she took hold of a bone and drew it up marrows finger bone was no longer connected to his hand bone or his hand bone to his wrist bone one finger bone was connected to another and another forming the line she hauled the line up hand over hand noting that the finger and arm bones connected to rib bones and neck bones and finally the head bone now swing the rest out around the mountain the skull told her up to the level of the trail the rock is not far beyond your vision chex obeyed she started the line of bones swinging back and forth pendulum fashion until she was able to bring the end of the line high enough then just at its height she let go and it flung out slapping against the mountain got it the skull exclaimed now pull me tight chex gazed at the arc of bones but if i pull too hard wont you come apart i dont think so i will warn you when my limit approaches so she hauled on the line again and the line tightened until when she held an arm bone the skull called out enough what now she called back touch the arm bone to the hand bone she held a loop of the bone line she brought the arm bone to the hand boneand immediately the two snapped together as if magnetized now use me to keep your balance the skull called try not to put too much strain on me chex looked at the narrow path with the bone line now stretched above it it seemed perilously precarious but marrow had known what he was doing before so she had to trust him now she held on to the line and walked out along the precipice the wall shoved her solid equine body out and she could not brace with her feet her wings made it worse because they added to the breadth of her body when folded and there was no room to open them here she clung to the line her body increasingly offbalance leaning out over the gulf below she had never been afraid of heights just of depths but it would be easy enough to cultivate such a phobia now her hands were becoming somewhat sweaty but she could not clean them she hoped the bones werent ticklish thats very good marrows skull said right under her hand startled chex almost let go of the line she had for the moment forgotten the nature of it thank you she muttered tersely vale of the vole she handed herself on along the rib bones and the backbones and the hipbones closing her mind to the precise nature of them not from any humanlike skittishness but because she did not want to raise any question in her mind about how they were able to hold together in this format marrow was a more surprising creature than she had first thought finally she reached the end where the trail widened and the endmost finger bone clung it had found a niche in the stone and hooked into it had she realized that this was all that supported the line and therefore her tilting body she would have been even more concerned than she had been she got her footing and let go of the line im across she called to the skull what now haul me in the skull called as the line swung down from the other side the far finger had let go she hauled hi the bones hand over hand thats good the skull said as it arrived giving her a momentary stare with an eye socket but how do you get back together she asked for that i will require some assistance the skull admitted you will have to set the bones together in the proper order but i dont know the proper order except in a very general way i will direct you and so it was she touched each bone to the one the skull called out and it anchored in place before too long marrow was back in proper skeletal shape the more i learn about you the more i respect you she told him as the job was completed i never realized that bones could be so versatile thank you i must confess that your flesh is not nearly as clumsy or repulsive as i had anticipated thank you she said with the trace of a smile they moved on up the mountain the way was easier now as the slope gradually leveled they were nearing the crest just as well for the day was drawing toward its close and she did not want to be on the trail at night if any of the winged monsters mistook her for nocturnal prey her situation could become difficult then they came to a cleft in the mountain it cut right across the path as though it had started as a crack and widened with time until now it was a formidable gap how was she to get across it she looked around there were a few scrubby trees and some dead wood and some weeds and assorted loose rocks that was it she looked vale of the vole again at the cleft it was plainly beyond her jump range there seemed to be no narrowing of it to the sides in fact this was its narrowest part the entire top of the mountain was split and the meeting plateau was on the other side i can perhaps throw you across she told marrow but it is too far for me i see no handholds the skeleton said and if there were i fear i could not sustain your full weight cohesion only goes so far to be sure she agreed you have done more than enough i would not ask you to attempt that even if i had sufficient arm strength to manage such a crossing there has to be another way but was there none of the items of deadwood were large enough to form a bridge and certainly the stones would not do it unless she got to work not letting herself think about how risky it was she picked up wood and rolled rocks forming a pile at the brink of the cleft she packed them in as solidly as she could fashioning a ramp whose height rose significantly above the ground marrow appraised this activity with a tilted eyeball socket isnt this a diversion of the strength you need to cross the cleft he inquired im building a ramp she explained my hope is that it will enable me to achieve a broader leap he considered judging by your demonstrated power of foot and present mass i believe you will fall short of the far landing by this amount he said holding his hand bones about a body width apart chex remembered how accurate his estimate of her progress in the water cave had been that dismayed her she had hoped that the added elevation would do the trick she had used up all the available materials she could build the ramp no higher but she had one other chance i cannot fly but my wings do provide some lift she said will that extend my distance enough i have no knowledge of the parameters of flying he said it will have to do she said let me toss you across now and i will join you in a moment as you wish she picked him up by neck bone and hipbone swung him back then heaved him across he landed in a pile but in a moment straightened out he was not subject to bruises then she tossed her bow and quiver of arrows across and her supply pack she wanted to carry no weight she could avoid on the jump then reflecting she caught up again on natural functions that was vale of the vole one more way to reduce weight she had not eaten during this climb and was hungry but at the moment that was for the best it was time she trotted to the other side of the crest then started her takeoff run she accelerated steadily and smoothly saving her peak effort for the conclusion she hit the ramp put forth her full strength and galloped up it at the very brink she leaped into the air the moment she was over the cleft she spread her wings and flapped them mightily she felt their downdraft but knew it was not enough her effort at flight was mere pretense then her front hooves came down on the rock and she knew she had made it she brought her rear hooves up to overlap the prints of the front ones securing her landing and made a small secondary leap to reorient for the first time in her life her wings had made a significant and positive difference how glad she was that she had built up her pectorals she came to a halt then turned to face marrow panting i hope thats the last hazard of the trail interesting he remarked your wings did extend your distance significantly most interesting she agreed wryly it seemed that skeletons were not much for emotion other than the generation of terror in bad dreams she ate some fruit from her pack then donned her knapsack and bow and quiver it cant be far now she said it is not marrow agreed they are just beyond the next crest how do you know that i can feel the quiver of the ground as they land skeletons were evidently very sensitive to quivers of the ground good enough ill go make my pitch pitch you plan to fashion another ramp ramp not unless theres another jump pitch is the inclination of a declivity it is also the inclination of a presentation amazing they crested this portion of the mountain the lofty plateau opened out and there were the winged monsters they were of all types griffins dragons rocs sphinxes and assorted less common creatures such as the hippogryph xap stepped forward he squawked i understand chex said i had to make it on my own or they would not listen to me will they listen now he squawked affirmatively o winged monsters chex said i come on behalf of the voles of the vale of the vole vale the demons have straightened the kissmee river and turned it ugly and mean and prevent the voles from restoring it to its natural meandering will you help hold off the demons so that the river can be restored there was a babble of squawks and hisses and growls then xap squawked they will decide tomorrow chex repeated xap squawked again i must meet cheiron she asked you mentioned him before sire you know i have trouble with centaurs my granddam refuses even to talk to me and the centaurs of the isle would not let me address them the hippogryph shrugged and dropped the subject he helped her forage for her supper and showed her to a suitable place to spend the night marrow who needed no sleep spent the night walking around and making the acquaintance of the various monsters a number of these would do well in bad dreams he remarked impressed in the morning xap explained the mechanism of the decision because language was a problem with many of the monsters and so was logic they would abide by a presentation made by champions she would represent the cause of the voles and cheiron would represent the cause of the winged monsters the cause that was most persuasive would win chex realized that she in her fatigue of the prior day had blundered she had rejected an introduction to the centaur and now cheiron was angry and she had to oppose him formally she was confident that she could have made her case successfully against one of the birdbrained monsters but a centaur was a different matter now she had to go up against an intellect comparable to her own well what was done was done perhaps cheiron would appreciate the plight of the voles despite his private affront she would just have to do the best presentation she could but when she stepped out to meet cheiron there was only a great wash of darkness hovering over the plain it was as though a storm cloud had moved in what is this she asked perplexed xap squawked light and darkness she repeated i am the light he the dark how can i make my presentation xap squawked again with my mind yes that was it she had assumed that the presentation would be verbal and logical now she realized that it was not merely a matter of having champions to make the presentations the presentations themselves had to be in a form intelligible to the less sophisticated vale of the vole monsters thus light and darkness flying creatures were good at determining shades the winged monsters were positioned in a circle covering the plateau all of them faced in toward the center they were as still as statues waiting she thought of the vale of the vole as volney had described it in its original state verdant peaceful pleasant the kissmee river caressing it with its meanders of how any creatures that drank from it became suffused with good will and affection though not compelled into embarrassing or awkward romantic relationships as happened with love springs light flared around her diminishing the darkness above and at the interface between the two the contrasts formed a picture that showed her vision then she thought of the way the demons had come channelizing the river replacing its soft curves with hard straight lines the picture shifted to show the meanness of the present vale where vegetation was dying and creatures shunned each other and the motto was kick mee or even kill mee finally she made her plea the images of flying monsters manifested in the picture swooping down on the shapes of the demons harrying them driving them out of the vale vole shapes appeared tunneling through the dikes and walls letting the captive water out so that the kissmee could return to its natural state and nourish the vale of the vole again now cheirons countercase developed the flying monsters descended on the demons but the demons fought back dematerializing and reforming behind the monsters throwing rocks at them stabbing them pulling the feathers from their wings soon the poor monsters were in a big pile on the ground wounded and dying while the voles remained unable to do their work on the dikes then the demons piled brush on the pile of injured creatures and set fire to it when chex had made her presentation the light about her had expanded until the whole plateau was illuminated and the darkness above had diminished when cheiron made his response the darkness grew reaching down squeezing out the light even the fire in the picture blazed darkly with the smoke roiling up like a bad dream of the gourd and merging with the darkness the light remained strong only around chex herself she had lost ground she tried again she thought of the way esk was going to see the ogres who were his ancestors just as the winged monsters were hers to ask for the help that his human kind refused to extend she thought of volney vole tunneling down to visit the most dreaded of his kin the wiggles on vale of the vole a similar mission if either of these agreed to help then the winged monsters would not be alone and might after all be able to prevail against the formidable demons as she thought her light brightened and pushed back the darkness farther than before and the images in the picture glowed the marching ogres seemed almost noble and the demons looked affrighted as the forces of both ground and air advanced victory was possible cheirons return sally came the darkness swelled against the bright picture and the picture grew smaller as if retreating until it was tiny and far away what did the winged monsters care what the landbound monsters did the demons were no threat to the creatures of the air chex did not wait for that case to be complete she surged back with an impromptu thesis of emotion the winged monsters did care they had to care for what harmed one part of xanth harmed all parts and what harmed the monsters of the land also harmed those of the air human beings might be callous about the problems of a nonhuman region and centaurs might be indifferent to noncentaur matters but surely the winged monsters wanted to have a better rapport with other creatures than this as she projected those thoughts the light rallied and pushed back the darkness but the darkness forged back there was no point in having the winged monsters be as foolish as the groundborne monsters all of them could perish on this foolish quest but chex would not abide that even if the quest were hopeless still it was a worthy one the deed should be done because it was worth doing without regard to possible failure other creatures might mask their cowardice with expressions of indifference but this should not be the way of the boldest of all creatures the winged monsters better to die in such an honorable quest than to live in the dishonor of noninvolvement the way the humans and centaurs were human folk did not seem to care about the plight of volish folk but other animals should her light brightened and spread with every point beating back the darkness until little was left of it except a small cloud now secondary sources of light were starting up like flames ignited by flying sparks these were from the monsters that rimmed the plateau they agreed with her the dark cloud shrank until at last the figure hovering within it became visible and suddenly chex felt faint cheiron was a winged centaur of course she should have realized that before she had correctly identified his name as typical of centaurs but had failed to connect this with vale of the vole the fact that every creature on this plateau was winged the path she had taken up had been little used and there had been no centaur prints showing on it the only way cheiron could have come here was by flying this should have been obvious to her instantly she had blundered personally as well as tactically she had alienated the only other creature of her precise kind the last of the darkness above dissipated and the sun shone down but in chexs heart new darkness was welling how could she have been so wrongheaded cheiron flew down toward her and the sunlight highlighted his silver wings and his golden hooves he was the handsomest centaur she had even seen he appeared to be of mature age certainly older than she well muscled and sleekly structured and he could fly he landed before her and folded his wings but she was too chagrined to meet his gaze i like your spirit filly he said you fought your way up here and you fought your way through the darkness i spread your sire was right about you you are worthy not only because you are the only other of my kind in xanth i came here from afar when i heard of you hoping you were worthwhile timidly flushing in the atrocious human manner she looked at him he was smiling youyou are not angry that i did not meet you before furious he said but you are young yet and cannot be expected to have mastery of all social graces especially when most centaurs shun you i know how that is believe me i know at least it gave me the pretext to try your mettle the winged monsters will travel to the vale of the vole you have persuaded them and i she gazed at him smitten the manner of any adolescent in the presence of wonder what a creature he was and you i will welcome youwhen you fly to me he turned spread his wings and took off leaving her in the downblast of air that was scarcely more tumultuous than her emotions she had to learn to fly chapter ogre hey walked along the path to castle roogna chex had promised princess ivy that she would send esk in for a report once she found him and ivy had promised in return to dig out something else to help them get help for the kissmee river as it was turning out little ivy was doing almost as much good for them as her parents might have who is ivy bria inquired esk explained for of course bria had very little information about the normal xanth hierarchies oh shes irenes daughter bria exclaimed my mother blythe knew irene she did esk asked startled how could that be after your ogre father tore up marrows folk he went on to tear up the brassies and he abducted blythe to this world there she got to know several interesting people including your mother tandy and later she came to help mare imbri rescue your kings why didnt you tell me that before he asked i didnt think it was relevant besides a girl has to be careful around ogres your father put a dent in my mother he wouldnt do a thing like that hes always been loyal to my mother are you saying its not true you embarrass me esk paused this promised to become complicated uh no im not saying that then what are you saying just that there must be some misunderstanding oh she seemed disappointed anyway later she married my father but i think she missed the outside world some i grew up very curious about it thats how i got lost i was looking for a way out esk smiled well you found a way out tele of the vole no you found it im not really out though im trapped here the same way you were trapped inside you mean your body is still there on the lost path no but im not really out either because the moment you go back into the gourd ill go back too or fade out or somethingi dont know exactly what happens but it isnt good what i need is a way to get stabilized so i dont get into trouble here chex found a physical way into the gourd esk exclaimed through the zombie gourd maybe if you went back in through that going in wont do me any good but i thought she glanced at him appraisingly you shouldnt try to think esk its bad for ogres well maybe you could go back in with me and then go out through that big gourd then youd be out on your own and not dependent on me that wont work either im on the lost path remember yes but if we find someone who enters the gourd at your home region then that person can take you back in and you wont be lost anymore but i still wouldnt know where the zombie gourd is i would just get lost again trying to find it thats ridiculous he snapped you could get a map or something and find it someone in there has to know where it is you think im ridiculous she exclaimed her brass face clouding up you embarrassed me oops he had been trying to avoid trouble but had somehow walked into it anyway im sorry i didnt mean thats no way to apologize esk glanced at her then at latia helplessly go ahead the curse fiend said shortly apologize the proper way uh yes esk said he stopped walking and bria stopped walking he took her in his arms i apologize for embarrassing you he said and gave her a quick kiss she stood motionless seeming to be a brass statue i dont think you did a good enough job latia remarked esk tried again bria im very sorry i embarrassed you and i humbly apologize he said and kissed her somewhat more authoritatively still the brassie girl stood absolutely frozen it was as if she had been cast in metal and allowed to harden in place you need instruction in kissing latia snorted disdainfully fale of the vole stung esk wrapped his arms about bria swung her around and gave her a kiss that threatened to bruise his lips then at last bria melted accepted she murmured now theres a girl who would be excellent on the stage latia murmured i have seldom seen better management what esk asked nothing the old woman said with the suggestion of a smirk they resumed their walk toward castle roogna but now esks head was spinning in much the way it had the first time bria had kissed him he tried to remember exactly how he had embarrassed her but was unable he tried to figure out what the curse fiend woman meant about management but drew another blank before long they reached castle roogna princess ivy danced out to meet them you found him she cried happily volney vole sniffed him out latia said the centaur and the vole had to go on additional searches but we brought him back here he looks sort of dazed the girl said he was some time in the gourd oh that would do it then she noticed bria hello whore you just something he fished out of the gourd bria said youre a gourd folk how exciting esk found his tongue shes bria brassie her mother knew your mother a brassie then her mother must be blythe brassie who got the dent from smash ogre bria glanced sidelong at esk who almost choked fortunately ivy was prancing on to a new subject i found something to help a pathfinder spell a pathfinder esk asked accepting the object she gave him it looked like a bit of twisted wire its a spell and it finds your path for you ivy explained wherever you want to go thats easy i want to go and ask the ogres if they will help the voles but i cant walk there and back within a week unless you have some more of those speed pills no i dont dare take any more someoned notice but this is just as good ask it for the path to the ogres you dont understand i can find the ogres i just need more time than i have then ask it for the path thatll take you there in the time you have ivy said brightly vale of the vole that spell can do that sure but theres one problem it works only once for each person well i can follow the same path back thats no problem the girls forehead wrinkled im not sure its like that i dont think you can find the path again without it i know a path like that bria remarked only you cant find your wayrom it gee that must be fun ivy said i suppose i could use the spell to get there esk said then hope to make it back the regular way in time maybe it can be done you can get back stupid ivy said just have a friend use the spell to find the return path why thats right esk exclaimed im embarrassed i should have thought of it uhoh latia muttered you embarrassed him bria said to ivy you will have to apologize ivy was interested geehow do i do that like this bria said she put her arms around esk i apologize she said then she kissed him extraordinary latia murmured admiringly no opportunity wasted that looks like fun ivy said at that point there was a splash and yowl from the moat oops moaties teasing someone again gotta go ivy dashed off esk examined the spell ill need someone to go with me i suppose he said have no fear we are both going with you latia said but im going to ogre country he protested it may be dangerous that is why were going with you bria said men always d get into trouble on their own esk wasnt completely certain of her logic but he was still slightly unbalanced from the last kiss or two so accepted it he knew that bria was mainly teasing him with those kisses because she was of a different world to which she would in due course return but still the kisses had their impact if only he could find a real girl like her then id better figure out how to use this spell he said looking at the pathfinder thats no problem latia said we curse fiends have used them on occasion simply hold it up focus on it and say the name of the place to which you wish to find a path vble of the vole oh esk held out the wire and opened his mouth but also specify that you want the shortest path latia added otherwise you might get the scenic route that would be longer than the one you would find on your own thank you for that little detail bria said latia glanced at her are you being snide girl that would embarrass me no not at all bria said quickly i was only being appreciative i thought as much when it came to management esk realized the old woman was no slouch women of all ages seemed to be better at that than men were even little ivy had managed to get around her fathers restrictions without much difficulty he addressed the pathfinder spell again he focused closely on it the shortest path to the ogrefenogre fen he said he bunked for there before him was a path he hadnt seen before it was reasonably wide and firm and clear there would be no trouble following it but it was headed south the ogre fen is in the north he objected this is the wrong path poppycock latia snappped pathfinders never err trust it instead of your private judgment esk realized that he had no particular choice because if he didnt take the proffered path he would have to find his own way which would take him a week or so one way he stepped out on the path latia and bria followed the path bore contentedly south entering the thickest jungle then safely out of sight of castle roogna it changed course curving back to the north see it knows where its going latia said but how can it be the shortest path when it just added this extra loop south esk asked maybe it has a sense of privacy the path curved left and continued curving until it intersected itself slightly above its prior level the curve tightened completing a second loop coming in just above and inside itself this path is just playing with us esk said its not going anywhere it probably has its reasons latia said dont criticize it too sharply you might embarrass it esk didnt want to kiss the path so he refrained from further comment the spiral continued until it became quite high and tight they were circling in a narrow radius at treetop level vale of the vole then at last the path took off to the north again along the branch of a giant tree see it just needed to wind up to its elevation bria said pleased it must be a female path it knows what its doing even if others dont esk hoped so the branch gnarled down into the depths of the foliage and the shade deepened so that they had to watch carefully to make sure of their footing there were many side branches but they could tell which one that path followed because it was well worn esk wondered about that the lost path in the gourd had been tricky to follow in places because of disuse who used this one so much probably there are several standard paths latia remarked answering his thought maybe segments of them get assembled end to end to make a particular route to a particular destination so this segment has been much used but only by folk going to other regions it hardly matters so long as the programming is accurate for us they came to the trunk of the tree there was a hole in it and the path entered the hole the interior was like a tunnel surprisingly extensive it continued long after it seemed to esk that it should have emerged from the far side of the tree the sides grew smoother and assumed a faint glistening as if moist then esk encountered a stalactite now wait a moment he exclaimed stalacs are in caves that is curious latia agreed she put her hand to the descending cone but this is after all wood esk touched it sure enough it was wood the darkness had given it another semblance the tunnel finally emerged onto another branch is this the same tree bria asked blinking in the sudden light indeed it seemed different the bark was smoother and the diameter of the trunk seemed smaller curious esk held on and worked his way around the outside until he could see the side they had entered there was no entry the tree had a hole on only one sidethe side from which they had exited he returned and peered back into the tunnel it extended way back and there was light at the end you act as if you had never before seen a magic path latia remarked esk was embarrassed but struggled manfully to master it fearing the consequence more than the embarrassment itself he turned his face forward and strode out along the branch path this one had smaller branches that extended up overhanging it and vale of the vole some of these bore fruit esk reached up and plucked a plumb that was bobbing below a stringlike twig plumbs always grew that way straight up and down and bobbing when they were ripe he bit into it and it was juicy and good so this was a plumb tree but farther along the branch were two matching fruits of a different type they were greenishyellow and thickest through their bases he plucked them both for it was impossible to pluck a single one that was the nature of pairs these too were very good farther along was a big pineapple he let that one pass that kind of fruit was apt to be explosive this is a versatile fruit tree latia remarked at last the path passed from the tree it stairstepped down to the ground and then coursed along to a small river esk paused i dont see the continuation across the river latia and bria looked the path intersected the river at a slant and did not resume beyond it only one explanation latia said she stepped into the river her foot did not splash into the water it landed on it as if encountering solidity she took another step and stood on the water just as i suspected she said the path goes on the river esk at this point knew better than to question it he stepped out on the water and found it as solid as ice but not cold this was the path all right he should have realized before for the path from the good magicians castle had crossed water too bria followed i think i like the ways of the outer world she said fluffing out her skirt esk looking at her discovered that the water she stood on was reflective he could see right up her legs he turned again quickly even though he had seen all of her legs in the gourd before she put on the dress he felt guilty about seeing them now guilty about wanting to see them did i embarrass you bria inquired and there was the other aspect of that trap he wanted to tell her the truth that she had inadvertently embarrassed him through no fault of her own but he knew that would only complicate things i uh embarrassed myself he said she laughed youre going to have trouble settling that trouble indeed he knew she was only teasing him possibly she understood about the reflection why couldnt his emotion follow his intellect and accept the brassie girl as a temporary acquaintance the river broadened until they were walking well away from either vale of the vole shore now water lilies spread across its calm surface obscuring the reflections which was a relief but where was the path going it seemed to have little concern about its destination sometimes it bore north sometimes south and sometimes east or west now it was heading out into what promised to become a lake when would it get serious about its destination abruptly it stopped latia now leading the way suddenly splashed into the lake beside a big green lily pad esk dropped to his belly on the solid portion of the path and reached down to haul her out his questing hand caught her bony ankle he yanked on itand felt the sting of a slap what was happening then latias head poked up sorry eski thought you were a leech or something its all rightthe path is down here just step down and reorient her head resubmerged did you noticeher hair wasnt even wet bria said esk hadnt noticed but now he recalled it he had reached into the water but his arm was dry he stepped off the end of the path and dropped into the water he was holding his breath but it didnt seem necessary he wasnt really submerged in a moment his body twisted around and he found his feet coming to rest against the underside of the lily pad he was standing upside down in the lake he tried breathing and it was all right he saw fish in the water swimming normally which was inverted compared to him but to him the water was air he looked down the way he had come and saw brias legs they were very nice legs all the way up yet again he wrenched away his gaze and tried to stifle a blush then bria jumped in she spun about and landed beside him on the lily pad which bowed with their weight careful she said we dont want to break through and fall out through the sky esk stepped across to the next lily pad he discovered that these pads had no stems they were just there he squatted and touched his finger to the lake surface between pads his hands broke through the surface tension and dangled in the air wed better stick to the pads he said i think theyre the stepping stones they moved on following the irregular trail of green pads finally the slope of the lakebed descended requiring them to duck their heads when it became so shallow that they could not walk esk tried stepping through the surface and resuming normal orientation vale of the vole he found himself thighdeep in the lake looking at a solid jungle of thorns the path did not continue in this direction latia emerged there they are she said cloudstones esk looked there above the lake was a small line of tiny clouds the nearest and lowest within stepping range he shrugged and stepped onto it it depressed a little wobbling but sustained his weight he stepped quickly to the next which was higher and larger and this one was more stable bria emerged oh i like this world better and better she exclaimed we dont have anything like this in the gourd esk refrained from pointing out that he hadnt seen it in this world either until now maybe he just hadnt traveled enough before the cloudstones took them safely across the lake and down to the far shore why the path hadnt gone directly there esk couldnt guess but he was in no position to question its rationale just so long as it got them to ogre country within three days at last the path resumed normal operation proceeding directly north through mixed terrainuntil they came to the mirror it stood across the path a vertical fulllength sheet of glass big enough to reflect a complete man esk would have crashed right into it because it reflected the path perfectly making it look like a continuationbut he saw himself approaching and realized what it was before colliding so he stopped and admired his somewhat bedraggled image bria looked much better but latia looked worse he peered around the mirror beyond was a dense impenetrable curseburr patch to the sides were itch plants above was the foliage of a poison acorn tree this was a dead end that was really deadly there has to be a way latia muttered maybe this is a door she poked her finger experimentally at the glass her finger passed through it without resistance i think i have found it she said as her hand and then her arm disappeared into the mirror the reflection showed only that portion of her that was on the near side but we dont know whats in there esk warned for he saw that her arm was not emerging from the other side of the mirror it was like the hole in the tree it came out elsewhere the other end of the path obviously she said and put her head through in a moment the rest of her disappeared and the mirror was clear you look a mess bria said contemplating esks reflection let me comb your hair she brought out a brass comb from somewhere uh but he protested weakly vale of the vole oh did i embarrass you id better apologize no no thats all right its best to be sure she put her arms around him esk knew he should protest some more but he lacked the gumption she squeezed him closely and kissed him and she was warm and soft and fascinating he closed his eyes and knew that he would not have known she was brass from the present feel of her again he felt as if he were floating ifif you are made of hard metal he said as she released him how can you be soso oh i can be quite soft when i want to be she said after all we brassies couldnt move very well if we remained absolutely rigid but your motherthat dent the ogre caught her by surprise he picked her up by her brassiere then dropped her on the brass hat of the man below esk began to get a notion where the dent might have been i see so it was an accident but wouldnt the dent have undented when she turned soft again no dents are the most permanent kinds of things shes still got it she pretends its a dimple i can see why you dislike ogres no i always thought it was romantic id like to meet an ogre myself well im part ogre i know she said softly then oops did i embarrass you youre blushing again no no its all right he said but she decided to play it safe and apologized in her fashion well latia remarked stepping out of the mirror i can see that you folk were really concerned about my welfare while i was in the mirror uh esk said dont tell me let me guess she embarrassed you its amazing how often i do that bria remarked innocently i must be very clumsy about outside world ways to be sure latia agreed dryly well im here to report that the path continues beyond its an odd scene but presumably it is what we want they stepped through the mirror the other side was indeed strange instead of being a mirror it seemed like a clear pane of glass showing the path they had just come from a oneway mirrorwhat strange magic the path ahead was glass too reflective in the manner of the lake vale of the vole surface the scenery to the sides was odder yet it was all of glass the brush was greenly tinted glass and the trees had brownly tinted trunks and greenly foliage a grayly tinted glass rabbit bounded away as they approached and a redly tinted glass bird sailed overhead it reminds me of home a little bria said only there everything is of brass well get you home when we can esk reassured her oh im not homesick this is a wonderful adventure im just comparing the glassy forest opened out into a glassy plain with many glass blades creamly tinted glass animals glazed on it they made glassy moosounds and mooved away worried by the nonglass intruders glazed grazed esk realized then again then a glassy unicorn charged up ridden by a glassy man the man dismounted and strode toward the party drawing a shining glass blade he spoke with the sound of breaking cutlery brandishing the weapon your glass will be ass no esk said realizing that the glassy man meant mischief the man changed his mind he remounted his glass steed and they galloped away sending up a cloud of glass dust lets move on through here quickly latia suggested i dont think these folk are friendly they hurried on along the path soon they came to another sheet of glass this should be our exit latia said but ill just check you two can get back to what you were doing she stepped through the glass and they watched her walk around a curve in the path beyond what were we doing bria inquired brightly uh oh yes i was apologizing to you i dont remember what for but better safe than sorry but you dont need to her warm kiss cut him off he decided that it was pointless to protest bria was correct she could be very soft when she chose to be yet her body was entirely brass and some of her ways were brassy too any expectations he might have were foolish he knew this in fact he was absolutely sure of this yet somehow he doubted latia returned coming around the curve and stepping through the glass yes its our path she reported and it seems to be near the ogre fen oh how do you know esk asked oh nothing specific trees twisted into pretzels boulders cracked vale of the vole with hairy fist marks on them dragons slinking about as if terrified of anything on two legs perhaps i am mistaken esk didnt press the case they stepped through the glass esk turned to look back and it was a mirror showing nothing of the glassies beyond that had been another interesting experience latia had described the terrain accurately they were definitely in ogre country esk felt nervous he had ogre ancestry but little direct experience with full ogres this could be a disaster soon they heard a great crashing as of trees getting knocked down an ogre stomped into view carelessly sweeping brush and rocks aside with one ham fist while picking his monstrous yellow teeth with the tenpenny nails of the other ham hand this seemed like a worse and worse idea this was a plain animal brute the ogre stood twice esks height and was so ugly that clouds of smog formed wherever it glanced oooo what a beast bria murmured admiringly the ogre heard her his shaggy puss swung around to aim at her what this me seeone tiny she he exclaimed we came to talk to you ogres esk called now the ogre spied the rest of the party he walk to talk ogres lacked facility with pronouns because they were very stupid yes we walk to talk esk said please take us to your leader the ogre scratched his hairy head giant fleas dodged out of the way of his dirty nail want to take no mistake no mistake esk agreed okay you say and the ogre reached out and grabbed esk hauled him up and jammed him into the huge backpack he wore then he grabbed latia and bria and treated them similarly i hope you know what hes doing latia muttered i hope so too esk muttered back the ogre strode on shoving brush and trees out of his way while the pack jogged violently with his motion the three clung to the rim and the straps because getting bounced out would lead to a painful fall the ogre arrived at an ogre village there was a huge fire in its center beside which sat a great black pot heat pot the ogre bellowed me got uhoh esk said the pot was full of water but he could see some bones in the bottom they reminded him of marrow and that was not reassuring vale of the vole the ogre swung the pack off and brought it to the pot he began to invert it no esk cried perplexed the ogre paused no so we came to talk not to be cooked esk yelled other ogres had appeared including several females if the males were ugly the females were appalling we look not cook one inquired scratching her head so vigorously that the lice scattered in terror we want your help for the voles esk cried wishing he had never undertaken this foolish mission put vole in bowl another ogre exclaimed smacking his lips with a sound that startled the birds from a distant tree we came to impress you with the need for this esk said knowing that the chances of impressing these monsters with anything they had to say was so small as to be worthless such mess impress the ogre who had brought them demanded and all of them laughed with a volume and crudity that only their kind could manage yes impress esk continued doggedly for your help the first ogre thought about that his cranium heated with the effort and the fleas got hotfeet and jumped off finally he exclaimed me say okay the other ogres glad to be relieved of the horrible effort of having to think for themselves bellowed their agreement wonderful latia said now all we have to do is impress them and our case is won maybe we can do that bria said brightly we each have our natures and our talents im not sure esk began for example i can be very hard when i want to be ill show you she climbed out of the pack which the ogre had set on the ground beside the pot eat me ogre she cried chew me up the ogre did not wait for a second invitation he snatched her up a moment before three other ham hands reached her and jammed her feet in his maw he chomped there was a pause then slow surprise spread across his puss from the region of his maw for his teeth had crunched something much harder than bone he pulled bria out and looked at her she still looked edible she sweet me eat he concluded and opened his maw wide and jammed in her head vale of the vole but the teeth crunched again on hard metal brias head remained attached cant you do better than that ogre she cried from the vicinity of his tongue confused the ogre hauled her out immediately another ogre grabbed her and chomped on an arm it was a powerful chomp the sound of it rang metallically startling a passing cloud so that it dropped a little water a chip of yellow tooth flew out tough she me agree the ogre confessed do i impress you bria demanded the ogres exchanged glances they were stupid glances and traveled very slowly so this took some time the surrounding trees tilted away worried when ogres acted strangely but eventually they all nodded agreement they were impressed so thats how it goes latia said well lets see what i can do she climbed out of the pack and addressed the ogres who is the ugliest among you she asked an ogress leaned forward as she did so all the nearby plants wilted me be ugly me say smugly she certainly was ugly esk had never seen a more horrendous puss i can be uglier than you latia said all the ogres laughed at this not even needing time for thought it was obvious that nobody could be uglier than the ogress ugly is as ugly does latia said stoutly what can your ugly do the ogress turned and lumbered into her hovel a flock of bats flew out looking stunned she brought out a battered pitcher of milk she grimaced at itand the entire pitcher curdled esk gaped that was ugly indeed he had thought the stories about that sort of thing were exaggerated then latia put her hands to her head she had powder and chalk and was using these to make up her face whats she doing bria asked shes an actress esk said all curse fiends are good at drama they can make themselves quite prettyand i guess ugly if they want to latia looked up her face homely to begin with had been transformed now it so ugly it was sickening but the ogres just looked undismayed they were used to ugly then latia walked over to the big pot lift me up she said curious an ogre picked her up and held her over the pot latia aimed her face down and scowled the water curdled esk gaped so did the ogres vale of the vole well latia inquired as the ogre set her down we confess we impress an ogre muttered still staring at the pot he poked a ham finger in the water was definitely curdled not frozen it clarified in the region of his finger finding this to be relatively pretty esk remembered how his grandmother a curse fiend had emulated an ogress and won his grandfathers love at last he had a notion how she had done it but now it was his turn what could he do to match what the women had done if he got mad he could develop ogre strength for a short time but that would only match the strength every normal ogre had not exceed it that would not impress them then he realized what would who is stupidest he asked me the first ogre cried forgetting to rhyme me me another exclaimed remembering there was a chorus of claims for of course each was proud and considered himself the stupidest creature of all time but finally one emerged as dominant the hugest and slackestjawed of them all he was so muscular that when he tried to think the muscles bulged on his head but so stupid that his effort to think couldnt even dislodge the fleas his skull couldnt get hot enough well i am stupider than you esk asserted ill prove it then he concentrated and his terror of failure invoked his ogre strength he marched across and wrapped his arms around the ogres legs and picked him up and swung him around exerting all his ogre power and cracked the ogres head into a tree the tree snapped off but the ogre wasnt hurt of course the ogre was however annoyed ogres didnt really like snapping tree trunks with their faces they preferred ham fists he snatched up the fallen trunk and swung it toward esk ready to smash him down into the ground with a single blow esk stood his ground what could be stupider than doing what i did to an ogre like that he asked the ogres considered then as the tree came down and esk jumped aside they started to laugh the welkin shuddered with their hawhaws making the sun vibrate and shed a few rays and even the ogre esk had attacked joined in it was a good joke indeed nothing could be stupider than that that was a dam fool thing to do latia snapped totally idiotic bria said precisely esk agreed it was the stupidest thing i could have done vale of the vote they were silent acceding to the sincerity of his claim thus it was that esks party impressed the ogres and won their support for the mission now all they had to do was survive the ogres welcoming party and manage to explain how to reach the vale of the vole from here the ogres would help chapter wiggle v olney tunneled down toward the wiggle princess guided by the locator pebble the squiggles had given him this stone like the other was reversed for him he had to orient on the foulest taste avoiding the good taste the wiggles as he understood it were the strongest borers of all the clans of the voles more correctly their larvae were when a pair of wiggles mated the female went to a suitable patch of rock and made her nest and when the larvae hatched they drilled out into that rock in an increasing radius until they found good locations for feeding and growth very few were lucky the great majority of the thousands of larvae perished when they used up all their strength in the vain search the wiggles problem was that their tastes were highly selective each individual liked only a particular flavor of rock and would not eat any other since there were many hundreds of flavors and the veins of rock were randomly distributed the chances of a single wiggle larva happening on its particular flavor were perhaps one in a thousand there were several thousand larvae in a typical swarm so normally a few did find their homes this was the reason that the ground was not overridden with wiggles a female mated only once and was thereafter sterile because all the egg cells in her body were expended in the laying of the larvae in any given year there would be only one or two swarms limited to their particular veins of stone it might have helped if the stone that was suitable for swarming was the same as what was suitable for eating then all the larvae would settle down immediately and eat but as he reviewed this in his mind volney saw why this was not so if all the thousands of wiggle larvae ate the rock they swarmed in they would soon finish it and the vein would become a pulsing mass of partially matured wiggles none of those would grow to maturity because the food would be gone all would perish and the swarm would die out without descendants so it was necessary for swarm taste and grow taste vale of the vole to differ the swarm taste was identical for all the larvae while the grow taste was different for each the wiggle system really did make sense when taken on its own terms but this particular wiggle princess the squiggles had explained was a mutant or close to it there was normally a good range of variation in a swarm with the tastes of individual larva including the most mundane flavors of rock and the most exotic the flavor required for swarming matched that of the princesss food since she normally consumed most of the food in the process of maturing she then had to find similar rock in another place for her nest this particular female had an extremely exotic taste so had been unable to find any more of her kind of rock she could not mate until she was assured of a proper nesting site once she found that she would summon a male and they would mate and she would go to the new site to make the nest the reason the squiggles who were fairly canny creatures thought volney might be interested was that this princesss taste was for airflavored stone she had found her vein and consumed it but that seemed to be the only such vein available generally wiggles preferred rockflavored stone she was a real rarity but what she might not realize was that there was a good deal of airflavored stone on the surface because of the way the air contaminated everything it touched in fact a similar taste accounted for those few swarms that occurred at the surface when a wiggle female happened on the surface and had a matching taste the creatures of the surface believed that they had to destroy every wiggle larva in the swarm to prevent any from generating new swarms that was their ignorance the truth was that their effort made very little difference apart from some temporary complications caused by the manner the larvae drilled through things because none of the larvae would have the same taste as their queenmother only those with some taste for deep rock who managed to reach a suitable vein of it would survive all the surface creatures needed to do was ignore the swarm and it would pass thus spake the squiggles who had been more than satisfied to educate one of their lofty volish cousins on the facts of life at the other end of the spectrum all this was news to volney who had shared the conventional surface creature alarm about wiggle swarming that showed that there was some justice to the attitude of the lower species of ground borers the voles of the vale had gotten out of touch and were forgetting the nature of their relatives he would have to reeducate his companions of the vale once this mission was over but first he had to get it over and that was not a sanguine prospect vale of the vole though a wiggle swarm might not be the disaster he had supposed it would still be devastating enough in the temporary sense because of the way the larvae drilled through everything they encountered leaving their little zzapp holes such holes could be quite painful for other living creatures and even lethal to loose a swarm on the vale of the volehe remained uncertain how wise that might be even if the voles and other creatures there had sufficient warning to evacuate the area until the swarm had passed concerns of this nature had caused him to dismiss the notion of seeking the wiggle princess out of paw before but now with the failure of the other two members of the party to obtain help he had to try it he hoped he wasnt making a terrible error such were his thoughts as he tunneled down at a slant following the foul taste of the pebble periodically he rested and ate some fruit and root from his pouch for this was an extensive dig in due course he slept keeping his whiskers alert for nickelpedes he had no intention of being trapped that way again after two days the sourness of the pebble practically numbed his tongue he was getting close indeed in another moment he broke through to the tunnel network of the princess he blinked for it was lighted bright fungus grew on the walls illuminating the region in pastel shades there was a definitely feminine aura here he would have known immediately that this was the abode of a female even if he had stumbled on it by accident he paused to prepare himself for the encounter then sent out a call hi voletalk she answered immediately who intrudes on my network volney was taken aback her voice in vole terms was dulcet he had expected a somewhat grating encounter for his kind had very little contact with her kind i am volney vole seeking perhaps a favor his words reminded him of the manner his human and centaurian companions hissed their s sounds making their speech artificial he was of course too polite to mention it to them realizing that they probably suffered from infirmities of their palates she appeared and he was surprised again she was a surprisingly petite creature reminiscent of a female of his own species with gray fur that seemed to glow she resembled a wiggle larva not in the slightest she was definitely of the family of voles and i am wilda wiggle she responded i would be more than happy to grant you that favor but i am not at the moment seeking a mate so i have been informed he said surprised at her interpretation he vale of the vole was not her type a vole and a wiggle however compatible physically were incompatible genetically they could only go through the motions of mating never producing offspring my favor is not of that nature i am not of your particular species what is it then she fluffed out her fur looking very pretty volney became conscious of the grime on his own fur because of his two days of boring he should have taken time to lick himself clean but he had a remedy he shifted to his surface suit his fur turning gray his eyes brown because he had not been boring in that it was clean i am from the vale of the vole and we have a severe problem the demons are harassing us and they have straightjacketed our formerly friendly river the kissmee and made it and the vale unfriendly we are seeking some way to drive the demons off so that we can restore the river to its natural and superior state so that our vale may be pleasant again that is very interesting im sure she said politely but i think it is no affair of mine it occurred to me that if a wiggle swarming were to occur in that vicinity the demons would be discomfited and would depart allowing us to restore the river but wiggles do not swarm on the surface she protested there is no decenttasting rock there there may be he said according to the squiggles who bore both in the depths and near the surface there is a good deal of airflavored stone at the surface airflavored stone i understand that the flavor you prefer is of that nature i know what i like but i never knew what it was called do you mean to say that there is stone in the flavor i require at the surface the squiggles seem to think so when i first encountered them they mistook me for you because of the odor remaining on my fur therefore it seems that the particular atmosphere of the vale may be compatible for you you dont smell like my rock she protested it has largely dissipated now for i have been some time away from the vale but perhaps some smell remains in my pouch he opened his pouch she sniffed yes that is my flavor oh i wish i had known before i must mate and go there immediately there is a complication he said the larvae of a wiggle swarm are damaging to the creatures of a region damaging i know nothing of this vale of the vole that is because your kind normally swarms in limited veins of specialized rock where no other creatures live on the surface the range of a swarm becomes virtually unlimited because the larvae travel through the air which offers little resistance they leave holes in the creatures which is awkward oh i see i suppose that could be awkward as you say but why dont you use a containment spell i beg your pardon a containment spell this has been used historically by our kindon those rare occasions when our territory overlaps that of other creatures it confines the swarm to a set radius so that no harm occurs beyond it but doesnt that interfere with your cycle of reproduction if the larvae cannot travel freely how can they find the rocks they need not any more than a limited vein of swarming rock does she pointed out we wiggles are accustomed to limitations if the containment spell limits only the radius and not the depth some larvae will find deep rock those that remain on the surface have no chance anyway as they seek a different flavor volney was highly gratified then it appears we can exchange favors he said tell me where this containment spell is and i will tell you where the vale is she was visibly pleased she fluffed out her fur some more and gazed at him with eyes that shifted from brown to gray as her fur converted the opposite way it is lost at the moment someone carried it into a gourd and failed to bring it out would that be on the lost path in the gourd he asked remembering something that esk had said why yes i suppose so so if you go there you should be able to find it she gazed at him with those big eyes that were now turning from gray to violet while her coat became pleasantly green it was evident that the wiggles were more versatile about coloration than the voles were you are a handsome vole volney the vale isare you familiar with the outline of the land of xanth it is in the central part south of the gap chasm north of lake ogrechobee i am sure i can find it she said her eyes were brightening to red while her fur was turning silver i am so glad you came to see me there was something about her attitude that nagged him he looked into her face and realized what an extraordinarily attractive creature she was those blazing red eyes red eyes that was the color of mating vale of the vole i must dig on now he said quickly so nice to have encountered you remain awhile she breathed we could have such a good time he realized now what had happened wilda had found a suitable place to nest because he had told her of the vale and confirmed it with a smell that had moved her into her mating phaseand he was the closest male wiggles were not the brightest of voles just as the diggles werent they were governed mostly by staggered instincts first a wiggle found a place to eat and grow then the males turned to prowling and the females searched for nesting sites once the sites were found the females were ready to mate and the first male who prowled their way was the one that normally did not take long because they put out a mating scent that attracted any males in the vicinity the mating scent that was why she was becoming so attractive she was starting to generate it and he was feeling its initial impact they might be of different species but it seemed that this type of scent signal was universal if he remained he would soon be overwhelmed by it despite the distinction of species and and it was a trap not because there was any danger hi the act itself it was apt to be quite pleasurable but because they were of different species remember i am a vole while you are a wiggle he reminded her dont tell me you are prudish about cultures she murmured rubbing her fur against his the process sent an electric tingle through his body he took a deep breathand realized that the mating scent was getting to him he would be overwhelmed all too soon and then he wouldnt care about species it isnt prudishness he explained its pointlessness we would not be fertile you would produce no swarm i dont understand that she said when one mates one produces one swarm then one joins adult society and subsequent matings are infertile the genes differ you need to mate with one of your own species a wiggle male im sure one will happen along soon because the mating scent could circulate through the fissures of the rock reaching prospective males who would delay not a moment lets not wait she said nuzzling his neck the scent was about to overpower him volney knew why this was wrong but now he was having trouble remembering did it really matter she was such a lovely creature vale of the vole then he had a desperately bright notion he took the guide pebble from his mouth and jammed it up his nose now the bitterness of it overwhelmed the alluring mating scent and his mind reverted to normal now it was clear to him why this was a dangerous trap if he tried to mate with her it would not take therefore she would not become gravid and her mating instinct would not abate she would continue her desire to mate and her scent and appearance would reflect that desire and he would find himself locked into a perpetual mating role she would not seek any other while he was there and no wiggle male would intrude however eager for no volish creature was wanton about mating thus there would be no way for her to become gravid and no way for him to escape because a male could not deny the mating scent when it was in full strength he would never leave this tunnel not even to eat he would gradually starve unable to wrench himself away and his last act before he died would be another mating with her natures natural curtailment would not be invoked because of the genetic incompatibility other creatures of xanth could crossbreed but not the voles they were pure strains kept pure by this limitation well it might be possible for the mating to take if enhanced by the elixir of a love spring or by an accommodation spell but neither was present on this occasion so that was of no significance dont you like me wilda inquired he did not want to affront her because he wanted her cooperation when she did successfully breed with one of her own kind a wiggle swarm suitably contained should banish the demons from the vale and certainly it would rum the demons dikes and let the water out of the killmee channels i simply want what is best for you he said and that is a mating with one of your own species i must go locate the containment spell and that was most of the truthabout all she might be capable of assimilating i really dont understand she said she tickled his nose with a whisker the tickle caused volney to sneeze the foul pebble flew from his nose and was lost in the dust suddenly he was exposed to the full impact of the mating odor it was time for desperate measures volney held his breath and leaped for the wall he jammed on his external claws and dug at the wall with extraordinary vigor the rock powdered under the magic of the talons and a new hole developed vale of the vole whats the matter wilda asked did i say something to offend you i apologize dont apologize volney gasped remembering one more thing esk had mentioned some folk had a most intimate mode of apology but i only want to be nice to you she pleaded as volney breathed some of the scent reached him why not simply turn back and but his rational mind still had enough sway to dominateas long as he held his breath again he continued his digging getting his nose into the new rock filtering out the scent ah you wish to flirt she said i will play i will catch you yes catch me volney gasped he could dig his way out of her range and before she found him a wiggle male would pass within range of her scent and would preempt the mating then afterwards she would remember the vale and feel no outrage at volneys abrupt retreat but he had forgotten what good borers the wiggles were wilda started her own tunnel parallel to his pacing him and she readily matched his progress he had no more strength pills he could not enhance himself with a spell to outdistance her when she grew tired of playing she would loop her tunnel and cut off his and merge the two and then her scent would overwhelm him and they would be locked in the futile mating effort what could he do she was tunneling above him preventing him from going for the surface she might not be bright about the details of genetics but she was canny about tunneling as all the members of the great family of voles were it was inherent any related creature who could not tunnel well was soon squeezed out of the ground one of the shames of the surface creatures was surely their inadequacy as tunnelers maybe he could double back fooling her and then head for the surface before she could catch him she wouldnt brave the surface until after mating it wasnt the wiggle way he hoped he widened his tunnel making room to turn his body around then scurried back it was much faster reexcavating refuse rocks than boring through solid virgin stone and he made three times the speed he soon intersected her original suite and scrambled through it how nice she murmured wiggling her whiskers you have returned volney held his breath and skidded to a stop she had anticipated him he could almost feel the scent caressing his fur he spun about and plunged back into his tunnel soon he was back at its end boring forward could he angle it up now before she followed him back here vale of the vole he could not she was already angling her tunnel toward his he could tell by the sound of it then he had a dark notion he knew one place she wouldnt go abruptly he angled down he had the excellent volish spatial memory that enabled him to orient on any region he had visited before he knew where to go wilda paced him not closing in evidently curious about this new ploy she knew he couldnt dig down forever eventually he would have to turn up again and then she would end the flirtation and close in for the finale wouldnt it be easier he wondered just to let her catch him but then he realized that it was the scent influencing him every time he bored through a fracture zone a suggestion of that scent filtered through and now it was filtering through the fracture zones of his will to resist and centering on his desire if he let her catch him he would never make the rendezvous with his friends on the surface and the vale of the vole would not be saved he had to fight on through now he was nearing his current destination the living lava flow if he played this too close he would suffer another type of fate and as he fried to death he would wish he had remained with the wiggle princess after all for if he died in the lava then wilda would mate elsewhere and go to the valeand there would be no containment spell he felt the heat he did not know the full extent of the flow but did know where his prior tunnel to it was he angled across to intersect that hoping that wilda did not realize what he had in mind her tunneling slowed as she felt the heat of the lava this was not a region she liked she was hesitating while he ground on good he didnt like this region either and didnt want to go any further into it than absolutely necessary then she came to her decision her tunnel angled to intercept his volney increased his effort he was tired from the two days of solid boring he had done to reach the princess but he knew that he had to draw on any strength he had remaining if she caught him all was lost the heat of the rock increased this made the boring easier for his magic talons but also worried him he was approaching the lava from the other side and could not be sure of its limit despite his effort wilda was gaining on him before he could locate his tunnel of several days ago she cut him off her tunnel broke through into his and her nose appeared before his nose this is fun she said but i dont like this region lets go back to vale of the vole my suite and make love this was in the circumstances a virtually irresistible offer volney tried to hold his breath but his effort of boring had him gasping he could not stop breathing now he knew he had lost he breathed in her fragrance but strangely he felt no overwhelming desire for her now she was pretty and she was nice he found no fault in her he did not blame her for her nature in another situation he would have liked to associate with her more thoroughly but he no longer felt the compulsion to mate with her what had happened the scent that was strong in his nostrils now was that of the lava it was very close and the rock through which they were tunneling was hot that was it the lava was burning off the mating scent he had been saved by the flow princess wilda he said gently i like you and find you most attractive but i am not of your species and i would do you no favor by attempting to mate with you i must return to the surface to look for the containment spell so that your swarm may flourish in the vale without hurting any other creatures there go and find a mate of your own kind and take my best wishes with you her whiskers quivered unhappily you do not wish to mate with me i want to but know it would only harm you he said and realized that he was not being insincere i am doing what is best i will always remember you with deepest regret for what i cannot do for you are a delight among females then he resumed his tunneling heading up at a steep angle she squatted where she was for a moment then forlornly she turned and moved back toward her suite it was done somehow he was not thrilled if only he could have yielded it took him three days to reach the surface because he was tired he suspected the fatigue was emotional as much as physical the merest suggestion of that mating scent clung to his fur and every so often he got a faint whiff and it sent him into a daydream of regret the princess was a wiggle true but she had been most delectable now that his decision had been made he was free to regret endlessly what might have been foolish as that would have been he could appreciate esks problem with the brassie girl the sweetest temptation could be that which was known to be the most foolish vale of the vole he had one day remaining to make the rendezvous when he broke surface it was not that far away so he collapsed and slept on the next day he trudged on to castle roogna and to the orchard there were esk and chex and the brassie girl and the skeleton man and the old curse fiend and of course little ivy who dashed up and hugged him exactly as if he were one of her pets the odd thing was that he discovered that he liked it he felt much more volish in that moment they exchanged histories it turned out that esk had gotton the ogres to agree to help already the gross humanoids were organizing in their dull fashion for their tromp to the vale chex had gotten the winged monsters to agree too they would appear in due course then volney with some misgiving explained what he had accomplished a wiggle princess ivy exclaimed with the characteristic humanoid problem with the s how excssiting chex was far more sober a wiggle sswarm she asked alarmed thatss quite a rissk we sshall have to ssearch for the containment spell on the losst path esk said that led to a discussion of ways and means the gourd was very chancy who should enter by the zombie route and who should stay behind i dont want to enter that way bria protested it might get me permanently fouled up readily ssolved chex said let essk return you to the losst path then he will look for you from the insside and resscue you again then you will be able to come to thiss world all the way physsically or to return to your ccity what iss your ccity called inssidentally brassilia bria responded but i may not want to return there it will be your choicse of coursse the centaur said volney could tell by her manner that brias hesitation was no surprise to the centaur of course the brassie girl wanted to remain here she was casting her scent for esk that was obvious to every member of the party except of course esk himself chex turned to the skeleton and you marrowdo you wissh to rissk the loop back in via the zombie gourd i confesss to developing an interesst in thiss world the skeleton said i am in no russh to return to the haunted garden sso i would like to travel with you if you concur but you rissk a convolussion whosse nature we do not properly undersstand she reminded him vale of the vole marrow shrugged he was very good at that because of the articulation and exposure of his bones it iss an interessting convolussion very interessting the centaur agreed that makess our party four i think that iss enough latia and bria can wait here and if we do not return in a week then i will go in after you bria said and latia will inform the voless of the vale that the ogress and winged monssterss and wiggless are coming sso they can prepare that settled it tomorrow their party of four would set out for the huge zombie gourd chex knew about volney knew it had to be done but he was ill at ease the notion of physically entering the gourd appalled him but not as much as the notion of letting his folk of the vale down chapter dreams it took them one day to reach the zombie gourd because the others could not travel as rapidly as chex they planned for a journey of two days within the gourd to find the containment spell and the same time to return giving them one days leeway the margin was the same but the stakes were rising the vale of the vole might well be hostage to their success chex brought out the pathfinder spell esk had used it for the path to the ogre fen and it would not work for him again so chex was taking her turn now the easiest and safest path for four folk to the lost containment spell she enounced carefully esk recognized the wisdom of that the gourd had its own difficulties and dangers such as entrapment on the lost path he had asked for the shortest path to the ogre fen and it had been slightly harrowing in places the gourd was bound to be worse the path appeared before them as they had anticipated it led into the huge peephole esk was nervous about this because of his prior experience with the gourd but he reminded himself that this was not the same situation when they entered physically they could depart physically on their own initiative also they had the guidance of the path and of course he had not been hurt before just confused he had even emerged with a couple of new friends but the others were leaping in and he had to follow before he got left out he leapedand found himself in the midst of rotting plants it was as if some monstrous blight had descended on this glade and caused the vegetation to sicken and die vombie plantv volney muttered evidently as bothered as esk was chex was showing the way along an overgrown and slushy path between depressions esk saw a fallen headstone and realized that these were sunken graves with the sickly plants crowding them he did not like this place at all vble of the vole watch the snake chex called esk looked ahead and saw a horrendous zombie serpent striking at marrows bone leg but its aim wasnt good it bit a plant instead the skeleton walked on unperturbed he was back in his original state having doffed the suit latia had made for him at some point indeed it seemed like a pointless affectation for him volney paused watching the snake he started to pass it and it drew back again to strike he scooted on ahead and the snake missed and bit the plant again it really was not particularly bright or swift as snakes went though perhaps was up to par as zombies went the oddest thing was that the plant was now becoming quite healthy the venom seemed to enhance it zombies are afraid of health chex called back so the bite threatens to deliver what they fear but we arent zombies and we cant be sure what it would do to us indeed they could not be sure esk timed the snake and zipped on by it and ran to catch up with the others they were now at a region of slashing knives this is the route i took before chex said the path leads here but it must diverge somewhere because i was going to centaur isle then she drew a knife from her pack and threw it into the gantlet there was an instant melee as the knives attacked the intruder knife they cut each other up in the process going wild and soon all of them were broken the four of them should be able to pass this waybut the marks of the pathfinders path no longer seemed to go here chex nodded it changes the knife fight is merely a key not a part of the path she set out along a new path that proceeded back the way they had come the decaying vegetation had changed to decaying stone and other junk chex came to a green rock that was so far gone it resembled a fungus she lifted a forehoof and struck it against this rock the thing flew apart where the pieces landed they sank into the ground and awful green fire rose up spreading to the ground itself consuming it before long something showed beneath a platform of wood that did not burn chex knocked the near end of the wood and it dropped and the far end swung up there was a hollow beneath with wooden steps leading down now the path should lead away chex remarked but it did not the wear marks that signaled the proper route proceeded down those steps vale of the vole i admit i was curious about this the centaur said but it means the route will no longer be familiar to me at least this has been enough to show you the way of it the path can be devious indeed it could bel but reasonably safe and easy esk repeated he wished he knew what was considered reasonable in the strange world of the gourd if striking zombie snakes represented safety what would represent danger chex stepped down into the pit somewhat awkwardly it was evident that centaurs were not made for stairs there was a landing below large enough for the four of them beyond it a broad lighted passage extended and this was clearly the path they lined up four abreast and walked onward this really wasnt very bad so far maybe the path was going to be easy by human definition then they came to a rusty barred gate across the passage behind it stood four grotesque zombies one was a rotting man another a decaying centaur another a moldy vole and the last a tattered skeleton this has abruptly become specific chex remarked something knows we are here i am not reawured volney said it is not unknown marrow said we of the gourd are animations of the concepts of bad dreams now that youand it seems ihave entered this realm physically those dreams are coalescing i suspect this will become rather unpleasant for you not for you chex inquired i do not dream of course so cannot have a bad dream but that figure before you looks very much like a spoiled skeleton yes this is odd it must have mistaken me for a living creature i am not certain whether to feel flattered or insulted but what do we do now esk asked break through the gate it has no opening and the bars are too closely set to let us through if as i conjecture these are animations from our minds it will be necessary for us to face them directly marrow said they are of course intended to frighten us away bad dreams lose their power when the subject fails to flee in terror he glanced around i hope you will not repeat that in the outside world trade secret you know esk would have laughed if his knees hadnt felt so weak then i shall face my doppelganger chex said boldly she stepped up to the gate the zombie centaur stepped up similarly as if it were a mirror image it met her right at the gate she put out her right hand and it matched her with its left she touched itand her hand passed through its hand vale of the vole no not throughinto the two merged and disappeared startled chex drew back her arm so did the zombie and both hands reappeared like water esk exclaimed like putting your hand into water it disappears and so does the reflection that must be it chex agreed grimly she spread her wings part way as she tended to do when wrestling with a concept and the zombie did the same then she stepped forward into the gate the doppelganger duplicated the motion they merged their two front sections disappeared into each other leaving a tworeared beast then the rears merged leaving only the two briefly swishing tails finally the tails drew together in the center and were gone then a picture formed superimposed over the gate it was of chex galloping through a forest casting worried glances back over her shoulder what was she fleeing from she entered a field now the pursuit came into view it consisted of a herd of centaurs males females and young ones brandishing spears and bows they seemed intent on killing her the field terminated in a rough slope strewn with rocks chex had to slow to avoid cracking her hooves against the rocks and the pursuing centaurs gained one aimed his bow the descent became sharper until she could go no farther without losing her footing entirely beyond was a dropoff to a raging river there was no chance of fording that if she tried she would be dashed to death against the rocks in the river her plight and her terror were manifest its only a vision esk called it cant hurt you just a bad dream chex heard him she glanced at him with realizationand abruptly was back in the passage with them the dream gone the zombie centaur was back on its side of the gate unchanged the way remained barred chex was breathing hard she had evidently had quite a scare you saw it she asked we saw it esk agreed you were being chased by centaurs they condemned me because of my wings she said they regarded me as a freak exactly as the real centaurs do esk agreed then that is your deepest fear or shame marrow said the worst dream the night mares can bring you rejection by your own kind vale of the vole she shuddered yes i try not to think about it but it does hurt terribly i want to be part of my species and i cannot be you must face it down marrow said how can i do that they will kill me if i do not flee them but a dream death is not a real death esk reminded her i hope youre right she said grimly dont wake me this tune she marched back into her doppelganger the two disappeared again into each other and the dream reappeared chex was fleeing through the forest heading for the field but this time she forced herself to stop and to turn and face her pursuers you have no right to harass me like this she cried i am what i was foaled to be it is no fault of mine freak freak they chorused death to all freaks then they stabbed her with their spears and shot her with their arrows and carved her with their knives until only a shuddering mass of flesh remained chex woke screaming the second dream had been worse than the first the threatened violence had been no bluff esk jumped over to her and opened his arms she reached down and clutched him to her heedless of the physical or social awkwardness oh it was horrible she cried i died they killed me and it hurt and i was mutilated and dead terrible esk agreed holding her as well as he could though her pectorals were squeezing against his neck that was evidently an improper way to face that fear marrow said first i fled then i faced them chex sobbed hysterically both were wrong what else can i do that iv for uv to convider volney said vhe hav tried the ekvtremev what remainv between chex disengaged from esk here im acting like a silly filly of course this is a problem to be analyzed and solved i was reacting in blacks and whites when reality is generally in shades of gray but the dream had such verisimilitude it overwhelmed me such what esk asked daunted by the sixsyllable word she had used it was realistic she clarified it made me believe i was there even though i knew better it made me believe you were there at first esk said and i thank you for your support she said i am coming to appreciate the value of friendship vae of the vole friendv volney said nodding in his emulation of human idiom could we join you there and oppove the ventaurv say yes esk exclaimed four are better than one and marrow could give them a real start i appreciate the offer chex said but i wouldnt want to put you into that sort of danger perhaps you could not actually be killed but believe me you could be hurt i felt that pain in any event i believe this is my personal challenge to surmount if should do it with help it wouldnt count they saw the justice in her position but if you cant fight them or reason with them or escape them what can you do esk asked reject them marrow said chexs eyes widened i think youre right i was treating them seriously both times and so they had power i gave them that power yet you knew they were figments of a dream esk said they still attacked you im not sure that just telling them you reject them will do any good no it wont she agreed i have to prove it and since this is a dream i think i know how she faced the gate wish me luck mountains of it esk said cavev of it volney agreed rib cages of it marrow said she nerved herself visibly then strode into the gate she disappeared against the zombie centaur and the vision formed this time she ran to the field then braked and whirled the horde of centaurs charged up brandishing their weapons you have no authority here she cried this is my dream i reject you and all you stand fornarrowness intolerance violence that is not my way and should not be yours they charged on her weapons flashing oh no esk thought it wasnt working then chex spread her wings and leaped into the air the wings stroked powerfully the downblast stirring up a cloud of dust and blowing back the manes of the centaurs she rose above them slowly grandly she was flying the centaurs gaped this was entirely unexpected i reject your landbound ways chex cried you have no wings so you condemn those who do that is your fundamental failingsour grapes now the centaurs began to recover they lifted their weaponsand chex accelerated her wing beats and launched up into the sky quickly of the vole passing out of range i dont need your approval i dont fear your condemnation she called i have my own life to live i leave you behind then she woke she was back on the floor panting flushed with victory and the dream was gone but in real life i still cant fly she said sadly i recognized that the terms of the dream were different and that if i had awful liabilities i also had wonderful abilities they go together the extremes are feasible in the dream so i drew on the positive and vanquished the negative and do you know its true i dont need the centaurs anymore im free of my liability of false desire i no longer want to be like them or accepted by them i want to explore my own horizons which are so much greater than theirs their reality is valid for them i could not flee them as long as i desired their acceptance nor oppose them as long as i knew that their dream presentation was merely an exaggeration of their actual way i could not defeat them on their own turf but when i invoked my turf they were helpless she paused realizing that the others were staring at her whats the matter do you disagree esk found his voice youre through he said i she looked around why im on the other side of the barrier your victory marrow agreed i came to terms with my worst fear or shame she agreed it no longer haunts me the dream was only the representation of it the barrier was only another representation neither exists for me anymore and she walked through the gate without hindrance turned and walked through it again the metal bars had no substance esk stepped up to touch the barsand his doppelganger matched him reaching out to meet his hand from the other side esk jerked his hand back that barrier remained real for him the vombie ventaur iv gone volney said but the otherv remain we must conquer our own bad dreams esk said i vhall tackle mine the vole said and marched into the gate the zombie vole met him snouton the two merged and the dream formed it was of a tunnel whose walls glowed prettily with colored fungus he entered it by boring through the wall the magic metal talons on his front feet gouging through the rock as if it were mud another vole was thereno esk realized that there were subtle distinctions of form and coloration it was a female and not of precisely volneys species her eyes and fur changed color as his did but she differed too vale of the vole the wiggle princess chex murmured she had crossed the barrier again and now stood beside him oh esk thought of the demoness metna and began to understand the nature of the voles deepest shame volney came to stand before the wiggle she approached and they sniffed noses there was a pleasant smell as of blooming flowers it reminded him somehow of bna brassie and that was funny because she was made of metal and smelled of polished brass volney jerked away and the dream ended he was back in the passage on the near side of the gate i wav afraid it would be that he said you desire the wiggle princess chex said but the trap yes you explained the centaur said but you avoided her so you should have no shame in that connection you did what you had to do and we are on this quest for the containment spell because of it yet i came so clove to failing volney said because of my unworthmevv your what esk asked you always struck me as a fine figure of a vole i am not volney said the rejection by her kind that chekv feared iv alvo mine this requires explanation chex said arent you on a mission for your folk i ambut it iv not becauve i am the bevt for it but becauve i am ekvpendable expendable chex asked how could that be volney sighed it iv the time for the baring of vecret vhamev i was a vuitor for an ekvtremely vohvh female vole but vhe turned invtead to another an extremely vohsh vole turned you down chex asked surely that is no fault of yours yev it iv volney insisted volve mate for hfe and when i wav rejected i became ineligible for any vubvequent matvh there wav nothing for me to do but depart one rejection makes youtaboo chex asked that hardly seems reasonable you are not a vole he reminded her think of me av having vprouted wmgv point made she agreed grimacing but then you were goingand helping your folk esk said where is the shame in that vale of the vole i did not undertake the mivvion for the good of the vale but av a pretekvt to depart volney explained still you did plan to complete it didnt you yev but when i met wilda you were tempted to forget your mission chex concluded yes i can appreciate that but you did resist that temptation so there is no shame the vhame iv in the temptation volney said i vhould not have been i doubt it marrow said you resisted that temptation both in life and in the dream chex nodded i think you have not yet faced your deepest fear or shame volney sighed with an exhalation of vs then muvt i fave it now he said he walked forward into his doppelganger vole the scene reformed dulcet wilda wiggle came forward to meet him sniffing noses the smell of flowers grew strong volney hesitated then took the plunge if seduction by her was not his deepest potential shame what was he moved in to embrace her in the vohsh way her nose wiggled she was smelling something a picture formed above them a scene within the scene a female vole turning away from the volney of the scenelet she realizes he is a rejectee chex murmured abruptly the wiggle turned away the scent of flowers faded volney was left thererejected again abruptly he woke back beside them in the passage now his deepest concern was clear that his basic unworthiness as a vole would have alienated the wiggle princess had he chosen to dally with her then he would have been guilty twice of betraying his mission and his vale and of failing at that there is only one solution chex said complete your mission then if there is fault it is none of yours and you need have no further shame the wiggle princess would not reject you then but if she did you would know that it was her error not your own but i am guilty of unvolivh weaknew he protested only in your bad dream she said you are afraid of weakness you have not practiced it in life volney shrugged then he marched back into the zombie vole the dream formedand dissipated immediately leaving volney on the far side of the gate vale of the vole now you believe chex said the dream has lost its power over you thus it was unable even to form now i believe volney agreed i will complete my mivvion regardlew of temptation or rejecvion esk took a breath my turn he said the zombie man came to meet him esk mergedand his dream opened out it consisted of a swirling universe of stars and dust and moons all moving in the splendor of their separate trajectories rather than being fixed in their shell the way they were in reality the moon instead of being a mass of green cheese was in this weird vision a monstrous ball of cratered rock and strangest of all the land of xanth was but a peninsula on the surface of a giant mundane sphere esk would have known that this was a hallucination even if he hadnt already been aware that it was only a dream the scene kept coming toward him the detail expanding until it became a map of xanth on which he was standing then a parallel picture formed identical to the first except that esk was not in it that was all he stood disembodied studying the two pictures one with his image and the other without there was absolutely no other distinction between them he screamed in a moment he found himself back in the passage chex hurried across and embraced him much as he had embraced her between her dreams comforting him as his horror slowly faded but what doev it mean volney asked perplexed i vaw no monvterv no vhame merely two venev there was no difference esk cried none at all true chex murmured but this was no horror to us why should it be to you as he thought about it esk came to understand it i am in one and not in the otherand there is no difference i make no difference at all yes esk chex said it doesnt matter whether i live or die esk said xanth is just the same what justification is there for my existence that is only your fear not the reality chex reminded him but maybe it is reality he argued i am nothing and nobody what i do doesnt matter i realize now that i set out to see the good magician because i needed some proof that i had some importance some mission in life getting rid of the demoness saving my folks from herthat was only a pretext i hoped the good magician would somehowmake me worthwhile vale of the vole but you are worthwhile chex said how can you doubt that i tell myself i am esk said but deep inside im not sure that it is so what have i done to make any difference at all to xanth if i had never lived would it matter to anyone or anything the picture with me in it is just the same as the one without me she considered i suppose that could be but it would be similarly true for all of us objectively viewed we may ah be unworthy but i think there is an answer you dont have to settle for what you are at this moment you can work to make a difference this is what volney will do then the pictures will change esk nodded when you say it it does seem to make sense but how can i make a difference xanth is so big and im so small how much difference would the kissmee river make a lot but thats volneys mission were only helping but if he cant do it without you and if i could help him do itthen there would be something that would not be the same without me esk said liking the notion he walked back into the gate the zombie met him and merged and the dream came again i am nothing now esk said but i can make a difference and im going to try if i succeed i will be something thats all i can doall any person can do to make an honest try if thats not enough then nothings enough and its not worth having any bad dreams about the pictures shimmered then something wriggled on the one that had his image a river that was almost straight on the other map was assuming curvature here that was all it was only a dream but it gave esk tremendous satisfaction he knew what he had to do to abolish his deepest fear to guarantee that his life had some bit of meaning his life was not necessarily empty until he failed to accomplish that mission the vision dissipated esk found himself standing on the other side of the gate only marrow remained on the original side it is my turn the skeleton said but i hesitate that is understandable chex said we have all had very difficult experiences i have no concern about a bad dream marrow said i do not dream because i am not alive my concern is that either there will be no reaction because there is nothing in me to generate itno fear no shame no guilty secretor that my attempt to cross will trigger an error that will blow the program vale of the vole do what esk asked this trial is geared to living folk with dreams marrow explained if one without dreams enters it the mechanism could clash unable to orient and the entire setting could be compromised or destroyed i am uncertain whether this should be risked he has a point chex murmured he is a creature of the bad dreams how can he have one of his own what happens esk asked if the program ah blows this entrance to the framework of the gourd would be closed off marrow said you might be trapped here with no route of escape or there could be emotional or physical damage to the three of you marrow iv a good guide volney said we may not complete the quevt without hiv advive then maybe we should risk it esk said chex nodded maybe we should there is after all no indication of trouble there is a skeletal zombie ready come on through marrow the skeleton shrugged it is as the saying goes no skin off my sinus cavity he marched into the gate the zombie skeleton met him and the two merged a picture started to form it showed marrow standing in the passage exactly as he was then it dissipated and marrow was standing back where he had started it tried to make a dream for him esk exclaimed and found nothing on which to fasten marrow said im not sure of that chex said there had to be something even to start it and i think we should understand what it is it could be significant he was bounced without a dream esk said it thought there was going to be a dream so it started it but then it found out there wasnt so it ended but there was a dream she insisted a simple one but nevertheless a dream that suggests that marrow does possess some reality on our terms now volney was interested what could vuch a reality be he hav no life the picture was just of him unchanged esk said for a moment i thought it was him until it faded indeed it was me marrow said since i have no life i have no dream it was just a picture of me as i am yes it was chex agreed therefore that must represent your deepest fear or shame vale of the vole i have no fear or shame marrow repeated that may be why you were rejected chex said because it accepts only those who can reconcile their dreams and i had none to reconcile marrow said nodding his skull no because you refused to come to terms with it that amused esk why should he come to terms with what doesnt exist because it does exist she said firmly had it not existed he would have passed through without challenge but there is a zombie doppelganger waiting for him and he cant pass until he overcomes that deepest spectre within him there is nothing within me marrow protested my skull and rib cage are completely hollow as you can see he knocked on his skull with a knucklebone and the sound was hollow so was the skeleton in the dream she agreed you mean hes afraid of himself esk asked incredulously perhaps she gazed at marrow are you what could there possibly be to fear in that marrow asked irritated you are avoiding an answer but there is nothing in me to fear by me the skeleton said i exist only to generate fear in living human folk i have no other reality so your dream suggests chex said does that please you why should it i have no right to be pleased or displeased it is merely my situation again you avoid an answer how do you think i feel marrow demanded id be pretty upset esk said here my deepest fear was that i counted for nothing in xanth so my life may have no meaning you arent even alive thats one step below me even it would be foolish of me to wish for life marrow said curtly it involves messiness how can a creature who isnt alive be foolish chex asked life is just a mass of awkwardnesses about consuming substance and eliminating substance marrow said of discomfort and pain and shame the end is exactly what i already am dead it is pointless but life has feeling chex said and you have feeling is your deepest fear that you can never be any more than you are now but i can never be more why dont you try the gate again she suggested vale of the vole marrow shrugged and walked back into the zombie this time a more substantial picture formedof him as he was but i dont want to be like this forever marrow cried abruptly and maybe i dont have to bel if esk can make of himself something worthwhile why cant i aspire to be more than a spook the dream held for a moment more then faded and marrow was on the near side of the gate i will hug you chex said she did so marrow seemed dazed esk could understand why the skeleton was coming alive at least in aspiration that was an enormous advance esk marveled privately he understood how living folk could become dead but not how dead folk could become alive was this a genuine process or merely an illusion spawned by this realm of dreams suppose marrow only thought he was starting to dream and therefore to live lets move on chex said briskly we now have better notions of our motives and natures but it will come to little unless we find that containment spell all too true they moved on along the passage which seemed brighter now no more rot volney remarked sniffing the floor we have pawed beyond the vombie region i am glad of that chex said not merely because i am not partial to rotting flesh but because this means that this is indeed an access to the whole of the world of the gourd not merely the zombie segment this path is proving itself then the passage terminated in a blank wall the path went right up to that wall and into it but they could not pass through that solid stone what now esk asked dismayed chex passed her hands along the wall feeling for crevices or loose panels while volney sniffed at the bottom for any evidence of impennanence both found nothing the wall remained completely solid and immovable any notions marrow esk asked wryly perhaps there is obviously a way through this barrier as there was through the last we have but to find that way esk suppressed a sharp response about restatements of the obvious then what is your notion this is the realm of dreams perhaps a dream is needed for the wall you mean if we dream we can pass it then we can more likely we shall have to handcraft a dream as is generally done here vale of the vole chex became interested how does one handcraft a dream of passing through a wall one designs it and implements it the skeleton said seriously chex showed signs of suppressing the same irate response that esk had could you be more specific certainly it is possible that if we portray a passage through the wall it will operate as portrayed chex seemed doubtful but she scouted about the passage until she found a fragment of stone that was black and crumbly she used this to mark a black line on the wall she extended it into a crude picture of a door then she pushed against the door nothing happened let me try esk said he took the rock and drew a doorknob then he made as if to grasp and turn that knob it turned the door opened out of the wall startled they piled through they entered a large gallery in which many lovely pictures were hung exhibitions at a picture chex remarked looking around the path led past scenes of rivers and lakes and waterfalls past scenes of deserts and badlands and dry holes past scenes of snowy forests and flowering bushes past scenes of strange houses including one with chicken legs until it stopped at a portrait of a gargoyle a stream of water was issuing from the monsters mouth and splashing into a pond below their path went up the wall and into the pond in the picture esk sighed ill try it he said he poked his finger at the pond his finger passed into the picture and he felt the wetness of the water he pushed his arm through and it got wet too finally he put both arms into it ducked his head and dived forward into the picture he splashed in the pond which was deeper than it looked he swam and in a moment hauled himself out onto the pavement beyond the pond dripping he looked back but saw nothing except the rest of this landscape which was a pleasant country village whose source of water was evidently this fountain the sun was high in the sky buttressed by fleecy clouds he had entered the world of the picture the path traveled on down a road which led into an ordinary forest there was nothing to indicate that this was the world of the gourd there was a splash behind him volney vole appeared in the water in a moment he caught the rim of the pond and hauled himself out as esk had done then marrow arrived appearing from nowhere the skeleton could vale of the vole not swim he simply put his bone feet down and walked along the bottom until he came to the edge then esk reached down and caught a bone hand and helped haul marrow up and out there will be a splash marrow warned indeed there was as chex landed in the pond this time esk was watching closely she appeared as if jumping out of a mirror first her front section then her hindquarters the mass of her body caused the water to rise and overflow she had a difficult time climbing out of the pond she got her forepart clear but esk had to catch her hands to help her brace and lift a hind foot and marrow grabbed that hind foot and lifted it to the rim then they helped roll her up and over that brink as she hauled her other hind foot up she got on her belly precariously poised by the pond and finally managed to tilt her body away from it so she could get back to her feet if this is the easiest and safest path she grunted i would very much dislike the most difficult and hazardous one she shook herself spraying water out i hope we dont have far to go yet they walked down the road to the forest as they passed the first trees the path abruptly diverged from the road and plunged into the thickest tangle of vegetation chex sighed i should have known but something was nagging esk this path seems familiar somehow naturally marrow said it is the lost path and the lost containment spell will be on this path esk exclaimed were getting close buoyed by this realization they piled onto the devious path only marrow seemed apprehensive there will be no escape by having your eye contact with the window to the gourd broken this time he warned that chilled esks enthusiasm but he saw no alternative but to forge ahead if they became trapped on the lost path despite the guidance of the pathfinder spell then their dream of saving the vale of the vole was vain but if they did not take this path the dream would be abandoned chapter elements he path was inordinately convoluted but as they traveled it it seemed clear enough just as had been the case when esk was on it before soon the familiarity was unmistakable he remembered the contours before long they would come to the place where say marrow he exclaimed will you be where you were i am here of course the skeleton said i mean that if you entered my world the same way i entered yours just in mind rather than in substance your body should i doubt it we magical creatures lack your grip on reality we are entirely where we appear to be so neither i nor bria brassie will be on this path you found us so we are no longer lost chex nodded silently she had evidently figured this out for herself that makes sense esk said but he remained nervous suppose the skeleton did appear in the path but when they came to that spot only the dent left by marrows hipbone remained in the ground marrows explanation had been correct his whole existence was where it seemed to be there were indeed differences between the living and the magical creatures before he had had to hold marrows bone hand to get him unlost now marrow was walking independently because he had been found evidently the pathfinders path superseded the qualities of the lost path and none of them was lost something red bounded away chex was startled but esk reassured her thats only a roe roes are red she gave him a peculiar look but did not comment then they reached the potted plant thats a violent esk said nonchalantly violents are blue she looked at him again and again stifled her comment it was supposed to be planted on a median strip but they rejected it esk continued vale of the vole she finally bit why because they didnt want any more violents on the media he explained innocently that does it she exclaimed i am going to throw you into the thorn bushes please dont that would nettle me she took a step toward him but was interrupted by volneys squeal of laughter embarrassed she faced away instead suspect she is the one who got nettled marrow remarked they went on in silence soon they passed the eye queue vine and the lost vitamin f and the other items until they passed the place where bria had been esk remembered her kisses of apology and felt himself flushing here is where the brassie picked up that accommodation spell marrow remarked the what esk asked startled the lost accommodation spell elves and other creatures use them when they want to breed with folk the wrong size or type how can it be lost if the elves use it chex asked its not listed in the lexicon just as the eye queue is not so it is lost marrow explained patiently just how does an accommodation spell accommodate esk asked now quite interested he remembered how friendly bria had become about that time and wished he had realized the spells nature before if an elf wishes to breed with a human being or an ogre or whatever the accommodation spell when invoked makes them appear to be of similar size thus they can accomplish their desire with reasonable dispatch suppose they are different in type rather than in size esk asked if for example one were flesh and the other metal the spell would make them compatible marrow said those elven spells are quite potent they could breed i suspect that someone has designs on someone chex remarked she glanced at esks flush and that someone doesnt mind very much is it uh one of those onetime spells esk asked like the pathfinder where one person can only no its continually invokable marrow said i was haunting an elf once in a dream and he was living with a mermaid on a regular basis he was afraid of death not of loss of the mermaid and he had been with her for years he made a fleshless grin i assumed the semblance of an elven skeleton and chased him right to the edge of the water but then the vale of the vole mermaid put her arms around him and shielded him from the fear i represented and i had to retire she had a bosom like that of chex except that it was glistening wet my pectorals get glistening wet when i exercise in hot weather chex remarked but whatwhat about an unreal person esk asked with tormented excitement how could she we have already seen some progress with marrow himself chex murmured sometimes the unreal becomes real in association with real folk they continued walking the path but esk was hardly aware of the other details along the way had brias apologies really been because of the nature of her culture or to impress him she had impressed him all right but what had been her motive was her true interest in him or in getting unlost or in trying to become real the more he considered it the more it seemed to him that she had wanted some avenue out of her predicament and he was what had been available so she had left the gourd with him and now had independence of a sort she could use that accommodation spell with any other male why should she bother with him he wished that thought did not bother him so much well look at that chex exclaimed startling him out of his reverie our path diverges from the lost path but the containment vpellivnt it lovt volney asked perhaps not in quite the way we assumed chex said or perhaps there is a section of this lost path that is neither easy nor safe so we must detour past it they followed the pathfinders path it led into a region completely different from their recent experience splashes of color formed in the air above it spreading and changing and dissolving strange sounds sounded groans and whines and unpleasant laughter smells wafted by some like perfume some like rotting brains it is good to return to conventional horrors marrow said enthusiastically thats right chex said this is the origin of bad dreams i had almost forgotten yes these are the sensations experienced by those alone and nervous arent they lovely lovely she agreed with resignation then a huge face formed above them its eyes glowing whoo invades theese mmy premisesss it demanded windily vale of the vole oh go retire to the lost path chex snapped at it weve been through enough already oooh sooo the face asked scowling the mouth opened wide impossibly wide until it was larger than the face itself from it came another entire face uglier than the first with a hugh warty nose and daggerlike teeth tressspasssers this new face hissed look would you mind chex asked impatiently we are trying to get somewhere and were getting tired of routine spooks just let us alone aarrgh the face growled it opened its mouth and the dagger teeth flashed from this orifice came a third face even worse with little dancing flames in lieu of eyes and a beak instead of a nose and a hole like a deep cave for a mouth will you leave oft chex shouted she unslung her bow nocked an arrow and let it fly at the beak uh that might not be wise esk said somewhat too late he was amazed at the facility with which she had attacked the face he had known that centaurs were good with bows but had not realized just how good the arrow passed right through the beak for it was only an image in the sky but the face reacted with outrage it roared sending down a blast of frigid air admixed with sleet and lunged down at them before they could move the gaping orifice closed on them the monster had swallowed their party whole the temperature plummeted and the sleet quickly coated them with ice in a moment they found themselves standing on a snowcovered hill with the wind howling around them driving off any heat remaining in their flimsy bodies youre right chex said her teeth chattering i shouldnt have done that they huddled together for scant warmth except for marrow who wasnt affected though the snow was caking on his bones the storm raged around them blotting out the sun and indeed the sky they were unable to look into the wind the whole scene was just the rush of air it was mean in the belly of the air monster and it was increasing the force of the wind was threatening to sweep them right off the mountain even before they froze to death ssome easy ppath esk chattered i believe this is the realm of the element of air marrow com of the vole mented the gourd annex of course air becomes quite stormy when aroused fanvy that volney muttered from almost under the snow fancy that chex repeated lets burrow down for some warmth until this passes it will not pass marrow said when air is offended it will not rest until it destroys its offender indeed the storm was still intensifying the sleet and snow blasted at them like sharp sand their huddle was not effective there was too much exposed surface and the wind and cold were too intense we shall have to tunnel down below it chex said only i am unable to tunnel well and am afraid of close confinement only the knowledge that this is all the world of the gourd has enabled me to endure the subterranean passages we have navigated hitherto i am able to tunnel volney said he donned his special talons and more or less dived into the snow sending up a shower of white in a moment he disappeared into the hole he was excavating with only the flying refuse signaling his activity your fear of confinement did not manifest in your bad dream the skull remarked that is true she agreed surprised i was more afraid of rejection than of getting squashed if i conquered my deepest fear i should be able to conquer my lesser fear she squared her shoulders at any rate i will try i think at this point i would rather be squoze than froze but it will take too long to dig a hole in the ground big enough for all of us esk said we can make a snow fort to shelter us partially until the digging is complete chex said she tried to move snow with her hands but they quickly turned blue and her activity slowed she was freezing oh if only i had a shovel she exclaimed tucking her hands under her wings i will be your shovel marrow said kick me what esk asked kick me apart and form my bones into a shovel the skeleton clarified oh yes chex agreed bend over marrow bent over and she turned around and delivered a powerful kick to his bone posterior his bones flew apart but as they landed they connected in a chain chex formed this chain into a crude shovel with the long leg bones serving as the handle and the tines of the rib cage serving as the scoop there were a number of bones left over so esk formed these into a somewhat clumsier second shovel with the grinning vale of the vole skull as the scoop there was a linkage of tiny bones between the shovels it seemed that marrow never came completely apart they proceeded to dig and it went very well the energy they expended wanned them and the shovels worked very well despite their seeming clumsiness apparently the magic of the skeleton facilitated whatever task his bones were shaped to soon they had a massive excavation and the force of the howling winds was first cramped and then cut off meanwhile volney was still boring down abruptly his head appeared in the hole i have found a cave he announced however it may not be wive to enter it why not esk asked we cant stay here long well freeze there may be another monvter chex paused in her labor it is a warm cave comfortable but then lets chance the monster she exclaimed but what about the path esk asked we have to follow the path the path iv there volney said that does it chex said if i can scramble down your hole im going to in a moment volney said he resumed tunneling and the hole widened rapidly soon it was wide enough to allow chex to squeeze throughor so she judged push me when i need it she told esk handing him her shovel ignore me if i scream i may foolishly panic she had to lean her head and shoulders way forward and grasp her front legs with her hands and stretch her hind feet out behind it looked like an extremely uncomfortable position for her but she simply did what she had to to get by volney helped pull her from below and esk helped push her from above but the thickest part of her body wedged in tight and would not move she was stuck now what do we do esk asked rhetorically use one of my bones as a lever to pry her out the skull said startled esk almost dropped it but why shouldnt marrow talk when reformed into a shovel he spoke by magic anyway he set his shovel which had arm bones for its handle at the end of chexs shovel forming a doublelength pole can you hold firm if i push at the side certainly the skull said we skeletons pride ourselves on our rigidity esk slid the business end of the shovelpole down where the centaur vale of the vole was wedged then slowly leaned outward on the handle trying to wedge her body in just that amount needed to enable it to pass it didnt work a little to the left the skull suggested esk tried again to the left beside one of her folded wings yes thats it the skull said i can feel the give here a little more esk pushed a little harder suddenly chex gave a wiggle and her torso slid down a little it was working following marrows suggestions esk pried carefully in different places each time getting the torso down a bit more finally it slid the rest of the way down she was through esk dropped down behind her the hole debouched in a cave where the centaur and the vole were now standing in the light from the hole he had come from esk saw that chex was touching up some scrapes on her hide i ah had to pry a little he said good thing too she said i was in danger of suffocating not to mention panicking indeed she seemed shaken but she had survived the experience it was warmer in the cave and that was a blessing he spotted the faint glow of the pathfinder path it did indeed pass this way but what was this about a monster there was an eargrinding bellow from the direction the path led there was indeed a monster they exchanged glances but we cant go back chex said even if i could squeeze through going up i wouldnt care to theres only the angry element of air up there and it is supposed to be safe esk said so far it has been scary but we havent actually been hurt vo far volney agreed twitching his whiskers disapprovingly they moved on along the path it wasnt long before they found the source of the roaring it was a huge face set in the floor of the cave whose mouth was a cave in itself and whose eyes were steaming vents chex paused at the chin the last face was that of the element of air she said at least as personified here in the gourd that should make this one the personification of the element of earth growerr the mouth roared and sulfurous gases fumed up making them cough but the path led into this mouth lets put marrow back together while we consider chex said no need the skull said you may need a shovel or a lever again or a weapon wait till were clear of these difficulties if you dont mind carrying me vale of the vole i dont mind esk said he was coming to respect the skeletons properties increasingly marrow was a very versatile fellow if we invult thiv fave it could be movt uncomfortable volney warned that gave esk an idea so lets flatter it he said chex nodded perhaps we could have had an easier transition through air if i had not lost my temper that was a most uncentaurish thing for me to do have you ever seen a handsomer face esk asked loudly one with more uh earthly features why im not sure i have chex replied it is a most appropriate sculpture the huge mouth stretched into a smile the roaring abated lets go in and see what other wonders are here esk said im sure it is even prettier inside than outside that is certainly possible chex agreed we do tend to forget how much we owe to the element of earth without it we would have very little substance the smile stretched into a satisfied grin a large stony tongue protruded forming into a ramp they walked down this ramp into the mouth there was no squeeze at all after a short descent the ramp leveled out into a winding road through a network of caves stalactites hung from the ceiling and there were magnificent pillars rising from below their points seeking those of the stalactites with uncanny accuracy some were of prettily colored stone showing green and red and yellow in merging bands some were crystalline translucent seeming almost too delicate to survive any shudder of the ground in the region some glowed providing soft light for the path now it required no stretch of imagination to compliment the beauty of this region it was indeed lovely there were also chambers of broken stones but even these were remarkable the stones were assorted gems ranging from multicolored quartz to scintillating diamonds here chexs female nature asserted itself we are merely passing through she said but i wonderdo you think it would be all right if i took one little fragment of this lovely purple amethyst it is such pretty stone if the element of earth doesnt object the skull said chex leaned down to pick up one stone from a mound half her height may i keep this one she asked i promise to treasure it forever and my memory of this region vale of the vole from the walls of the cave there came a soft purring esk resolved to try the positive approach first in all future encounters with strange folk or forces what a difference it had made in this case finally they came to a wall of fire this promises to be more of a challenge chex remarked how do we enter the annex of the element of fire without getting burned i suspect you will have to become flames the skull said chex laughed then sobered that was not humor she concluded it certainly isnt funny esk said i dont want to get burned up perhapv more imaginavhion volney asked you mean make another picture of a door and step through it chex asked but if beyond is the realm of fire we would still be burned esk pondered we insulted air and almost got wiped out in a snowstorm we complimented earth and had a very pleasant tour suppose we compliment fire these elements have power and they can make things hard or easy for us if they choose chex nodded if air could almost freeze us to death maybe fire can refrain from burning us to death if it chooses but how do we compliment fire you might try telling it the truth marrows skull said the truth esk asked that we dont want to get burned that we have a mission to perform and need its help it was esks turn to nod ill try it he faced the wall of fire o element of fire he intoned we are four travelers who must pass through your realm may we talk to you a giant face formed in the wall with eyes like sunspots and a mouth like a monstrous magnetic flux ooooh it inquired hotly yes we have traversed air and earth and now we come to you we have used you in our cooking and to heat us when we are cold we appreciate your power but we cannot touch you without being hurt will you let us pass without being burned the face considered you must become flame it said enunciating each syllable with a flare of fire but esk began we can become flamewithout being hurt chex cut in yesif you accept the fireface said and we can go on to the next realm yes then we accept she said how do we become flame for answer the mouth opened into a big fiery circle vale of the vole we have to trust the word of the element of fire chex said then she leaped into the circle she vanished in her place was only a dancing flame in the shape of a centaur esk stared horrified it burned her up he whispered the centaurflame turned and made a beckoning motion nothat is her the skull said she has become flame throw me in next esks hand was shaking but he heaved the bone staff through the hoop it converted into a flame the shape of a skeleton it muvt be true volney said the path iv vuppoved to be vafe remember heave me up nekvt esk leaned down and locked his hands together the vole put a hind foot in then heaved as esk heaved and managed to flop into the circle he too disappeared in flame now it was esks turn he contemplated the ring of fire and quailed was it really safe to pass through that hoop or had the others been burned up and mocking flameimages substituted how could he be sure chex had conquered her claustrophobia and entered earth could he conquer his fear of being burned and trust his body to fire he hesitated unable to take the plunge the three fire folk beckoned him from beyond but fire demons would do that too it was no proof that his friends were all right then he thought about how he might escape if he did not enter the flame the path that had brought them here could not be traveled the other way there were too many barriers blank walls oneway pictures and such he could not return alone he had to be with someone who had the pathfinder spell that could ferret out a new path so he was lost by himself he might as well perish in the flame that gave him the doubtful confidence to take the plunge he took a breath held it and jumped into the hoop there was a flare of vertigo then he landed on a jet of fuel and it buoyed him and sustained him welcome aboard chex said for a moment i thought you werent going to rejoin us esk looked down at himself he was fashioned of flame be careful not to stray from a source of fuel volney cautioned you can fade quickly if careless esk did a double take youre not lisping he exclaimed his body flaring brightly with his surprise vale of the vole i never lisped the firevole said indignantly it is you who has corrected his hissing esk decided not to argue the case he quickly verified the fuel situation if he stepped off his jet his body became anemic and threatened to flare out there were many jets here so there was no problem he simply had to step from one to another he looked at chex she was changing shapel flame is malleable she said observing his look he wasnt sure how any of them saw or heard or spoke but they did i have trouble keeping my posterior hot so i am experimenting with a shape that is more efficient for this purpose she continued to change until she lost all semblance of centaurhood and most resembled the flame on a big candle then she extended a pseudopod of fire to an adjacent jet and flared up there and let her prior self die out esk tried it he merged his two feet into one base and felt better more of the fuel was pouring into his being he reached for the next jet and saw that it was an extension of flame rather than an arm why take the trouble to shape a useless arm when all he needed was the connection soon all of them looked like candle flames even marrow they commenced their trip across the realm of fire the path showed in the form of a pattern of fuels whether comprised of just gas or flowing liquid or sturdy solids they could endure on any of it though then color and heat varied as the fuels did the flavors of the fuels varied and their reliability gas was green and flickering while coal was blue and even and wood was yellow and sputtering they became connoisseurs of fuels for these were the stuff of life to be without fuel was to perish a horrible thought they crossed the field of fire and came to a sharp boundary water a seemingly endless lake stretched across the plain terminating the fuel and therefore the fire it seemed bleak indeed but the path continued into it we thank you for your hospitality fire esk said now we must move on through water a flame face appeared i dont envy you it said and flamed out oh element of water esk said addressing the lake we are four travelers who must pass through your territory may we do so in safety and comfort a face formed on the surface of the lake with eyes like whirlpools dive in it mouthed wetly but at the moment we are in the form of flames esk said we fear being abruptly quenched vale of the vole the water mouth simply opened into a widening ripple ring there was no other answer i will try it marrow said i have no life to lose the skeletonflame leaped into the water hissed hugely and flickered out oops volney said then a bonewhite fish poked its snout out of the water it spouted a stream of water toward them then turned tail esk looked at chex marrow so it would seem she said then ill follow esk dived into the water he felt the shock of the cutoff of his flame but at the same time he felt the pleasant pressure of the cool water he inhaledand felt the water surge through his gills he was now a fish there was another splash and a new fish appeared this one had brown scales and a large body with white fins above that fluttered like wings hello chex he said in fishtalk this is very like flying she replied pleased this is very like living the bonewhite fish said wiggling its bony fins there was one more splash and a squat fish with short fins appeared this is very like tunneling it said also pleased they swam across the element of water following the glowing trail of bubbles that marked their path they passed waving seaweed plants and bubbling underwater springs and regions where the sunlight speckled the upper surface and shallows where white sand lay like a desert with dunes and deeps where the seafloor was lost in the gloom of the unfathomable unknown it was indeed like flying chex fairly danced her upper fins stroking like wings moving up toward the surface and down toward the floor esk had never longed to fly but now he understood how it was with her there was a unique freedom in this mode that made landbound travel seem oppressively dull other fish came to watch them pass but these did not intrude on the marked path some were large and looked hungry but the path was evidently enchanted to keep them off in due course they reached the far side of the element of water gourd annex the path lead through a translucent vertical wall and there seemed to be no special challenge to passing through it except for their fishly status o void esk spoke we are four travelers needing to pass through your territory on a quest will you vale of the vole he broke off horrified what am i saying thats the void no one escapes from it except the night mares chex agreed equally horrified my dam was here once and had to be carried out by night mares she had to pay a fee of half her soul for that and my dammy mother too esk said and my fatherthey were left with no more than one full soul between them we cant go there you forget marrow said this is not the true void we face but merely its annex this is the dream of the void which horrifies sleepers even as you are being horrified now it is no more binding on you than the gourd itself chex nodded which was a nice accomplishment in her fishly form i suppose we can risk it then since the path leads into it and the path is supposed to be safe she sounded extremely uncertain we either trust it or we dont esk said since we must pass through it to reach the containment spell that is what we must do he hoped he sounded more assured than he felt his knees felt weak which was alarming because he didnt have any knees at the moment esk repeated his ritual address to the void but there was no response they discussed this and concluded reluctantly that if they could swim through the barrier it was probably safe to do so and they would assume appropriate forms in the next element perhaps even their own this time mutually nervous they linked hands and swam forward into the barrier together they found themselves floating in the air above a featureless plain the water was gone but they remained fish i thought i might revert to my own form chex said surprised as she spoke she did so becoming a centaur floating in the air without flying and be tied to the ground she added startled again whereupon she dropped to the ground her hooves striking with clunks then why arent the rest of us reverting esk asked the rest of them reverted similarly marrow was in his assembled form the complete skeleton i think i would have settled for a fleshly state he said wistfully and become a living man fully fleshed naked i think we have a special situation here chex said with a certain centaurish understatement very special volney agreed assuming the form of another man this is like the fire realm chex said there we could shape our forms and volney spoke as we do but here it is more so vale of the vole i had noted your amelioration of speech volney agreed i always wondered what it would be like to walk upright as human folk do or to be fleshed as living folk are marrow added assuming the form of a male centaur or to be masculine chex said turning male um we may be in danger of getting distracted from our mission esk warned the others immediately reverted to their natural forms i will be relieved when we finally reach the containment spell chex said we could be distracted for eternity in a place like this and the danger of that might be similar to that of the gourd via the peephole not to mention the risk to the vale of the vole all too true vohiey agreed there are dangers other than physical they followed the path which wound generally downward at first the scenery was blank but gradually trees and fields and bushes developed chex paused at the risk of distraction let me pose a question she said is it possible that there is no scenery and that we are imagining it if so things may not be what they seem easy to test esk said lets all concentrate on there being no scenery and see if it disappears they concentrated and it disappeared my next question chex said slowly is are we also imagining the path esk whistled wed better find out they concentrated but the path remained that at least is genuine chex said relieved we can imagine any scenery we want just so long as we dont lose the path they proceeded and the scenery formed again this tune more elaborately and less credibly it seemed to be a joint effort with voles and winged centaurs flying in the distance and trees growing in the manner of bones and bearing skulls for fruit and brass girls peeking from behind translucent metal curtains that showed their bronzed legs then the path led into a loop there was no question about this they circled the loop several times verifying that it went nowhere i think we have come to the end esk said but where is the containment spell abolish the scenery marrow suggested they concentrated and their surroundings became blank again now they saw that the paths loop enclosed a deep hole the terrain simply vale of the vole curved down until lost in a blackness so deep that it seemed to suck them in they had to yank their gazes away but what is it volney asked i suspect it is the center of the void marrow said the black hole from which nothing returns but if the spell is down there how can we bring it out esk asked you forget again marrow said this is the void annex not the void itself this is a representation of the center we might indeed be able to fetch something from it but the path does not go into it just around it volney said that suggests that the spell is not in it but but is it chex exclaimed the containment spell is the void esk asked confused i think i see the logic chex said what contains a wiggle swarm nothing esk said you have to catch and kill every one or there will be another swarm later not so volney protested point taken chex said quickly but we agree that there is no wall that will bar swarming wiggle larvae they zzapp through everything until they run out of energy or find their particular type of rock or get killed true volney agreed so the notion of a containment spell is a strange one she continued it claims to contain the uncontainable however there is one thing that contains anything inside it without exceptions and that is the void esk and volney chorused the void she agreed my dam and esks parents escaped the outer region of the void only through the intercession of the night mares who alone can range such regions freely so that outer wall of the void should contain the wiggles too not hurting them just preventing them from escaping it until they run out of energy and expire they would die happy imagining that they are in their favorite rock but they would not reach beyond it in due course all of them would be gone except those who drilled down and actually found their type of rock within the enclosed region the void is indeed the containment spell her logic was compelling but how can we take thethe void with us to the vale esk asked obviously we cant she said but perhaps we can take this representation of it and it will do the job imagination wont stop a wiggle swarm esk protested a wiggle larva has very little imagination it is singleminded true but i suspect that this gourd void operates like the peephole if vale of the vole we take it to the vale and set it up it will lock the wiggles into the real void which is a region just like this only more permanent and the effect will be the same then all we shall have to do is return it to the gourd and she broke off as the implication sank in marrow was the one who voiced it how do we set up the void there without being trapped in it ourselves and how do we return it to the gourd when we are done with it there must be a way esk said we really have two problems getting it there and getting it backwithout being trapped in it marrow leaned over the hole peering at it dont do that chex exclaimed if you fall in it is only a representation the skeleton reminded her he reached down picked up the edge of the hole and folded the hole in half then as the others stared he folded it again into a quarter and continued until it was a small wad he could hide in one bone fist the problem of moving it has been solved i was concerned that i would be unable to handle it because the demon folk cannot handle anything of the gourd but it seems i am not made of the same stuff as the demons evidently not chex agreed i did not realize that demons were limited in that respect demons being soulless are barred from handling things that relate intimately to souls marrow explained most of the things of the gourd relate for it is the living conscience the guardian of the soul that summons the dreams the blank scenery around them was gone now they stood hi a large chamber evidently the reallife setting for the illusion that was this aspect of the realm of the gourd the illusion had faded with the folding of the central part of it uh yes so it seems esk agreed we can take it there and back here the same way but only if we can be next to it to pick it up and when the wiggles swarm well be so full of zzapp holes that well be dead i am already dead marrow reminded him i shall be glad to remain beside the hole until the wiggle swarm is done and the rest of us can remain outside chex said marrow i think you have made the completion of our mission possible she leaned down and kissed the top of his skull the skeleton seemed disconcerted was that an apology an apology she asked you either kissed me or knocked skulls and that means vale of the vole she laughed yes that was an apology for ever thinking that you were not as genuine a person as any of the rest of us she glanced about now lets havelets seevolney use the pathfinder spell to find us a path to the zombie gourd exit he hasnt used that spell before she brought out the pathfinder spell and handed it to the vole gladly volney said vale of the vole chapter monsters hree women welcomed them back to castle roogna old latia mature bria and young ivy everyone else was tied up with the search for the missing good magician humfrey esk happened to be leading as they arrived at the orchard so he got the first brunt of it did you get the containment spell latia asked have i caused you embarrassment bria asked what was it like in the gourd ivy asked esk addressed them in order we got it yes you have it was weird then marrow showed his fist full of void distracting latia and chex started giving a travelogue for ivy leaving only bria then i must apologize she said eagerly what did i do you used me to get you out of the gourd and to try to become real she had been about to embrace him but now she paused yes thats true but you know my mother blythe always did rather regret that she never got to know the ogre your father better or get out more into this world she spoke of it sometimes and i could see how sad she was it wasnt that she was unhappy in the city of brass just that she wondered what might have been i inherited that wondering thats why i wandered and finally got myself lost i was looking for a way out but i couldnt find it then you came and i knew right away that not only could you get me out but you were sort of cute too then when i learned that you were the son of mothers ogre i just knew i wanted you for myself when i found the accommodation spell i knew it was possible knew you were looking for a flesh girl and that you wouldnt like my type without a lot of encouragement so i just had to act fast if i was to have any hope at all thats the whole of it i dont think so esk said why did you think i wouldnt like you well im not exactly like the flesh girls youre still holding back whatever happened to you in the gourd you learned a lot she exclaimed i learned my deepest fear and now i can recognize that kind of fear in others you must have good reason to think i wont like you if i know the truth its the soul she whispered the what we creatures of the dream realm dont have souls we cant be real without them you want my soul he exclaimed shocked maybehalf of it she said timidly you cant have any of it he exclaimed outraged yes of course she said almost inaudibly then let me apologize and i will leave you alone no no apology ive had enough of that artifice he spun away from her and stalked off the other dialogues were winding down we muvt move on to the vale volney said the monvters will be arriving start in the morning ivy exclaimed theres so much i want to hear they agreed they were tired from their days trek the path out through the gourd had been almost as convoluted as the one going in and then they had had to walk from the gourd to castle roogna it would be better to start fresh in the morning next day they set forth with volney leading the way then chex esk marrow latia and bria the brass girl had not spoken to him since his rebuff of her desire and he felt a little guilty about that but a lot angry about being asked for such a thing half his soul then he remembered something chex had said and speeded up to walk abreast of her didnt your mother lose half her soul to get out of the void yes that was the price of the night mares souls are in great demand in the realm of the gourd your folks paid it too they never talked much about that aspect of their experience he said i never thought they had half souls oh they dont the night stallion gave back a soul at the end so they each had a full one again they probably never thought about the matter since esk wasnt sure of that but your mother my dam never got hers back but she really didnt mind you see that was the half soul that went to mare imbri and enabled her to t vale of the vole become real and survive the loss of her body in the true void and become a day mare chem grew her soul back in time anyway so really didnt lose anything soulscan grow back he had heard of this but now it was important to get the matter quite straight oh yes if theres something to start with thats how babies get souls i understand they take some from each parent and grow the rest and the parents grow back what they have lost so while i understand it is not fun losing part of your soul its not torture either i would not have a soul of my own if my dam had not been able to grow hers back to full strength why do you ask bria wants half mine chex gazed down at him sidelong oh so it has come to that i cant say i am surprised thats why shes been playing up to me for my soul so she can become real oh is that how you see it what other way is there to see it she decided to use me to get her out of the gourd thought she liked me is there a conflict between the two isnt there you dont use someone you really like im not sure of that liking and sharingthey can go together i guess shed like me to give her half my soul but she has a home in the gourd why would she want to remain out here esk spread his hands i guess she just likes it better here she says she likes exploring and her mother knew my father but why would she like it better when its so strange for her what are you getting at i wouldnt want to go to a strange realm and stay there the rest of my existence unless i had a very good reason i really dont see any reason for her if i met someone who lived in that other realm and i wanted to be with him and could not unless i stayed there then i think i might do what i had to arrange to stay esk considered are you saying that its the other way around shes not using me because she wants to stay but she wants to stay because she likes me well i do wonder why she hasnt asked any other man for his soul surely she had opportunity while we were absent but ivy said bria just vale of the vole kept mostly to herself and didnt say much that she did no exploring and seemed depressed until you returned esk shook his head i wish i knew her true motive why because it makes a difference he flared if she just decided i was the handiest idiot with a soul to take why should it make a difference you dont have to give her anything you dont want to give what if i gave her my soul and she just went off elsewhere then the resolution of that indecision might be worth it it would certainly be a way to ascertain her true motive confused esk didnt answer he dropped back his thoughts in a morass the path reached the intersection that led south to the good magicians castle and north toward the vale volney went north and they trailed along after him this path soon narrowed and curved eastward following the contours of the land volney proceeded with sureness but evening fell before they progressed very far along it they had to camp for the night they foraged for fruits and tubers marrow and bria helped though neither needed to eat the sight of her stirred him like a breeze lifting the curtains of his confusion if all she wanted was his soul and she couldnt have that why hadnt she simply gone elsewhere she hardly needed to help them if she didnt want to why should it make a difference to him chex had asked because bria had kissed him and been soft in his arms and he wished he could have more of that maybe he was a fool but that was the way he felt chex had told him exactly how to learn the truth he went to bria ill give you half my soul he said what to get rid of me she snapped i dont want it then why did you ask for it before i then she turned away oh never mind this was not at all what he had expected no i really want to know because i was foolish she said i thought but again she broke off esk began to see the answer because you thought we could maybe have a life together i should have known better im just a brassie from the gourd fm not even alive why should anyone want toto she dabbed at her face with a corner of her skirt she sounded exactly as uncertain of her value as he had been of his vale of the vole and as prickly about admitting it his understanding expanded someone might oh sure she said corrosively who only another fool he said i think i owe you an apology she gazed at him a brass tear on her cheek you mean you want to i misunderstood your motive i think i thought you wanted my soul not me it hurt oh esk she said abruptly softening i take half my soul then do what you want lets just apologize for now she said i want you to be sure they apologized to each other her way and esk was sure already but she wouldnt take his soul yet chex saw them holding hands a little later and made no comment neither did any of the others that meant they understood in the morning they resumed the trek and this time bria walked with esk the path continued eastward without unusual event it did seem to be enchanted and now that the little dragons had gone there were no other threats by evening they reached the vale of the voles it was a sorry sight a broad valley overrun by scrub much of which was dying through it ran a channel as straight as a metal pole along which ugly brown water coursed there was a bothersome humming sound throughout thats funny esk said i thought only demons could hear the hummers they have gotten worve volney replied now there are vo many that everyone can hear them but they bother the demonv worve than uv the demons were there too cruising around recklessly the voles were evidently keeping low so as not to attract the notice of the irate demons what a wasteland chex remarked a demon in the form of a small black cloud made a rightangle turn and zeroed in on her what did you call me horseface it demanded i wasnt talking to you chex replied i didnt even know you were there thats a lie you called me a wasteband the demon screeched ill pulverize you a muscular arm sprouted from the cloud and formed a fist that cocked itself aiming for her face no esk said vale of the vole aw you arent worth the effort marehair the demon said and drifted away i may be mistaken jatia said but i believe i see why the voles would like to be rid of the demons they were not bothervome until the hummerv got bad volney said now the killmee river makev everyone vole and demon bad tempered the winged monsters and ogres may arrive any time esk said wed better get a good nights rest before it gets hectic yes indeed chex said we shall need to get organized too do we have any campaign plan campaign plan esk asked blankly who is going to direct the monsters exactly what are they going to do when they arrive why just wade into the demons and drive them off esk said more likely the ogres will wade into the winged monsters unless there is some organization uh yes esk agreed disgruntled but how do you organize ogres you establish an overall plan then designate a liaison to their leader the same for the winged monsters organization and disciplinethats the key to prevailing in any conflict but first we need a leader i guess since you know how to do it esk said uncomfortably a filly dont be ridiculous it has to be a man why because thats the nature of armies they have male leaders thats silly esk protested the most competent one should be the leader no the most acceptable one must be the leader she smiled and i think that is you esk you are the only male human creature in this party thus related to all others by blood or sex blood or sex esk repeated alarmed ogres curse fiends brassies centaurs and manlike skeletons all derive in some devious manner from human stock thats blood figuratively volney is male as are you so you have an affinity with each of the rest of us and with those we are working with you have some small basis for understanding each of our viewpoints and we all know that so we can accept you as our leader more readily than we could accept another creature does anyone disagree she glanced around the others shrugged but i dont know anything about leadership esk protested a good leader asks advice of course and chooses as he thinks best i vale of the vole suggest that you establish a campaign plan and appoint liaisons to the several groups uh yes esk agreed still feeling out of sorts the plan is to wade into the demons and drive them out of the vale any objections yev volney said the demonv can dematerialive and will do vo when threatened how can we drive them out youre right esk said chagrined how could i have forgotten uh does anyone have a suggestion yes latia said i happen to know a bit about demons it is true that they can dematerialize at will but it is also true that they cannot maintain that state indefinitely or they lose cohesion i think they have to spend about ninety percent of their time in solid form if they dont they start to dissipate into vapor and cannot recover but i thought demons were eternal esk said they are but their material forms arent if they vaporize and cant recover they must remain vaporous as clouds or similar unable to have much tangible effect on physical things they dont like that i know of one case with a perpetually bad nature he calls himself cumulo fracto nimbus the king of clouds hes really just a vaporized demon he serves as a bad example for other demons they dont want to be relegated to that state but the demons can dematerialize for short periods esk said so they can just do it when a monster attacks then reform how can we get around that i was coming to that if the monsters simply keep attacking forcing the demons to constantly dematerialize before long their vapor limit will be used up and they will have to go a concerted continuous campaign should do it in a day or so we just need to see that the demons get no rest in solid form say yes esk exclaimed and well have the monsters to do it thank you latia thats a big help thats what i came for she said almost forgetting her dour nature so far as to smile but not quite any more objections or suggestions esk asked feeling better suppose the demons attack us chex asked i mean not the monsters who can take care of themselves but those of this party who are vulnerable they could disrupt our organization not to mention our lives esks feeling plummeted i never thought of that either well have to plan to protect ourselves i can say no to those who attack me or anyone with me and the othersi dont know vale of the vole i can throw a curse latia said i have two bad ones stored up she glanced at bria that is presuming that the one i threw at you was after all a blessing i think it was esk agreed and bria smiled at him i can hide among my kind volney said the demonv cannot divtmguivh well between volev we all look alike to them i vhould be av vafe av any then i appoint you to be our liaison to the volves esk said and chex to be liaison to the winged monsters who should be able to protect her i think bria and marrow cant be hurt so maybe we arent as vulnerable that way as we thought who will be liaison to the ogresand to the demons chex asked the demons he exclaimed were fighting them we need liaison to the enemy too so we can let the demons know what we want their withdrawal from the vale esk considered maybe latia can be liaison to the ogres they were really impressed by heruh by the way she curdled water by my ugliness latia said its high time that paid off for me certainly ill serve in that capacity and for the demons that leaves marrow or bria does one of you want to ill do it bria said ill make myself extremely hard for them then i suppose marrow isis our reserve esk said you will need a messenger when you have information to impart or new directives to give to the scattered folk marrow said i can serve in that capacity yes thats good esk agreed so i think were pretty well organized now lets sleep they did but it took him a long time to relax he was aware now of the formidable challenge ahead he had somehow thought that once they got help and reached the vale everything would fall neatly into place that wasnt so people could get hurt finally bria came put your head in my lap she said i dont need to sleep he did so and found her lap surprisingly soft she stroked his hair and it was very nice and soon he slept it was stormy in the morning which seemed appropriate ogres loved foul weather and perhaps winged monsters did too there was the sound of trees crashing down as something big and violent approached the vale and a big winged shape sailed out of the swirling sky vale of the vole liaisons get out there and intercept your folk esk cried before they encounter each other chex galloped off to the region where the winged monster was coming down while latia put on her ugliest face and clumped toward the forest crashing i will notify the volev volney said can you find me if you need me give me a hair of your pelt marrow said i can use it to orient on you volney touched his flank with a talon and several hairs came loose the skeleton took one and put it to his nose yes i will know this scent you can do that esk asked surprised find one vole among hundreds by smell not exactly by smell marrow said i sense the essence of things magically whether by light or by sound or by substance i speak the same way no offense intended but it seems to me that your fleshly mechanisms are relatively clumsy i suppose they are esk said we fleshly creatures do most things in the mundane manner saving our magic for special things that may be why we have talents it has been said that in xanth some creatures have magic while others are magic im one of the former and you are one of the latter yes all my magic is needed just to handle my perceptions communication motion and to keep my bones together there is none left over for a separate talent perhaps that is why i would like to achieve the living state the skeletons aspiration seemed to have evolved usually before marrow had remarked on the inconvenience and messiness of the living functions i think the same goes for me bria said only i dont long for a magic talent just for a soul esk said i told you you could have half of mine and i told you to wait until youre sure i dont think its the soul i want thats just the means to the end an end esk asked what end love i dont think i can truly experience it without a soul all i can experience is my futile longing for it a soul marrow said yes of course that is necessary i wonder whether anyone would share one with me maybe if you got to know someone well enough esk said you certainly seem worthy of it vale of the vole now chex and latia were returning trailed by what turned out to be a stallion with a birds head and an ogre who grandpa esk exclaimed crunch ogre for it was indeed he the vegetarian ogre who had married a curse fiend actress now grizzled with age but still the epitome of ogreishness big ugly and stupid me learn of plan do what me can crunch said and this is my own sire xap hippogryph chex said happily he took this pretext to check up on me these two can speak for their groups latia said she grimaced your grandfather says i remind him of his mate who is beautifully ugly thats great esk said now i know well have good contact with the ogres and winged monsters did you explain that they must not fight each other the hippogryph squawked with distaste and the ogre made a horrendous scowl that was sufficient answer they understood but you will get to bash all the demons you want esk continued this time the squawk was joyous and the ogre smiled which was of course worse than his scowl esk explained about the need to harass the demons steadily until they departed the vale just to find some place where they could put in some solid time in peace monster and ogre nodded they were going to love this now the forest behind shook with the horrible tread of many ogres and the troubled sky darkened further with the arrival of many winged monsters crunch and xap hastened to meet with their groups and explain things you had better locate volney and tell him that the action is about to begin esk told marrow the voles will want to tunnel well out of the way immediately the skeleton agreed and headed off how do i contact the demons bria asked i dont know their leader or even whether they have a leader i think you will just have to go out and see whether any one of them looks like a leader and then address that one if hes not the leader he can still act as liaison tell him that we wont leave until the demons do ill do that she agreed we had better rejoin our contacts chex said in case there are any questions or confusions yes latia agreed you know i can see why my friend married that vale of the vole ogre theres a certain splendor in all that brute power uncluttered by the restraints of intellect ogres do have their points esk said feeling foolishly proud of his heritage they departed and esk found himself alone it had been a long time since he had been alone even for a minute and he discovered that he felt uncomfortable with it then the ogres waded into the vale of the vole punching at demons with great gusto and the winged monsters flew across the vale spearing demons with their claws with equal gusto the weather continued to deprove but esk stood out in the wind and rain and watched the carnage with simple joy the campaign to restore the kissmee river had begun a demoness appeared beside him so it is you she exclaimed just as the brass girl said esk looked closely at her oh nometria he exclaimed what are you doing here i heard the forest shuddering and saw the monsters massing above so i was curious then i saw this strange metal woman and she told me that you were running this show just what do you think youre doing pesk thats esk we think were clearing the demons out of the vale of the vole indeed as he spoke there was a great splashing as the ogres reached the channelized river and waded in knocking out the retaining walls as they went you wont have the kickmee river to kick around any more kickmee she repeated thats almost clever esk thank you now go away we have to restore the river you demons ruined but we only did that to get rid of the hummers she protested and did it work no she confessed theyre worse than ever well were only doing this to get rid of you demons do you think it will work there was something about the way she inquired that bothered him why dont you go back to my hideout and relax he asked nastily it was getting dull there after you quit we demons arent happy unless we have someone to pester she focused on him thoughtfully i think youre more of a creature than i guessed before let me do you that service we discussed her dress dissolved leaving her naked absolutely not esk exclaimed you disgust me vale of the vole no i never discussed you with anyone else i didnt even remember you till now thats disgust as in ugh esk clarified youre confusing words again ugh she agreed thank you for that correction lets do this quickly so i can still have time to bash a bird before they quit she reached to embrace him he straightarmed her but his hand passed right through her head without affecting her body she embraced him hungrily rubbing her lush torso against him let me just get these clothes off you you darling mortal man she murmured no esk cried this time it carried the force of his magic and she had to desist she stood back slightly considering him why not esk dont you like women sure i like women i just dont like demons she snapped her fingers that brassass shes the one i should have realized so what if she is he asked defensively bothered that he should have to defend anything to a demoness esk shes no more your kind than i am she has no living flesh no soul why be a fool what do you care what kind of a fool i am you got my hideout now leave me alone well ill think about it she said meanwhile ill just serve as liaison to my folk i dont want you as liaison too bad she said and faded out with a superior smile the rain was easing and the clouds thinning but the melee was getting worse esk peered at the action and discovered to his horror that the ogres and winged monsters were starting to fight each other even as he saw that marrow hurried back i told volney then got caught in the scuffle the skeleton said our monsters are starting to fight each other esk said go find our ogre and winged monster liaisons and tell them to stop it we havent gotten rid of the demons yet right away marrow agreed and hurried off again bria ran up i found a liaison she cried a demoness who said she takes the message i dont want that one esk said thats the one i know from before she came here and tried tonever mind vale of the vole oh she did did she bria said with some asperity well two can play at that game she stepped out of her dress what are you doing he asked upset im seducing you of course she came to embrace him but theres a battle going on yes well have to hurry but i thought you wanted half my soul she paused as if startled then recovered yes give me half your soul esk had promised but he did not like this at all this was not the way bria had been before well come on she said urgently no not now he said feeling like a complete heel why was he reneging well then see if you get any of this she snapped and her dress reappeared on her body she stalked away and was soon lost to view the campaign was falling apart as the ogres and winged monsters fought each other instead of the demons this had to be stoppedbut how he had told them not to fight each other marrow returned the voles want to know why the monsters are fighting each other instead of the demons i wish i knew esk said maybe the monsters lack discipline maybe a better leader would have prevented this chex galloped back my sire says the ogres started it she exclaimed they just laid into the winged monsters they could reach well have to see what latia reports esk said dejectedly oh everything is going wrong the battle anyway she agreed with bria too she there she is now the centaur said indeed bria was coming back esk decided that abjection was the best policy bria im sorry he exclaimed ill give you my soul right now she halted what i didnt mean to renege i justwas confused esk i told you i wanted you to wait its too big a decision to make on the spur of the moment yes but then you asked for it right away and i did not how could you think such a thing but just now when you were here what are you talking about ive been down looking for a liaison demon the whole time fele of the vole she was chex put in i saw her down near the river channel but esk said his confusion getting worse and i found one bria said a demoness who said she would talk to her folk yes that was metria the one who latia rushed up gasping crunch says the winged monsters started it they just flew down and started attacking ogres so naturally the ogres fought back why did they break the truce the ogres started it chex protested my sire would not deceive me crunch would not deceive an ugly curse fiend latia retorted even if he were smart enough to make the attempt and she stupid enough to fall for it the ogres didnt start it everybody blames the mischief on somebody else esk cried but somebody must have started it then they all did double takes coming to a common realization the demons can change form chex said and they love mischief latia added and they have motive to mess up our campaign bria concluded once i talked to metria they knew what we were doing and who our leader was so demons in the form of ogres attacked the winged monsters chex said and demons in the form of winged monsters attacked the ogres latia said esk snapped his fingers and metriashe must have assumed your form bria now i rememberyour clothes reappeared on you as if by magic you cant dress that way bria pursed her lips she emulated meand tried to get your soul esk was overwhelmed by new chagrin he seemed to be flushing across his entire body i think we had better hurry back and explain to our liaisons chex said and call a temporary retreat yes latia said both hurried away bria approached esk and you almost gave it to her she said what a disaster that would have been how could i have been such a fool esk moaned because you are a nice man with a nice soul who just doesnt want to believe evil of anyone she said i think i had better stay close to you after all the demoness can bring any messages here vale of the vole i thought she was you and i told her no esk said still overcome by guilt and she took off her clothes bria said i suppose i should be insulted but im not i think maybe she wasnt acting like me so you were suspicious and thats why you told her no esk brightened yes she wasnt acting like you only i didnt realize if i seem to ask you for anything or offer you anything just say no bna said because it wont be me it will be her i guess im glad it wasnt you he said i apologize for thinking it was you accepted she said and they kissed the battle was beginning to clear as the ogres and winged monsters got the word and retreated the demon ploy had failed but the battle had not been won by the time the disengagement was complete the day was late to esk it seemed as if only an hour had passed but it had been many hours they discussed the days events and worked out a new plan for the morrow each monster would take a particular territory and bash anything else found within that region regardless of its appearance that way the demons could not fool them because each monster would know that no ally would intrude in his particular spot marrow would serve as an observer but not as a messenger because no messenger could be trusted the demons would emulate the messenger and carry false messages but though there might be a hundred skeletons ranging the battlefield only one would be the true marrow and esk would be able to identify him by using his magic he would simply tell any skeleton no meaning that his appearance was wrong and if it were a demon that appearance would change only the true marrow would be unable to change esk could have done this with metria had he thought of it in time so i will listen to marrow tomorrow he concluded and i will talk to any others directly showing my magic so that i know they are valid and they know i am then they made their various preparations for the night bria joined esk i want to give you something she murmured no he said alarmed she laughed dont worry im not the demoness its the accommodation spell i want you to have it me why i can be very soft when i want to be but not that soft there are some vale of the vole things flesh cant do with brass thats why the spell is necessary keep the spell if you dont invoke it i cant seduce you uh he said nonplused so if i succeed in doing so youll know it isnt me its the demoness but i just thought youd like the secunty of knowing that she handed him the spell esk looked at the object she had given him it looked like a grain of rice thisis it some of the elven spells are very small but potent nonetheless she smiled briefly so to speak but ill lose this swallow it then you wont be able to lose it but if i digest it it will be gone no it will be part of you for all your life you will be able to invoke it anytime by gesturing like this she made an encompassing sweep with her hands all you will have to do is be close to the one you wish to accommodate whoever that may be but i dont want anyone but you i was teasing you esk she said gently though it is true it would work with any female if you get the wrong one simply dissolve it by reversing the gesture but its your spell he protested you found it and you found me so i am yours but youre the one who needs it not me i mean youre a brassie in a realm of flesh so theres only one i wish to accommodate so he can have the spell but this is so esk she said seriously i asked you for half your soul so i could love you better and be more like you you may give me that when the time is right you run the risk that if you do and i am not what i seem you will have lost half your soul and have nothing in return well i want you to have something back and i think this is it i run the risk of giving it to you and then you leave and i have nothing in return so we are sharing risks but if we win we win together eat the spell make it yours for always esk ate the spell then he lay down and held her until he tired and fell asleep after which she held him until he woke again somewhere between they exchanged an apology or two but these might simply have been kisses vale of the vole next day the campaign resumed the ogres marched to their assigned quadrants and the winged monsters flew to theirs latia and chex went to make contact with their liaisons and volney with his then both groups commenced the bashing of demons and if the demons resembled other ogres or monsters so much the better the voles forewarned lay low marrow walked through the vale up and down its long length inspecting the situation soon the skeleton returned the monsters are bashing each other again he cried sound the retreat take my hand esk said perplexed the skeleton extended a bone hand and esk took it in his own no he said the skeleton shimmered and changed becoming a grotesque parody of itself get lost demon esk said demoness it said and metrias visage formed how did you know marrow wouldnt tell a fib like that he replied she puffed into irritated vapor and dissipated you really showed her bria said taking his hand come lets entertain ourselves while the campaign proceeds esk looked aroundand saw bria on his other side seated a little way away he looked back at the first the two were identical ignore the demoness over there the closer one said she doesnt matter she drew him in toward her for a kiss esk remembered what bria had told him the last evening he could distinguish between the brassie and the demonessbut only by doing something whose success would make him wish he hadnt because it was possible only with the demoness unless he used the accommodation spell which he had no intention of doing that left him with no way then he snapped the fingers of his free hand what a fool i am he exclaimed for waiting so long the bria close to him agreed no he said invoking his magic she fuzzed in outline then reverted to metrias form curses foiled again she exclaimed disgusted and vaporized esk looked at bria you never spoke he exclaimed i knew you could distinguish between us if you wanted to she said i wanted to but he shrugged not the way you suggested i know i shouldnt tease you like that it could make trouble not anymore he said now that ive finally figured out the obvious vale of the vole your fleshly brains do seem rather inefficient at times im insulted then i must apologize she came to him and put her arms around him no he said she halted in place i wish youd let me just making sure he said you didnt dissolve into vapor so you are the right one she nodded agreement but still could not kiss him because of his magic so he kissed her instead the battle died down the monsters were either tiring or running out of targets do you think the demons have flown bria asked i dont trust them to give up so readily he replied there must be some trick but he couldnt think what it might be because the demons certainly seemed gone the skeleton returned the action has died out everywhere he reported the monsters have run out of demons give me your hand the skeleton extended his hand no esk said i realize you dont trust this report but thats the way it is marrow said uncomfortably i know it is esk said i had a false skeleton come before so i am verifying each oh yes of course i had forgotten chex and latia were approaching esk touched each using his magic and each was genuine there seemed to be no demon tricks maybe we had better verify this ourselves esk said how can we do that chex asked well i can touch things to make sure they arent demons and i thought latia might throw a curse that could stir them up i think it could latia agreed but i could verify only a limited region that way and i have only two curses before i reach a blessing thats my problem too esk said i can expose one demon at a time but it would take forever to expose them all and that wouldnt get rid of them anyway so lets hope theyre really gone they walked into the valley to the nearest square governed by an ogre the ogre stood and made a monstrous ham fist ready to pulverize them oops i hadnt thought of that esk said of course it thinks were demons pretending to be us you stop the ogre so i can get close enough to curse his territory latia suggested vale of the vole good enough when they reached the edge of the square the ogre charged nop esk said sharply the ogre dully surprised backed off latia stepped in and hurled her curse a rock a bush and a pile of dirt wavered and vaporized in a moment three demons manifested rubbing the regions of their posteriors this was evidently where the curse had scored go to it ogre esk cried as he and latia scrambled back with a horrendous roar the ogre grabbed at two demons and bashed their heads together while stomping on the third the demons of course dematerialized but their cover had been blown if any new objects appear in your territory bash them esk called to the ogre me see hee hee the ogre agreed stomping gleefully meaning had returned briefly to its life chex sighed obviously the demons havent vacated they are getting plenty of solidtime by concealing themselves as inert objects they cant hurt us that way but neither can we drive them out i fear we are losing this campaign esk nodded glumly fortunately we do have another resource i had hoped we wouldnt have to use the wiggle swarm but it seems well have to i vuppove we alwayv knew it would come to thiv volney said otherwive we would not have vet up for it but it means that the voles remaining in the vale will have to evacuate chex said they wont like that we will do what is nevewary volney said grimly i will give the word now he moved off to find his liaison it seems ironic chex remarked that in order to save the vale we have to come close to destroying it we seem pretty much like monsters ourselves bria said they proceeded dejectedly back toward their camp chapter swarm wake esk bria whispered urgently huh he asked dully finding it dark what time is it midnight or thereabouts she said esk i hear something he grabbed her hand no he said oh dont doubt me now she cried im the real brassie just listen she was solid and did not vaporize at his challenge he had been afraid that metria was trying to fool him at night when he couldnt see her he listened there was a kind of distant roaring noise maybe the ogres on their way home he said for they had dismissed the ogres and winged monsters knowing that their efforts could not after all dislodge the demons ogres make crashes not sustained roars thats something else maybe marrow will know hes been scouting around he doesnt sleep any more than i do where is he out there somewhere should we call him the roaring seemed louder yes esk put his hands to his mouth and called marrow marrow in a moment they heard the skeleton approaching you heard it marrow asked esk took his bone hand and verified his identity yes do you know what it is it is water and it is coursing this way is that significant water from where from the killmee river obviously or the killmee lake that is the only significant source in this vicinity but we are uphill from the vale how can the water be coming here chex stepped up there was no mistaking her footfalls in the dark the demons must be doing it they are good at channelizing they may vale of the vole have made a new channel that leads here and boosted the water with a spell but why my guess would be to get rid of us she said we have caused them a lot of disturbance and are planning more so they may be launching a preemptive strike i didnt think they had the organization for that but it may be they do you bet we do came metrias voice we learned it from you too bad you woke up early wed better get out of here esk said youll break your legs trying to run in the dark the demoness said and if you dont run youll never escape it we have a torrent coming the whole of lake killmee is pouring down here there is lowland all around marrow reported i believe she is correct you cannot escape it in time i am not threatened of course as i cannot drown but the rest of you i cannot drown either bria said maybe we can throw up a barricade esk said growing desperate fat chance mortal metria said youve had it my only regret is that you were too stupid to be seduced away from your stupid campaign already the roaring was swelling to an alarming proportion water was surging along the lower channels to either side of the hillock they had camped on weve got to try esk cried then there was a new crashing hoo hee where be crunchs voice bellowed go away you big ugly idiot metria screamed she nice too demon shrew the ogre bellowed back pleased at the compliment in a few more strides he arrived his huge horny feet striking sparks from the groaning ground they hit it get wet need help yet take volney to safety esk cried knowing that the vole being lowest to the ground was in the greatest immediate danger had there been more time volney might have tunneled down and made a closedoff chamber that would survive the torrent dry but now he just had to be gotten away me roll take vole the ogre agreed there was a sound as he found volney in the dark and picked him up oh phooey metria exclaimed ones getting away there was the sound of great wings and a huge flying shape blotted out the few stars that dared to show their light on this awful night squawk vale of the vole sire chex exclaimed take esk to safety no esk cried take latia because he knew that she was older and more frail than he xap didnt argue he found the curse fiend and got her mounted then spread his wings and took off double phooey the demoness swore two saved but thats all you fool no other monsters are coming so youre stuck indeed the water was now attacking the hillock gleefully gouging out chunks of it by the sound there was a great deal more coming marrow and bria might survive the flood being dead already but chex and esk were in real trouble oh how i wish i could fly the centaur cried over the almost deafening roar i wish you could too esk cried back then he had a notion bria could the accommodation spell make her able to fly it could make her able to mate with you but thats all bria replied sadly oh esk i dont want to lose you take my soul he screamed at her take it before i lose it anyway no that would only make me love you and youd be gone then give it to me metria said no sense in wasting a serviceable soul esk suggested that she do something with herself that perhaps only a demoness could manage it would have turned a mortal inside out or worse get on my back chex called ill try to forge through the water youll never succeed mulemane the demoness screamed the waters too strong esk was sickly certain she was right but he staggered through the shallow rushing water toward the centaur where are you chex here she called back her swishing tail touched his right arm which felt abruptly light he reached her and tried to mount but the splashing water made her hide slippery she had spread her wings for stability and was flapping them and the downdraft made it worse he slid off with a splash try again she urged maybe marrow or bria can boost you her nervously switching tail caught him across the back suddenly esk felt impossibly light he jumpedand leaped right over her back landing with another splash on the other side whats the matter she cried over the roar ii jumped over you he exclaimed hardly believing it i feel so light vale of the vole thats true marrow said her tail makes things light i felt it when i rode her and it flicked me i had forgotten my tail makes things light chex repeated surprised chex bria screamed as esk jumped again more carefully and made it to the centaurs back flick yourself why chex said thats right esk said your magic must be in your tail it makes things light enough to fly that must be why the biting bugs take off when you swish them chex swatted herself with her tail oh my goodness i feel it i feel it she screamed delight overcoming her horror of the raging water im lighti think light enough to fly take off bria cried marrow and i will be all right get into the sky hang on chex said but esk needed no warning he was gripping her mane tightly she flapped her wings harder her body tilted as if she were standing on her hind feet then it evened as her hind quarters lifted they were airborne she continued to stroke strongly her body spun about in the air as it lifted making esk dizzy but they were above the flood and therefore safe just stay up he cried you dont need to go anywhere just stay out of the water i wish i could see better she cried back im so afraid of crashing into something and falling then fly straight up toward the stars he replied you can see them yes she pumped slowly on up the roar of the water diminished slightly as they put distance between them and it but i am tiring she panted ive never flown before call for help esk recommended not sure whether he was being facetious she took him literally help she screamed there was an answering squawk in the distance sire she cried with glad recognition xap hippogryph flew toward them and was soon hovering beside his filly sire im tiring and must come down chex cried can you guide me to a safe landing there was an affirmative squawk then xap led the way and chex followed getting the hang of navigation even as her wings lost strength flick yourself again esk suggested vale of the vole she did it oh yes that does help now i can make it i think it was true the lightness caused by her magic flicking gradually wore off but could be restored by repeated flicking all she needed was wing strength which would come naturally with practice soon they reached the dry hill where crunch and volney and latia waited the last thing esk heard before chexs hooves touched down in a clumsy but serviceable landing was metrias anguished darn darn darn they had survived the demons counterattack by morning the water was ebbing even the full killmee lake could not keep the entire region inundated long the water was running through new channels to rejoin the river and surge on down into lake ogrechobee where it would surely agitate the curse fiends soggy refuse was everywhere and highwater marks were on the trees huge tangles of battered brush were balled hi the thickets while small temporary ponds stewed as the sun heated them gazing at this esk realized that he might have climbed a tall stout tree and rode out the flood but how could he have known what tree was secure in the dark a number of large ones had been undermined and toppled also that would not have helped chex so the way it had turned out was best the four fleshly members of the party were safe and thanks to the return of crunch and xap were likely to remain that way but the two creatures from the gourd were gone they said they would survive esk said trying to sound positive they are all metal and bone chex agreed with a similar effort me look down brook crunch offered xap squawked sire will search by air chex translated she spread her wings experimentally but winced and folded them again my muscles are stiff from the nights exertion im not ready to fly again just yet then she looked surprised but they are stiff here she added reaching back to touch under her wings not here in the pectorals she cupped her breasts you ninny latia said did you really think those were muscles you were developing there you have become a mature female of your species but i exercised chex protested you exercised and strengthened your wing muscles true but you were also becoming a mare or a woman however you choose to call it any man could have told you vale of the vole flustered chex looked at esk who could only nod her breasts had never looked much like muscles to him for the first time he saw a centaur blush well letv vearch where we can for bria and marrow volney said diplomatically we can vpread out and keep each other in vight walking downward until we find them they did that chex walked closest to the vale on the east then esk next west then volney then latia farthest west they walked south pushing through tangles slogging through mudflats and making generally messy progress far ahead they heard crunch proceeding in the ogre manner crashingly and above xap wheeled his sharp eagle eyes peering down they searched all morning without success esks heart slowly sank as if caught in the mud he slogged through what would he do if they couldnt find bria by evening they knew it was no use they had canvassed the region up and down and sideways looking and calling but had found no sign of either lost creature but they cant die because they arent alive esk said around the lump in his throat they cant be hurt but they can be mislaid chex said perhaps the water caught them and washed them all the way down into lake ogrechobee and they are waiting for it to ebb before they slog back here that must be it esk agreed but he knew that it was as much of an effort for chex to believe this as it was for him bria and marrow should have been able to hold onto something and ride the rushing water out then call out if stuck in a tangle indeed they could have climbed a tree with far more confidence than esk because if it fell they would not be killed their complete disappearance was inexplicable we have done what we can latia said briskly we must simply wait for their return in due course and get on with our business the wiggle will be arriving soon they foraged and ate and settled for the night esk slept alone and didnt like it it had not taken long at all for him to get quite accustomed to brias company as darkness closed a figure appeared hello esk bria he exclaimed joyously then he caught on metria go away dont be that way the demoness said youve lost your metal girl but demon substance can be as good let me show you what i can do for you vale of the vole youre trying to corrupt me so i wont make any more trouble for the demons he said angrily that too but i have developed respect for you esk youre an interesting man we could have a lot of fun together she lay down beside him and drew his head into her bosom it smelled faintly of smoke i thought you just wanted to be left alone he said grumpily yes when i choose and to have stimulating company when i choose i misjudged you before so im making up for that now come have a pleasant night with me your companions need not know no he gritted oh fudge she said you keep doing that you fool she dissolved into vapor and was gone so the demons knew of their loss that did not make esk feel any better he knew he could not trust metria yet for a moment hi his sorrow and loneliness he had almost been tempted he felt guilty for that next day the water was down further but there was still no sign of bria or marrow there was however another arrival xap reported a pretty vole coming along the path from the east looking good enough to eat thatv wilda volney said now we muvt vet up for the vwann well this might help take their minds off their lost companions they plunged into this new aspect of their campaign with vigor wilda wiggle was indeed a very pretty figure of volishness she wore her surface coat gray with intense brown eyes her fur almost glowed and her contours were softly rounded esk was sure that if he had been a vole he would have found her compellingly luscious it was hard to believe that this dulcet creature could be the origin of the worst menace of xanth a wiggle swarm but it was so have you the plafe she asked speaking the humanoid language as well as volney did but with an accent we have esk assured her have you the fpell we have ekfellent i have mated and muft foon make my neft the way we have set it up esk explained is that you will select a site near the center of the vale then before the larvae hatch and swarm you and all other vulnerable creatures will evacuate the vale and well lay down the containment spell which is really an aspect of the void and leave it in place until the swarm is done then well fold up the void vale of the vole again and the voles will return to restore the river the demons dikes will be hopelessly ruined of course so the restoration will be easy wilda considered i have two queftionf she said wiggling her nose delicately are you fure the demonf will leave well we think they will because they wont enjoy the swarming at all and once their dikes are ruined theyll have to do the work all over again and demons are not noted for their patience if it doesnt work well just have to think of something else and who will fet out the void and fetch it back again why marrow will do that esk said you havent met marrow yet hes a he broke off oops chex said oh my latia said we forgot that we needed him for that little chore do you folk have a problem metria inquired coalescing youve been listening esk said accusingly of course she said im the demon liaison after all your brassy girlfriend appointed me thats brassie esk snapped not brassy i dont think youre going to find your bone friend in time the demoness said or your metal one considering that we hold both hostage what esk gasped well i really dont expect you to believe me but its true we couldnt let you folk proceed with your plan unchallenged after all you can have them back the moment you agree to stop harassing us and go home damn you esk swore thats hard to do just as its hard to kill your dead friends all we can do is hold them are you ready to deal no esk cried in fury and anguish ill handle that void myself esk youll be holed chex protested you wouldnt survive im an old crone ill do it latia said it doesnt matter much if i die ill never understand you mortals will to sacrifice metria said it wont work regardless because whoever remains in the vale will be holed and killed and wont be able to remove the void anyway they exchanged glances shes right chex said a fleshly creature cant do it but a demonic creature might metria said why dont you ask me what vale of the vole i said i know what you said even if a demon could handle the void which no demon can why would you this is to drive you out of the vale i cant touch the void tis true but i could protect a mortal from the swarm by making myself into an invisible shield you know she could chex said but but why ill tell you why metria said its because we demons have nothing to fear from the wiggles we can either vaporize or make ourselves too hard for them to penetrate we just dont like the mess they will make of our dikes but you mortals wont believe that so well have to prove it the hard way are you ready to deal deal esk asked he was getting bewildered as he tended to do when events became too surprising ill help you with the void metria said and we will release our hostages to you if if what esk asked guardedly if after you are satisfied that you cant drive us from the vale you will put the same effort into solving our problem that you have put into trying to get rid of us us help you esk demanded that would be crazy suit yourself she said beginning to fade wait he cried i didnt say i wouldnt she resolidified now you are getting sensible it isnt much we ask after all let me see whether i understand this correctly chex said you are allowing us one more try at getting you demons out of the vale of the vole and if we fail then we must try as hard to get rid of the hummers as we did to get rid of you thats it metria agreed but if we fail to get rid of you we may fail to get rid of the hummers too but youll try as hard as you can and you might have better success the demoness said you fleshly creatures have souls and therefore a degree of honor we think its worth the deal and we get bria and marrow back esk said the moment you start working for us metria agreed all right esk said ill make the deal now wait chex protested this isnt tight if we do drive the demons out we wont get back the hostages and never mind esk said i have my reason im making the deal not vale of the vole you he turned to the demoness i will handle the void you will protect me but vhe may not volney said how can you truvt her with your life because im making the deal esk said its my responsibility if i die then the deal is off and the rest of you can do what you want so the demoness has some incentive to honor her part of it and keep me alive metria nodded you have gotten smarter mortal but then the hostages would not be freed chex said im the one who is love with bria not you esk said if im gone theres no such lever on you and the demons dont want the hostages anyway theyre just using them against us so if i dont make it you just quit and go home because the vale will be locked forever in the void and of no further use to either the voles or the demons were playing for double or nothing here if metria lets me die the demons lose as much as we or the voles do more actually because the demons already control the vale and the voles will be driven away if the demons remain youve learned to play hardball chex said the term derived from mundania wherein the ball might be soft but the play bashed heads ogres were fans of mundane ball games as they were of mundane politics because of the extreme violence there it will take me a day to build my neft and another to lay my eggf wilda said can the volef evacuate in that time theyll have to volney said letv get on it they got on it they helped organize the evacuation of the voles from the vale while wilda built her nest in the center beside the deleted killmee river the voles emerged from their deep tunnels in families with cute little ones scrambling along behind their elders all of them changed from their subterranean outfits to their surface coats whose gray color resisted the brightness and heat of the sunlight better the demons watched cynically they didnt care whether the voles left or stayed they intended to govern the vale their way regardless similarly they watched wilda at her labor fashioning her nest she gathered sticks and stones and broken bones and sand and mud and other crud and formed a small round house chinking every crevice tight then she climbed into that house and pulled the lid down securely the voles were only half evacuated then but that was on schedule because they had one more day they toiled on out all day and all night until the vale was entirely clear the demons remained where they were unconcerned vale of the vole esk took the waddedup void which chex had saved in her pack and carried it to a spot near the nest where are you metria he called the demoness materialized beside him here i am mortal whats on your foolhardy mind its almost time i just want you to be here with me when i open the void i will be as close to you as a second skin she assured him with it seemed a certain relish the lid lifted off the nest wildas head poked out i have an hour to get clear she said spying esk if everything ready no volef remain its ready esk said wilda scrambled out of the nest let the lid fall back into place and hurried toward the forest she knew that the wiggle larvae had no discrimination they would hole her as readily as anything else in their path just as she plunged into the forest esk heard a noise from the nest the larvae were starting to hatch he took out the void and unfolded it he laid it out on the ground and stepped away from the black hole that appeared it might be merely an aspect of the void annex of the gourd but it looked deep and he didnt want to fall in the sounds were increasing at the nest time to shield me he told metria that i will do mortal man she agreed she wavered and became a flat sheet this sheet floated toward him becoming translucent then transparent it brushed up against him and passed through his clothing plastering itself to his body hey he protested as it pressed against his face threatening to smother him i have to breathe you know so you do mortal she said i forgot a wrinkle formed so that the fit against his face was not quite tight and air could get in from the sides the wiggles were definitely swarming now holes were appearing in the nest and their zzapping spread out in all directions how could you pass through my clothing but still stop wiggles he asked nervously i phased out and in again the sheet replied it continued to close about his torso wrapping about his arms and legs she had not been joking about being as close to him as a second skin hey he exclaimed as the sheet abruptly tickled him in the crotch it was conforming itself precisely to his private parts stop that vale of the vole make me mortal the sheet replied giving him an embarrassing squeeze esk jumped turned and started to stride away dont turn the sheet cried zzappt ouch he clapped his hand to a buttock i told you not to turn the sheet said i am covering you only on the front you got tagged by a wiggle indeed there was blood on his hand where he had touched his buttock a passing wiggle larva had grazed him he hastily turned to face the nest againand felt something bounce off his chest just in time the sheet said if that had struck your back it would have holed you now the zzapps of the wiggle larvae were all around him passing so thickly that there was no way to avoid them metria was indeed protecting him he just wished that she wasnt so conscientious about certain regions of his anatomy i never promised you i wouldnt enjoy it the sheet said giving him yet another embarrassing tickle yet at the same time a zzapp bounced off there so he knew that this closeness was necessary she was teasing him but also doing the job she had promised she evidently did have a certain interest in his body though he couldnt see why if she wanted a body why didnt she have a male demon assume that shape the carnage of the wiggle swarm was becoming horrendous the shrubs and trees were getting holed and tattered as the tiny wormlike creatures zzapped through each wiggle larva would jump forward a short distance then hover in place in the air absolutely still it was evidently tasting its surroundings to discover whether they matched its need then unpredictably it would jump forward again if anything was in its path it simply tunneled magically through that was why wiggles were considered the worst scourge of xanth a swarm ruined just about everything in the vicinity except the demons the demons were ignoring the larvae or at least were not alarmed by them a demon in the vapor state could not be hurt by holing and they were achieving such compactness when solid that the wiggles bounced off as they did from esk metria was right this was no way to drive out the demons however if anything happened to esk all the demons would be trapped in the void for they could not escape it they werent in any discomfort within it they simply could not pass its outer rim which was near the edge of the vale that would be one way to rid the vale of them vale of the vole the only trouble was that it would rid the vale of serviceability for anything else any voles who entered the void would not be able to depart again ever no waitl he had miscalculated once the wiggle swarm was gone anyone human or vole could enter fold up the central hole and abolish the void why hadnt he thought of that before he had never had to risk his life here but the demoness hadnt realized it either or chex so at least he had company hi his foolishness that was a comfort anyway someone would have had to risk his life in order to place the void and that person would have been stuck in it with the wiggles and he esk was the only one metria would have been willing to protect so it all came out the same the hours passed as the carnage proceeded the zzapps of the wiggles became fewer here as their radius of destruction increased but esk knew better than to take a chance one holing by one tardy larva could still put him away that meant that he remained in closevery close contact with metria after a long while she tired of nudging and tickling him in intimate regions having evidently had as much fun as she wanted with him but they were still stuck with each others company why really did you make this deal he asked her to get this close to you without your saying no of course the sheet responded promptly how else could i surround your flesh with mine for hours at a stretch she squeezed him in a localized region making her meaning considerably clearer than he liked i dont think so he retorted your sole object has been to embarrass me or subvert me so that i could not be an effective leader against the demons now that were cooperating there cannot be much pleasure for you in my company you had to know you were letting yourself in for a long dull day so why did you do it you are getting smart again she said i suppose there is no reason not to tell you the truth now we really do want to be rid of the hummers they are just about as bad to us as the wiggle swarm is to you every time we try to settle down in solid state to rest they drive us crazy with their humming we have tried everything we can think of to get rid of them but they just keep getting worse when we saw how determined and clever you were getting in trying to deal with us it just seemed that you might even solve our problem with the hummers if you had reason that is the truth were desperate and we want your help without it were going to have to vacate the vale anyway vale of the vole you mean if we had just done nothing you demons would have gone and the voles problem would have been solved esk asked chagrined it is an irony isnt it she agreed complacently you dont know how that makes me feel oh i know she said even if you cant solve our problem i will have some delight in remembering how much frustration i caused you simply by telling you the truth esk laughed somewhat bitterly you outsmarted me all right yet if i had it to do over again i probably would because because of the metal girl you mortals do put inordinate stress on relationships you do have her hostage you werent just telling us that to cause more mischief we do have them both remember i was with you when you deserted them we knew exactly where they were we couldnt abduct you because we wanted your help but when you left them behind they were ready prey they thought we were actually rescuing them at first but then they realized who we were and the girl started crying and saying your name it was quite amusing damn you esk repeated weve been through that before she reminded him esk shut up she was still baiting him when she had opportunity he was already committed to help her cause there was no need to give her extra satisfaction night fell and he lay down and slept carefully facing toward the wiggle nest the demoness stroked his hair in the manner bria had using a flap of her sheet but he refused to curse her again tomorrow he would be with bria again that made it bearable by noon the next day the wiggles had cleared and it was safe to fold up the void esk did so and metria gave him a final goose and separated from him he had failed as she had predicted and now had a new chore to tackle the vale was in shambles the dikes made by the demons were rubble holed so many times they had collapsed the trees were tattered and many would die the water had spread out passing through the holes and formed a great messy marsh the whole region was deathly quiet esk about to fold up the void paused metriado you notice anything she formed in her natural guise i notice you have ruined the vale for vole and demon by your foolish exercise it will be a real chore to rebuild those dikes vale of the vole why rebuild them to get rid of the hummers of course listen metria what do you hear she listened absolutely nothing its eerie what about the hummers she was so surprised that she dissipated into vapor and then reformed theyre gone esk had been thinking fast now it burst upon him in much the way the sun burst out of a smothering cloud dont you see demonessit is the environment that spawns the hummers the spread of the water evidently stifles them there used to be a lot of water in the vale because of the way the kissmee river meandered then you channelized it and the land dried out and the hummers increased maybe they need stagnant pools such as the ones you left in the cutoff meanders flowing water washes them out i dont know the exact pattern but im sure now that it involves the disruption of the natural river now the hummers are gone but if you channelize the river again they will return worse than ever thats the answer to your problemto restore the kissmee river and keep every meander she seemed stunned which was unusual for a demon when we straightened the riverthe hummers got worse now theyre gone but we cant leave the vale in a stew like this even the voles wouldnt be able to use it demons and voles need dry land to camp on you can have the dry land esk said warmly just make it natural land let nature take its course that means meanders and occasional flooding it may be inconvenient for you but it must be devastating to the hummers who probably need still stagnant water to breed in like that in your holding ponds and dry land to forage on like the vale the way you made it let the river change its level as it wishes and the land alternately flood and dry out and you should have very few hummer problems im only conjecturing of course but doesnt it make sense to you she listened again and heard no hummers again it does make sense to me mortal let me consult with my kind she vaporized esk folded the void carefully and wadded it into a fistsized ball they would have to return it to the gourd but one of their number who had not yet invoked the pathfinder spell could do that perhaps marrow he esk would have to remain here until the demons were satisfied about his solution to the hummer problem but that was all right he didnt have any other pressing destination as he walked slushily out of the vale metria reappeared well give it vale of the vole a try mortal well even help the voles restore the river meanwhile well release the hostages theyre a bother to keep anyway and there at the edge of the forest was marrowand bria the brassie girl rushed down to fling herself into his arms i was so afraid you had fallen and drowned she exclaimed the demons wouldnt tell us anything theyre demonic he agreed but i think have solved their problem with the hummers they are going to help restore the kissmee river to its natural state then there was a flurry of discussion as things were worked out wilda wiggle having passed beyond her reproduction cycle was now ready to settle down with a male for fun and companionship and she still liked volney the two were conversing by the shattered riverbank and it seemed that some of the waters affection was returning for they were touching noses in a fashion that was surely the volish kiss marrow was going to return the void then see what else he could do to become real he thought the folk at castle roogna might be able to use his services in looking for the lost good magician latia was returning to her people her mission completed that success would ensure proper respect for her during her retirement xap and crunch departed together evidently friends now and chex i believe i have a date with a winged centaur she said spreading her wings i dont think i need to be concerned anymore about the acceptance of my species i mean to generate my own species she flicked herself with her tail and took off and her happiness seemed to spread out in ripples a shape appeared in the sky for a moment esk thought it was chex returning but instead it was her sire xap he landed before esk and squawked esk could not understand the wingedmonster language but he thought he might guess you say you have a message from my grandfather crunch ogre that i have performed an act of ogreish destruction absolutely ruining the vale so i am now considered an adult in the ogreish mode xap squawked agreement and took off again tell him i appreciate his news esk called i never would have guessed otherwise xaps final squawk sounded very like laughter evidently the hippogryphs sense of humor was more liberal than his centaur fillys i shall have to stay here awhile esk told bria i promised the demons and of course id like to see the vale of the vole restored to its vale of the vole original beauty and the kissmee river to its former affection so if you speaking of affection she murmured lets go somewhere private and try out that accommodation spell now that your grandfather says you are adult you should be able to handle an adult relationship uh i meant if you want half my soul now that too she agreed then she hugged him and he knew that it didnt matter what was done in what order they would be together
