guards guards a discworld novel terry pratchett dedication they may be called the palace guard the city guard or the patrol whatever the name their purpose in any work of heroic fantasy is identical it is round about chapter three to rush into the room attack the hero one at a time and be slaughtered noone ever asks them if they wanted to this book is dedicated to those fine men and also to mike harrison mary gentle neil gaiman and all the others who assisted with and laughed at the idea of lspace too bad we never used schrodingers paperback this is where the dragons went they lie not dead not asleep not waiting because waiting implies expectation possibly the word were looking for here is dormant and although the space they occupy isnt like normal space nevertheless they are packed in tightly not a cubic inch there but is filled by a claw a talon a scale the tip of a tail so the effect is like one of those trick drawings and your eyeballs eventually realise that the space between each dragon is in fact another dragon they could put you in mind of a can of sardines if you thought sardines were huge and scaly and proud and arrogant and presumably somewhere theres the key in another space entirely it was early morning in ankhmorpork oldest and greatest and grubbiest of cities a thin drizzle dripped from the grey sky and punctuated the river mist that coiled among the streets rats of various species went about their nocturnal occasions under nights damp cloak assassins assassinated thieves thieved hussies hustled and so on and drunken captain vimes of the night watch staggered slowly down the street folded gently into the gutter outside the watch house and lay there while above him strange letters made of light sizzled in the damp and changed colour the city wasa wasa wasa wossname thing woman thass what it was woman roaring ancient centuries old strung you along let you fall in thingy love with her then kicked you inna terry pratchett inna thingy thingy in your mouth tongue tonsils teeth thats what it she did she wasa thing you know lady dog puppy hen bitch and then you hated her and and just when you thought youd got her it out of your your whatever then she opened her great booming rotten heart to you caught you off bal bal bal thing ance yeah thassit never knew where where you stood lay only thing you were sure of you couldnt let her go because because she was yours all you had even in her gutters damp darkness shrouded the venerable buildings of unseen university premier college of wizardry the only light was a faint octarine flicker from the tiny windows of the new high energy magic building where keenedged minds were probing the very fabric of the universe whether it liked it or not and there was light of course in the library the library was the greatest assemblage of magical texts anywhere in the multiverse thousands of volumes of occult lore weighted its shelves it was said that since vast amounts of magic can seriously distort the mundane world the library did not obey the normal rules of space and time it was said that it went on forever it was said that you could wander for days among the distant shelves that there were lost tribes of research students somewhere in there that strange things lurked in forgotten alcoves and were preyed on by other things that were even stranger wise students in search of more distant volumes took care to leave chalk marks on the shelves as they roamed deeper into the fusty darkness and told friends to come looking for them if they werent back by supper and because magic can only loosely be bound the library books themselves were more than mere pulped wood and paper a this was untrue the truth is that even big collections of ordinary books distort space as can readily be proved by anyone who has been around a really oldfashioned secondhand bookshop one of those that look as though they were designed by m escher on bad day and has more staircases than storeys and those rows of shelves which end in little doors that are surely too small for a fullsized human to enter the relevant equation is knowledge power energy matter mass a good bookshop is just a genteel black hole that knows how to read guards guards raw magic crackled from their spines earthing itself harmlessly in the copper rails nailed to every shelf for that very purpose faint traceries of blue fire crawled across the bookcases and there was a sound a papery whispering such as might come from a colony of roosting starlings in the silence of the night the books talked to one another there was also the sound of someone snoring the light from the shelves didnt so much illuminate as highlight the darkness but by its violet flicker a watcher might just have identified an ancient and battered desk right under the central dome the snoring was coming from underneath it where a piece of tattered blanket barely covered what looked like a heap of sandbags but was in fact an adult male orangutan it was the librarian not many people these days remarked upon the fact that he was an ape the change had been brought about by a magical accident always a possibility where so many powerful books are kept together and he was considered to have got off lightly after all he was still basically the same shape and he had been allowed to keep his job which he was rather good at although allowed is not really the right word it was the way he could roll his upper lip back to reveal more incredibly yellow teeth than any other mouth the university council had ever seen before that somehow made sure the matter was never really raised but now there was another sound the alien sound of a door creaking open footsteps padded across the floor and disappeared amongst the clustering shelves the books rustled indignantly and some of the larger grimoires rattled their chains the librarian slept on lulled by the whispering of the rain in the embrace of his gutter half a mile away captain vimes of the night watch opened his mouth and started to sing now a blackrobed figure scurried through the midnight streets ducking from doorway to doorway and reached a grim and forbidding portal no mere doorway got that grim without effort one felt it looked as though the architect had been called in and given specific instructions we want something eldritch in dark terry pratchett oak hed been told so put an unpleasant gargoyle thing over the archway give it a slam like the footfall of a giant and make it clear to everyone in fact that this isnt the kind of door that goes dingdong when you press the bell the figure rapped a complex code on the dark woodwork a tiny barred hatch opened and one suspicious eye peered out the significant owl hoots in the night said the visitor trying to wring the rainwater out of its robe yet many grey lords go sadly to the masterless men intoned a voice on the other side of the grille hooray hooray for the spinsters sisters daughter countered the dripping figure to the axeman all supplicants are the same height yet verily the rose is within the thorn the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy said the voice behind the door there was a pause broken only by the sound of the rain then the visitor said what the good mother makes bean soup for the errant boy there was another longer pause then the damp figure said are you sure the illbuilt tower doesnt tremble mightily at a butterflys passage nope bean soup it is im sorry the rain hissed down relentlessly in the embarrassed silence what about the caged whale said the soaking visitor trying to squeeze into what little shelter the dread portal offered what about it it should know nothing of the mighty deeps if you must know oh the caged whale you want the elucidated brethren of the ebon night three doors down whore you then were the illuminated and ancient brethren of ee i thought you met over in treacle street said the damp man after a while yeah well you know how it is the fretwork club have the room tuesdays there was a bit of a mixup oh well thanks anyway my pleasure the little door slammed shut the robed figure glared at it for a moment and then splashed guards guards further down the street there was indeed another portal there the builder hadnt bothered to change the design much he knocked the little barred hatch shot back yes look the significant owl hoots in the night all right yet many grey lords go sadly to the masterless men hooray hooray for the spinsters sisters daughter okay to the axeman all supplicants are the same height yet verily the rose is within the thorn its pissing down out here you do know that dont you yes said the voice in the tones of one who indeed does know it and is not the one standing in it the visitor sighed the caged whale knows nothing of the mighty deeps he said if it makes you any happier the illbuilt tower trembles mightily at a butterflys passage the supplicant grabbed the bars of the window pulled himself up to it and hissed now let us in im soaked there was another damp pause these deeps did you say mighty or nightly mighty i said mighty deeps on account of being you know deep its me brother fingers it sounded like nightly to me said the invisible doorkeeper cautiously look do you want the bloody book or not i dont have to do this i could be at home in bed you sure it was mighty listen i know how deep the bloody deeps are all right said brother fingers urgently i knew how mighty they were when you were a perishing neophyte now will you open this door well all right there was the sound of bolts sliding back then the voice said would you mind giving it a push the door of knowledge through which the untutored may not pass sticks something wicked in the damp brother fingers put his shoulder to it forced his way through gave brother doorkeeper a dirty look and hurried within the others were waiting for him in the inner sanctum standing around with the sheepish air of people not normally terry pratchett accustomed to wearing sinister hooded black robes the supreme grand master nodded at him brother fingers isnt it yes supreme grand master do you have that which you were sent to get brother fingers pulled a package from under his robe just where i said it would be he said no problem well done brother fingers thank you supreme grand master the supreme grand master rapped his gavel for attention the room shuffled into some sort of circle i call the unique and supreme lodge of the elucidated brethren to order he intoned is the door of knowledge sealed fast against heretics and knowlessmen stuck solid said brother doorkeeper its the damp ill bring my plane in next week soon have it all right all right said the supreme grand master testily just a yes would have done is the triple circle well and truly traced art all here who art here and it be well for an knowlessman that he should not be here for he would be taken from this place and his gaskin slit his moules shown to the four winds his welchet torn asunder with many hooks and his figgin placed upon a spike yes what is it sorry did you say elucidated brethren the supreme grand master glared at the solitary figure with its hand up yea the elucidated brethren guardian of the sacred knowledge since a time no man may wot of last february said brother doorkeeper helpfully the supreme grand master felt that brother doorkeeper had never really got the hang of things sorry sorry sorry said the worried figure wrong society im afraid must have taken a wrong turning ill just be going if youll excuse me and his figgin placed upon a spike repeated the supreme grand master pointedly against a background of damp wooden noises as brother doorkeeper tried to get the dread portal open are we quite finished any more knowlessmen happened to drop in on their way somewhere else he added with bitter sarcasm right fine so glad i suppose its too much to ask if the four guards guards watchtowers are secured oh good and the trouser of sanctity has anyone bothered to shrive it oh you did properly ill check you know all right and have the windows been fastened with the red cords of intellect in accordance with ancient prescription good now perhaps we can get on with it with the slightly miffed air of one who has run their finger along a daughterinlaws top shelf and found against all expectation that it is sparkling clean the grand master got on with it what a shower he told himself a bunch of incompetents no other secret society would touch with a tenfoot sceptre of authority the sort to dislocate their fingers with even the simplest secret handshake but incompetents with possibilities nevertheless let the other societies take the skilled the hopefuls the ambitious the selfconfident hed take the whining resentful ones the ones with a bellyful of spite and bile the ones who knew they could make it big if only theyd been given the chance give him the ones in which the floods of venom and vindictiveness were dammed up behind thin walls of ineptitude and lowgrade paranoia and stupidity too theyve all sworn the oath he thought but not a man jack of em has even asked what a figgin is brethren he said tonight we have matters of profound importance to discuss the good governance nay the very future of ankhmorpork lies in our hands they leaned closer the supreme grand master felt the beginnings of the old thrill of power they were hanging on his words this was a feeling worth dressing up in bloody silly robes for do we not well know that the city is in thrall to corrupt men who wax fat on their illgotten gains while better men are held back and forced into virtual servitude we certainly do said brother doorkeeper vehemently when theyd had time to translate this mentally only last week down at the bakers guild i tried to point out to master critchley that it wasnt eye contact because the supreme grand master had made sure the brethrens hoods shrouded their faces in mystic darkness but nevertheless he managed to silence brother doorkeeper by dint of sheer outraged silence terry pratchett yet it was not always thus the supreme grand master continued there was once a golden age when those worthy of command and respect were justly rewarded an age when ankhmorpork wasnt simply a big city but a great one an age of chivalry an age when yes brother watchtower a bulky robed figure lowered its hand are you talking about when we had kings well done brother said the supreme grand master slightly annoyed at this unusual evidence of intelligence and but that was all sorted out hundreds of years ago said brother watchtower wasnt there this great battle or something and since then weve just had the ruling lords like the patrician yes very good brother watchtower there arent any more kings is the point im trying to make said brother watchtower helpfully as brother watchtower says the line of it was you talking about chivalry that give me the clue said brother watchtower quite so and you get that with kings chivalry said brother watchtower happily and knights and they used to have these however said the supreme grand master sharply it may well be that the line of the kings of ankh is not as defunct as hitherto imagined and that progeny of the line exists even now thus my researches among the ancient scrolls do indicate he stood back expectantly there didnt seem to be the effect hed expected however probably they can manage defunct he thought but i ought to have drawn the line at progeny brother watchtower had his hand up again yes you saying theres some sort of heir to the throne hanging around somewhere said brother watchtower this may be the case yes yeah they do that you know said brother watchtower knowledgeably happens all the time you read about it skions theyre called they go lurking around in the distant wildernesses for ages handing down the secret sword and birthmark and so forth from generation to generation then just when the old kingdom needs them they turn up and turf out any guards guards usurpers that happen to be around and then theres general rejoicing the supreme grand master felt his own mouth drop open he hadnt expected it to be as easy as this yes all right said a figure the supreme grand master knew to be brother plasterer but so what lets say a skion turns up walks up to the patrician says what ho im king heres the birthmark as per spec now bugger off whats he got then life expectancy of maybe two minutes thats what you dont listen said brother watchtower the thing is the skion has to arrive when the kingdom is threatened doesnt he then everyone can see right then he gets carried off to the palace cures a few people announces a halfholiday hands round a bit of treasure and bobs your uncle he has to marry a princess too said brother doorkeeper on account of him being a swineherd they looked at him who said anything about him being a swineherd said brother watchtower i never said he was a swineherd whats this about swineherds hes got a point though said brother plasterer hes generally a swineherd or a forester or similar your basic skion its to do with being in wossname cognito theyve got to appear to be of you know humble origins nothing special about humble origins said a very small brother who seemed to consist entirely of a little perambulatory black robe with halitosis ive got lots of humble origins in my family we thought swineherding was a posh job but your family doesnt have the blood of kings brother dunnykin said brother plasterer we might of said brother dunnykin sulkily right then said brother watchtower grudgingly fair enough but at the essential moment see your genuine kings throw back their cloak and say lo and their essential kingnessness shines through how exactly said brother doorkeeper might of got the blood of kings muttered brother dunnykin got no right saying i might not have got the blood of look it just does okay you just know it when you see it terry pratchett but before that theyve got to save the kingdom said brother plasterer oh yes said brother watchtower heavily thats the main thing is that what from then got as much right as anyone to might have the blood of kings the patrician said brother doorkeeper brother watchtower as the sudden authority on the ways of royalty shook his head i dunno that the patrician is a threat exactly he said hes not your actual tyrant as such not as bad as some weve had i mean he doesnt actually oppress i get oppressed all the time said brother doorkeeper master critchley where i work he oppresses me morning noon and night shouting at me and everything and the woman in the vegetable shop she oppresses me all the time thats right said brother plasterer my landlord oppresses me something wicked banging on the door and going on and on about all the rent i allegedly owe which is a total lie and the people next door oppress me all night long i tell them i work all day a mans got to have some time to learn to play the tuba thats oppression that is if im not under the heel of the oppressor i dont know who is put like that said brother watchtower slowly i reckon my brotherinlaw is oppressing me all the time with having this new horse and buggy hes been and bought havent got one i mean wheres the justice in that i bet a king wouldnt let that sort of oppression go on peoples wives oppressing em with why havent they got a new coach like our rodney and that the supreme grand master listened to this with a slightly lightheaded feeling it was as if hed known that there were such things as avalanches but had never dreamed when he dropped the little snowball on top of the mountain that it could lead to such astonishing results he was hardly having to egg them on at all i bet a kingd have something to say about landlords said brother plasterer and hed outlaw people with showy coaches said brother watchtower probably bought with stolen money too i reckon guards guards i think said the supreme grand master tweaking things a little that a wise king would only as it were outlaw showy coaches for the undeserving there was a thoughtful pause in the conversation as the assembled brethren mentally divided the universe into the deserving and the undeserving and put themselves on the appropriate side itd be only fair said brother watchtower slowly but brother plasterer was right really i cant see a skion manifesting his destiny just because brother doorkeeper thinks the woman in the vegetable shop keeps giving him funny looks no offence and bloody short weight said brother doorkeeper and she yes yes yes said the supreme grand master truly the rightthinking folk of ankhmorpork are beneath the heel of the oppressors however a king generally reveals himself in rather more dramatic circumstances like a war for example things were going well surely for all their selfcentred stupidity one of them would be bright enough to make the suggestion there used to be some old prophecy or something said brother plasterer my grandad told me his eyes glazed with the effort of dramatic recall yea the king will come bringing law and justice and know nothing but the truth and protect and serve the people with his sword you dont all have to look at me like that i didnt make it up oh we all know that one and a fat lot of good thatd be said brother watchtower i mean what does he do ride in with law and truth and so on like the four horsemen of the apocralypse hallo everyone he squeaked im the king and thats truth over there watering his horse not very practical is it nah you cant trust old legends why not said brother dunnykin in a peeved voice cos theyre legendary thats how you can tell said brother watchtower sleeping princesses is a good one said brother plasterer only a king can wake em up dont be daft said brother watchtower severely we havent got a king so we cant have princesses stands to reason terry pratchett of course in the old days it was easy said brother doorkeeper happily why he just had to kill a dragon the supreme grand master clapped his hands together and offered a silent prayer to any god who happened to be listening hed been right about these people sooner or later their rambling little minds took them where you wanted them to go what an interesting idea he trilled wouldnt work said brother watchtower dourly there aint no big dragons now there could be the supreme grand master cracked his knuckles come again said brother watchtower i said there could be there was a nervous laugh from the depths of brother watchtowers cowl what the real thing great big scales and wings yes breath like a blast furnace yes them big claw things on its feet talons oh yes as many as you want what do you mean as many as i want i would hope its selfexplanatory brother watchtower if you want dragons you can have dragons you can bring a dragon here now into the city me all of you i mean us said the supreme grand master brother watchtower hesitated well i dont know if thats a very good and it would obey your every command that stopped them that pulled them up that dropped in front of their weaselly little minds like a lump of meat in a dog pound can you just repeat that said brother plasterer slowly you can control it you can make it do whatever you want what a real dragon the supreme grand masters eyes rolled in the privacy of his hood guards guards yes a real one not a little pet swamp dragon the genuine article but i thought they were you know miffs the supreme grand master leaned forward they were myths and they were real he said loudly both a wave and a particle youve lost me there said brother plasterer i will demonstrate then the book please brother fingers thank you brethren i must tell you that when i was undergoing my tuition by the secret masters the what supreme grand master said brother plasterer why dont you listen you never listen he said the secret masters said brother watchtower you know the venerable sages what live on some mountain and secretly run everything and taught him all this lore and that and can walk on fires and that he told us last week hes going to teach us arent you supreme grand master he finished obsequiously oh the secret masters said brother plasterer sorry its these mystic hoods sorry secret i remember but when i rule the city the supreme grand master said to himself there is going to be none of this i shall form a new secret society of keenminded and intelligent men although not too intelligent of course not too intelligent and we will overthrow the cold tyrant and we will usher in a new age of enlightenment and fraternity and humanism and ankhmorpork will become a utopia and people like brother plasterer will be roasted over slow fires if i have any say in the matter which i will and his figgin when i was as i said undergoing my tuition by the secret masters he continued that was where they told you you had to walk on ricepaper wasnt it said brother watchtower conversationally i always thought that was a good bit ive been saving it off the bottom of my macaroons ever since amazing really i can walk on it no trouble shows what being in a proper secret society does for you does that a figgin is defined in the dictionary of bye watering words as a small shortcrust pasty containing raisins the dictionary would have been invaluable for the supreme grand master when he thought up the societys oaths since it also includes welchet ca type of waistcoat worn by certain clockmakers gaskin ca shy greybrown bird of the coot family and moules terry pratchett when he is on the griddle the supreme grand master thought brother plasterer will not be lonely your footfalls on the road of enlightenment are an example to us all brother watchtower he said if i may continue however among the many secrets from the heart of being said brother watchtower approvingly from the heart as brother watchtower says of being was the current location of the noble dragons the belief that they died out is quite wrong they simply found a new evolutionary niche and they can be summoned from it this book he flourished it gives specific instructions its just in a book said brother plasterer no ordinary book this is the only copy it has taken me years to track it down said the supreme grand master its in the handwriting of tubal de malachite a great student of dragon lore his actual handwriting he summoned dragons of all sizes and so can you there was another long awkward silence um said brother doorkeeper sounds a bit like you know magic to me said brother watchtower in the nervous tone of the man who has spotted which cup the pea is hidden under but doesnt like to say i mean not wishing to question your supreme wisdomship and that but well you know magic his voice trailed off yeah said brother plasterer uncomfortably its er the wizards see said brother fingers you probly dint know this when you was banged up with them venerable herberts on their mountain but the wizards round here come down on you like a ton of bricks if they catches you doin anything like that demarcation they call it said brother plasterer like i dont go around fiddling with the mystic interleaved wossnames of causality and they dont do any plastering i fail to see the problem said the supreme grand master in fact he saw it all too clearly this was the last hurdle help their tiny little minds over this and he held the world in the palm of his hand their stupefyingly unintelligent selfinterest hadnt let him down so far surely it couldnt fail him now guards guards the brethren shuffled uneasily then brother dunnykin spoke huh wizards what do they know about a days work the supreme grand master breathed deeply ah the air of meanminded resentfulness thickened noticeably nothing and thats a fact said brother fingers goin around with their noses in the air too good for the likes aus i used to see em when i worked up the university backsides a mile wide im telling you catch em doing a job of honest toil like thieving you mean said brother watchtower who had never liked brother fingers much ocourse they tell you brother fingers went on pointedly ignoring the comment that you shouldnt go round doin magic on account of only them knowin about not disturbin the universal harmony and whatnot load of rubbish in my opinion weell said brother plasterer i dunno really i mean you get the mix wrong you just got a lot of damp plaster round your ankles but you get a bit of magic wrong and they say ghastly things comes out the woodwork and stitches you right up yeah but its the wizards that say that said brother watchtower thoughtfully never could stand them myself to tell you the truth could be theyre on to a good thing and dont want the rest of us to find out its only waving your arms and chanting when alls said and done the brethren considered this it sounded plausible if they were on to a good thing they certainly wouldnt want anyone else muscling in the supreme grand master decided that the time was ripe then we are agreed brethren you are prepared to practise magic oh practise said brother plaster relieved i dont mind practising so long as we dont have to do it for real the supreme grand master thumped the book i mean carry out real spells put the city back on the right lines summon a dragon he shouted they took a step back then brother doorkeeper said and then if we get this dragon the rightful kingll turn up just like that yes said the supreme grand master i can see that said brother watchtower supportively terry pratchett stands to reason because of destiny and the gnomic workings of fate there was a moments hesitation and then a general nodding of cowls only brother plasterer looked vaguely unhappy weell he said it wont get out of hand will it i assure you brother plasterer that you can give it up any time you like said the supreme grand master smoothly wellall right said the reluctant brother just for a bit then could we get it to stay here long enough to burn down for example any oppressive vegetable shops ah hed won thered be dragons again and a king again not like the old kings a king who would do what he was told that said the supreme grand master depends on how much help you can be we shall need initially any items of magic you can bring it might not be a good idea to let them see that the last half of de malachites book was a charred lump the man was clearly not up to it he could do a lot better and absolutely noone would be able to stop him thunder rolled it is said that the gods play games with the lives of men but what games and why and the identities of the actual pawns and what the game is and what the rules are who knows best not to speculate thunder rolled it rolled a six now pull back briefly from the dripping streets of ankhmorpork pan across the morning mists of the disc and focus in again on a young man heading for the city with all the openness sincerity and innocence of purpose of an iceberg drifting into a major shipping lane the young man is called carrot this is not because of his hair guards guards which his father has always clipped short for reasons of hygiene it is because of his shape it is the kind of tapering shape a boy gets through clean living healthy eating and good mountain air in huge lungfuls when he flexes his shoulder muscles other muscles have to move out of the way first he is also bearing a sword presented to him in mysterious circumstances very mysterious circumstances surprisingly therefore there is something very unexpected about this sword it isnt magical it hasnt got a name when you wield it you dont get a feeling of power you just get blisters you could believe it was a sword that had been used so much that it had ceased to be anything other than a quintessential sword a long piece of metal with very sharp edges and it hasnt got destiny written all over it its practically unique in fact thunder rolled the gutters of the city gurgled softly as the detritus of the night was carried along in some cases protesting feebly when it came to the recumbent figure of captain vimes the water diverted and flowed around him in two streams vimes opened his eyes there was a moment of empty peace before memory hit him like a shovel it had been a bad day for the watch there had been the funeral of herbert gaskin for one thing poor old gaskin he had broken one of the fundamental rules of being a guard it wasnt the sort of rule that someone like gaskin could break twice and so hed been lowered into the sodden ground with the rain drumming on his coffin and noone present to mourn him but the three surviving members of the night watch the most despised group of men in the entire city sergeant colon had been in tears poor old gaskin poor old vimes vimes thought poor old vimes here in gutter but thats where he started poor old vimes with the water swirling in under breastplate poor old vimes watching rest of gutters contents ooze by probly even poor old gaskin has got better view now he thought terry pratchett lessee hed gone off after the funeral and got drunk no not drunk another word ended with er drunker that was it because world all twisted up and wrong like distorted glass only came back into focus if you looked at it through bottom of bottle something else now what was it oh yes nighttime time for duty not for gaskin though have to get new fellow new fellow coming anyway wasnt that it some stick from the hicks written letter some tick from the shicks vimes gave up and slumped back the gutter continued to swirl overhead the lighted letters fizzed and flickered in the rain it wasnt only the fresh mountain air that had given carrot his huge physique being brought up in a gold mine run by dwarfs and working a twelvehour day hauling wagons to the surface must have helped he walked with a stoop what will do that is being brought up in a gold mine run by dwarfs who thought that five feet was a good height for a ceiling hed always known he was different more bruised for one thing and then one day his father had come up to him or rather come up to his waist and told him that he was not in fact as he had always believed a dwarf its a terrible thing to be nearly sixteen and the wrong species we didnt like to say so before son said his father we thought youd grow out of it see grow out of what said carrot growing but now your mother thinks that is we both think its time you went out among your own kind i mean its not fair keeping you cooped up here without company of your own height his father twiddled a loose rivet on his helmet a sure sign that he was worried er he added but youre my kind said carrot desperately in a manner of speaking yes said his father in another manner of speaking which is a rather more precise and accurate manner of speaking no its all this genetics business you see so guards guards it might be a very good idea if you were to go out and see something of the world what for good oh no no of course not come back and visit whenever you like but well a lad your age stuck down here its not right you know i mean not a child any more having to shuffle around on your knees most of the time and everything its not right what is my own kind then said carrot bewildered the old dwarf took a deep breath youre human he said what like mr varneshi mr varneshi drove an oxcart up the mountain trails once a week to trade things for gold one of the big people youre six foot six lad hes only five foot the dwarf twiddled the loose rivet again you see how it is yes but but maybe im just tall for my height said carrot desperately after all if you can have short humans cant you have tall dwarfs his father patted him companionably on the back of the knees youve got to face facts boy youd be much more at home up on the surface its in your blood the roof isnt so low either you cant keep knocking yourself out on the sky he told himself hold on said carrot his honest brow wrinkling with the effort of calculation youre a dwarf right and mams a dwarf so i should be a dwarf too fact of life the dwarf sighed hed hoped to creep up on this over a period of months maybe sort of break it to him gently but there wasnt any time any more sit down lad he said carrot sat the thing is he said wretchedly when the boys big honest face was a little nearer his own we found you in the woods one day toddling about near one of the tracksum the loose rivet squeaked the king plunged on thing is you seethere were these carts on fire as you might say and dead people um yes extremely dead people because of bandits it was a bad winter that winter there were all sorts coming into the hills so we took you in of course and then well it was a long winter like i said and your mam got used to you and well we never got around to asking varneshi to make enquiries thats the long and the short of it terry pratchett carrot took this fairly calmly mostly because he didnt understand nearly all of it besides as far as he was aware being found toddling in the woods was the normal method of childbirth a dwarf is not considered old enough to have the technical processes explained to him until he has reached pubertyt all right dad he said and leaned down so as to be level with the dwarfs ear but you know me and you know minty rocksmacker shes really beautiful dad got a beard as soft as a a a very soft thing weve got an understanding and yes said the dwarf coldly i know her fathers had a word with me so did her mother with your mother he added silently and then she had a word with me lots of words its not that they dont like you youre a steady lad and a fine worker youd make a good soninlaw four good sonsinlaw thats the trouble and shes only sixty anyway its not proper its not right hed heard about children being reared by wolves he wondered whether the leader of the pack ever had to sort out something tricky like this perhaps hed have to take him into a quiet clearing somewhere and say look son you might have wondered why youre not as hairy as everyone else hed discussed it with varneshi a good solid man varneshi of course hed known the mans father and his grandfather now he came to think about it humans didnt seem to last long it was probably all the effort of pumping blood up that high got a problem there king right enough the old man had said as they shared a nip of spirits on a bench outside shaft hes a good lad mind you said the king sound character honest not exactly brilliant but you tell him to do something he dont rest until hes done it obedient you could chop his legs off said varneshi its not his legs thats going to be the problem said the king darkly the pronoun is used by dwarfs to indicate both sexes all dwarfs have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing gender is more or less optional tie about j lit dezkaknik mine supervisor guards guards ah yes well in that case you could no no agreed varneshi thoughtfully hmm well then what you should do is you should send him away for a bit let him mix a bit with humans he sat back what youve got here king is a duck he added in knowledgeable tones i dont think i should tell him that hes refusing to believe hes a human as it is what i mean is a duck brought up among chickens wellknown farmyard phenomenon finds it cant bloody well peck and doesnt know what swimming is the king listened politely dwarfs dont go in much for agriculture but you send him off to see a lot of other ducks let him get his feet wet and he wont go running around after bantams any more and bobs your uncle varneshi sat back and looked rather pleased with himself when you spend a large part of your life underground you develop a very literal mind dwarfs have no use for metaphor and simile rocks are hard the darkness is dark start messing around with descriptions like that and youre in big trouble is their motto but after two hundred years of talking to humans the king had as it were developed a painstaking mental toolkit which was nearly adequate for the job of understanding them surely bjorn stronginthearm is my uncle he pointed out slowly same thing there was a pause while the king subjected this to careful analysis youre saying he said weighing each word that we should send carrot away to be a duck among humans because bjorn stronginthearm is my uncle hes a fine lad plenty of openings for a big strong lad like him said varneshi i have heard that dwarfs go off to work in the big city said the king uncertainly and they send back money to their families which is very commendable and proper there you are then get him a job in in varneshi sought for inspiration in the watch or something my greatgrandfather was in the watch you know fine job for a big lad my grandad said what is a watch said the king terry pratchett oh said varneshi with the vagueness of someone whose family for the last three generations hadnt travelled more than twenty miles they goes about making sure people keep the laws and do what theyre told that is a very proper concern said the king who since he was usually the one doing the telling had very solid views about people doing what they were told of course they dont take just anyone said varneshi dredging the depths of his recollection i should think not for such an important task i shall write to their king i dont think they have a king there said varneshi just some man who tells them what to do the king of the dwarfs took this calmly this seemed to be about ninetyseven per cent of the definition of kingship as far as he was concerned carrot took the news without fuss just as he took instructions about reopening shaft or cutting timber for shoring props all dwarfs are by nature dutiful serious literate obedient and thoughtful people whose only minor failing is a tendency after one drink to rush at enemies screaming arrrrrrgh and axing their legs off at the knee carrot saw no reason to be any different he would go to this city whatever that was and have a man made of him they took only the finest varneshi had said a watchman had to be a skilled fighter and clean in thought word and deed from the depths of his ancestral anecdotage the old man had dragged tales of moonlight chases across rooftops and tremendous battles with miscreants which of course his greatgrandad had won despite being heavily outnumbered carrot had to admit it sounded better than mining after some thought the king wrote to the ruler of ankhmorpork respectfully asking if carrot could be considered for a place amongst the citys finest letters rarely got written in that mine work stopped and the whole clan had sat around in respectful silence as his pen scrittered across the parchment his aunt had been sent up to varneshis to beg his pardon but could he see his way clear to sparing a smidgen of wax his sister had been sent down to the village to ask mistress garlick the witch how you stopped spelling recommendation guards guards months had gone by and then thered been the reply it was fairly grubby since mail in the ramtops was generally handed to whoever was going in more or less the right direction and it was also fairly short it said baldly that his application was accepted and would he present himself for duty immediately just like that he said i thought thered be tests and things to see if i was suitable youre my son said the king i told them that see stands to reason youll be suitable probably officer material hed pulled a sack from under his chair rummaged around in it and presented carrot with a length of metal more a sword than a saw but only just this might rightly belong to you he said when we found the carts this was the only thing left the bandits you see just between you and me he beckoned carrot closer we had a witch look at it in case it was magic but it isnt quite the most unmagical sword shed ever seen she said they normally have a bit see on account of its like magnetism i suppose got quite a nice balance though he handed it over he rummaged around some more and then theres this he held up a shirt itll protect you carrot fingered it carefully it was made from the wool of ramtop sheep which had all the warmth and softness of hog bristles it was one of the legendary woolly dwarf vests the kind of vest that needs hinges protect me from what he said colds and so on said the king your mother says youve got to wear it and erthat reminds me mr varneshi says hed like you to drop in on the way down the mountain hes got something for you his father and mother had waved him out of sight minty didnt funny that she seemed to have been avoiding him lately hed taken the sword slung on his back sandwiches and clean underwear in his pack and the world more or less at his feet in his pocket was the famous letter from the patrician the man who ruled the great fine city of ankhmorpork at least thats how his mother had referred to it it certainly had an importantlooking crest at the top but the signature was terry pratchett something like lupin squiggle secy pp still if it wasnt actually signed by the patrician then it had certainly been written by someone who worked for him or in the same building probably the patrician had at least known about the letter in general terms not this letter perhaps but probably he knew about the existence of letters in general carrot walked steadfastly down the mountain paths disturbing clouds of bumblebees after a while he unsheathed the sword and made experimental stabs at felonious tree stumps and unlawful assemblies of stinging nettles varneshi was sitting outside his hut threading dried mushrooms on a string hallo carrot he said leading the way inside looking forward to the city carrot gave this due consideration no he said having second thoughts are you no i was just walking along said carrot honestly i wasnt thinking about anything much your dad give you the sword did he said varneshi rummaging on a fetid shelf yes and a woolly vest to protect me against chills ah yes it can be very damp down there so ive heard protection very important he turned around and added dramatically this belonged to my greatgrandfather it was a strange vaguely hemispherical device surrounded by straps its some sort of sling said carrot after examining it in polite silence varneshi told him what it was codpiece like in fish said carrot mystified no its for the fighting mumbled varneshi you should wear it all the time protects your vitals like carrot tried it on its a bit small mr varneshi thats because you dont wear it on your head you see varneshi explained some more to carrots mounting bewilderment and subsequently horror my greatgrandad used to say varneshi finished that but for this i wouldnt be here today guards guards what did he mean by that varneshis mouth opened and shut a few times ive no idea he said spinelessly anyway the shameful thing was now at the very bottom of carrots pack dwarfs didnt have much truck with things like that the ghastly preventative represented a glimpse into a world as alien as the backside of the moon there had been another gift from mr varneshi it was a small but very thick book bound in a leather that had become like wood over the years it was called the laws and ordinances of the cities of ankh and morpork this belonged to my greatgrandad as well he said this is what the watch has to know you have to know all the laws he said virtuously to be a good officer perhaps varneshi should have recalled that in the whole of carrots life noone had ever really lied to him or given him an instruction that he wasnt meant to take quite literally carrot solemnly took the book it would never have occurred to him if he was going to be an officer of the watch to be less than a good one it was a five hundred mile journey and surprisingly quite uneventful people who are rather more than six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders often have uneventful journeys people jump out at them from behind rocks then say things like oh sorry i thought you were someone else hed spent most of the journey reading and now ankhmorpork was before him it was a little disappointing hed expected high white towers rearing over the landscape and flags ankhmorpork didnt rear rather it sort of skulked clinging to the soil as if afraid someone might steal it there were no flags there was a guard on the gate at least he was wearing chainmail and the thing he was propped up against was a spear he had to be a guard carrot saluted him and presented the letter the man looked at it for some time mm he said eventually i think ive got to see lupin squiggle secy pp said carrot whats the pp for said the guard suspiciously terry pratchett could it be pretty promptly said carrot who had wondered about this himself well i dont know about any secy said the guard you want captain vimes of the night watch and where is he based said carrot politely at this time of day id try the bunch of grapes in easy street said the guard he looked carrot up and down joining the watch are you i hope to prove worthy yes said carrot the guard gave him what could loosely be called an oldfashioned look it was practically neolithic what was it you done he said im sorry said carrot you must of done something said the guard my father wrote a letter said carrot proudly ive been volunteered bloody hellfire said the guard now it was night again and beyond the dread portal are the wheels of torment duly spun said the supreme grand master the elucidated brethren shuffled around their circle brother watchtower said the supreme grand master not my job to spin the wheels of torment muttered brother watchtower s brother plasterers job spinning the wheels of torment no it bloody well isnt its my job to oil the axles of the universal lemon said brother plasterer hotly you always say its my job the supreme grand master sighed in the depths of his cowl as yet another row began from this dross he was going to forge an age of rationality just shut up will you he snapped we dont really need the wheels of torment tonight stop it the pair of you now brethren you have all brought the items as instructed there was a general murmuring place them in the circle of conjuration said the supreme grand master guards guards it was a sorry collection bring magical things hed said only brother fingers had produced anything worthwhile it looked like some sort of altar ornament best not to ask from where the supreme grand master stepped forward and prodded one of the other things with his toe what he said is this s a amulet muttered brother dunnykin s very powerful bought it off a man guaranteed protects you against crocodile bites are you sure you can spare it said the supreme grand master there was a dutiful titter from the rest of the brethren less of that brothers said the grand master spinning around bring magical things i said not cheap jewellery and rubbish good grief this city is lousy with magic he reached down what are these things for heavens sake theyre stones said brother plasterer uncertainly i can see that whyre they magical brother plasterer began to tremble theyve got holes in them supreme grand master everyone knows that stones with holes in them are magical the supreme grand master walked back to his place on the circle he threw his arms up right fine okay he said wearily if thats how were going to do it thats how were going to do it if we get a dragon six inches long well all know the reason why wont we brother plasterer brother plasterer sorry i didnt hear what you said brother plasterer i said yes supreme grand master whispered brother plasterer very well so long as thats quite understood the supreme grand master turned and picked up the book and now he said if we are all quite ready um brother watchtower meekly raised his hand ready for what supreme grand master he said for the summoning of course good grief i should have thought but you havent told us what were supposed to do supreme grand master whined brother watchtower the grand master hesitated this was quite true but he wasnt going to admit it terry pratchett well of course he said its obvious you have to focus your concentration think hard about dragons he translated all of you thats all is it said brother doorkeeper yes dont we have to chant a mystic prune or something the supreme grand master stared at him brother doorkeeper managed to look as defiant in the face of oppression as an anonymous shadow in a black cowl could look he hadnt joined a secret society not to chant mystic runes hed been looking forward to it you can if you like said the supreme grand master now i want you yes what is it brother dunnykin the little brother lowered his hand dont know any mystic prunes grand master not to what you might call chant hum he opened the book hed been rather surprised to find after pages and pages of pious ramblings that the actual summoning itself was one short sentence not a chant not a brief piece of poetry but a mere assemblage of meaningless syllables de malachite said they caused interference patterns in the waves of reality but the daft old fool was probably making it up as he went along that was the trouble with wizards they had to make everything look difficult all you really needed was willpower and the brethren had a lot of that smallminded and vitriolic willpower yes lousy with malignity maybe but still powerful enough in its way theyd try nothing fancy this time round somewhere inconspicuous around him the brethren were chanting what each man considered according to his lights to be something mystical the general effect was actually quite good if you didnt listen to the words the words oh yes he looked down and spoke them aloud nothing happened he blinked when he opened his eyes again he was in a dark alley his stomach was full of fire and he was very angry guards guards it was about to be the worst night of his life for zebbo mooty thief third class and it wouldnt have made him any happier to know that it was also going to be the last one the rain was keeping people indoors and he was way behind on his quota he was therefore a little less cautious than he might otherwise have been in the night time streets of ankhmorpork caution is an absolute there is no such thing as moderately cautious you are either very cautious or you are dead you might be walking around and breathing but youre dead just the same he heard the muffled sounds coming from the nearby alley slid his leatherbound cosh from his sleeve waited until the victim was almost turning the corner sprang out said oh shi and died it was a most unusual death noone else had died like that for hundreds of years the stone wall behind him glowed cherry red with heat which gradually faded into darkness he was the first to see the ankhmorpork dragon he derived little comfort from knowing this however because he was dead t he said and his disembodied self looked down at the small heap of charcoal which he knew with an unfamiliar sort of certainty was what he had just been disembodied from it was a strange sensation seeing your own mortal remains he didnt find it as horrifying as he would have imagined if youd asked him say ten minutes ago finding that you are dead is mitigated by also finding that there really is a you who can find you dead the alley opposite was empty again that was really strange said mooty extremely unusual certainly did you see that what was it mooty looked up at the dark figure emerging from the shadows whore you anyway he added suspiciously guess said the voice mooty peered at the hooded figure cor he said i thought you dint turn up for the likes o me i turn up for everyone i mean inperson sort of thing sometimes on special occasions yeah well said mooty this is one of them all right i mean terry pratchett it looked like a bloody dragon whats a man to do you dont expect to find a dragon around the corner and now if you would care to step this way said death laying a skeletal hand on mootys shoulder do you know a fortune teller once told me id die in my bed surrounded by grieving greatgrandchildren said mooty following the stately figure what do you think of that eh i think she was wrong a bloody dragon said mooty fire breathing too did i suffer much no it was practically instantaneous thats good i wouldnt like to think id suffered much mooty looked around him what happens now he said behind them the rain washed the little heap of black ash into the mud the supreme grand master opened his eyes he was lying on his back brother dunnykin was preparing to give him the kiss of life the mere thought was enough to jerk anyone from the borders of consciousness he sat up trying to shed the feeling that he weighed several tons and was covered in scales we did it he whispered the dragon it came i felt it the brethren glanced at one another we never saw nothing said brother plasterer i might of seen something said brother watchtower loyally no not here snapped the supreme grand master you hardly want it to materialise here do you it was out there in the city just for a few seconds he pointed look the brethren turned around guiltily expecting at any moment the hot flame of retribution in the centre of the circle the magic items were gently crumbling to dust even as they watched brother dunnykins amulet collapsed sucked dry whispered brother fingers ill be damned three dollars that amulet cost me muttered brother dunnykin guards guards but it proves it works said the supreme grand master dont you see you fools it works we can summon dragons could be a bit expensive in magical items said brother fingers doubtfully three dollars it was no rubbish power growled the supreme grand master does not come cheap very true nodded brother watchtower not cheap very true he looked at the little heap of exhausted magic again cor he said we did it though dint we we only went and bloody well did some magic right see said brother fingers i tole you there was nothin to it you all did exceptionally well said the supreme grand master encouragingly shouldve been six dollars but he said hed cut his own throat and sell it me for three dollars yeah said brother watchtower we got the hang of it all right dint hurt a bit we done real magic and dint get et by tooth fairies from out of the woodwork either brother plasterer i couldnt help noticing the other brethren nodded real magic nothing to it everyone had just better watch out hang on though said brother plasterer wheres this dragon gone i mean did we really summon it or not fancy you asking a silly question like that said brother watchtower doubtfully the supreme grand master brushed the dust off his mystic robe we summoned it he said and it came but only as long as the magic lasted then it went back if we want it to stay longer we need more magic understand and that is what we must get three dollars i shant see again in a hurry shut up dearest father well here i am in ankhmorpork it is not like at home i think it must have changed a bit since mr varneshis greatgrandfather was here i dont think people here know right from wrong terry pratchett found captain vimes in a common alehouse i remembered what you said about a good dwarf not going into such places but since he did not come out i went in he was lying with his head on the table when i spoke to him he said pull the other one kid it has got bells on i believe he was the worse for drink he told me to find a place to stay and report to sgt colon at the watch house tonight he said anyone wanting to join the guard needed their head examined mr varneshi did not mention this perhaps it is done for reasons of hygiene i went for a walk there are many people here i found a place it is called the shades then i saw some men trying to rob a young lady i set about them they did not know how to fight properly and one of them tried to kick me in the vitals but i was wearing the protective as instructed and he hurt himself then the lady came up to me and said was i interested in bed i said yes she took me to where she lived a boarding house i think it is called it is run by a mrs palm the lady whose purse it was she is called reet said you should of seen him there were of them it was amazing mrs palm said it is on the house she said what a big protective so i went upstairs and fell asleep although it is a very noisy place reet woke me up once or twice to say do you want anything but they had no apples so i have fallen on my feet as they say here but i dont see how that is possible because if you fall you fall off your feet it is common sense there is certainly a lot to do when i went to see the sgt i saw a place called the thieves guild i asked mrs palm and she said of course she said the leaders of the thieves in the city meet there i went to the watch house and met sgt colon a very fat man and when i told him about the thieves guild he said dont be a idiot i do not think he is serious he says dont you worry about thieves guilds this is all what you have to do you walk along the streets at night shouting its twelve oclock and alls well i said what if it is not all well and he said you bloody well find another street this is not leadership i have been given some chain mail it is rusty and not well made they give you money for being a guard it is dollars a month when i get it i will send you it guards guards i hope you are all well and that shaft is now open this afternoon i will go and look at the thieves guild it is disgraceful if i do something about it it will be a feather in my cap i am getting the hang of how they talk here already your loving son carrot ps please give all my love to minty i really miss her lord vetinari the patrician of ankhmorpork put his hand over his eyes he did what i was marched through the streets said urdo van pew currently president of the guild of thieves burglars and allied trades in broad daylight with my hands tied together he took a few steps towards the patricians severe chair of office waving a finger you know very well that we have kept within the budget he said to be humiliated like that like a common criminal there had better be a full apology he said or you will have another strike on your hands we will be driven to it despite our natural civic responsibilities he added it was the finger the finger was a mistake the patrician was staring coldly at the finger van pew followed his gaze and quickly lowered the digit the patrician was not a man you shook a finger at unless you wanted to end up being able to count only to nine and you say this was one person said lord vetinari yes that is van pew hesitated it did sound weird now he came to tell someone but there are hundreds of you in there said the patrician calmly thick as you should excuse the expression thieves van pew opened and shut his mouth a few times the honest answer would have been yes and if anyone had come sidling in and skulking around the corridors it would have been the worse for them it was the way he strode in as if he owned the place that fooled everyone that and the fact that he kept hitting people and telling them to mend their ways the patrician nodded i shall deal with the matter momentarily he said it was a terry pratchett good word it always made people hesitate they were never quite sure whether he meant hed deal with it now or just deal with it briefly and noone ever dared ask van pew backed down a full apology mark you i have a position to maintain he added thank you do not let me detain you said the patrician once again giving the language his own individual spin right good thank you very well said the thief after all you have such a lot of work to do lord vetinari went on well of course this is the case the thief hesitated the patricians last remark had barbs on it you found yourself waiting for him to strike er he said hoping for a clue with so much business being conducted that is panic took over the thief s features randomised guilt flooded his mind it wasnt a case of what had he done it was a question of what the patrician had found out about the man had eyes everywhere none of them so terrifying as the icy blue ones just above his nose i er dont quite follow he began curious choice of targets the patrician picked up a sheet of paper for example a crystal ball belonging to a fortune teller in sheer street a small ornament from the temple of offler the crocodile god and so on gewgaws i am afraid i really dont know said the head thief the patrician leaned forward no unlicensed thieving surely he said i shall look into it directly stuttered the head thief depend upon it the patrician gave him a sweet smile im sure i can he said thank you for coming to see me dont hesitate to leave the thief shuffled out it was always like this with the patrician he reflected bitterly you came to him with a perfectly one of the remarkable innovations introduced by the patrician was to make the thieves guild responsible for theft with annual budgets forward planning and above all rigid job protection thus in return for an agreed average level of crime per annum the thieves themselves saw to it that unauthorised crime was met with the full force of injustice which was generally a stick with nails in it guards guards reasonable complaint next thing you knew you were shuffling out backwards bowing and scraping relieved simply to be getting away you had to hand it to the patrician he admitted grudgingly if you didnt he sent men to come and take it away when hed gone lord vetinari rang the little bronze bell that summoned his secretary the mans name despite his handwriting was lupine wonse he appeared pen poised you could say this about lupine wonse he was neat he always gave the impression of just being completed even his hair was so smootheddown and oiled it looked as though it had been painted on the watch appears to be having some difficulty with the thieves guild said the patrician van pew has been in here claiming that a member of the watch arrested him what for sir being a thief apparently a member of the watch said the secretary i know but just sort it out will you the patrician smiled to himself it was always hard to fathom lord vetinaris idiosyncratic sense of humour but a vision of the redfaced irate head thief kept coming back to him one of the patricians greatest contributions to the reliable operation of ankhmorpork had been very early in his administration the legalising of the ancient guild of thieves crime was always with us he reasoned and therefore if you were going to have crime it at least should be organised crime and so the guild had been encouraged to come out of the shadows and build a big guildhouse take their place at civic banquets and set up their training college with dayrelease courses and city and guilds certificates and everything in exchange for the winding down of the watch they agreed while trying to keep their faces straight to keep crime levels to a level to be determined annually that way everyone could plan ahead said lord vetinari and part of the uncertainty had been removed from the chaos that is life and then a little while later the patrician summoned the leading thieves again and said oh by the way there was something else what was it now oh yes i know who you are he said i know where you live i know what terry pratchett kind of horse you ride i know where your wife has her hair done i know where your lovely children how old are they now my doesnt time fly i know where they play so you wont forget about what we agreed will you and he smiled so did they after a fashion and in fact it had turned out very satisfactorily from everyones point of view it took the head thieves a very little time to grow paunches and start having coatsofarms made and meet in a proper building rather than smoky dens which noone had liked much a complicated arrangement of receipts and vouchers saw to it that while everyone was eligible for the attentions of the guild noone had too much and this was very acceptable at least to those citizens who were rich enough to afford the quite reasonable premiums the guild charged for an uninterrupted life there was a strange foreign word for this innsewerants noone knew exactly what it had originally meant but ankhmorpork had made it its own the watch hadnt liked it but the plain fact was that the thieves were far better at controlling crime than the watch had ever been after all the watch had to work twice as hard to cut crime just a little whereas all the guild had to do was to work less and so the city prospered while the watch had dwindled away like a useless appendix into a handful of unemployables who noone in their right mind could ever take seriously the last thing anyone wanted them to do was get it into their heads to fight crime but seeing the head thief discommoded was always worth the trouble the patrician felt captain vimes knocked very hesitantly at the door because each tap echoed around his skull enter vimes removed his helmet tucked it under his arm and pushed the door open its creak was a blunt saw across the front of his brain he always felt uneasy in the presence of lupine wonse come to that he felt uneasy in the presence of lord vetinari but that was different that was down to breeding and ordinary fear of guards guards course whereas hed known wonse since their childhood in the shades the boy had shown promise even then he was never a gang leader never a gang leader hadnt got the strength or stamina for that and after all what was the point in being the gang leader behind every gang leader were a couple of lieutenants bucking for promotion being a gang leader is not a job with longterm prospects but in every gang there is a pale youth whos allowed to stay because hes the one who comes up with all the clever ideas usually to do with old women and unlocked shops this was wonses natural place in the order of things vimes had been one of the middle rankers the falsetto equivalent of a yesman he remembered wonse as a skinny little kid always tagging along behind in handmedown pants with the kind of odd skipping run hed invented to keep up with the bigger boys and forever coming up with fresh ideas to stop them idly ganging up on him which was the usual recreation if nothing more interesting presented itself it was superb training for the rigours of adulthood and wonse became good at it yes theyd both started in the gutter but wonse had worked his way up whereas as he himself would be the first to admit vimes had merely worked his way along every time he seemed to be getting anywhere he spoke his mind or said the wrong thing usually both at once that was what made him uncomfortable around wonse it was the ticking of the bright clockwork of ambition vimes had never mastered ambition it was something that happened to other people ah vimes sir said vimes woodenly he didnt try to salute in case he fell over he wished hed had time to drink dinner wonse rummaged in the papers of his desk strange things afoot vimes serious complaint about you im afraid he said wonse didnt wear glasses if he had worn glasses hed have peered at vimes over the top of them sir one of your night watch men seems he arrested the head of the thieves guild vimes swayed a little and tried hard to focus he wasnt ready for this sort of thing terry pratchett sorry sir he said seem to have lost you there i said vimes that one of your men arrested the head of the thieves guild one of my men yes vimess scattered brain cells tried valiantly to regroup a member of the watch he said wonse grinned mirthlessly tied him up and left him in front of the palace theres a bit of a stink about it im afraid there was a note ah here it is this man is charged with conspiracy to commit crime under section of the general felonies act by me carrot ironfoundersson vimes squinted at him fourteen eyeeyeeye apparently said wonse what does that mean i really havent the faintest notion said wonse drily and what about the name carrot but we dont do things like that said vimes you cant go around arresting the thieves guild i mean wed be at it all day apparently this carrot thinks otherwise the captain shook his head and winced carrot doesnt ring a bell the tone of blurred conviction was enough even for wonse who was momentarily taken aback he was quite the secretary hesitated carrot carrot he said ive heard the name before seen it written down his face went blank the volunteer that was it remember me showing you vimes stared at him wasnt there a letter from i dont know some dwarf all about serving the community and keeping the streets safe thats right begging that his son would be found suitable for a humble position in the watch the secretary was rummaging among his files whatd he done said vimes nothing that was it not a blessed thing vimess brow creased as his thoughts shaped themselves around a new concept a volunteer he said guards guards yes he didnt have to join he wanted to join and you said it must be a joke and i said we ought to try and get more ethnic minorities into the watch you remember vimes tried to it wasnt easy he was vaguely aware that he drank to forget what made it rather pointless was that he couldnt remember what it was he was forgetting any more in the end he just drank to forget about drinking a trawl of the chaotic assortment of recollections that he didnt even try to dignify any more by the name of memory produced no clue do i he said helplessly wonse folded his hands on the desk and leaned forward now look captain he said lordship wants an explanation i dont want to have to tell him the captain of the night watch hasnt the faintest idea what goes on among the men under if i may use the term loosely his command that sort of thing only leads to trouble questions asked that sort of thing we dont want that do we do we no sir vimes muttered a vague recollection of someone earnestly talking to him in the bunch of grapes was bobbing guiltily at the back of his mind surely that hadnt been a dwarf not unless the qualification had been radically altered at any rate of course we dont said wonse for old times sake and so on so ill think of something to tell him and you captain will make a point of finding out whats going on and putting a stop to it give this dwarf a short lesson in what it means to be a guard all right haha said vimes dutifully im sorry said wonse oh thought you made an ethnic joke there sir look vimes im being very understanding in tb circumstances now i want you to get out there and sort this out do you understand vimes saluted the black depression that always lurked ready to take advantage of his sobriety moved in on his tongue right you are mr secretary he said ill see to it that he learns that arresting thieves is against the law terry pratchett he wished he hadnt said that if he didnt say things like that hed have been better off now captain of the palace guard a big man giving him the watch had been the patricians little joke but wonse was already reading a new document on his desk if he noticed the sarcasm he didnt show it very good he said dearest mother it has been a much better day i went into the thieves guild and arrested the chief miscreant and dragged him to the patricians palace no more trouble from him i fancy and mrs palm says i can stay in the attic because it is always useful to have a man around the place this was because in the night there were men the worse for drink making a fuss in one of the girls rooms and i had to speak to them and they showed fight and one of them tried to hurt me with his knee but i had the protective and mrs palm says he has broken his patella but i neednt pay for a new one i do not understand some of the watch duties i have a partner his name is nobby he says i am too keen he says i have got a lot to learn i think this is true because i have only got up to page in the laws and ordinances of the cities of ankh and morpork love to all your son carrot ps love to minty it wasnt just the loneliness it was the backtofront way of living that was it thought vimes the night watch got up when the rest of the world was going to bed and went to bed when dawn drifted over the landscape you spent your whole time in the damp dark streets in a world of shadows the night watch attracted the kind of people who for one reason or another were inclined to that kind of life he reached the watch house it was an ancient and surprisingly large building wedged between a tannery and a tailor who made suspicious leather goods it must have been quite imposing once but quite a lot of it was now uninhabitable and patrolled only by owls and rats over the door a motto in the guards guards ancient tongue of the city was now almost eroded by time and grime and lichen but could just be made out fabric ati diem pvnc it translated according to sergeant colon who had served in foreign parts and considered himself an expert on languages as to protect and to serve yes being a guard must have meant something once sergeant colon he thought as he stumbled into the musty gloom now there was a man who liked the dark sergeant colon owed thirty years of happy marriage to the fact that mrs colon worked all day and sergeant colon worked all night they communicated by means of notes he got her tea ready before he left at night she left his breakfast nice and hot in the oven in the mornings they had three grownup children all born vimes had assumed as a result of extremely persuasive handwriting and corporal nobbs well anyone like nobby had unlimited reasons for not wishing to be seen by other people you didnt have to think hard about that the only reason you couldnt say that nobby was close to the animal kingdom was that the animal kingdom would get up and walk away and then of course there was himself just a skinny unshaven collection of bad habits marinated in alcohol and that was the night watch just the three of them once there had been dozens hundreds and now just three vimes fumbled his way up the stairs groped his way into his office slumped into the primeval leather chair with its prolapsed stuffing scrabbled at the bottom drawer grabbed bottle bit cork tugged spat out cork drank began his day the world swam into focus life is just chemicals a drop here a drip there everythings changed a mere dribble of fermented juices and suddenly youre going to live another few hours once in the days when this had been a respectable district some hopeful owner of the tavern next door had paid a wizard a considerable sum of money for an illuminated sign every letter a different colour now it worked erratically and sometimes shortcircuited in the damp at the moment the e was a garish pink and flashed on and off at random vimes had grown accustomed to it it seemed like part of life he stared at the flickering play of light on the crumbling terry pratchett plaster for a while and then raised one sandalled foot and thumped heavily on the floorboards twice after a few minutes a distant wheezing indicated that sergeant colon was climbing the stairs vimes counted silently colon always paused for six seconds at the top of the flight to get some of his breath back on the seventh second the door opened the sergeants face appeared around it like a harvest moon you could describe sergeant colon like this he was the sort of man who if he took up a military career would automatically gravitate to the post of sergeant you couldnt imagine him ever being a corporal or for that matter a captain if he didnt take up a military career then he looked cut out for something like perhaps a sausage butcher some job where a big red face and a tendency to sweat even in frosty weather were practically part of the specification he saluted and with considerable care placed a scruffy piece of paper on vimess desk and smoothed it out evenin captain he said yesterdays incident reports and that also you owe fourpence to the tea club whats this about a dwarf sergeant said vimes abruptly colons brow wrinkled what dwarf the one whos just joined the watch name of vimes hesitated carrot or something him colons mouth dropped open hes a dwarf i always said you couldnt trust them little buggers he fooled me all right captain the little sod must of lied about his height colon was a sizeist at least when it came to people smaller than himself do you know he arrested the president of the thieves guild this morning what for for being president of the thieves guild it seems the sergeant looked puzzled wheres the crime in that i think perhaps i had better have a word with this carrot said vimes didnt you see him sir said colon he said hed reported to you sir i uh must have been busy at the time lot on my mind said vimes yes sir said colon politely vimes had just enough self guards guards respect left to look away and shuffle the strata of paperwork on his desk weve got to get him off the streets as soon as possible he muttered next thing you know hell be bringing in the chief of the assassins guild for bloody well killing people where is he i sent him out with corporal nobbs captain i said hed show him the ropes sort of thing you sent a raw recruit out with nobby said vimes wearily colon stuttered well sir experienced man i thought corporal nobbs could teach him a lot lets just hope hes a slow learner said vimes ramming his brown iron helmet on his head come on when they stepped out of the watch house there was a ladder against the tavern wall a bulky man at the top of it swore under his breath as he wrestled with the illuminated sign its the e that doesnt work properly vimes called up what the e and the t sizzles when it rains its about time it was fixed fixed oh yes fixed thats what im doing all right fixing the watch men splashed off through the puddles brother watchtower shook his head slowly and turned his attention once again to his screwdriver men like corporal nobbs can be found in every armed force although their grasp of the minutiae of the regulations is usually encyclopedic they take good care never to be promoted beyond perhaps corporal he tended to speak out of the corner of his mouth he smoked incessantly but the weird thing carrot noticed was that any cigarette smoked by nobby became a dogend almost instantly but remained a dogend indefinitely or until lodged behind his ear which was a sort of nicotine elephants graveyard on the rare occasions he took one out of his mouth he held it cupped in his hand he was a small bandylegged man with a certain resemblance to a chimpanzee who never got invited to tea parties terry pratchett his age was indeterminate but in cynicism and general world weariness which is a sort of carbon dating of the personality he was about seven thousand years old a cushy number this route he said as they strolled along a damp street in the merchants quarter he tried a doorhandle it was locked you stick with me he added and ill see youre all right now you try the handles on the other side of the street ah i understand corporal nobbs weve got to see if anyones left their store unlocked said carrot you catch on fast son i hope i can apprehend a miscreant in the act said carrot zealously er yeah said nobby uncertainly but if we find a door unlocked i suppose we must summon the owner carrot went on and one of us would have to stay to guard things right yeah nobby brightened ill do that he said dont you worry about it then you could go and find the victim owner i mean he tried another doorknob it turned under his grip back in the mountains said carrot if a thief was caught he was hung up by the he paused idly rattling a doorknob nobby froze by the what he said in horrified fascination cant remember now said carrot my mother said it was too good for them anyway stealing is wrong nobby had survived any number of famous massacres by not being there he let go of the doorknob and gave it a friendly pat got it said carrot nobby jumped got what he shouted i remember what we hang them up by said carrot oh said nobby weakly where we hang them up by the town hall said carrot sometimes for days they dont do it again i can tell you and bjorn stronginthearms your uncle nobby leaned his pike against the wall and fumbled a fagend from the recesses of his ear one or two things he decided needed to be sorted out why did you have to become a guard lad he said guards guards everyone keeps on asking me that said carrot i didnt have to i wanted to it will make a man of me nobby never looked anyone directly in the eye he stared at carrots right ear in amazement you mean you aint running away from anything he said what would i want to run away from anything for nobby floundered a bit ah theres always something maybe maybe you was wrongly accused of something like maybe he grinned maybe the stores was mysteriously short on certain items and you was unjustly blamed or certain items was found in your kit and you never knew how they got there that sort of thing you can tell old nobby or he nudged carrot praps it was something else eh shershay la fern eh got a girl into trouble i carrot began and then remembered that yes one should tell the truth even to odd people like nobby who didnt seem to know what it was and the truth was that he was always getting minty in trouble although exactly how and why was a bit of a mystery just about every time he left after paying calls on her at the rocksmacker cave he could hear her father and mother shouting at her they were always very polite to him but somehow merely being seen with him was enough to get minty into trouble yes he said ah often the case said nobby wisely all the time said carrot just about every night really blimey said nobby impressed he looked down at the protective is that why they make you wear that then what do you mean well dont worry about it said nobby everyones got their little secret or big secret as it might be even the captain hes only with us because he was brung low by a woman thats what the sergeant says brung low goodness said carrot it sounded painful but i reckon its cos he speaks his mind spoke it once too often to the patrician i heard said the thieves guild was nothing but a pack of thieves or something thats why hes with us dunno really he looked speculatively at the pavement and then said so wherere you staying lad theres a lady called mrs palm carrot began terry pratchett nobby choked on some smoke that went the wrong way in the shades he wheezed youre staying there oh yes every nightf well every day really yes and youve come here to have a man made of you yes i dont think i should like to live where you come from said nobby look said carrot thoroughly lost i came because mr varneshi said it was the finest job in the world upholding the law and everything thats right isnt it well er said nobby as to that mean upholding the law i mean once yes before we had all the guilds and stuffthe law sort of thing aint really i mean these days everythings more oh i dunno basically you just ring your bell and keep your head down nobby signed then he grunted snatched his hourglass from his belt and peered in at the rapidlydraining sand grains he put it back pulled the leather muffler off his bells clapper and shook it once or twice not very loudly twelve of the clock he muttered and alls well and thats it is it said carrot as the tiny echoes died away more or less more or less nobby took a quick drag on his dogend just that no moonlight chases across rooftops no swinging on chandeliers nothing like that said carrot shouldnt think so said nobby fervently i never done anything like that noone ever said anything to me about that he snatched a puff on the cigarette a man could catch his death of cold chasing around on rooftops i reckon ill stick to the bell if its all the same to you can i have a go said carrot nobby was feeling unbalanced it can be the only reason why he made the mistake of wordlessly handing carrot the bell carrot examined it for a few seconds then he waved it vigorously over his head twelve oclock he bellowed and alls weeeeelllw the echoes bounced back and forth across the street and finally were overwhelmed by a horrible thick silence several dogs guards guards barked somewhere in the night a baby started crying ssshh hissed nobby well it is all well isnt it said carrot it wont be if you keep on ringing that bloody bell give it here i dont understand said carrot look ive got this book mr varneshi gave me he fumbled for the laws and ordinances nobby glanced at them and shrugged never heard of em he said now just shut up your row you dont want to go making a din like that you could attract all sorts come on this way he grabbed carrots arm and bustled him along the street what sorts protested carrot as he was pushed determinedly forward bad sorts muttered nobby but were the watchl damn right and we dont want to go tangling with people like that remember what happened to gaskin i dont remember what happened to gaskin said carrot totally bewildered whos gaskin before your time mumbled nobby he deflated a bit poor bugger could of happened to any of us he looked up and glared at carrot now stop all this you hear its getting on my nerves moonlight bloody chases my bum he stalked along the street nobbys normal method of locomotion was a kind of sidle and the combination of stalking and sidling at the same time created a strange effect like a crab limping but but said carrot in this book it says i dont want to know from no book growled nobby carrot looked utterly crestfallen but its the law he began he was nearly terminally interrupted by an axe that whirred out of a low doorway beside him and bounced off the opposite wall it was followed by sounds of splintering timber and breaking glass hey nobby said carrot urgently theres a fight going on nobby glanced at the doorway ocourse there is he said its a dwarf bar worst kind you keep out of there kid them little buggers like to trip you up and then kick twelve kinds of shit out of you you come along onobby and hell terry pratchett he grabbed carrots treetrunk arm it was like trying to tow a building carrot had gone pale dwarfs drinking and fighting he said you bet said nobby all the time and they use the kind of language i wouldnt even use to my own dear mother you dont want to mix it with them theyre a poisonous bunch of dont go in therel noone knows why dwarfs who at home in the mountains lead quiet orderly lives forget it all when they move to the big city something comes over even the most blameless ironore miner and prompts him to wear chainmail all the time carry an axe change his name to something like grabthroat shinkicker and drink himself into surly oblivion its probably because they do live such quiet and orderly lives back home after all probably the first thing a young dwarf wants to do when he hits the big city after seventy years of working for his father at the bottom of a pit is have a big drink and then hit someone the fight was one of those enjoyable dwarfish fights with about a hundred participants and one hundred and fifty alliances the screams oaths and the ringing of axes on iron helmets mingled with the sounds of a drunken group by the fireplace who another dwarfish custom were singing about gold nobby bumped into the back of carrot who was watching the scene with horror look its like this every night in here said nobby dont interfere thats what the sergeant says its their ethnic folkways or somethin you dont go messin with ethnic folkways but but carrot stuttered these are my people sort of its shameful acting like this what must everyone think we think theyre mean little buggers said nobby now come on but carrot had waded into the scuffling mass he cupped his hands around his mouth and bellowed something in a language nobby didnt understand practically any language including his guards guards native one would have fitted that description but in this case it was dwarfish grduzk grduzk aakzt ezem ke burk tze tzim the fighting stopped a hundred bearded faces glared up at carrots stooped figure their annoyance mingled with surprise a battered tankard bounced off his breastplate carrot reached down and picked up a struggling figure without apparent effort juk ydtruztrudeztuza hudrzd dezek drezhuk huzukrukt btduzgkek meek btduz t betk kcedrutk kehktd aadbthuk no dwarf had ever heard so many old tongue words from the mouth of anyone over four feet high they were astonished carrot lowered the offending dwarf to the floor there were tears in his eyes youre dwarfs he said dwarfs shouldnt be acting like this look at you all arent you ashamed one hundred bonehard jaws dropped i mean look at you carrot shook his head can you imagine what your poor whitebearded old mother slaving away back in her little hole wondering how her son is getting on tonight can you imagine what shed think if she saw you now your own dear mothers who first showed you how to use a pickaxe nobby standing by the doorway in terror and amazement was aware of a growing chorus of noseblowings and muffled sobs as carrot went on shes probably thinking i expect hes having a quiet game of dominoes or something a nearby dwarf wearing a helmet encrusted with sixinch spikes started to cry gently into his beer and i bet its a long time since any of you wrote her a letter too and you promised to write every week lit good day good day what is all of this that is going on here listen sunshine litthe stare of the great hot eye in the sky whose fiery gaze penetrates the mouth of the cavern i dont want to have to give anyone a smacking so if you play btduz with me ill play btduz with you okay a popular dwarfish game which consists of standing a few feet apart and throwing large rocks at one anothers head lit all correctly beamed and propped terry pratchett nobby absentmindedly took out a grubby handkerchief and passed it to a dwarf who was leaning against the wall shaking with grief now then said carrot kindly i dont want to be hard on anyone but i shall be coming past here every night from now on and i shall expect to see proper standards of dwarf behaviour i know what its like when youre far from home but theres no excuse for this sort of thing he touched his helmet ghruk tuk he gave them all a bright smile and halfwalked halfcrouched out of the bar as he emerged into the street nobby tapped him on the arm dont you ever do anything like that to me again he fumed youre in the city watch dont give me any more of this law business but it is very important said carrot seriously trotting after nobby as he sidled into a narrower street not as important as stayin in one piece said nobby dwarf bars if youve got any sense my lad youll come in here and shut up carrot stared up at the building they had reached it was set back a little from the mud of the street the sounds of considerable drinking were coming from inside a battered sign hung over the door it showed a drum a tavern is it said carrot thoughtfully open at this hour dont see why not said nobby pushing open the door damn useful idea the mended drum and more drinking carrot thumbed hastily through the book i hope so said nobby he nodded to the troll which was employed by the drum as a splattert evenin detritus just showing the new lad the ropes the troll grunted and waved a crusted arm the inside of the mended drum is now legendary as the most famous disreputable tavern on the discworld and such a feature evening all t like a bouncer but trolls use more force guards guards of the city that after recent unavoidable redecorations the new owner spent days recreating the original patina of dirt soot and less identifiable substances on the walls and imported a ton of prerotted rushes for the floor the drinkers were the usual bunch of heroes cut throats mercenaries desperadoes and villains and only microscopic analysis could have told which was which thick coils of smoke hung in the air perhaps to avoid touching the walls the conversation dipped fractionally as the two guards wandered in and then rose to its former level a couple of cronies waved to nobby he realised that carrot was busy what you doin he said and no talkin about mothers right im taking notes said carrot grimly ive got a notebook thats the ticket said nobby youll like this place i comes here every night for my supper how do you spell contravention said carrot turning over a page i dont said nobby pushing through the crowds a rare impulse to generosity lodged in his mind what dyou want to drink i dont think that would be very appropriate said carrot anyway strong drink is a mocker he was aware of a penetrating stare in the back of his neck and turned and looked into the big bland and gentle face of an orangutan it was seated at the bar with a pint mug and a bowl of peanuts in front of it it tilted its glass amicably towards carrot and then drank deeply and noisily by apparently forming its lower lip into a sort of prehensile funnel and making a noise like a canal being drained carrot nudged nobby theres a monk he began dont say it said nobby urgently dont say the word its the librarian works up at the university always comes down here for a nightcap of an evening and people dont object why should they said nobby he always stands his round just like everyone else terry pratchett carrot turned and looked at the ape again a number of questions pressed for attention such as where does it keep its money the librarian caught his gaze misinterpreted it and gently pushed the bowl of peanuts towards him carrot pulled himself to his full impressive height and consulted his notebook the afternoon spent reading the laws and ordinances had been well spent who is the owner proprietor lessee or landlord of these premises he said to nobby wassat said the small guard landlord well i suppose charley here is in charge tonight why he indicated a large heavyset man whose face was a net of scars its owner paused in the act of spreading the dirt more evenly around some glasses by means of a damp cloth and gave carrot a conspiratorial wink charley this is carrot said nobby hes stopping along of rosie palms what every night said charley carrot cleared his throat if you are in charge he intoned then it is my duty to inform you that you are under arrest a rest of what friend said charley still polishing under arrest said carrot with a view to the presentation of charges to whit ixi that on or about th grune at a place called the mended drum filigree street you did a serve or b did cause to serve alcoholic beverages after the hours of midnight contrary to the provisions of the public ale houses act of and ixii on or about th grune at a place called the mended drum filigree street you did serve or did cause to serve alcoholic beverages in containers other than of a size and capacity laid down by aforesaid act and xi that on or about th grune at a place called the mended drum filigree street you did allow customers to carry unsheathed edge weapons of a length greater than inches contrary to section three of said act and xii that on or about th grune at a place called the mended drum filigree street you did serve alcoholic beverages in premises apparently unlicensed for the sale andor consumption of said beverages contrary to section three of the aforesaid act there was dead silence as carrot turned over another page and went on it is also my duty to inform you that it is my intention guards guards to lay evidence before the justices with a view to the consideration of charges under the public foregatherings act the licensed premises acts of er and through and also he glanced sideways at the librarian who knew trouble when he heard it coming and was hurriedly trying to finish his drink the domestic and domesticated animals act the silence that followed held a rare quality of breathless anticipation as the assembled company waited to see what would happen next charley carefully put down the glass whose smears had been buffed up to a brilliant shine and looked down at nobby nobby was endeavouring to pretend that he was totally alone and had no connection whatsoever with anyone who might be standing next to him and coincidentally wearing an identical uniform whatd he mean justices he said to nobby there aint no justices nobby gave a terrified shrug new is he said charley make it easy on yourself said carrot this is nothing personal you understand said charley to nobby its just a wossname had a wizard in here the other night talking about it sort of bendy educational thing you know he appeared to think for a moment learning curve that was it its a learning curve detritus get your big stony arse over here a moment generally about this time in the mended drum someone throws a glass and in fact this now happened captain vimes ran up short street the longest in the city which shows the famous morpork subtle sense of humour in a nutshell with sergeant colon stumbling along behind protesting nobby was outside the drum hopping from one foot to another in times of danger he had a way of propelling himself from place to place without apparently moving through the intervening terry pratchett space which could put any ordinary matter transporter to shame es fighting in there he stuttered grabbing the captains arm all by himself said the captain no with everyone shouted nobby hopping from one foot to the other oh conscience said theres three of you hes wearing the same uniform hes one of your men remember poor old gaskin another part of his brain the hated despicable part which had nevertheless enabled him to survive in the guards these past ten years said its rude to butt in well wait until hes finished and then ask him if he wants any assistance besides it isnt watch policy to interfere in fights its a lot simpler to go in afterwards and arrest anyone recumbent there was a crash as a nearby window burst outwards and deposited a stunned fighter on the opposite side of the street i think said the captain carefully that wed better take prompt action thats right said sgt colon a man could get hurt standing here they sidled cautiously a little way down the street where the sound of splintering wood and breaking glass wasnt so overpowering and carefully avoided one anothers eyes there was the occasional scream from within the tavern and every now and again a mysterious ringing noise as though someone was hitting a gong with their knee they stood in a little pool of embarrassed silence you had your holidays this year sergeant said captain vimes eventually rocking back and forth on his heels yessir sent the wifeto quirm last month sir to see her aunt very nice at this time of year im told yessir all the geraniums and whatnot a figure tumbled out of an upper window and crumpled on the cobbles thats where theyve got the floral sundial isnt it said the captain desperately yessir very nice sir all done with little flowers sir there was a sound like something hitting something else guards guards repeatedly with something heavy and wooden vimes winced i dont think hed of been happy in the watch sir said the sergeant in a kindly voice the door of the mended drum had been torn off during riots so often that speciallytempered hinges had recently been installed and the fact that the next tremendous crash tore the whole door and doorframe out of the wall only showed that quite a lot of money had been wasted a figure in the midst of the wreckage tried to raise itself on its elbows groaned and slumped back well it would seem that its all the captain began and nobby said its that bloody troll what said vimes its the troll the one they have on the door they advanced with extreme caution it was indeed detritus the splatter it is very difficult to hurt a creature that is to all intents and purposes a mobile stone someone seemed to have managed it though the fallen figure was groaning like a couple of bricks being crushed together thats a turnup for the books said the sergeant vaguely all three of them turned and peered at the brightlylit rectangle where the doorway had been things had definitely quietened down a bit in there you dont think said the sergeant that hes winning do you the captain thrust out his jaw we owe it to our colleague and fellow officer he said to find out there was a whimper from behind them they turned and saw nobby hopping on one leg and clutching a foot whats up with you man said vimes nobby made agonised noises sergeant colon began to understand although cautious obsequiousness was the general tenor of watch behaviour there wasnt one member of the entire squad who hadnt at some time been at the wrong end of detrituss fists nobby had merely tried to play catchup in the very best traditions of policemen everywhere he went and kicked him inna rocks sir he said disgraceful said the captain vaguely he hesitated do trolls have rocks he said terry pratchett take it from me sir good grief vimes said dame nature moves in strange ways doesnt she right you are sir said the sergeant obediently and now said the captain drawing his sword forward yessir this means you too sergeant the captain added yessir it was possibly the most circumspect advance in the history of military manoeuvres right down at the bottom end of the scale that things like the charge of the light brigade are at the top of they peered cautiously around the ravished doorway there were a number of people sprawled across the tables or what remained of the tables those who were still conscious looked unhappy about it carrot stood in the middle of the floor his rusty chain mail was torn his helmet was missing he was swaying a little from side to side and one eye was already starting to swell but he recognised the captain dropped the feeblyprotesting customer he was holding and threw a salute beg to report thirtyone offences of making an affray sir and fiftysix cases of riotous behaviour fortyone offences of obstructing an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty thirteen offences of assault with a deadly weapon six cases of malicious lingering and and corporal nobby hasnt even shown me one rope yet he fell backwards breaking a table captain vimes coughed he wasnt at all sure what you were supposed to do next as far as he knew the watch had never been in this position before i think you should get him a drink sergeant he said yessir and get me one too yessir have one yourself why dont you yessir and you corporal will you please what are you doing guards guards searchingthebodiesir said nobby quickly straightening up for incriminating evidence and that in their money pouches nobby thrust his hands behind his back you never know sir he said the sergeant had located a miraculously unbroken bottle of spirits in the wreckage and forced a lot of its contents between carrots lips what we going to do with all this lot captain he said over his shoulder i havent the faintest idea said vimes sitting down the watch jail was just about big enough for six very small people which were usually the only sort to be put in it whereas these he looked around him desperately there was nork the impaler lying under a table and making bubbling noises there was big henri there was grabber simmons one of the most feared barroom fighters in the city all in all there were a lot of people it wouldnt pay to be near when they woke up we could cut their froats sir said nobby veteran of a score of residual battlefields he had found an unconscious fighter who was about the right size and was speculatively removing his boots which looked quite new and about the right size that would be entirely wrong said vimes he wasnt sure how you actually went about cutting a throat it had never hitherto been an option no he said i think perhaps well let them off with a caution there was a groan from under the bench besides he went on quickly we should get our fallen comrade to a place of safety as soon as possible good point said the sergeant he took a swig of the spirits for the sake of his nerves the two of them managed to sling carrot between them and guide his wobbling legs up the steps vimes collapsing under the weight looked around for nobby corporal nobbs he rasped why are you kicking people when theyre down safest way sir said nobby nobby had long ago been told about fighting fair and not terry pratchett guards guards striking a fallen opponent and had then given some creative thought to how these rules applied to someone four feet tall with the muscle tone of an elastic band well stop it i want you to caution the felons said the captain how sir well you captain vimes stopped he was blowed if he knew hed never done it just do it he snapped surely i dont have to tell you everything nobby was left alone at the top of the stairs a general muttering and groaning from the floor indicated that people were waking up nobby thought quickly he shook an admonitory cheesestraw of a finger let that be a lesson to you he said dont do it again and ran for it up in the darkness of the rafters the librarian scratched himself reflectively life was certainly full of surprises he was going to watch developments with interest he shelled a thoughtful peanut with his feet and swung away into the darkness the supreme grand master raised his hands are the thuribles of destiny ritually chastised that evil and loose thinking may be banished from this sanctified circle yep the supreme grand master lowered his hands yep he said yep said brother dunnykin happily done it myself you are supposed to say yea o supreme one said the supreme grand master honestly ive told you enough times if youre not all going to enter into the spirit of the thing yes you listen to what the supreme grand master tells you said brother watchtower glaring at the errant brother i spent hours chastising them thuribles muttered brother dunnykin carry on o supreme grand master said brother watchtower very well then said the grand master tonight well try another experimental summoning i trust you have obtained suitable raw material brothers scrubbed and scrubbed not that you get any thanks all sorted out supreme grand master said brother watchtower it was the grand master conceded a slightly better collection the brothers had certainly been busy pride of place was given to an illuminated tavern sign whose removal the grand master thought should have merited some sort of civic award at the moment the e was a ghastly pink and flashed on and off at random got that said brother watchtower proudly they thought i was mending it or something but i took my screwdriver and i yes well done said the supreme grand master shows initiative thank you supreme grand master beamed brother watchtower knuckles rubbed raw all red and cracked never even got my three dollars back either noone as much as says and now said the supreme grand master taking up the book we will begin to commence shut up brother dunnykin every town in the multiverse has a part that is something like ankhmorporks shades its usually the oldest part its lanes faithfully following the original tracks of medieval cows going down to the river and they have names like the shambles the rookery sniggs alley most of ankhmorpork is like that in any case but the shades was even more so a sort of black hole of bredinthebrickwork lawlessness put it like this even the criminals were afraid to walk the streets the watch didnt set foot in it they were accidentally setting foot in it now not very reliably it had been a trying night and they had been steadying their nerves they were now so steady that all four were relying on the other three to keep them upright and steer captain vimes passed the bottle back to the sergeant terry pratchett guards guards shame on on on he thought for a bit you he said drun in fron of a super super superererer ofisiler the sergeant tried to speak but could only come out with a series of esses put yoursel onna charge said captain vimes rebounding off a wall he glared at the brickwork this wall assaulted me he declared hah think youre tough eh well m a ofisler of of of the law illhaveyouknow and we don take any any any he blinked slowly once or twice whats it we don take any of sarnt he said chances sir said colon no no no sother stuff never mind anyway we don take any of of of it from anyone vague visions were trotting through his mind of a room full of criminal types people that had jeered at him people whose very existence had offended and taunted him for years lying around and groaning he was a little unclear how it had happened but some almost forgotten part of him some much younger vimes with a bright shining breastplate and big hopes a vimes he thought the alcohol had long ago drowned was suddenly restless shallie shallie shallie tell you something sarnt he said sir the four of them bounced gently off another wall and began another slow crabwise waltz across the alley this city this city this city sarnt this city is a is a is a woman sarnt so tis a woman sarnt ancient raddled old beauty sarnt butifyoufallinlovewithher then then then shekicksyouinnateeth s woman said colon he screwed up his sweating face with the effort of thought s eight miles wide sir s gotta river in it lots of of houses and stuff sir he reasoned ah ah ah vimes waggled an unsteady finger at him never never never said it wasa small woman did i be fair he waved the bottle another random thought exploded in the froth of his mind we showed em anyway he said excitedly as the four of them began an oblique shuffle back to the opposite wall showed them dint we taught thema forget they wont lesson inna hurry eh sright said the sergeant but not very enthusiastically he was still wondering about his superior officers sex life but vimes was in the kind of mood that didnt need encouragement hah he shouted at the dark alleyways don like it eh taste of your your your own medicine thingy well now you can bootle in your trems he threw the empty bottle into the air two oclock he yelled and alls weeeellll which was astonishing news to the various shadowy figures who had been silently shadowing the four of them for some time only sheer puzzlement had prevented them making their attentions sharp and plain these people are clearly guards they were thinking theyve got the right helmets and everything and yet here they are in the shades so they were being watched with the fascination that a pack of wolves might focus on a handful of sheep who had not only trotted into the clearing but were making playful butts and baaing noises the outcome was of course going to be mutton but in the meantime inquisitiveness gave a stay of execution carrot raised his muzzy head wherere we he groaned on our way home said the sergeant he looked up at the pitted wormeaten and knifescored sign above them were jus goin down goin down goin down he squinted sweetheart lane sweetheart lane snot on the way home slurred nobby we wouldnt wanta go down sweetheart lane its in the shades catch us goin down sweetheart lane there was a crowded moment in which realisation did the icy work of a good nights sleep and several pints of black coffee the three of them by unspoken agreement clustered up towards carrot what we gonna do captain said colon er we could call for help said the captain uncertainly what here youve got a point i reckon we must of turned left out of silver street instead of right quavered nobby well thats one mistake we wont make again in a hurry said the captain then he wished he hadnt terry pratchett guards guards they could hear footsteps somewhere off to their left there was a snigger we must form a square said the captain they all tried to form a point hey what was that said sergeant colon what there it was again sort of a leathery sound captain vimes tried not to think about hoods and garrotting there were he knew many gods there was a god for every trade there was a beggars god a whores goddess a thieves god probably even an assassins god he wondered whether there was somewhere in that vast pantheon a god who would look kindly on hardpressed and fairly innocent lawenforcement officers who were quite definitely about to die there probably wasnt he thought bitterly something like that wasnt stylish enough for gods catch any god worrying about any poor sod trying to do his best for a handful of dollars a month not them gods went overboard for smart bastards whose idea of a days work was prising the ruby eye of the earwig king out of its socket not for some unimaginative sap who just pounded the pavement every night more sort of slithery said the sergeant who liked to get things right and then there was a sound perhaps a volcanic sound or the sound of a boiling geyser but at any rate a long dry roar of a sound like the bellows in the forges of the titans but it was not so bad as the light which was bluewhite and the sort of light to print the pattern of your eyeballs blood vessels on the back of the inside of your skull they both went on for hundreds of years and then instantly stopped the dark aftermath was filled with purple images and once the ears regained an ability to hear a faint clinkery sound the guards remained perfectly still for some time well well said the captain weakly after a further pause he said very clearly every consonant slotting perfectly into place sergeant take some men and investigate that will you investigate what sir said colon but it had already dawned on the captain that if the sergeant took some men it would leave him captain vimes all alone no ive a better idea well all go he said firmly they all went now that their eyes were used to the darkness they could see an indistinct red glow ahead of them it turned out to be a wall cooling rapidly bits of calcined brickwork were falling off as they contracted making little pinging noises that wasnt the worst bit the worst bit was what was on the wall they stared at it they stared at it for a long time it was only an hour or two till dawn and noone even suggested trying to find their way back in the dark they waited by the wall at least it was warm they tried not to look at it eventually colon stretched uneasily and said chin up captain it could have been worse vimes finished the bottle it didnt have any effect there were some types of sobriety that you just couldnt budge yes he said it could have been us the supreme grand master opened his eyes once again he said we have achieved success the brethren burst into a ragged cheer the brothers watchtower and fingers linked arms and danced an enthusiastic jig in their magic circle the supreme grand master took a deep breath first the carrot he thought and now the stick he liked the stick silence he screamed brother fingers brother watchtower cease this shameful display he screeched the rest of you be silent they quietened down like rowdy children who have just seen the teacher come into the room then they quietened down a lot more like children who have just seen the teachers expression terry pratchett guards guards the supreme grand master let this sink in and then stalked along their ragged ranks i suppose he said that we think weve done some magic do we hmm brother watchtower brother watchtower swallowed well er you said we were er i mean you havent done anythingyet well er no er brother watchtower trembled do real wizards leap about after a tiny spell and start chanting here we go here we go here we go brother watchtower hmm well we were sort of the supreme grand master spun on his heel and do they keep looking apprehensively at the woodwork brother plasterer brother plasterer hung his head he hadnt realised anyone had noticed when the tension was twanging satisfactorily like a bowstring the supreme grand master stood back why do i bother he said shaking his head i could have chosen anyone i could have picked the best but ive got a bunch of children er honest said brother watchtower we was making an effort i mean we was really concentrating werent we lads yes they chorused the supreme grand master glared at them theres no room in this brotherhood for brothers who are not behind us all the way he warned with almost visible relief the brethren like panicked sheep who see that a hurdle has been opened in the fold galloped towards the opening no worries about that your supremity said brother watchtower fervently commitment must be our watchword said the supreme grand master watchword yeah said brother watchtower he nudged brother plasterer whose eyes had strayed to the skirting board again wha oh yeah watchword yeah said brother plasterer and trust and fraternity said the supreme grand master yeah and them too said brother fingers so said the supreme grand master if there be any one here not anxious yea eager to continue in this great work let him step forward now noone moved theyre hooked ye gods im good at this thought the supreme grand master i can play on their horrible little minds like a xylophone its amazing the sheer power of mundanity whod have thought that weakness could be a greater force than strength but you have to know how to direct it and i do very well then he said and now we will repeat the oath he led their stumbling terrified voices through it noting with approval the strangled way they said figgin and he kept one eye on brother fingers too hes slightly brighter than the others he thought slightly less gullible at least better make sure im always the last to leave dont want any clever ideas about following me home you need a special kind of mind to rule a city like ankhmorpork and lord vetinari had it but then he was a special kind of person he baffled and infuriated the lesser merchant princes to the extent that they had long ago given up trying to assassinate him and now merely jockeyed for position amongst themselves anyway any assassin who tried to attack the patrician would be hard put to it to find enough flesh to insert the dagger while other lords dined on larks stuffed with peacocks tongues lord vetinari considered that a glass of boiled water and half a slice of dry bread was an elegant sufficiency it was exasperating he appeared to have no vice that anyone could discover youd have thought with that pale equine face that hed incline towards stuff with whips needles and young women in dungeons the other lords could have accepted that nothing wrong with whips and needles in moderation but the patrician apparently spent his evenings studying reports and on special occasions if he could stand the excitement playing chess he wore black a lot it wasnt particularly impressive black such as the best assassins wore but the sober slightly shabby terry pratchett black of a man who doesnt want to waste time in the mornings wondering what to wear and you had to get up very early in the morning to get the better of the patrician in fact it was wiser not to go to bed at all but he was popular in a way under his hand for the first time in a thousand years ankhmorpork operated it might not be fair or just or particularly democratic but it worked he tended it as one tends a topiary bush encouraging a growth here pruning an errant twig there it was said that he would tolerate absolutely anything apart from anything that threatened the city and here it was he stared at the stricken wall for a long time while the rain dripped off his chin and soaked his clothes behind him wonse hovered nervously then one long thin blueveined hand reached out and the fingertips traced the shadows well not so much shadows more a series of silhouettes the outline was very distinct inside there was the familiar pattern of brickwork outside though something had fused the wall in a rather nice ceramic substance giving the ancient flettons a melted mirrorlike finish the shapes outlined in brickwork showed a tableau of six men frozen in an attitude of surprise various upraised hands had quite clearly been holding knives and cutlasses the patrician looked down silently on the pile of ash at his feet a few streaks of molten metal might once have been the very same weapons that were now so decisively etched into the wall hmm he said captain vimes respectfully led him across the lane and into fast luck alley where he pointed out exhibit a to whit footprints he said which is stretching it a bit sir theyre more what youd call claws one might go so far as to say talons the patrician stared at the prints in the mud his expression was quite unreadable and mime artists it was a strange aversion but there you are anyone in baggy trousers and a white face who tried to ply their art anywhere within ankhs crumbling walls would very quickly find themselves in a scorpion pit on one wall of which was painted the advice learn the words guards guards i see he said eventually and do you have an opinion about all this captain the captain did in the hours until dawn hed had all sorts of opinions starting with a conviction that it had been a big mistake to be born and then the grey light had filtered even into the shades and he was still alive and uncooked and had looked around him with an expression of idiot relief and seen not a yard away these footprints that had not been a good moment to be sober well sir he said i know that dragons have been extinct for thousands of years sir yes the patricians eyes narrowed vimes plunged on but sir the thing is do they know sergeant colon said he heard a leathery sound just before just before just before the er offence so you think an extinct and indeed a possibly entirely mythical dragon flew into the city landed in this narrow alley incinerated a group of criminals and then flew away said the patrician one might say it was a very publicspirited creature well when you put it like that if i recall the dragons of legend were solitary and rural creatures who shunned people and dwelt in forsaken out of the way places said the patrician they were hardly urban creatures no sir said the captain repressing a comment that if you wanted to find a really forsaken out of the way place then the shades would fit the bill pretty well besides said lord vetinari one would imagine that someone would have noticed wouldnt you agree the captain nodded at the wall and its dreadful frieze apart from them you mean sir in my opinion said lord vetinari its some kind of warfare possibly a rival gang has hired a wizard a little local difficulty could be linked to all this strange thieving sir volunteered wonse but theres the footprints sir said vimes doggedly were close to the river said the patrician possibly it was perhaps a wading bird of some sort a mere coincidence he added but i should cover them over if i were you we dont want terry pratchett people getting the wrong idea and jumping to silly conclusions do we he added sharply vimes gave in as you wish sir he said looking at his sandals the patrician patted him on the shoulder never mind he said carry on good show of initiative that man patrolling in the shades too well done he turned and almost walked into the wall of chain mail that was carrot to his horror captain vimes saw his newest recruit point politely to the patricians coach around it fullyarmed and wary were six members of the palace guard who straightened up and took a wary interest vimes disliked them intensely they had plumes on their helmets he hated plumes on a guard he heard carrot say excuse me sir is this your coach sir and the patrician looked him blankly up and down and said it is who are you young man carrot saluted lanceconstable carrot sir carrot carrot that name rings a bell lupine wonse who had been hovering behind him whispered in the patricians ear his face brightened ah the young thieftaker a little error there i think but commendable no person is above the law eh no sir said carrot commendable commendable said the patrician and now gentlemen about your coach sir said carrot doggedly i couldnt help noticing that the front offside wheel contrary to the hes going to arrest the patrician vimes told himself the thought trickling through his brain like an icy rivulet hes actually going to arrest the patrician the supreme ruler hes going to arrest him this is what hes actually going to do the boy doesnt know the meaning of the word fear oh wouldnt it be a good idea if he knew the meaning of the word survival and i cant get my jaw muscles to move were all dead or worse were all detained at the patricians pleasure and as we all know hes seldom that pleased it was at this precise moment that sergeant colon earned himself a metaphorical medal lanceconstable carrot he shouted attention lance guards guards constable carrot abouuta turna lanceconstable carrot quiuck marcha carrot brought himself to attention like a barn being raised and stared straight ahead with a ferocious expression of acute obedience well done that man said the patrician thoughtfully as carrot strode stiffly away carry on captain and do come down heavily on any silly rumours about dragons right yes sir said captain vimes good man the coach rattled off the bodyguard running alongside behind him captain vimes was only vaguely aware of the sergeant yelling at the retreating carrot to stop he was thinking he looked at the prints in the mud he used his regulation pike which he knew was exactly seven feet long to measure their size and the distance between them he whistled under his breath then with considerable caution he followed the alley around the corner it led to a small padlocked and dirtencrusted door in the back of a timber warehouse there was something very wrong he thought the prints come out of the alley but they dont go in and we dont often get any wading birds in the ankh mainly because the pollution would eat their legs away and anyway its easier for them to walk on the surface he looked up a myriad washing lines crisscrossed the narrow rectangle of the sky as efficiently as a net so he thought something big and fiery came out of this alley but didnt come into it and the patrician is very worried about it ive been told to forget about it he noticed something else at the side of the alley and bent down and picked up a fresh empty peanut shell he tossed it from hand to hand staring at nothing right now he needed a drink but perhaps it ought to wait terry pratchett the librarian knuckled his way urgently along the dark aisles between the slumbering bookshelves the rooftops of the city belonged to him oh assassins and thieves might make use of them but hed long ago found the forest of chimneys buttresses gargoyles and weathervanes a convenient and somehow comforting alternative to the streets at least up until now it had seemed amusing and instructive to follow the watch into the shades an urban jungle which held no fears for a lb ape but now the nightmare he had seen while brachiating across a dark alley would if he had been human have made him doubt the evidence of his own eyes as an ape he had no doubts whatsoever about his eyes and believed them all the time right now he wanted to concentrate them urgently on a book that might hold a clue it was in a section noone bothered with much these days the books in there were not really magical dust lay accusingly on the floor dust with footprints in it oook said the librarian in the warm gloom he proceeded cautiously now realising with a sense of inevitability that the footprints seemed to have the same destination in mind as he did he turned a corner and there it was the section the bookcase the shelf the gap there are many horrible sights in the multiverse somehow though to a soul attuned to the subtle rhythms of a library there are few worse sights than a hole where a book ought to be someone had stolen a book in the privacy of the oblong office his personal sanctum the patrician paced up and down he was dictating a stream of instructions and send some men to paint that wall he finished lupine wonse raised an eyebrow guards guards is that wise sir he said you dont think a frieze of ghastly shadows will cause comment and speculation said the patrician sourly not as much as fresh paint in the shades said wonse evenly the patrician hesitated a moment good point he snapped have some men demolish it he reached the end of the room spun on his heel and stalked up it again dragons as if there were not enough important enough real things to take up his time do you believe in dragons he said wonse shook his head theyre impossible sir so ive heard said lord vetinari he reached the opposite wall turned would you like me to investigate further said wonse yes do so and i shall ensure the watch take great care said wonse the patrician stopped his pacing the watch the watch my dear chap the watch are a bunch of incompetents commanded by a drunkard its taken me years to achieve it the last thing we need to concern ourselves with is the watch he thought for a moment ever seen a dragon wonse one of the big ones i mean oh theyre impossible you said theyre just legend really superstition said wonse hmm said the patrician and the thing about legends of course is that they are legendary exactly sir even so the patrician paused and stared at wonse for some time oh well he said sort it out im not having any of this dragon business its the type of thing that makes people restless put a stop to it when he was alone he stood and looked out gloomily over the twin city it was drizzling again ankhmorpork brawling city of a hundred thousand souls and as the patrician privately observed ten times that number of actual people the fresh rain glistened on the panorama of towers and rooftops all unaware of the teeming rancorous world it was dropping into luckier rain fell on upland sheep or whispered gently over forests or pattered somewhat incestuously into the sea rain that fell on ankhmorpork though was rain that was in trouble they did terrible things to water in ankh terry pratchett morpork being drunk was only the start of its problems the patrician liked to feel that he was looking out over a city that worked not a beautiful city or a renowned city or a welldrained city and certainly not an architecturally favoured city even its most enthusiastic citizens would agree that from a high point of vantage ankhmorpork looked as though someone had tried to achieve in stone and wood an effect normally associated with the pavements outside allnight takeaways but it worked it spun along cheerfully like a gyroscope on the lip of a catastrophe curve and this the patrician firmly believed was because no one group was ever powerful enough to push it over merchants thieves assassins wizards all competed energetically in the race without really realising that it neednt be a race at all and certainly not trusting one another enough to stop and wonder who had marked out the course and was holding the starting flag the patrician disliked the word dictator it affronted him he never told anyone what to do he didnt have to that was the wonderful part a large part of his life consisted of arranging matters so that this state of affairs continued of course there were various groups seeking his overthrow and this was right and proper and the sign of a vigorous and healthy society noone could call him unreasonable about the matter why hadnt he founded most of them himself and what was so beautiful was the way in which they spent nearly all their time bickering with one another human nature the patrician always said was a marvellous thing once you understood where its levers were he had an unpleasant premonition about this dragon business if ever there was a creature that didnt have any obvious levers it was a dragon it would have to be sorted out the patrician didnt believe in unnecessary cruelty he did not believe in pointless revenge but he was a great believer in the need for things to be sorted out funnily enough captain vimes was thinking the same thing he found he didnt like the idea of citizens even of the shades being turned into a mere ceramic tint while being bang alongside the idea of necessary cruelty of course guards guards and it had been done in front of the watch more or less as if the watch didnt matter as if the watch was just an irrelevant detail that was what rankled of course it was true that only made it worse what was making him even angrier was that he had disobeyed orders he had scuffed up the tracks certainly but in the bottom drawer of his ancient desk hidden under a pile of empty bottles was a plaster cast he could feel it staring at him through three layers of wood he couldnt imagine what had got into him and now he was going even further out on to the limb he reviewed his for want of a better word troops hed asked the senior pair to turn up in plain clothes this meant that sergeant colon whod worn uniform all his life was looking redfaced and uncomfortable in the suit he wore for funerals whereas nobby i wonder if i made the word plain clear enough said captain vimes its what i wear outside work guv said nobby reproachfully sir corrected sergeant colon my voice is in plain clothes too said nobby initiative that is vimes walked slowly around the corporal and your plain clothes do not cause old women to faint and small boys to run after you in the street he said nobby shifted uneasily he wasnt at home with irony no sir guv he said its all the go this style this was broadly true there was a current fad in ankh for big feathered hats ruffs slashed doublets with gold frogging flared pantaloons and boots with ornamental spurs the trouble was vimes reflected that most of the fashionconscious had more body to go between these component bits whereas all that could be said of corporal nobbs was that he was in there somewhere it might be advantageous after all absolutely noone would ever believe when they saw him coming down the street that here was a member of the watch trying to look inconspicuous it occurred to vimes that he knew absolutely nothing about nobbs outside working hours he couldnt even remember where the man lived all these years hed known the man and hed never realised that in his seiiet private life corporal nobbs was a terry pratchett bit of a peacock a very short peacock it was true a peacock that had been hit repeatedly with something heavy perhaps but a peacock nonetheless it just went to show you never could tell he brought his attention back to the business in hand i want you two he said to nobbs and colon to mingle unobtrusively or obtrusively in your case corporal nobbs with people tonight and er see if you can detect anything unusual unusual like what said the sergeant vimes hesitated he wasnt exactly sure himself anything he said pertinent ah the sergeant nodded wisely pertinent right there was an awkward silence maybe people have seen weird things said captain vimes or perhaps there have been unexplained fires or footprints you know he finished desperately signs of dragons you mean like piles of gold what have been slept on said the sergeant and virgins being chained to rocks said nobbs knowingly i can see youre experts sighed vimes just do the best you can this mingling said sergeant colon delicately it would involve going into taverns and drinking and similar would it to a certain extent said vimes ah said the sergeant happily in moderation right you are sir and at your own expense oh but before you go said the captain do either of you know anyone who might know anything about dragons apart from sleeping on gold and the bit with the young women i mean wizards would volunteered nobby apart from wizards said vimes firmly you couldnt trust wizards every guard knew you couldnt trust wizards they were even worse than civilians colon thought about it theres always lady ramkin he said lives in scoone avenue breeds swamp dragons you know the little buggers people keep as pets oh her said vimes gloomily i think ive seen her around the one with the whinny if you love dragons sticker on the back of her carriage guards guards thats her shes mental said sergeant colon what do you want me to do sir said carrot er you have the most important job said vimes hurriedly i want you to stay here and watch the office carrots face broadened in a slow unbelieving grin you mean im left in charge sir he said in a manner of speaking said vimes but youre not allowed to arrest anyone understand he added quickly not even if theyre breaking the law sir not even then just make a note of it ill read my book then said carrot and polish my helmet good boy said the captain it should be safe enough he thought noone ever comes in here not even to report a lost dog noone ever thinks about the watch youd have to be really out of touch to go to the watch for help he thought bitterly scoone avenue was a wide treelined and incredibly select part of ankh high enough above the river to be away from its allpervading smell people in scoone avenue had old money which was supposed to be much better than new money although captain vimes had never had enough of either to spot the difference people in scoone avenue had their own personal bodyguards people in scoone avenue were said to be so aloof they wouldnt even talk to the gods this was a slight slander they would talk to gods if they were wellbred gods of decent family lady ramkins house was not hard to find it commanded an outcrop that gave it a magnificent view of the city if that was your idea of a good time there were stone dragons on the gatepost and the gardens had an unkempt overgrown look statues of ramkins long gone loomed up out of the greenery most of them had swords and were covered in ivy up to the neck vimes sensed that this was not because the gardens owner was too poor to do anything about it but rather that the gardens owner thought there were much more important things than ancestors which was a pretty unusual point of view for an aristocrat they also apparently thought that there were more important terry pratchett things than property repair when he rang the bell of the rather pleasant old house itself in the middle of a flourishing rhododendron forest several bits of the plaster facade fell off that seemed to be the only effect except that something round the back of the house started to howl some things it started to rain again after a while vimes felt the dignity of his position and cautiously edged around the building keeping well back in case anything else collapsed he reached a heavy wooden gate in a heavy wooden wall in contrast with the general decrepitude of the rest of the place it seemed comparatively new and very solid he knocked this caused another fusillade of strange whistling noises the door opened something dreadful loomed over him ah good man do you know anything about mating it boomed it was quiet and warm in the watch house carrot listened to the hissing of sand in the hourglass and concentrated on buffing up his breastplate centuries of tarnish had given up under his cheerful onslaught it gleamed you knew where you were with a shiny breastplate the strangeness of the city where they had all these laws and concentrated on ignoring them was too much for him but a shiny breastplate was a breastplate well shined the door opened he peered across the top of the ancient desk there was noone there he tried a few more industrious rubs there was the vague sound of someone who had got fed up with waiting two purplefingernailed hands grasped the edge of the desk and the librarians face rose slowly into view like an earlymorning coconut oook he said carrot stared it had been explained to him carefully that contrary to appearances laws governing the animal kingdom did not apply to the librarian on the other hand the librarian himself was never very interested in obeying the laws governing the human kingdom either he was one of those little anomalies you have to build around guards guards hallo said carrot uncertainly oook the librarian prodded the desk with a long manyjointed finger what oook sorry the librarian rolled his eyes it was strange he felt that socalled intelligent dogs horses and dolphins never had any difficulty indicating to humans the vital news of the moment eg that the three children were lost in the cave or the train was about to take the line leading to the bridge that had been washed away or similar while he only a handful of chromosomes away from wearing a vest found it difficult to persuade the average human to come in out of the rain you just couldnt talk to some people oook he said and beckoned i cant leave the office said carrot ive had orders the librarians upper lip rolled back like a blind is that a smile said carrot the librarian shook his head someone hasnt committed a crime have they said carrot oook a bad crime oook like murder eeek worse than murder eeekr the librarian knuckled over to the door and bounced up and down urgently carrot gulped orders were orders yes but this was something else the people in this city were capable of anything he buckled on his breastplate screwed his sparkling helmet on to his head and strode towards the door then he remembered his responsibilities he went back to the desk found a scrap of paper and painstakingly wrote out fighting crime pleass call again later thankyou and then he went out on to the streets untarnished and unafraid terry pratchett the supreme grand master raised his arms brethren he said let us begin it was so easy all you had to do was channel that great septic reservoir of jealousy and cringing resentment that the brothers had in such abundance harness their dreadful mundane unpleasantness which had a force greater in its way than roaring evil and then open your own mind into the place where the dragons went vimes found himself grabbed by the arm and pulled inside the heavy door shut behind him with a definite click its lord mountjoy gayscale talonthrust iii of ankh said the apparition which was dressed in huge and fearsomelypadded armour you know i really dont think he can cut the mustard he cant said vimes backing away it really needs two of you it does doesnt it whispered vimes his shoulder blades trying to carve their way out through the fence could you oblige boomed the thing what oh dont be squeamish man you just have to help him up into the air its me who has the tricky part i know its cruel but if he cant manage it tonight then hes for the choppychop survival of the fittest and all that dont you know captain vimes managed to get a grip on himself he was clearly in the presence of some sexcrazed wouldbe murderess insofar as any gender could be determined under the strange lumpy garments if it wasnt female then references to its me who has the tricky part gave rise to mental images that would haunt him for some time to come he knew the rich did things differently but this was going too far madam he said coldly i am an officer of the watch and i must warn you that the course of action you are suggesting breaks the laws of the city and also of several of the more straitlaced gods he added silently and i must advise you that his lordship should be released unharmed immediately the figure stared at him in astonishment why it said its my bloody dragon guards guards have another drink notcorporal nobby said sergeant colon unsteadily i do not mind if i do notsgt colon said nobby they were taking inconspicuosity seriously that ruled out most of the taverns on the morpork side of the river where they were very well known now they were in a rather elegant one in downtown ankh where they were being as unobtrusive as they knew how the other drinkers thought they were some kind of cabaret i was thinking said sgt colon what if we bought a bottle or two we could go home and then wed be really inconspicuous nobby gave this some thought but he said weve got to keep our ears open he said were supposed to what he said detect anything we can do that at my house said sgt colon we could listen all night really hard thas a good point said nobby in fact it sounded better and better the more he thought about it but first he announced i got to pay a visit me too said the sergeant this detecting business gets to you after a while doesnt it they stumbled out into the alley behind the tavern there was a full moon up but a few rags of scruffy cloud were drifting across it the pair inconspicuously bumped into one another in the darkness is that you detector sergeant colon said nobby thas right now can you detect the door to the privy detector corporal nobbs were looking for a short dark door of mean appearance ahahaha there were a couple of clanks and a muffled swearword from nobby as he staggered across the alley followed by a yowl when one of ankhmorporks enormous population of feral cats fled between his legs who loves you pussycat said nobby under his breath needs must then said sgt colon and faced a handy corner his private musings were interrupted by a grunt from the corporal you there sgt terry pratchett detector sergeant to you nobby said sgt colon pleasantly nobbys tone was urgent and suddenly very sober dont piss about sergeant i just saw a dragon fly over ive seen a horsefly said sgt colon hiccuping gently and ive seen a housefly ive even seen a greenfly but i aint never seen a dragon fly of course you have you pillock said nobby urgently look im not messing about he had wings on him like like like great big wings sergeant colon turned majestically the corporals face had gone so white that it showed up in the darkness honest sergeant sgt colon turned his eyes to the damp sky and the rainwashed moon all right he said show me there was a slithering noise behind him and a couple of roof tiles smashed on to the street he turned and there on the roof was the dragon theres a dragon on the roof he warbled nobby its a dragon on the roof what shall i do nobby theres a dragon on the roof its looking right at me nobby for a start you could do your trousers up said nobby from behind the nearest wall even shorn of her layers of protective clothing lady sybil ramkin was still toweringly big vimes knew that the barbarian hublander folk had legends about great chainmailed armourbrad carthorseriding maidens who swooped down on battlefields and carried off dead warriors on their cropper to a glorious roistering afterlife while singing in a pleasing mezzosoprano lady ramkin could have been one of them she could have led them she could have carried off a battalion when she spoke every word was like a hearty slap on the back and clanged with the aristocratic selfassurance of the totally wellbred the vowel sounds alone would have cut teak vimess ragged forebears were used to voices like that usually from heavilyarmoured people on the back of a war charger telling them why it would be a jolly good idea dontcherknow to guards guards charge the enemy and hit them for six his legs wanted to stand to attention prehistoric men would have worshipped her and in fact had amazingly managed to carve lifelike statues of her thousands of years ago she had a mass of chestnut hair a wig vimes learned later noone who had much to do with dragons kept their own hair for long she also had a dragon on her shoulder it had been introduced as talonthrust vincent wonderkind of quirm referred to as vinny and seemed to be making a large contribution to the unusual chemical smell that pervaded the house this smell permeated everything even the generous slice of cake she offered him tasted of it the er shoulderit looksvery nice he said desperate to make conversation rubbish said her ladyship im just training him up because shouldersitters fetch twice the price vimes murmured that he had occasionally seen society ladies with small colourful dragons on their shoulders and thought it looked very er nice oh it sounds nice she said ill grant you then they realise it means sootburns frizzled hair and crap all down their back those talons dig in too and then they think the things getting too big and smelly and next thing you know its either down to the morpork sunshine sanctuary for lost dragons or the old heaveho into the river with a rope round your neck poor little buggers she sat down arranging a skirt that could have made sails for a small fleet now then captain vimes was it vimes was at a loss ramkins longdead stared down at him from ornate frames high on the shadowy walls between around and under the portraits were the weapons theyd presumably used and had used well and often by the look of them suits of armour stood in dented ranks along the walls quite a number he couldnt help noticing had large holes in them the ceiling was a faded riot of motheaten banners you did not need forensic examination to understand that lady ramkins ancestors had never shirked a fight it was amazing that she was capable of doing something so unwarlike as having a cup of tea my forebears she said following his hypnotised gaze you terry pratchett know not one ramkin in the last thousand years has died in his bed yes maam source of family pride that yes maam quite a few of them have died in other peoples of course captain vimess teacup rattled in its saucer yes maam he said captain is such a dashing title ive always thought she gave him a bright brittle smile i mean colonels and so on are always so stuffy majors are pompous but one always feels somehow that there is something delightfully dangerous about a captain what was it you had to show me vimes gripped his parcel like a chastity belt i wondered he faltered how big swamper he stopped something dreadful was happening to his lower regions lady ramkin followed his gaze oh take no notice of him she said cheerfully hit him with a cushion if hes a bother a small elderly dragon had crawled out from under his chair and placed its jowly muzzle in vimess lap it stared up at him soulfully with big brown eyes and gently dribbled something quite corrosive by the feel of it over his knees and it stank like the ring around an acid bath thats dewdrop mabelline talonthrust the first said her ladyship champion and sire of champions no fire left now poor soppy old thing he likes his belly rubbed vimes made surreptitiously vicious jerking motions to dislodge the old dragon it blinked mournfully at him with rheumy eyes and rolled back the corner of its mouth exposing a picket fence of sootblackened teeth just push him off if hes a nuisance said lady ramkin cheerfully now then what was it you were asking i was wondering how big swamp dragons grow said vimes trying to shift position there was a faint growling noise you came all the way up here to ask me that well i seem to recall gayheart talonthrust of ankh stood fourteen thumbs high toe to matlock mused lady ramkin er about three foot six inches she added kindly guards guards no bigger than that said vimes hopefully in his lap the old dragon began to snore gently golly no he was a bit of a freak actually mostly they dont get much bigger than eight thumbs captain vimess lips moved in hurried calculation two feet he ventured well done thats the cobbs of course the hens are a bit smaller captain vimes wasnt going to give in a cobb would be a male dragon he said only after the age of two years said lady ramkin triumphantly up to the age of eight months hes a pewmet then hes a cock until fourteen months and then hes a snood captain vimes sat entranced eating the horrible cake britches gradually dissolving as the stream of information flooded over him how the males fought with flame but in the laying season only the hens breathed fire from the combustion of complex intestinal gases to incubate the eggs which needed such a fierce temperature while the males gathered firewood a group of swamp dragons was a slump or an embarrassment a female was capable of laying up to three clutches of four eggs every year most of which were trodden on by absentminded males and that dragons of both sexes were vaguely uninterested in one another and indeed everything except firewood except for about once every two months when they became as singleminded as a buzzsaw he was helpless to prevent himself being taken out to the kennels at the back outfitted from neck to ankle in leather armour faced with steel plates and ushered into the long low building where the whistling had come from the temperature was terrible but not as bad as the cocktail of smells he staggered aimlessly from one metallined pen to another while pearshaped squeaking little horrors with red eyes were introduced as moonpenny duchess marchpaine whos gravid at the moment and moonmist talonthrust ii who was best of breed at pseudopolis last year jets of pale green flame played across his knees only until their third clutch of course after that theyre dams terry pratchett many of the stalls had rosettes and certificates pinned over them and this one im afraid is goodboy bindle featherstone of quirm said lady ramkin relentlessly vimes stared groggily over the charred barrier at the small creature curled up in the middle of the floor it bore about the same resemblance to the rest of them as nobby did to the average human being something in its ancestry had given it a pair of eyebrows that were about the same size as its stubby wings which could never have supported it in the air its head was the wrong shape like an anteater it had nostrils like jet intakes if it ever managed to get airborne the things would have the drag of twin parachutes it was also turning on captain vimes the most silently intelligent look hed ever had from any animal including corporal nobbs it happens said lady ramkin sadly its all down to genes you know it is said vimes somehow the creature seemed to be concentrating all the power its siblings wasted in flame and noise into a stare like a thermic lance he couldnt help remembering how much hed wanted a puppy when he was a little boy mind you theyd been starving anything with meat on it would have done he heard the dragon lady say one tries to breed for a good flame depth of scale correct colour and so on one just has to put up with the occasional total whittle the little dragon turned on vimes a gaze that would be guaranteed to win it the award for dragon the judges would most like to take home and use as a portable gas lighter total whittle vimes thought he wasnt sure of the precise meaning of the word but he could hazard a shrewd guess it sounded like whatever it was you had left when you had extracted everything of any value whatsoever like the watch he thought total whittles every one of them and just like him it was the saga of his life thats nature for you said her ladyship of course i wouldnt dream of breeding from him but he wouldnt be able to anyway why not said vimes guards guards because dragons have to mate in the air and hell never be able to fly with those wings im afraid ill be sorry to lose the bloodline naturally his sire was brenda rodleys treebite brightscale do you know brenda er no said vimes lady ramkin was one of those people who assumed that everyone else knew everyone one knew charming gel anyway his brothers and sisters are shaping up very well poor little bastard thought vimes thats nature for you in a nutshell always dealing off the bottom of the pack no wonder they call her a mother you said you had something to show me lady ramkin prompted vimes wordlessly handed her the parcel she slipped off her heavy mittens and unwrapped it plaster cast of a footprint she said baldly well does it remind you of anything said vimes could be a wading bird oh vimes was crestfallen lady ramkin laughed or a really big dragon got it out of a museum did you no i got it off the street this morning ha someones been playing tricks on you old chap er there was er circumstantial evidence he told her she stared at him draco nobilis she said hoarsely pardon said vimes draco nobilis the noble dragon as opposed to these fellows she waved a hand in the direction of the massed ranks of whistling lizards draco vulgaris the lot of them but the big ones are all gone you know this really is a nonsense no two ways about it all gone beautiful things they were weighed tons biggest things ever to fly noone knows how they did it and then they realised it was suddenly very quiet all along the rows of kennels the dragons were silent brighteyed and watchful they were staring at the roof terry pratchett carrot looked around him shelves stretched away in every direction on those shelves books he made a calculated guess this is the library isnt it he said the librarian maintained his gentle but firm grip on the boys hand and led him along the maze of aisles is there a body said carrot thered have to be worse than murder a body in a library it could lead to anything the ape eventually padded to a halt in front of a shelf no different than it seemed a hundred others some of the books were chained up there was a gap the librarian pointed to it oook well what about it a hole where a book should be oook a book has been taken a book has been taken you summoned the watch carrot drew himself up proudly because someones taken a book you think thats worse than murder the librarian gave him the kind of look other people would reserve for people who said things like whats so bad about genocide this is practically a criminal offence wasting watch time said carrot why dont you just tell the head wizards or whoever they are oook the librarian indicated with some surprisingly economical gestures that most wizards would not find their own bottoms with both hands well i dont see what we can do about it said carrot whats the book called the librarian scratched his head this one was going to be tricky he faced carrot put his leatherglove hands together then folded them open i know its a book whats its name the librarian sighed and held up a hand four words said carrot first word the ape pinched two wrinkled fingers together small word a the fo oook the the second wordthird word small word the a to of fro of of the something of something second word what oh first syllable fingers touching your fingers thumbs guards guards the orangutan growled and tugged theatrically at one large hairy ear oh sounds like fingers hand adding up sums cut off smaller wordsum sum second syllable small very small syllable a in un on on sum on sum on summon summoner summonin summoning summoning the summoning of something this is fun isnt it fourth word whole word he peered intently as the librarian gyrated mysteriously big thing huge big thing flapping great big flapping leaping thing teeth huffing blowing great big huge blowing flapping thing sweat broke out on carrots forehead as he tried obediently to understand sucking fingers sucking fingers thing burnt hot great big hot blowing flapping thing the librarian rolled his eyes homo sapiens you could keep it the great dragon danced and spun and trod the air over the city its colour was moonlight gleaming off its scales sometimes it would twist and glide with deceptive speed over the rooftops for the sheer joy of existing and it was all wrong vimes thought part of him was marvelling at the sheer beauty of the sight but an insistent weaselly little group of brain cells from the wrong side of the synapses was scrawling its graffiti on the walls of wonderment its a bloody great lizard they jeered must weigh tons nothing that big can fly not even on beautiful wings and what is a flying lizard doing with great big scales on its back five hundred feet above him a lance of bluewhite flame roared into the sky it cant do something like that itd burn its own lips off beside him lady ramkin stood with her mouth open behind her the little caged dragons yammered and howled the great beast turned in the air and swooped over the rooftops the flame darted out again below it yellow flames sprang up it was done so quietly and stylishly that it took vimes several seconds to realise that several buildings had in fact been set on fire golly said lady ramkin look its using the thermals terry pratchett thats what the fire is for she turned to vimes her eyes hopelessly aglow do you realise were very probably seeing something that noone has seen for centuries yes its a bloody flying alligator setting fire to my city shouted vimes she wasnt listening to him there must be a breeding colony somewhere she said after all this time where do you think it lives vimes didnt know but he swore to himself that he would find out and ask it some very serious questions one egg breathed the breeder just let me get my hands on one egg vimes stared at her in genuine astonishment it dawned on him that he was very probably a flawed character below them another building exploded into flame how far exactly he said speaking very slowly and carefully as to a child did these things fly theyre very territorial animals murmured her ladyship according to legend they vimes realised he was in for another dose of dragon lore just give me the facts mlady he said impatiently not very far really she said slightly taken aback thank you very much maam youve been very helpful muttered vimes and broke into a run somewhere in the city there was nothing outside for miles except low fields and swamp it had to be living somewhere in the city his sandals flapped on the cobbles as he hurtled down the streets somewhere in the city which was totally ridiculous of course totally ridiculous and impossible he didnt deserve this of all the cities in all the world it could have flown into he thought its flown into mine guards guards by the time he reached the river the dragon had vanished but a pall of smoke was hanging over the streets and several human bucket chains had been formed to pass lumps of the river to the stricken buildings the job was considerably hampered by the droves of people streaming out of the streets carrying their possessions most of the city was wood and thatch and they werent taking any chances in fact the danger was surprisingly small mysteriously small when you came to think about it vimes had surreptitiously taken to carrying a notebook these days and he had noted the damage as if the mere act of writing it down somehow made the world a more understandable place itym ae coache house itym ae smalle vegettable shape vimes wondered about that hed bought some apples in there once and there didnt appear to be anything about it that a dragon could possibly take offence at still very considerate of the dragon he thought as he made his way to the watch house when you think of all the timber yards hayricks thatched roofs and oil stores it could have hit by chance its managed to really frighten everyone without actually harming the city rays of early morning sunlight were piercing the drifts of smoke as he pushed open the door this was home not the bare little room over the candlemakers shop in wixons alley where he slept but this nasty brown room that smelt of unswept chimneys sgt colons pipe nobbys mysterious personal problem and latterly carrots armour polish it was almost like home noone else was there he wasnt entirely surprised he clumped up to his office and leaned back in his chair whose cushion would have been thrown out of its basket in disgust by an incontinent dog pulled his helmet over his eyes and tried to think the guild of fire fighters had been outlawed by the patrician the previous year after many complaints the point was that if you bought a contract from the guild your house would be protected against fire unfortunately the general ankhmorpork ethos quickly came to the fore and fire fighters would tend to go to prospective clients houses in groups making loud comments like very inflammable looking place this and probably go up like a firework with just one carelesslydropped match know what i mean terry pratchett guards guards no good rushing about the dragon had vanished in all the smoke and confusion as suddenly as it had come time for rushing about soon enough the important thing was working out where to rush to hed been right wading bird but where did you start looking for a bloody great dragon in a city of a million people he was aware that his right hand entirely unbidden had pulled open the bottom drawer and three of his fingers acting on sealed orders from his hindbrain had lifted out a bottle it was one of those bottles that emptied themselves reason told him that sometimes he must occasionally start one break the seal see amber liquid glistening all the way up to the neck it was just that he couldnt remember the sensation it was as if the bottles arrived twothirds empty he stared at the label it seemed to be jimkin bearhuggers old selected dragons blood whiskey cheap and powerful you could light fires with it you could clean spoons you didnt have to drink much of it to be drunk which was just as well it was nobby who shook him awake with the news that there was a dragon in the city and also that sgt colon had had a nasty turn vimes sat and blinked owlishly while the words washed around him apparently having a firebreathing lizard focusing interestedly on ones nether regions from a distance of a few feet can upset the strongest constitution an experience like that could leave a lasting mark on a person vimes was still digesting this when carrot turned up with the librarian swinging along behind him did you see it did you see it he said we all saw it said vimes i know all about it said carrot triumphantly someones brought it here with magic someones stolen a book out of the library and guess what its called cant even begin to said vimes weakly its called the summoning ofdragons oook confirmed the librarian oh whats it about said vimes the librarian rolled his eyes its about how to summon dragons by magic oook and thats illegal that is said carrot happily releasing feral creatures upon the streets contrary to the wild animals public vimes groaned that meant wizards you got nothing but trouble with wizards i suppose he said there wouldnt be another copy of this book around would there oook the librarian shook his head and you wouldnt happen to know whats in it vimes sighed what oh four words he said wearily first word sounds like bend bough sow cow how how second word small word the a to to yes understood but i meant in any kind of detail no i see whatre we going to do now sir said carrot anxiously its out there intoned nobby gone to ground like during the hours of daylight coiled up in its secret lair on top of a great hoard of gold dreamin ancient reptilian dreams fromma dawna time waitin for the secret curtains of the night when once more it will sally forth he hesitated and added sullenly whatre you all looking at me like that for very poetic said carrot well everyone knows the real old dragons used to go to sleep on a hoard of gold said nobby well known folk myth vimes looked blankly into the immediate future vile though nobby was he was also a good indication of what was going through the mind of the average citizen you could use him as a sort of laboratory rat to forecast what was going to happen next i expect youd be really interested in finding out where that hoard is wouldnt you said vimes experimentally nobby looked even more shifty than usual well capn i was thinking of having a bit of a look around you know when im off duty of course he added virtuously oh dear said captain vimes he lifted up the empty bottle and with great care put it back in the drawer the elucidated brethren were nervous a kind of fear crackled from brother to brother it was the fear of someone who having cheerfully experimented with pouring the powder and wadding terry pratchett guards guards the ball has found that pulling the trigger had led to a godawful bang and pretty soon someone is bound to come and see whos making all the noise the supreme grand master knew that he had them though sheep and lamb sheep and lamb since they couldnt do anything much worse than they had already done they might as well press on and damn the world and pretend theyd wanted it like this all along oh the joy of it only brother plasterer was actually happy let that be a lesson to all oppressive vegetable sellers he kept saying yes er said brother doorkeeper only the thing is theres no chance of us sort of accidentally summoning the dragon here is there i that is we have it under perfect control said the supreme grand master smoothly the power is ours i can assure you the brothers cheered up a little bit and now the supreme grand master continued there is the matter of the king the brothers looked solemn except for brother plasterer have we found him then he said thats a stroke of luck you never listen do you snapped brother watchtower it was all explained last week we dont go around finding anyone we make a king i thought he was supposed to turn up cos of destiny brother watchtower sniggered we sort of help destiny along a bit the supreme grand master smiled in the depths of his robe it was amazing this mystic business you tell them a lie and then when you dont need it any more you tell them another lie and tell them theyre progressing along the road to wisdom then instead of laughing they follow you even more hoping that at the heart of all the lies theyll find the truth and bit by bit they accept the unacceptable amazing bloody hell thats clever said brother doorkeeper how do we do that then look the supreme grand master said what we do we find some handsome lad whos good at taking orders he kills the dragon and bobs your uncle simple much more intelligent than waitin for a socalled real king but brother plasterer seemed deep in the toils of cerebration if we control the dragon and we do control the dragon right then we dont need anyone killing it we just stop summoning it and everyonell be happy right ho yes said brother watchtower nastily i can just see it can you we just trot out say hallo we wont set fire to your houses any more arent we nice do we the whole point about the thing with the king is that hell be a a sort of undeniably potent and romantic symbol of absolute authority said the supreme grand master smoothly thats it said brother watchtower a potent authority oh i see said brother plasterer right okay thats what the kingll be thats it said brother watchtower noone going to argue with a potent authority are they too right said brother watchtower stroke of luck then finding the true king right now said brother plasterer million to one chance really we havent found the right king we dont need the right king said the supreme grand master wearily for the last time ive just found us a likely lad who looks good in a crown and can take orders and knows how to flourish a sword now just listen flourishing of course was important it didnt have much to do with wielding wielding a sword the supreme grand master considered was simply the messy business of dynastic surgery it was just a matter of thrust and cut whereas a king had to flourish one it had to catch the light in just the right way leaving watchers in no doubt that here was destinys chosen hed taken a long time preparing the sword and shield it had been very expensive the shield shone like a dollar in a sweeps earhole but the sword the sword was magnificent it was long and shiny it looked like something some genius of metalwork one of those little zen guys who works only by the light of dawn and can beat a club sandwich of folded steels into something with the cutting edge of a scalpel and the stoppingpower of a sexcrazed rhinoceros on bad acid had made and then retired in tears because hed never ever do anything so good again there were so many jewels on the hilt it had to be sheathed in velvet you had to look at it through smoked glass just laying a hand on it practically conferred kingship terry pratchett as for the lad he was a distant cousin keen and vain and stupid in a passably aristocratic way currently he was under guard in a distant farmhouse with an adequate supply of drink and several young ladies although what the boy seemed most interested in was mirrors probably hero material the supreme grand master thought glumly i suppose said brother watchtower that he isnt the real air to the throne what do you mean said the supreme grand master well you know how it is fate plays funny tricks haha itd be a laugh wouldnt it said brother watchtower if this lad turned out to be the real king after all this trouble there is no real king any more snapped the supreme grand master what do you expect some people wandering in the wilderness for hundreds and hundreds of years patiently handing down a sword and a birthmark some sort of magic he spat the word hed make use of magic means to an end end justifies means and so forth but to go around believing it believing it had some sort of moral force like logic made him wince good grief man be logical be rational even if any of the old royal family survived the blood lined be so watered down by now that there must be thousands of people who lay claim to the throne even he tried to think of the least likely claimant even someone like brother dunnykin he stared at the assembled brethren dont see him here tonight by the way funny thing that said brother watchtower thoughtfully didnt you hear what he got bitten by a crocodile on his way home last night poor little bugger what million to one chance itd escaped from a menagerie or something and was lying low in his back yard he went to feel under his doormat for his doorkey and it had him by the funes brother watchtower fumbled under his robe and produced a grubby brown envelope were having a whipround to buy him some grapes and that i dont know whether youd like to er a species of geranium guards guards put me down for three dollars said the supreme grand master brother watchtower nodded funny thing he said i already have just a few more nights thought the supreme grand master by tomorrow the peoplell be so desperate theyd crown even a onelegged troll if he got rid of the dragon and well have a king and hell have an advisor a trusted man of course and this stupid rabble can go back to the gutter no more dressing up no more ritual no more summoning the dragon i can give it up he thought i can give it up any time i like the streets outside the patricians palace were thronged there was a manic air of carnival vimes ran a practised eye over the assortment before him it was the usual ankhmorpork mob in times of crisis half of them were here to complain a quarter of them were here to watch the other half and the remainder were here to rob importune or sell hotdogs to the rest there were a few new faces though there were a number of grim men with big swords slung over their shoulders and whips slung on their belts striding through the crowds news spreads quick dont it observed a familiar voice by his ear morning captain vimes looked into the grinning cadaverous face of cutmeownthroat dibbler purveyor of absolutely anything that could be sold hurriedly from an open suitcase in a busy street and was guaranteed to have fallen off the back of an oxcart morning throat said vimes absently whatre you selling genuine article captain throat leaned closer he was the sort of person who could make good morning sound like a onceinalifetime nevertoberepeated offer his eyes swivelled back and forth in their sockets like two rodents trying to find a way out cant afford to be without it he hissed antidragon cream personal guarantee if youre incinerated you get your money back no quibble what youre saying said vimes slowly if i understand the terry pratchett wording correctly isthat if i am baked alive by the dragon youll return the money upon personal application said cutmeownthroat he unscrewed the lid from ajar of vivid green ointment and thrust it under vimess nose made from over fifty different rare spices and herbs to a recipe known only to a bunch of ancient monks what live on some mountain somewhere one dollar ajar and im cutting my own throat its a public service really he added piously youve got to hand it to those ancient monks brewing it up so quickly said vimes clever buggers agreed cutmeownthroat it must be all that meditation and yak yogurt so whats happening throat said vimes whore all the guys with the big swords dragon hunters capn the patrician announced a reward of fifty thousand dollars to anyone who brings him the dragons head not attached to the dragon either hes no fool that man what thats what he said its all written on posters fifty thousand dollars not chicken feed eh more like dragon fodder said vimes itd bring trouble you mark his words im amazed youre not grabbing a sword and joining in im more in what you might call the service sector capn throat looked both ways conspiratorially and then passed vimes a slip of parchment it said antidragon mirror shields a portable lair detectors a dragonpiercing arrows a per each shovels a picks a sacks a l vimes handed it back why the sacks he said on account of the hoard said throat oh yes said vimes gloomily of course tell you what said throat tell you what for our boys in brown ten percent off and youre cutting your own throat throat fifteen percent for officers urged throat as vimes walked guards guards away the cause of the slight panic in his voice was soon apparent he had plenty of competition the people of ankhmorpork were not by nature heroic but were by nature salesmen in the space of a few feet vimes could have bought any number of magical weapons genuine certyfycate of orthenticity with everyone a cloak of invisibility a good touch he thought and he was really impressed by the way the stallowner was using a mirror with no glass in it and by way of lighter relief dragon biscuits balloons and windmills on sticks copper bracelets guaranteed to bring relief from dragons were a nice thought there seemed to be as many sacks and shovels about as there were swords gold that was it the hoard hah fifty thousand dollars an officer ofthe watch earned thirty dollars a month and had to pay to have his own dents beaten out what he couldnt do with fifty thousand dollars vimes thought about this for a while and then thought of the things he could do with fifty thousand dollars there were so many more of them for a start he almost walked into a group of men clustered around a poster nailed to the wall it declared indeed that the head of the dragon that had terrorised the city would be worth a to the brave hero that delivered it to the palace one of the cluster who from his size weaponry and that way he was slowly tracing the lettering with his finger vimes decided was a leading hero was doing the reading for the others to terher palackee he concluded fifty thousand said one of them reflectively rubbing his chin cheap job said the intellectual well below the rate should be half the kingdom and his daughters hand in marriage yes but he aint a king hes a patrician well half his patrimony or whatever whats his daughter like the assembled hunters didnt know hes not married vimes volunteered and he hasnt got a daughter they turned and looked him up and down he could see the disdain in their eyes they probably got through dozens like him terry pratchett every day not got a daughter said one of them wants people to kill dragons and he hasnt got a daughter vimes felt in an odd way that he ought to support the lord of the city hes got a little dog that hes very fond of he said helpfully bleeding disgusting not even having a daughter said one of the hunters and whats fifty thousand dollars these days you spend that much in nets sright said another people think its a fortune but they dont reckon on well its not pensionable theres all the medical expenses youve got to buy and maintain your own gear wear and tear on virgins nodded a small fat hunter yeah and then thereswhat my speciality is unicorns the hunter explained with an embarrassed smile oh right the first speaker looked like someone whod always been dying to ask the question i thought they were very rare these days youre right there you dont see many unicorns either said the unicorn hunter vimes got the impression that in his whole life this was his only joke yeah well times are hard said the first speaker sharply monsters are getting more uppity too said another i heard where this guy he killed this monster in this lake no problem stuck its arm up over the door pour encourjay lays ortras said one of the listeners right and you know what its mum come and complained its actual mum come right down to the hall next day and complained actually complained thats the respect you get the females are always the worst said another hunter gloomily i knew this crosseyed gorgon once oh she was a terror kept turning her own nose to stone its our arses on the line every time said the intellectual i mean i wish i had a dollar for every horse ive had eaten out from underneath me right fifty thousand dollars he can stuff it yeah right cheapskate lets go and have a drink right guards guards they nodded in righteous agreement and strode off towards the mended drum except for the intellectual who sidled uneasily back to vimes what sort of dog he said what said vimes i said what sort of dog a small wirehaired terrier i think said vimes the hunter thought about this for some time nah he said eventually and hurried off after the others hes got an aunt in pseudopolis i believe vimes called after him there was no response the captain of the watch shrugged and carried on through the throng to the patricians palace where the patrician was having a difficult lunchtime gentlemen he snapped i really dont see what else there is to do the assembled civic leaders muttered amongst themselves at times like this its traditional that a hero comes forth said the president of the guild of assassins a dragon slayer where is he thats what i want to know why arent our schools turning out young people with the kind of skills society needs fifty thousand dollars doesnt sound much said the chairman of the guild of thieves it may not be much to you my dear sir but it is all the city can afford said the patrician firmly if it doesnt afford any more than that i dont think therell be a city for long said the thief and what about trade said the representative of the guild of merchants people arent going to sail here with a cargo of rare comestibles just to have it incinerated are they gentlemen gentlemen the patrician raised his hands in a conciliatory fashion it seems to me he went on taking advantage of the brief pause that what we have here is a strictly magical phenomenon i would like to hear from our learned friend on this point hmm someone nudged the archchancellor of unseen university who had nodded off terry pratchett guards guards eh what said the wizard startled into wakefulness we were wondering said the patrician loudly what you were intending to do about this dragon of yours the archchancellor was old but a lifetime of survival in the world of competitive wizardry and the byzantine politics of unseen university meant that he could whip up a defensive argument in a split second you didnt remain archchancellor for long if you let that sort of ingenuous remark whizz past your ear my dragon he said its well known that the great dragons are extinct said the patrician brusquely and besides their natural habitat was definitely rural so it seems to me that this one must be mag with respect lord vetinari said the archchancellor it has often been claimed that dragons are extinct but the current evidence if i may make so bold tends to cast a certain doubt on the theory as to habitat what we are seeing here is simply a change of behaviour pattern occasioned by the spread of urban areas into the countryside which has led many hitherto rural creatures to adopt nay in many cases to positively embrace a more municipal mode of existence and many of them thrive on the new opportunities thereby opened to them for example foxes are always knocking over my dustbins he beamed hed managed to get all the way through it without actually needing to engage his brain are you saying said the assassin slowly that what weve got here is the first civic dragon thats evolution for you said the wizard happily it should do well too he added plenty of nesting sites and a more than adequate food supply silence greeted this statement until the merchant said what exactly is it that they do eat the thief shrugged i seem to recall stories about virgins chained to huge rocks he volunteered itll starve round here then said the assassin were on loam they used to go around ravening said the thief dunno if thats any help anyway said the leader of the merchants it seems to be your problem again my lord five minutes later the patrician was striding the length of the oblong office fuming they were laughing at me said the patrician i could tell did you suggest a working party said wonse of course i did it didnt do the trick this time you know i really am inclined to increase the reward money i dont think that would work my lord any proficient monster slayer knows the rate for the job ha half the kingdom muttered the patrician and your daughters hand in marriage said wonse i suppose an aunt isnt acceptable the patrician said hopefully tradition demands a daughter my lord the patrician nodded gloomily perhaps we can buy it off he said aloud are dragons intelligent i believe the word traditionally is cunning my lord said wonse i understand they have a liking for gold really what do they spend it on they sleep on it my lord what do you mean in a mattress no my lord on it the patrician turned this fact over in his mind dont they find it rather knobbly he said so i would imagine sir i dont suppose anyone has ever asked hmm can they talk theyre apparently good at it my lord ah interesting the patrician was thinking if it can talk it can negotiate if it can negotiate then i have it by the short by the small scales or whatever it is they have and they are said to be silver tongued said wonse the patrician leaned back in his chair only silver he said there was the sound of muted voices in the passageway outside and vimes was ushered in ah captain said the patrician what progress im sorry my lord said vimes as the rain dripped off his cape towards apprehending this dragon said the patrician firmly the wading bird said vimes terry pratchett you know very well what i mean said vetinari sharply investigations are in hand said vimes automatically the patrician snorted all you have to do is find its lair he said once you have the lair you have the dragon thats obvious half the city seems to be looking for it if there is a lair said vimes wonse looked up sharply why do you say that we are considering a number of possibilities said vimes woodenly if it has no lair where does it spend its days said the patrician inquiries are being pursued said vimes then pursue them with alacrity and find the lair said the patrician sourly yes sir permission to leave sir very well but i shall expect progress by tonight do you understand now why did i wonder if it has a lair vimes thought as he stepped out into the daylight and the crowded square because it didnt look real thats why if it isnt real it doesnt need to do anything we expect how can it walk out of an alley it didnt go into once youve ruled out the impossible then whatever is left however improbable must be the truth the problem lay in working out what was impossible of course that was the trick all right there was also the curious incident of the orangutan in the nighttime by day the library buzzed with activity vimes moved through it diffidently strictly speaking he could go anywhere in the city but the university had always held that it fell under thaumaturgical law and he felt it wouldnt be wise to make the kind of enemies where you were lucky to end up the same temperature let alone the same shape he found the librarian hunched over his desk the ape gave him an expectant look guards guards havent found it yet sorry said vimes enquiries are continuing but there is a little help you can give me oook well this is a magical library right i mean these books are sort of intelligent isnt that so so ive been thinking i bet if i got in here at night theyd soon kick up a fuss because they dont know me but if they did know me theyd probably not mind so whoever took the book would have to be a wizard wouldnt they or someone who works for the university at any rate the librarian glanced from side to side then grasped vimess hand and led him into the seclusion of a couple of bookshelves only then did he nod his head someone they know a shrug and then another nod thats why you told us is it oook and not the university council oook any idea who it is the librarian shrugged a decidedly expressive gesture for a body which was basically a sack between a pair of shoulderblades well its something let me know if any other strange things happen wont you vimes looked up at the banks of shelves stranger than usual i mean oook thank you its a pleasure to meet a citizen who regards it as their duty to assist the watch the librarian gave him a banana vimes felt curiously elated as he stepped out into the citys throbbing streets again he was definitely detecting things they were little bits of things like a jigsaw no one of them made any real sense but they all hinted at a bigger picture all he needed to do was find a corner or a bit of an edge he was pretty certain it wasnt a wizard whatever the librarian might think not a proper paidup wizard this sort of thing wasnt their style and there was of course this business about the lair the most sensible course would be to wait and see if the dragon turned up tonight and try and see where that meant a high place was there some way of detecting dragons themselves hed had a look terry pratchett at cutmeownthroat dibblers dragon detectors which consisted solely of a piece of wood on a metal stick when the stick was burned through youd found your dragon like a lot of cutmeownthroats devices it was completely efficient in its own special way while at the same time being totally useless there had to be a better way of finding the thing than waiting until your fingers were burned off the setting sun spread out on the horizon like a lightlypoached egg the rooftops of ankhmorpork sprouted a fine array of gargoyles even in normal times but now they were alive with as ghastly an array of faces as ever were seen outside a woodcut about the evils of gindrinking among the nonwoodcutbuying classes many of the faces were attached to bodies holding a fearsome array of homely weapons that had been handed down from generation to generation for centuries often with some force from his perch on the roof of the watch house vimes could see the wizards lining the rooftops of the university and the gangs of opportunist hoardresearchers waiting in the streets shovels at the ready if the dragon really did have a bed somewhere in the city then it would be sleeping on the floor tomorrow from somewhere below came the cry of cutmeownthroat dibbler or one of his colleagues selling hot sausages vimes felt a sudden surge of civic pride there had to be something right about a citizenry which when faced with catastrophe thought about selling sausages to the participants the city waited a few stars came out colon nobby and carrot were also on the roof colon was sulking because vimes had forbidden him to use his bow and arrow these werent encouraged in the city since the heft and throw of a longbows arrow could send it through an innocent bystander a hundred yards away rather than the innocent bystander at whom it was aimed thats right said carrot the projectile weapons act guards guards ill dont you keep on quoting all that sort of stuff snapped colon we dont have any of them laws any more thats all old stuff its all more wossname now pragmatic law or no law said vimes say put it away but captain i was a dab hand at this protested colon anyway he added peevishly a lot of other people have got them that was true enough neighbouring rooftops bristled like hedgehogs if the wretched thing turned up it was going to think it was flying through solid wood with slots in it you could almost feel sorry for it i said put it away said vimes im not having my guards shooting citizens so put it away thats very true said carrot were here to protect and to serve arent we captain vimes gave him a sidelong look er he said yeah yes thats right on the roof of her house on the hill lady ramkin adjusted a rather inadequate folding chair on the roof arranged the telescope coffee flask and sandwiches on the parapet in front of her and settled down to wait she had a notebook on her knee half an hour went by hails of arrows greeted a passing cloud several unfortunate bats and the rising moon bugger this for a game of soldiers said nobby eventually its been scared off sgt colon lowered his pike looks like it he conceded and its getting chilly up here said carrot he politely nudged captain vimes who was slumped against the chimney staring moodily into space maybe we ought to be getting down sir he said lots of people are hmm said vimes without moving his head could be coming on to rain too said carrot vimes said nothing for some minutes he had been watching the tower of art which was the centre of unseen university and reputedly the oldest building in the city it was certainly the tallest time weather and indifferent repairs had given it a gnarled appearance like a tree that has seen too many thunderstorms he was trying to remember its shape as is the case with many terry pratchett things that are totally familiar he hadnt really looked at it for years now he was trying to convince himself that the forest of little turrets and crenellations at its top looked just the same tonight as they had done yesterday it was giving him some difficulty without taking his eyes off it he grabbed sgt colons shoulder and gently pointed him in the right direction he said can you see anything odd about the top of the tower colon stared up for a while and then laughed nervously well it looks like theres a dragon sitting on it doesnt it yes thats what i thought only only only when you sort of look properly you can see its just made up out of shadows and clumps of ivy and that i mean if you halfclose one eye it looks like two old women and a wheelbarrow vimes tried this nope he said it still looks like a dragon a huge one sort of hunched up and looking down look you can see its wings folded up beg pardon sir thats just a broken turret giving the effect they watched it for a while then vimes said tell me sergeant i ask in a spirit of pure inquiry what do you thinks causing the effect of a pair of huge wings unfurling colon swallowed i think thats caused by a pair of huge wings sir he said spot on sergeant the dragon dropped it wasnt a swoop it simply kicked away from the top of the tower and halffell halfflew straight downwards disappearing from view behind the university buildings vimes caught himself listening for the thump and then the dragon was in view again moving like an arrow moving like a shooting star moving like something that has somehow turned a thirtytwo feet per second per second plummet into an unstoppable upward swoop it glided over the rooftops at little more than head height all the more horrible because of the sound it was as though the air was slowly and carefully being torn in half the watch threw themselves flat vimes caught a glimpse of huge vaguely horselike features before it slid past guards guards sodding arseholes said nobby from somewhere in the guttering vimes redoubled his grip on the chimney and pulled himself upright you are in uniform corporal nobbs he said his voice hardly shaking at all sorry captain sodding arseholes sir wheres sergeant colon down here sir holding on to this drainpipe sir oh for goodness sake help him up carrot gosh said carrot look at it go you could tell the position of the dragon by the rattle of arrows across the city and by the screams and gurgles of all those hit by the misses and ricochets he hasnt even flapped his wings yet shouted carrot trying to stand on the chimney pot look at him go it shouldnt be that big vimes told himself watching the huge shape wheel over the river its as long as a street there was a puff of flame above the docks and for a moment the creature passed in front of the moon then it flapped its wings once with a sound like the damp hides of a pedigree herd being slapped across a cliff it turned in a tight circle pounded the air a few times to build up speed and came back when it passed over the watch house it coughed a column of spitting white fire tiles under it didnt just melt they erupted in redhot droplets the chimney stack exploded and rained bricks across the street vast wings hammered at the air as the creature hovered over the burning building fire spearing down on what rapidly became a glowing heap then when all that was left was a spreading puddle of melted rock with interesting streaks and bubbles in it the dragon raised itself with a contemptuous flick of its wings and soared away and upwards over the city lady ramkin lowered her telescope and shook her head slowly thats not right she whispered thats not right at all shouldnt be able to do anything like that terry pratchett she raised the lens again and squinted trying to see what was on fire down below in their long kennels the little dragons howled traditionally upon waking from blissfully uneventful insensibility you ask where am i its probably part of the racial consciousness or something vimes said it tradition allows a choice of second lines a key point in the selection process is an audit to see that the body has all the bits it remembers having yesterday vimes checked then comes the tantalising bit now that the snowball of consciousness is starting to roll is it going to find that its waking up inside a body lying in a gutter with something multiple the noun doesnt matter after an adjective like multiple nothing good ever follows multiple or is it going to be a case of crisp sheets a soothing hand and a businesslike figure in white pulling open the curtains on a bright new day is it all over with nothing worse to look forward to now than weak tea nourishing gruel short strengthening walks in the garden and possibly a brief platonic love affair with a ministering angel or was this all just a moments blackout and some looming bastard is now about to get down to real business with the thick end of a pickaxe helve are there the consciousness wants to know going to be grapes at this point some outside stimulus is helpful its going to be all right is favourite whereas did anyone get his number is definitely a bad sign either however is better than you two hold his hands behind his back in fact someone said you were nearly a goner there captain the pain sensations which had taken advantage of vimess unconscious state to bunk off for a metaphorical quick cigarette rushed back vimes said arrgh then he opened his eyes there was a ceiling this ruled out one particular range of unpleasant options and was very welcome his blurred vision also revealed corporal nobbs which was less so corporal nobbs guards guards proved nothing you could be dead and see something like corporal nobbs ankhmorpork did not have many hospitals all the guilds maintained their own sanitariums and there were a few public ones run by the odder religious organisations like the balancing monks but by and large medical assistance was nonexistent and people had to die inefficiently without the aid of doctors it was generally thought that the existence of cures encouraged slackness and was in any case probably against natures way have i already said where am i said vimes faintly yes did i get an answer dunno where this place is captain it belongs to some posh bint she said to bring you up here even though vimess mind appeared to be full of pink treacle he nevertheless grabbed two clues and wrestled them together the combination of rich and up here meant something so did the strange chemical smell in the room which even overpowered nobbys more everyday odours were not talking about lady ramkin are we he said cautiously you could be right great big biddy mad for dragons nobbys rodent face broke into the most horribly knowing grin vimes had ever seen youre in her bed he said vimes peered around him feeling the first overtures of a vague panic because now that he could halfway focus he could see a certain lack of bachelor sockness about the place there was a faint hint of talcum powder bit of a boodwah said nobby with the air of a connoisseur hang on hang on a minute said vimes there was this dragon it was right over us the memory rose up and hit him like a zombie with a grudge you all right captain the talons outspread wide as a mans reach the boom and thump of the wings bigger than sails the stink of chemicals the gods alone knew what sort it had been so close he could see the tiny scales on its legs and the red gleam in its eyes they were more than just reptile eyes they were eyes you could drown in and the breath so hot that it wasnt like fire at all but terry pratchett something almost solid not burning things but smashing them apart on the other hand he was here and alive his left side felt as though it had been hit with an iron bar but he was quite definitely alive what happened he said it was young carrot said nobby he grabbed you and the sergeant and jumped off the roof just before it got us my side hurts it must have got me said vimes no i reckon that was where you hit the privy roof said nobby and then you rolled off and hit the water butt what about colon is he hurt not hurt not exactly hurt he landed more sort of softly him being so heavy he went through the roof talk about a short sharp shower of and then what happened well we sort of made you comfy and then everyone went blundering about and shouting for the sergeant until they found out where he was ocourse then they just stood where they were and shouted and then this woman come running up yelling said nobby this is lady ramkin youre referring to said vimes coldly his ribs were aching really magnificently now yeah big fat party said nobby unmoved cor she cant half boss people about oh the poor dear man you must bring him up to my house this instant so we did best place too everyones running around down in the city like chickens with their heads cut off how much damage did it do well after you were out of it the wizards hit it with fireballs it didnt like that at all just seemed to make it stronger and angrier took out the universitys entire widdershins wing and thats about it really it flamed a few more things and then it must of flown away in all the smoke noone saw where it went if they did they aint saying nobby sat back and leered disgusting really her livin in a room like this shes got pots of money sarge says shes got no call livin in ordinary rooms whats the good of not wanting to be poor if the rich are allowed guards guards to go round livin in ordinary rooms should be marble he sniffed anyway she said i was to fetch her when you woke up shes feeding her dragons now odd little buggers arent they its amazing shes allowed to keep em what do you mean you know tarred with the same brush and that when nobby had shambled out vimes took another look around the room it did indeed lack the gold leaf and marble that nobby felt was compulsory for people of a high station in life all the furniture was old and the pictures on the wall though doubtless valuable looked the sort of pictures that are hung on bedroom walls because people cant think of anywhere else to put them there were also a few amateurish watercolours of dragons all in all it had the look about it of a room that is only ever occupied by one person and has been absentmindedly moulded around them over the years like a suit of clothes with a ceiling it was clearly the room of a woman but one who had cheerfully and without any silly moping been getting on with her life while all that soppy romance stuff had been happening to other people somewhere else and been jolly grateful that she had her health such clothing as was visible had been chosen for sensible hardwearing qualities possibly by a previous generation by the look of it rather than its use as light artillery in the war between the sexes there were bottles and jars neatly arranged on the dressing table but a certain severity of line suggested that their labels would say things like rub on nightly rather than just a dab behind the ears you could imagine that the occupant of this room had slept in it all her life and had been called my little girl by her father until she was forty there was a big sensible blue dressing gown hanging behind the door vimes knew without even looking that it would have a rabbit on the pocket in short it was the room of a woman who never expected that a man would ever see the inside of it the bedside table was piled high with papers feeling guilty but doing it anyway vimes squinted at them dragons was the theme there were letters from the cavern club exhibitions committee and the friendly flamethrowers league there were pamphlets and appeals from the sunshine terry pratchett sanctuary for sick dragons poor little vinnys fires were nearly damped after five years cruel use as a paintstripper but now and there were requests for donations and talks and things that added up to a heart big enough for the whole world or at least that part of it that had wings and breathed fire if you let your mind dwell on rooms like this you could end up being oddly sad and full of a strange diffuse compassion which would lead you to believe that it might be a good idea to wipe out the whole human race and start again with amoebas beside the drift of paperwork was a book vimes twisted painfully and looked at the spine it said diseases of the dragon by sybil deidre olgivanna ramkin he turned the stiff pages in horrified fascination they opened into another world a world of quite stupefying problems slab throat the black tups dry lung storge staggers heaves weeps stones it was amazing he decided after reading a few pages that a swamp dragon ever survived to see a second sunrise even walking across a room must be reckoned a biological triumph the painstakinglydrawn illustrations he looked away from hurriedly you could only take so much innards there was a knock at the door i say are you decent lady ramkin boomed cheerfully er ive brought you something jolly nourishing somehow vimes imagined it would be soup instead it was a plate stacked high with bacon fried potatoes and eggs he could hear his arteries panic just by looking at it ive made a bread pudding too said lady ramkin slightly sheepishly i dont normally cook much just for myself you know how it is catering for one vimes thought about the meals at his lodgings somehow the meat was always grey with mysterious tubes in it er he began not used to addressing ladies from a recumbent position in their own beds corporal nobbs tells me and what a colourful little man nobby is said lady ramkin vimes wasnt certain he could cope with this colourful he said weakly a real character weve been getting along famously guards guards you have oh yes what a great fund of anecdotes he has oh yes hes got that all right it always amazed vimes how nobby got along with practically everyone it must hed decided have something to do with the common denominator in the entire world of mathematics there could be no denominator as common as nobby er he said and then found he couldnt leave this strange new byway you dont find his language a bit er ripe salty corrected lady ramkin cheerfully you should have heard my father when he was annoyed anyway we found weve got a lot in common its an amazing coincidence but my grandfather once had his grandfather whipped for malicious lingering that must make them practically family vimes thought another stab of pain from his stricken side made him wince youve got some very bad bruising and probably a cracked rib or two she said if you roll over ill put some more of this on lady ramkin flourished a jar of yellow ointment panic crossed vimess face instinctively he raised the sheets up around his neck dont play silly buggers man she said i shant see anything i havent seen before one backside is pretty much like another its just that the ones i see generally have tails on now roll over and up with the nightshirt it belonged to my grandfather you know there was no resisting that tone of voice vimes thought about demanding that nobby be brought in as a chaperon and then decided that would be even worse the cream burned like ice what is it all kinds of stuff itll reduce the bruising and promote the growth of healthy scale what sorry probably not scale dont look so worried im almost positive about that okay all done she gave him a slap on the rump madam i am captain of the night watch said vimes knowing it was a bloody daft thing to say even as he said it half naked in a ladys bed too said lady ramkin unmoved terry pratchett guardsguards now sit up and eat your tea weve got to get you good and strong vimess eyes filled with panic why he said lady ramkin reached into the pocket of her grubby jacket i made some notes last night she said about the dragon oh the dragon vimes relaxed a bit right now the dragon seemed a much safer prospect and i did a bit of working out too ill tell you this its a very odd beast it shouldnt be able to get airborne youre right there if its built like swamp dragons it should weigh about twenty tons twenty tons its impossible its all down to weight and wingspan ratios you see i saw it drop off the tower like a swallow i know it should have torn its wings off and left a bloody great hole in the ground said lady ramkin firmly you cant muck about with aerodynamics you cant just scale up from small to big and leave it at that you see its all a matter of muscle power and lifting surfaces i knew there was something wrong said vimes brightening up and the flame too nothing goes around with that kind of heat inside it how do swamp dragons manage it oh thats just chemicals said lady ramkin dismissively they just distill something flammable from whatever theyve eaten and ignite the flame just as it comes out of the ducts they never actually have fire inside them unless they get a case of blowback what happens then youre scraping dragon off the scenery said lady ramkin cheerfully im afraid theyre not very welldesigned creatures dragons vimes listened they would never have survived at all except that their home swamps were isolated and short of predators not that a dragon made good eating anyway once youd taken away the leathery skin and the enormous flight muscles what was left must have been like biting into a badlyrun chemical factory no wonder dragons were always ill they relied on permanent stomach trouble for supplies of fuel most of their brain power was taken up with controlling the complexities of their digestion which could distill flameproducing fuels from the most unlikely ingredients they could even rearrange their internal plumbing overnight to deal with difficult processes they lived on a chemical knifeedge the whole time one misplaced hiccup and they were geography and when it came to choosing nesting sites the females had all the common sense and mothering instinct of a brick vimes wondered why people had been so worried about dragons in the olden days if there was one in a cave near you all you had to do was wait until it selfignited blew itself up or died of acute indigestion youve really studied them havent you he said someone ought to but what about the big ones golly yes theyre a great mystery you know she said her expression becoming extremely serious yes you said there are legends you know it seems as though one species of dragon started to get bigger and bigger and thenjust vanished died out you mean nothey turned up sometimes from somewhere full of vim and vigour and then one day they stopped coming at all she gave vimes a triumphant look i think they found somewhere where they could really be really be what dragons where they could really fulfil their potential some other dimension or something where the gravity isnt so strong or something i thought when i saw it said vimes i thought you cant have something that flies and has scales like that they looked at each other weve got to find it in its lair said lady ramkin no bloody flying newt sets fire to my city said vimes just think of the contribution to dragon lore said lady ramkin listen if anyone ever sets fire to this city its going to be me its an amazing opportunity theres so many questions youre right there a phrase of carrots crossed vimess mind it can help us with our enquiries he suggested terry pratchett but in the morning said lady ramkin firmly vimess look of bitter determination faded i shall sleep downstairs in the kitchen said lady ramkin cheerfully i usually have a camp bed made up down there when its egglaying time some of the females always need assistance dont you worry about me youre being very helpful vimes muttered ive sent nobby down to the city to help the others set up your headquarters said lady ramkin vimes had completely forgotten the watch house it must have been badly damaged he ventured totally destroyed said lady ramkin just a patch of melted rock so im letting you have a place in pseudopolis yard sorry oh my father had property all over the city she said quite useless to me really so i told my agent to give sergeant colon the keys to the old house in pseudopolis yard itll do it good to be aired but that area i mean theres real cobbles on the streets the rent alone i mean lord vetinari wont dont you worry about it she said giving him a friendly pat now you really ought to get some sleep vimes lay in bed his mind racing pseudopolis yard was on the ankh side of the river in quite a highrent district the sight of nobby or sergeant colon walking down the street in daylight would probably have the same effect on the area as the opening of a plague hospital he dozed gliding in and out of a sleep where giant dragons pursued him waving jars of ointment and awoke to the sound of a mob lady ramkin drawing herself up haughtily was not a sight to forget although you could try it was like watching continental drift in reverse as various subcontinents and islands pulled themselves together to form one massive angry protowoman the broken door of the dragon house swung on its hinges the inmates already as highly strung as a harp on amphetamines were going mad little gouts of flame burst against the metal guards guards plates as they stampeded back and forth in their pens hwhat she said is the meaning of this if a ramkin had ever been given to introspection shed have admitted that it wasnt a very original line but it was handy it did the job the reason that cliches become cliches is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communication the mob filled the broken doorway some of it was waving various sharp implements with the upanddown motion proper to rioters worl said the leader its the dragon innit there was a chorus of muttered agreement hwhat about it said lady ramkin worl its been burning the city they dont fly far you got dragons here could be one of them couldnt it yeah sright qed so what were going to do is were going to put em down sright yeah pro bonopublico lady ramkins bosom rose and fell like an empire she reached out and grabbed the dunging fork from its hook on the wall one step nearer i warn you and youll be sorry she said the leader looked beyond her to the frantic dragons yeah he said nastily and whatll you do eh her mouth opened and shut once or twice i shall summon the watch she said at last the threat did not have the effect she had expected lady ramkin had never paid much attention to those bits of the city that didnt have scales on well thats too bad said the leader thats really worrying you know that makes me go all weak at the knees that does he extracted a lengthy cleaver from his belt and now you just stand aside lady because a streak of green fire blasted out of the back of the shed passed a foot over the heads of the mob and burned a charred rosette in the woodwork over the door some rioters can be quite welleducated terry pratchett then came a voice that was a honeyed purr of sheer deadly menace this is lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth iv the hottest dragon in the city it could burn your head clean off captain vimes limped forward from the shadows a small and extremely frightened golden dragon was clamped firmly under one arm his other hand held it by the tail the rioters watched it hypnotised now i know what youre thinking vimes went on softly youre wondering after all this excitement has it got enough flame left and yknow i aint so sure myself he leaned forward sighting between the dragons ears and his voice buzzed like a knife blade what youve got to ask yourself is am i feeling lucky they swayed backwards as he advanced well he said are you feeling lucky for a few moments the only sound was lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth ivs stomach rumbling ominously as fuel sloshed into his flame chambers now look er said the leader his eyes fixed hypnotically on the dragons head theres no call for anything like that in fact he might just decide to flare off all by himself said vimes they have to do it to stop the gas building up it builds up when they get nervous and yknow i reckon youve made them all pretty nervous now the leader made what he hoped was a vaguely conciliatory gesture but unfortunately did it with the hand that was still holding a knife drop it said vimes sharply or youre history the knife clanged on the flagstones there was a scuffle at the back of the crowd as a number of people metaphorically speaking were a long way away and knew nothing about it but before the rest of you good citizens disperse quietly and go about your business said vimes meaningfully i suggest you look hard at these dragons do any of them look sixty feet long would you say theyve got an eightyfoot wingspan how hot do they flame would you say dunno said the leader vimes raised the dragons head slightly the leader rolled his eyes guards guards dunno sir he corrected do you want to find out the leader shook his head but he did manage to find his voice who are you anyway he said vimes drew himself up captain vimes city watch he said this met with almost complete silence the exception was the cheerful voice somewhere in the back of the crowd which said night shift is it vimes looked down at his nightshirt in his hurry to get off his sickbed hed shuffled hastily into a pair of lady ramkins slippers for the first time he saw they had pink pompoms on them and it was at this moment that lord mountjoy quickfang winterforth iv chose to belch it wasnt another stab of roaring fire it was just a nearinvisible ball of damp flame which rolled over the mob and singed a few eyebrows but it definitely made an impression vimes rallied magnificently they couldnt have noticed his brief moment of sheer horror that one was just to get your attention he said pokerfaced the next one will be a little lower er said the leader right you are no problem we were just going anyhow no big dragons here right enough sorry youve been troubled oh no said lady ramkin triumphantly you dont get away that easily she reached up on to a shelf and produced a tin box it had a slot in the lid it rattled on the side was the legend the sunshine sanctuary for sick dragons the initial whipround produced four dollars and thirtyone pence after captain vimes gestured pointedly with the dragon a further twentyfive dollars and sixteen pence were miraculously forthcoming then the mob fled we made a profit on the day anyway said vimes when they were alone again that was jolly brave of you lets just hope it doesnt catch on said vimes gingerly putting the exhausted dragon back in its pen he felt quite lightheaded once again he was aware of eyes staring fixedly at him he glanced sideways into the long pointed face of goodboy bindle terry pratchett featherstone rearing up in a pose best described as the last puppy in the shop to his astonishment he found himself reaching over and scratching it behind its ears or at least behind the two spiky things at the sides of its head which were presumably its ears it responded with a strange noise that sounded like a complicated blockage in a brewery he took his hand away hurriedly its all right said lady ramkin its his stomachs rumbling that means he likes you to his amazement vimes found that he was rather pleased about this as far as he could recall nothing in his life before had thought him worth a burp i thought you were er going to get rid of him he said i suppose i shall have to she said you know how it is though they look up at you with those big soulful eyes there was a brief mutual awkward silence how would it be if i you dont think you might like they stopped itd be the least i could do said lady ramkin but youre already giving us the new headquarters and everything that was simply my duty as a good citizen said lady ramkin please accept goodboy as as a friend vimes felt that he was being inched out over a very deep chasm on a very thin plank i dont even know what they eat he said theyre omnivores actually she said they eat everything except metal and igneous rocks you cant be finicky you see when you evolve in a swamp but doesnt he need to be taken for walks or flights or whatever he seems to sleep most of the time she scratched the ugly thing on top of its scaly head hes the most relaxed dragon ive ever bred i must say what about er you know he indicated the dunging fork well its mainly gas just keep him somewhere well ventilated you havent got any valuable carpets have you its best not to let them lick your face but they can be trained to control their flame theyre very helpful for lighting fires guards guards goodboy bindle featherstone curled up amidst a barrage of plumbing noises theyve got eight stomachs vimes remembered the drawings in the book had been very detailed and theres lots of other stuff like fractionaldistillation tubes and mad alchemy sets in there no swamp dragon could ever terrorise a kingdom except by accident vimes wondered how many had been killed by enterprising heroes it was terribly cruel to do something like that to creatures whose only crime was to blow themselves absentmindedly to pieces in midair which was not something any individual dragon made a habit of it made him quite angry to think about it a race of of whittles thats what dragons were born to lose live fast die wide omnivores or not what they must really live on was their nerves flapping apologetically through the world in mortal fear of their own digestive system the family would be just getting over fathers explosion and some twerp in a suit of armour would come plodding into the swamp to stick a sword into a bag of guts that was only one step away from selfdestruction in any case huh itd be interesting to see how the great dragon slayers of the past stood up to the big dragon armour best not to wear it itd all be the same in any case and at least your ashes wouldnt come prepackaged in their own foil he stared and stared at the malformed little thing and the idea that had been knocking for attention for the last few minutes finally gained entrance everyone in ankhmorpork wanted to find the dragons lair at least wanted to find it empty bits of wood on a stick wouldnt do it he was certain but as they said set a thief he said could one dragon sniff out another i mean follow a scent the phrase set a thief to catch a thief had by this time replaced a much older and quintessentially ankhmorporkian proverb which was set a deep hole with springloaded sides tripwires whirling knife blades driven by water power broken glass and scorpions to catch a thief terry pratchett dearest mother talk about a turn up for the books last night the dragon burned up our headquarters and lo and behold we have been given a better one it is in a place called pseudopolis yard opposite the opera house sgt colon said we have gone up in the world and has told nobby not to try to sell the furnishings going up in the world is a metaphor which i am learning about it is like lying but more decorative there are proper carpets to spit on twice today groups of people have tried to search the cellars here for the dragon it is amazing and digging up peoples privies and poking into attics it is like a fever one thing is people havent got time for much else and sgt colon says when you go out on your rounds and shout twelve of the clock and alls well while a dragon is melting the street you feel a bit of a burke i have moved out of mrs palms because there are dozens of bedrooms here it was sad and they made me a cake but i think it is for the best although mrs palm never charged me rent which was very nice of her considering she is a widow with so many fine daughters to bring up plus dowries ekcetra also i have made friends with this ape who keeps coming round to see if we have found his book nobby says it is a flearidden moron because it won d off him playing cripple mr onion which is a game of chance with cards which i do not play i have told nobby about the gambling acts and he said piss off which i think is in violation of the decency ordinances of but i have decided to use my discretion capt vimes is ill and is being looked after by a lady nobby says it is well known she is mental but sgt colon says its just because of living in a big house with a lot of dragons but she is worth a fortune and well done to the capt for getting his feet under the table i do not see what the furniture has to do with it this morning i went for a walk with reet and showed her many interesting examples of the ironwork to be found in the city she said it was very interesting she said i was quite different to anyone shes ever met your loving son carrotx ps i hope minty is keeping well he folded the paper carefully and shoved it into the envelope suns going down said sergeant colon carrot looked up from his sealing wax that means it will be night soon colon went on accurately guards guards yes sergeant colon ran a finger round his collar his skin was impressively pink the result of a mornings scrubbing but people were still staying at a respectful distance some people are born to command some people achieve command and others have command thrust upon them and the sergeant was now included in this category and wasnt very happy about it any minute now he knew he was going to have to say that it was time they went out on patrol he didnt want to go out on patrol he wanted to find a nice subbasement somewhere but nobblyess obligay if he was in charge he had to do it it wasnt the loneliness of command that was bothering him it was the beingfriedalive of command that was giving him problems he was also pretty sure that unless they came up with something about this dragon very soon then the patrician was going to be unhappy and when the patrician was unhappy he became very democratic he found intricate and painful ways of spreading that unhappiness as far as possible responsibility the sergeant thought was a terrible thing so was being horribly tortured as far as he could see the two facts were rapidly heading towards one another and thus he was terribly relieved when a small coach pulled up outside the yard it was very old and battered there was a faded coat of arms on the door painted on the back and rather newer was the little message whinny if you love dragons out of it wincing as he got down stepped captain vimes following him was the woman known to the sergeant as mad sybil ramkin and finally hopping down obediently on the end of its lead was a small the sergeant was too nervous to take account of actual size well ill be mogadored theyve only gone and caught it nobby looked up from the table in the corner where he was continually failing to learn that it is almost impossible to play a game of skill and bluff against an opponent who smiles all the time the librarian took advantage of the diversion to help himself to a couple of cards off the bottom of the pack dont be daft thats just a swamp dragon said nobby shes all right is lady sybil a real lady terry pratchett the other two guards turned and stared at him this was nobby talking you two can bloody well stop that he said why shouldnt i know a lady when i sees one she give me a cup of tea in a cup fin as paper and a silver spoon in it he said speaking as one who had peeped over the plateau of social distinction and i give it back to her so you can stop looking at me like that what is it you actually do on your evenings off said colon no business of yourn did you really give the spoon back said carrot yes i bloody well did said nobby hotly attention lads said the sergeant flooded with relief the other two entered the room vimes gave his men his usual look of resigned dismay my squad he mumbled fine body of men said lady ramkin the good old rank and file eh the rank anyway said vimes lady ramkin beamed encouragingly this led to a strange shuffling among the men sergeant colon by dint of some effort managed to make his chest stick out more than his stomach carrot straightened up from his habitual stoop nobby vibrated with soldierly bearing hands thrust straight down by his sides thumbs pointing sharply forward pigeon chest inflated so much that his feet were in danger of leaving the ground i always think we can all sleep safer in my bed knowing that these brave men are watching over us said lady ramkin walking sedately along the rank like a treasure galleon running ahead of a mild breeze and who is this it is difficult for an orangutan to stand to attention its body can master the general idea but its skin cant the librarian was doing his best however standing in a sort of respectful heap at the end of the line and maintaining the kind of complex salute you can only achieve with a fourfoot arm es plain clothes maam said nobby smartly special ape services very enterprising very enterprising indeed said lady ramkin how long have you been an ape my man oook guards guards well done she turned to vimes who was definitely looking incredulous a credit to you she said a fine body of men oook anthropoids corrected lady ramkin with barely a break in the flow for a moment the rank felt as though they had just returned from singlehandedly conquering a distant province they felt in fact tremendously buckedup which was how lady ramkin would almost certainly have put it and which was definitely several letters of the alphabet away from how they normally felt even the librarian felt favoured and for once had let the phrase my man pass without comment a trickling noise and a strong chemical smell prompted them to look around goodboy bindle featherstone was squatting with an air of sheepish innocence alongside what was not so much a stain on the carpet as a hole in the floor a few wisps of smoke were curling up from the edges lady ramkin sighed dont you worry maam volunteered nobby cheerfully soon have that cleaned up im afraid theyre often like that when theyre excited she said fine specimen you got there maam nobby went on revelling in the newfound experience of social intercourse its not mine she said it belongs to the captain now or all of you perhaps a sort of mascot his name is goodboy bindle featherstone goodboy bindle featherstone bore up stoically under the weight of the name and sniffed a table leg he looks more like my brother errol said nobby playing the cheeky chirpy lovable city sparrow card for all it was worth got the same pointed nose excuse me for saying so milady vimes looked at the creature which was investigating its new environment and knew that it was now irrevocably an errol the little dragon took an experimental bite out of the table chewed it for a few seconds spat it out curled up and went to sleep he aint going to set fire to anything is he said the sergeant anxiously terry pratchett i dont think so he doesnt seem to have worked out what his flame ducts are for yet said lady ramkin you cant teach him anything about relaxing though said vimes anyway men oook i wasnt talking to you sir whats this doing here er said sergeant colon hurriedly i erwith you being away and all and us likely to be shorthanded carrot here says its all according to the law and that i swore him in sir the ape sir swore him in what sergeant said vimes as special constable sir said colon blushing you know sir sort of citizens watch vimes threw up his hands special bloody uniquel the librarian gave vimes a big smile just temporarily sir for the duration like said colon pleadingly we could do with the help sir and well hes the only one who seems to like us i think its a frightfully good idea said lady ramkin well done that ape vimes shrugged the world was mad enough already what could make it worse okay he said okay i give in fine give him a badge although im damned if i know where hell wear it fine yes why not you all right captain said colon all concern fine fine welcome to the new watch snapped vimes striding vaguely around the room great after all we pay peanuts dont we so we might as well employ mon the sergeants hand slapped respectfully across vimess mouth er just one thing captain said colon urgently to vimess astonished eyes you dont use the m word gets right up his nose sir he cant help it he loses all selfcontrol like a red rag to a wossname sir ape is all right sir but not the m word because sir when he gets angry he doesnt just go and sulk sir if you get my drift hes no trouble at all apart from that sir all right just dont say monkey ohshit guards guards the brethren were nervous hed heard them talking things were moving too fast for them he thought hed led them into the conspiracy a bit at a time never giving them more truth than their little brains could cope with but hed still overestimated them a firm hand was needed firm but fair brothers said the supreme grand master are the cuffs of veracity duly enhanced what said brother watchtower vaguely oh the cuffs yeah enhanced right and the martlets of beckoning are they fittingly divested brother plasterer gave a guilty start me what oh fine no problem divested yes the supreme grand master paused brothers he said softly we are so near just once more just a few hours once more and the world is ours do you understand brothers brother plasterer shuffled a foot well he said i mean of course yes no fears about that behind you one hundred and ten percent hes going to say only thought the supreme grand master only ah we that is all of us weve been odd really you feel so different dont you after summoning the dragon sort of cleaned out said brother plasterer helpfully yes like its sort of brother watchtower struggled with the serpents of selfexpression taking something out of you sucked dry said brother plasterer yes like he said and we well its maybe its a bit risky like stuffs been dragged from your actual living brain by eldritch creatures from the beyond said brother plasterer id have said more like a bit of a sick headache myself said brother watchtower helplessly and we was wondering you know about all this stuff about cosmic balance and that because well look what happened to poor old dunnykin could be a bit of a judgement er it was just a maddened crocodile hidden in a flower bed said the supreme grand master it could have happened to anyone i understand your feelings however terry pratchett guards guards you do said brother watchtower oh yes theyre only natural all the greatest wizards feel a little illatease before undertaking a great work such as this the brethren preened themselves great wizards thats us yeah but in a few hours itll be over and i am sure that the king will reward you handsomely the future will be glorious this normally did the trick it didnt appear to be working this time but the dragon brother watchtower began there wont be any dragon we wont need it look said the supreme grand master its quite simple the lad will have a marvellous sword everyone knows kings have marvellous swords thisd be the marvellous sword youve been telling us about would it said brother plasterer and when it touches the dragon said the supreme grand master itll be fooml yeah they do that said brother doorkeeper my uncle kicked a swamp dragon once he found it eating his pumpkins damn thing nearly took his leg off the supreme grand master sighed a few more hours yes and then no more of this the only thing he hadnt decided was whether to let them alone whod believe them after all or send the guard to arrest them for being terminally stupid no he said patiently i mean the dragon will vanish well have sent it back end of dragon wont people be a bit suspicious said brother plasterer wont they expect lumps of dragon all over the place no said the supreme grand master triumphantly because one touch from the sword of truth and justice will totally destroy the spawn of evil the brethren stared at him thats what theyll believe anyway he added we can provide a bit of mystic smoke at the time dead easy mystic smoke said brother fingers no bits then said brother plasterer a shade disappointed brother watchtower coughed dunno if people will accept that he said sounds a bit too neat like listen snapped the supreme grand master theyll accept anything theyll see it happenl people will be so keen to see the boy win they wont think twice about it depend upon it now let us commence he concentrated yes it was easier easier every time he could feel the scales feel the rage of the dragon as he reached into the place where the dragons went and took control this was power and it was his sergeant colon winced ow dont be a big softy said lady ramkin cheerfully tightening the bandage with a wellpractised skill handed down through many generations of ramkin womenfolk he hardly touched you and hes very sorry said carrot sharply show the sergeant how sorry you are go on oook said the librarian sheepishly dont let him kiss me squeaked colon do you think picking someone up by their ankles and bouncing their head on the floor comes under the heading of striking a superior officer said carrot im not pressing charges me said the sergeant hurriedly can we get on said vimes impatiently were going to see if errol can sniff out the dragons lair lady ramkin thinks its got to be worth a try you mean set a deep hole with springloaded sides tripwires whirling knife blades driven by water power broken glass and scorpions to catch a thief captain said the sergeant doubtfully ow yes we dont want to lose the scent said lady ramkin stop being a big baby sergeant brilliant idea about using errol maam if i may make so bold said nobby while the sergeant blushed under his bandage vimes was not certain how long he would be able to put up with nobby the social mountaineer carrot said nothing he was gradually coming to terms with the fact that he probably wasnt a dwarf but dwarf blood flowed in his veins in accordance with the famous principle of morphic resonance and his borrowed genes were telling him that nothing terry pratchett was going to be that simple finding a hoard even when the dragon wasnt at home was pretty risky anyway he was certain hed know if there was one around the presence of large amounts of gold always made a dwarfs palms itch and his werent itching well start by that wall in the shades said the captain sergeant colon glanced sideways at lady ramkin and found it impossible to show cowardice in the face of the supportive he contented himself with is that wise captain of course it isnt if we were wise we wouldnt be in the watch i say all this is tremendously exciting said lady ramkin oh i dont think you should come mlady vimes began sybil please its a very disreputable area you see but im sure i shall be perfectly safe with your men she said im sure vagabonds just melt away when they see you thats dragons thought vimes they melt away when they see dragons and just leave their shadows on the wall whenever he felt that he was slowing down or that he was losing interest he remembered those shadows and it was like having dull fire poured down his backbone things like that shouldnt be allowed to happen not in my city in fact the shades were not a problem many of its denizens were out hoardhunting anyway and those that remained were far less inclined than hitherto to lurk in dark alleys besides the more sensible of them recognised that lady ramkin if waylaid would probably tell them to pull up their socks and not be silly in a voice so used to command that they would probably find themselves doing it the wall hadnt been knocked down yet and still bore its grisly fresco errol sniffed around it trotted up the alley once or twice and went to sleep dint work said sergeant colon good idea though said nobby loyally it could be all the rain and people walking about i suppose said lady ramkin vimes scooped up the dragon it had been a vain hope anyway guards guards it was just better to be doing something than nothing wed better get back he said the suns gone down they walked back in silence the dragons even tamed the shades vimes thought its taken over the whole city even when it isnt here people start tying virgins to rocks any day now its a metaphor of human bloody existence a dragon and if that wasnt bad enough its also a bloody great hot flying thing he pulled out the key to the new headquarters while he was fumbling in the lock errol woke up and started to yammer not now vimes said his side twinged the night had barely started and already he felt too tired a slate slid down the roof and smashed on the cobbles beside him captain hissed sergeant colon what its on the roof captain something about the sergeants voice got through to vimes it wasnt excited it wasnt frightened it just had a tone of dull leaden terror he looked up errol started to bounce up and down under his arm the dragon the dragon was peering down interestedly over the guttering its face alone was taller than a man its eyes were the size of very large eyes coloured a smouldering red and filled with an intelligence that had nothing to do with human beings it was far older for one thing it was an intelligence that had already been long basted in guile and marinated in cunning by the time a group of almostmonkeys were wondering whether standing on two legs was a good career move it wasnt an intelligence that had any truck with or even understood the arts of diplomacy it wouldnt play with you or ask you riddles but it understood all about arrogance and power and cruelty and if it could possibly manage it it would burn your head off because it liked to it was even more angry than usual at the moment it could sense something behind its eyes a tiny weak alien mind bloated with selfsatisfaction it was infuriating like an unscratchable itch it was making it do things it didnt want to do and stopping it from doing things it wanted to do very much terry pratchett those eyes were for the moment focused on errol who was going frantic vimes realised that all that stood between him and a million degrees of heat was the dragons vague interest in why vimes had a smaller dragon under his arm dont make any sudden moves said lady ramkins voice behind him and dont show fear they can always tell when youre afraid is there any other advice you can offer at this time said vimes slowly trying to speak without moving his lips well tickling them behind their ears often works oh said vimes weakly and a good sharp no and taking away their food bowl ah and hitting them on the nose with a roll of paper is what i do in extreme cases in the slow brightlyoutlined desperate world vimes was now inhabiting which seemed to revolve around the craggy nostrils a few metres away from him he became aware of a gentle hissing sound the dragon was taking a deep breath the intake of air stopped vimes looked into the darkness of the flame ducts and wondered whether hed see anything whether thered be some tiny white glow or something before fiery oblivion swept over him at that moment a horn rang out the dragon raised its head in a puzzled way and made a noise that sounded vaguely interrogative without being in any way a word the horn rang out again the noise seemed to have a number of echoes that lived a life of their own it sounded like a challenge if that wasnt what it was then the horn blower was soon going to be in trouble because the dragon gave vimes a smouldering look unfolded its enormous wings leapt heavily into the air and against all the rules of aeronautics flew slowly away in the direction of the sound nothing in the world should have been able to fly like that the wings thumped up and down with a noise like potted thunder but the dragon moved as though it was idly sculling through the air if it stopped flapping the movement suggested it would simply glide to a halt it floated not flew for something guards guards the size of a barn with an armourplated hide it was a pretty good trick it passed over their heads like a barge heading for the plaza of broken moons follow it shouted lady ramkin thats not right it flying like that im pretty sure theres something in one of the witchcraft laws said carrot taking out his notebook and its damaged the roof its really piling up the offences you know you all right captain said sergeant colon i could see right up its nose said captain vimes dreamily his eyes focused on the worried face of the sergeant wheres it gone he demanded colon pointed along the street vimes glowered at the shape disappearing over the rooftops follow it he said the horn sounded again other people were hurrying towards the plaza the dragon drifted ahead of them like a shark heading towards a wayward airbed its tail flicking slowly from side to side some loony is going to fight it said nobby i thought someone would have a go said colon poor buggerll be baked in his own armour this seemed to be the opinion of the crowds lining the plaza the people of ankhmorpork had a straightforward nononsense approach to entertainment and while they were looking forward to seeing a dragon slain theyd be happy to settle instead for seeing someone being baked alive in his own armour you didnt get the chance every day to see someone baked alive in their own armour it would be something for the children to remember vimes was jostled and bounced around by the crowd as more people flooded into the plaza behind them the horn sounded a third challenge thats a slughorn that is said colon knowledgeably like a tocsin only deeper you sure said nobby terry pratchett yep it must have been a bloody big slug peanuts figgins hot sausages whined a voice behind them hallo lads hallo captain vimes in at the death eh have a sausage on the house whats going on throat said vimes clinging to the vendors tray as more people spilled around them some kids ridden into the city and said hed kill the dragon said cutmeownthroat got a magic sword he says has he got a magic skin youve got no romance in your soul captain said throat removing a very hot toasting fork from the tiny frying pan on his tray and applying it gently to the buttock of a large woman in front of him stand aside madam commerce is the lifeblood of the city thank you very much ocourse he continued by rights there should be a maiden chained to a rock only the aunt said no thats the trouble with some people no sense of tradition this lad says hes the rightful air too vimes shook his head the world was definitely going mad around him youve lost me there he said air said throat patiently you know air to the throne what throne the throne of ankh what throne of ankh you know kings and that throat looked reflective wish i knew what his bloody name is he said i put an order in to igneous the trolls allnight wholesale pottery for three gross of coronation mugs and its going to be a right pain painting all the names in afterwards shall i put you down for a couple capn to you ninety pence and thats cutting me own throat vimes gave up and shoved his way back through the throng using carrot as a lighthouse the lanceconstable loomed over the crowd and the rest of the rank had anchored themselves to him its all gone mad he shouted whats going on carrot theres a lad on a horse in the middle of the plaza said carrot hes got a glittery sword you know doesnt seem to be doing much at the moment though vimes fought his way into the lee of lady ramkin kings he panted of ankh and thrones are there guards guards what oh yes there used to be said lady ramkin hundreds of years ago why some kid says hes heir to the throne thats right said throat whod followed vimes in the hope of clinching a sale he made a big speech about how he was going to kill the dragon overthrow the usurpers and right all wrongs everyone cheered hot sausages two for a dollar made of genuine pig why not buy one for the lady dont you mean pork sir said carrot warily eyeing the glistening tubes manner of speaking manner of speaking said throat quickly certainly your actual pig products genuine pig everyone cheers any speech in this city growled vimes it doesnt mean anything get your pig sausages five for two dollars said throat who never let a conversation stand in the way of trade could be good for business could monarchy pig sausages pig sausages inna bun and righting all wrongs too sounds like a solid idea to me with onions can i press you to a hot sausage maam said nobby lady ramkin looked at the tray around throats neck thousands of years of good breeding came to her aid and there was only the faintest suggestion of horror in her voice when she said my they look good what splendid foodstuffs are they made by monks on some mystic mountain said carrot throat gave him an odd look no he said patiently by pigs what wrongs said vimes urgently come on tell me what wrongs is he going to right weell said throat theres well taxes thats wrong for a start he had the grace to look slightly embarrassed paying taxes was something that in throats world happened only to other people thats right said an old woman next to him and the gutter of my house leaks something dreadful and the landlord wont do nothing thats wrong and premature baldness said the man in front of her thats wrong too vimess mouth dropped open ah kings can cure that you know said another protomonarchist knowingly terry pratchett guards guards as a matter of fact said throat rummaging in his pack ive got one bottle left of this astonishing ointment what is made he glared at carrot by some ancient monks who live on a mountain and they cant answer back you know the monarchist went on thats how you can tell theyre royal completely incapable of it its to do with being gracious fancy said the leakyguttering woman money too said the monarchist enjoying the attention they dont carry it thats how you can always tell a king why its not that heavy said the man whose remaining hair was spread across the dome of his head like the remnant of a defeated army can carry hundreds of dollars no problem you probably get weak arms being a king said the woman wisely probably with the waving ive always thought said the monarchist pulling out a pipe and beginning to fill it with the ponderous air of one who is going to deliver a lecture that one of the major problems of being a king is the risk of your daughter getting a prick there was a thoughtful pause and falling asleep for a hundred years the monarchist went on stolidly ah said the others unaccountably relieved and then theres wear and tear on peas he added well there would be said the woman uncertainly having to sleep on them all the time said the monarchist not to mention hundreds of mattresses right is that so i think i could get em for him wholesale said throat he turned to vimes who had been listening to all this with leaden depression see captain and youd be in the royal guard i expect get some plumes in your helmet ah pageantry said the monarchist pointing with his pipe very important lots of spectacles what free said throat weell i think maybe you have to pay for the frames said the monarchist youre all bloody mad shouted vimes you dont know anything about him and he hasnt even won yet bit of a formality i expect said the woman its a firebreathing dragon screamed vimes remembering those nostrils and hes just a guy on a horse for heavens sake throat prodded him gently in the breastplate you got no soul capn he said when a stranger comes into the city under the thrall of the dragon and challenges it with a glittery sword weeell theres only one outcome aint there its probably destiny thrall shouted vimes thrall you thieving bugger throat you were flogging cuddly dragon dolls yesterday thats was just business capn no need to get excited about it said throat pleasantly vimes went back to the rank in a gloomy rage say what you liked about the people of ankhmorpork they had always been staunchly independent yielding to no man their right to rob defraud embezzle and murder on an equal basis this seemed absolutely right to vimess way of thinking there was no difference at all between the richest man and the poorest beggar apart from the fact that the former had lots of money food power fine clothes and good health but at least he wasnt any better just richer fatter more powerful better dressed and healthier it had been like that for hundreds of years and now they get one sniff of an ermine robe and they go all gooey he muttered the dragon was circling the plaza slowly and warily vimes craned to see over the heads in front of him in the same way that various predators have the silhouette of their prey almost programmed into their genes it was possible that the shape of someone on a horse holding a sword clicked a few tumblers in a dragons brain it was showing keen but wary interest back in the crowd vimes shrugged i didnt even know we were a kingdom well we havent been for ages said lady ramkin the kings got thrown out and jolly good job too they could be quite frightful but youre well from a pos from a highborn family he said i should have thought youd be all for kings some of them were fearful oiks you know she said airily wives all over the place and chopping peoples heads off fighting pointless wars eating with their knife chucking half terry pratchett eaten chicken legs over their shoulders that sort of thing not our sort of people at all the plaza went quiet the dragon had flapped slowly to the far end and was almost stationary in the air apart from the slow beating of its wings vimes felt something claw gently at his back and then errol was on his shoulder gripping with his hind claws his stubby wings were beating in time with those of the bigger specimen he was hissing his eyes were fixed on the hovering bulk the boys horse jigged nervously on the plazas flagstones as he dismounted flourished the sword and turned to face the distant enemy he certainly looks confident vimes told himself on the other hand how does the ability to slay dragons fit you for kingship in this day and age it was certainly a very shiny sword you had to admit that and now it was two of the clock the following morning and all was well apart from the rain it was drizzling again there are some towns in the multiverse which think they know how to have a good time places like new orleans and rio reckon they not only know how to push the boat out but set fire to the harbour as well but compared to ankhmorpork with its hair down theyre a welsh village at pm on a wet sunday afternoon fireworks banged and sparkled in the damp air over the turbid mud of the river ankh various domesticated animals were being roasted in the streets dancers congad from house to house often managing to pick up any loose ornaments while doing so there was a lot of quaffing going on people who in normal circumstances would never think of doing it were shouting hurrah vimes stalked gloomily through the crowded streets feeling like the only pickled onion in a fruit salad hed given the rank the evening off he wasnt feeling at all royalist he didnt think he had anything against kings as such but the sight of ankhmorporkians waving flags was mysteriously upsetting that was something only silly subject people did in other countries guards guards besides the idea of royal plumes in his hat revolted him hed always had a thing about plumes plumes sort of well bought you off told everyone that you didnt belong to yourself and hed feel like a bird itd be the last straw his errant feet led him back to the yard after all where else was there his lodgings were depressing and his landlady had complained about the holes which despite much shouting errol kept making in the carpet and the smell errol made and vimes couldnt drink in a tavern tonight without seeing things that would upset him even more than the things he normally saw when he was drunk it was nice and quiet although the distant sounds of revelry could be heard through the window errol scrambled down from his shoulder and started to eat the coke in the fireplace vimes sat back and put his feet up what a day and what a fight the dodging the weaving the shouts of the crowd the young man standing there looking tiny and unprotected the dragon taking a deep breath in a way now very familiar to vimes and not flaming that had surprised vimes it had surprised the crowd it had certainly surprised the dragon which had tried to squint at its own nose and clawed desperately at its flame ducts it had remained surprised right up to the moment when the lad ducked in under one claw and thrust the sword home and then a thunderclap youd have thought thered have been some bits of dragon left really vimes pulled a scrap of paper towards him he looked at the notes hed made yesterday itym heavy draggon but yet it can flye right welle itym the fyre be main hot yet issueth from ane living thinge itym the swamp dragons be right poor thinges yet this monstrous form waxeth full mightily itym from whence it cometh none knowe nor wither it goeth nor where it bideth betweentimes itym whyfore did it burneth so neatlie he pulled the pen and ink towards him and in a slow round hand added terry pratchett itym can a draggon be destroyed into utterlye noethinge he thought for a while and continued itym why fore did it explode that noone may find it search they greatly a puzzler that lady ramkin said that when a swamp dragon exploded there was dragon everywhere and this one had been a damn great thing admittedly its insides must have been an alchemical nightmare but the citizens of ankhmorpork should still have been spending the night shovelling dragon off the streets noone seemed to have bothered about this the purple smoke was quite impressive though errol finished off the coke and started on the fire irons so far this evening he had eaten three cobblestones a doorknob something unidentifiable hed found in the gutter and to general astonishment three of cutmeownthroats sausages made of genuine pork organs the crunching of the poker going down mingled with the patter of rain on the windows vimes stared at the paper again and then wrote itym how can kinges come of noethinge he hadnt even seen the lad close to he looked personable enough not exactly a great thinker but definitely the kind of profile you wouldnt mind seeing on your small change mind you after killing the dragon he could have been a crosseyed goblin for all that it mattered the mob had borne him in triumph to the patricians palace lord vetinari had been locked up in his own dungeons he hadnt put up much fight apparently just smiled at everyone and went quietly what a happy coincidence for the city that just when it needed a champion to kill the dragon a king came forth vimes turned this thought over for a while then he turned it back to front he picked up the quill and wrote itym what a happy chance it be for a lad that would be kings that there be a draggon to sloe to prove beyond doubt his boney fiddes guards guards it was a lot better than birthmarks and swords that was for sure he twiddled the quill for a while and then doodled itym the draggon was not a mechanical devise yette surely no wizzard has the power to create a beaste of that mag magg maggnyt size itym whye in the pinche could it not flame itym where did it come from itym where did it goe the rain pounded harder on the window the sounds of celebration became distinctly damp and then faded completely there was a murmur of thunder vimes underlined goe several times after further consideration he added two more question marks after staring at the effect for some time he rolled the paper into a ball and threw it into the fireplace where it was fielded and swallowed by errol there had been a crime senses vimes didnt know he possessed ancient policemans senses prickled the hairs on his neck and told him there had been a crime it was probably such an odd crime that it didnt figure anywhere in carrots book but it had been committed all right a handful of hightemperature murders was only the start of it hed find it and give it a name then he stood up took his leather rain cape from its hook behind the door and stepped out into the naked city this is where the dragons went they lie not dead not asleep not waiting because waiting implies expectation possibly the word were looking for here is angry it could remember the feel of real air under its wings and the sheer pleasure of the flame there had been empty skies above and an interesting world below full of strange running creatures existence had a different texture there a better texture and just when it was beginning to enjoy it it had been crippled terry pratchett stopped from flaming and whipped back like some hairy canine mammal the world had been taken away from it in the reptilian synapses of the dragons mind the suggestion was kindled that just possibly it could get the world back it had been summoned and disdainfully banished again but perhaps there was a trail a scent a thread which would lead it to the sky perhaps there was a pathway of thought itself it recalled a mind the peevish voice so full of its own diminutive importance a mind almost like that of a dragon but on a tiny tiny scale aha it stretched its wings lady ramkin made herself a cup of cocoa and listened to the rain gurgling in the pipes outside she slipped off the hated dancing shoes which even she was prepared to concede were like a pair of pink canoes but nobblyess obligay as the funny little sergeant would say and as the last representative of one of ankhmorporks oldest families shed had to go to the victory ball to show willing lord vetinari seldom had balls there was a popular song about it in fact but now it was going to be balls all the way she couldnt stand balls for sheer enjoyment it wasnt a patch on mucking out dragons you knew where you were mucking out dragons you didnt get hot and pink and have to eat silly things on sticks or wear a dress that made you look like a cloud full of cherubs little dragons didnt give a damn what you looked like so long as there was a feeding bowl in your hands funny really shed always thought it took weeks months to organise a ball invitations decorations sausages on poles ghastly chickeny mixture to force into those little pastry cases but it had all been done in a matter of hours as if someone had been expecting it one of the miracles of catering obviously shed even danced with the for want of a better word new king who had said some polite words to her although they had been rather muffled guards guards and a coronation tomorrow youd have thought itd take months to sort out she was still musing on that as she mixed the dragons late night feed of rock oil and peat spiked with flowers of sulphur she didnt bother to change out of the ballgown but slipped the heavy apron over the top donned the gloves and helmet pulled the visor down over her face and ran clutching the feed buckets through the driving rain to the shed she knew it as soon as she opened the door normally the arrival of food would be greeted with hoots and whistles and brief bursts of flame the dragons each in its pen were sitting up in attentive silence and staring up through the roof it was somehow scary she clanged the buckets together no need to be afraid nasty big dragon all gone she said brightly get stuck in to this you people one or two of them gave her a brief glance and then went back to their what they didnt seem to be frightened just very very attentive it was like a vigil they were waiting for something to happen the thunder muttered again a couple of minutes later she was on her way down into the damp city there are some songs which are never sung sober nellie dean is one so is any song beginning as i was a walking in the area around ankhmorpork the favoured air is a wizards staff has a knob on the end the rank were drunk at least two out of three of the rank were drunk carrot had been persuaded to try a shandy and hadnt liked it much he didnt know all the words either and many of the ones he did know he didnt understand oh i see he said eventually its a sort of humorous play on words is it you know said colon wistfully peering into the thickening mists rolling in off the ankh sat times like this i wish old youre not to say it said nobby swaying a little you terry pratchett agreed we wouldnt say nothing its no good talking about it it was his favourite song said colon sadly he was a good light tenor now sarge he was a righteous man our gaskin said colon we couldnt of helped it said nobby sulkily we could have said colon we could have run faster what happened then said carrot he died said nobby in the hexecution of his duty i told him said colon taking a swig at the bottle they had brought along to see them through the night i told him slow down i said youll do yourself a mischief i said i dont know what got into him running ahead like that i blame the thieves guild said nobby allowing people like that on the streets there was this bloke we saw done a robbery one night said colon miserably right in front of us and captain vimes he said come on and we run only the point is you shouldnt run too fast see else you might catch them leads to all sorts of problems catching people they dont like it said nobby there was a mutter of thunder and a flurry of rain they dont like it agreed colon but gaskin went and forgot he ran on went round the corner and well this bloke had a couple of mates waiting it was his heart really said nobby well anyway and there he was said colon captain vimes was very upset about it you shouldnt run fast in the watch lad he said solemnly you can be a fast guard or you can be an old guard but you cant be a fast old guard poor old gaskin it didnt ought to be like that said carrot colon took a pull at the bottle well it is he said rain bounced on his helmet and trickled down his face but it didnt ought to be said carrot flatly but it is said colon guards guards someone else in the city was also ill at ease he was the librarian sergeant colon had given him a badge the librarian turned it round and round in his big gentle hands nibbling at it it wasnt that the city suddenly had a king orangs are traditionalists and you couldnt get more traditional than a king but they also liked things neat and things werent neat or rather they were too neat truth and reality were never as neat as this sudden heirs to ancient thrones didnt grow on trees and he should know besides noone was looking for his book that was human priorities for you the book was the key to it he was sure of that well there was one way to find out what was in the book it was a perilous way but the librarian ambled along perilous ways all day in the silence of the sleeping library he opened his desk and removed from its deepest recesses a small lantern carefully built to prevent any naked flame being exposed you couldnt be too careful with all this paper around he also took a bag of peanuts and after some thought a large ball of string he bit off a short length of the string and used it to tie the badge around his neck like a talisman then he tied one end of the ball to the desk and after a moments contemplation knuckled off between the bookshelves paying out the string behind him knowledge equals power the string was important after a while the librarian stopped he concentrated all his powers of librarianship power equals energy people were stupid sometimes they thought the library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books which was true enough but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library energy equals matter he swung into an avenue of shelving that was apparently a few feet long and walked along it briskly for half an hour matter equals mass and mass distorts space it distorts it into polyfractal lspace terry pratchett so while the dewey system has its fine points when youre setting out to look something up in the multidimensional folds of lspace what you really need is a ball of string now the rain was trying hard it glistened off the flagstones in the plaza of broken moons littered here and there with torn bunting flags broken bottles and the occasional regurgitated supper there was still plenty of thunder about and a green fresh smell in the air a few shreds of mist from the ankh hovered over the stones it would be dawn soon vimess footsteps echoed wetly from the surrounding buildings as he picked his way across the plaza the boy had stood here he peered through the mist shreds at the surrounding buildings getting his bearings so the dragon had been hovering he paced forward here and said vimes this is where it was killed he fumbled in his pockets there were all sorts of things in there keys bits of string corks his finger closed on a stub end of chalk he knelt down errol jumped off his shoulder and waddled away to inspect the detritus of the celebration he always sniffed everything before he ate it vimes noticed it was a bit of a puzzle why he bothered because he always ate it anyway its head had been about lets see here he walked backwards dragging the chalk over the stones progressing slowly over the damp empty square like an ancient worshipper treading a maze here a wing curving away towards a tail which stretched out to here change hands now head for the other wing when he finished he walked to the centre of the outline and ran his hands over the stones he realised he was halfexpecting them to be warm surely there should be something some oh he didnt know some grease or something some crispy fried dragon lumps errol started eating a broken bottle with every sign of enjoyment you know what i think said vimes i think it went somewhere guards guards thunder rolled again all right all right muttered vimes it was just a thought it wasnt that dramatic errol stopped in midcrunch very slowly as though it was mounted on very smooth welloiled bearings the dragons head turned to face upwards what it was staring at intently was a patch of empty air there wasnt much else you could say about it vimes shivered under his cape this was daft look dont muck about he said theres nothing there errol started to tremble its just the rain said vimes go on finish your bottle nice bottle a thin worried keening noise broke from the dragons mouth ill show you said vimes he cast around and spotted one of throats sausages cast aside by a hungry reveller who had decided he was never going to be that hungry he picked it up look he said and threw it upwards he felt sure watching its trajectory that it ought to have fallen back to the ground it shouldnt have fallen away as if hed dropped it neatly into a tunnel in the sky and the tunnel shouldnt have been looking back at him vivid purple lightning lashed from the empty air and struck the houses on the near side of the plaza skittering across the walls for several yards before winking out with a suddenness that almost denied that it had ever happened at all then it erupted again this time hitting the rimward wall the light broke where it hit into a network of searching tendrils spreading across the stones the third attempt went upwards forming an actinic column that eventually rose fifty or sixty feet in the air appeared to stabilise and started to spin slowly vimes felt that a comment was called for he said arrgh as the light revolved it sent out thin zigzag streamers that jittered away across the rooftops sometimes dipping sometimes doubling back searching errol ran up vimess back in a flurry of claws and fastened himself firmly on his shoulder the excruciating agony recalled to vimes that there was something he should be doing was it time to scream again he tried another arrgh no probably not terry pratchett the air started to smell like burning tin lady ramkins coach rattled into the plaza making a noise like a roulette wheel and pounded straight for vimes stopping in a skid that sent it juddering around in a semicircle and forced the horses either to face the other way or plait their legs a furious vision in padded leather gauntlets tiara and thirty yards of damp pink tulle leaned down towards him and screamed come on you bloody idiot one glove caught him under his unresisting shoulder and hauled him bodily on to the box and stop screaming the phantom ordered focusing generations of natural authority into four syllables another shout spurred the horses from a bewildered standing start to a full gallop the coach bounced away over the flagstones an exploratory tendril of flickering light brushed the reins for a moment and then lost interest i suppose you havent got any idea whats happening shouted vimes against the crackling of the spinning fire not the foggiest the crawling lines spread like a web over the city growing fainter with distance vimes imagined them creeping through windows and sneaking under doors it looks as though its searching for something he shouted then getting away before it finds it is a firstclass idea dont you think a tongue of fire hit the dark tower of art slid blindly down its ivygrown flanks and disappeared through the dome of unseen universitys library the other lines blinked out lady ramkin brought the coach to a halt at the far side of the square what does it want the library for she said frowning maybe it wants to look something up dont be silly she said breezily theres just a lot of books in there what would a flash of lightning want to read something very short i really think you could try to be a bit more help the line of light exploded into an arc between the librarys dome and the centre of the plaza and hung in the air a band of brilliance several feet across guards guards then in a sudden rush it became a sphere of fire which grew swiftly to encompass almost all the plaza vanished suddenly and left the night full of ringing violet shadows and the plaza full of dragon who would have thought it so much power so close at hand the dragon could feel the magic flowing into it renewing it from second to second in defiance of all boring physical laws this wasnt the poor fare it had been given before this was the right stuff there was no end to what it could do with power like this but first it had to pay its respects to certain people it sniffed the dawn air it was searching for the stink of minds noble dragons dont have friends the nearest they can get to the idea is an enemy who is still alive the air became very still so still that you could almost hear the slow fall of dust the librarian swung on his knuckles between the endless bookshelves the dome of the library was still overhead but then it always was it seemed quite logical to the librarian that since there were aisles where the shelves were on the outside then there should be other aisles in the space between the books themselves created out of quantum ripples by the sheer weight of words there were certainly some odd sounds coming from the other side of some shelving and the librarian knew that if he gently pulled out a book or two he would be peeking into different libraries under different skies books bend space and time one reason the owners of those aforesaid little rambling poky secondhand bookshops always seem slightly unearthly is that many of them really are having strayed into this world after taking a wrong turning in their own bookshops in worlds where it is considered commendable business practice to wear carpet slippers all the time and open your shop only when you feel like it you stray into lspace at your peril very senior librarians however once they have proved themselves terry pratchett worthy by performing some valiant act of librarianship are accepted into a secret order and are taught the raw arts of survival beyond the shelves we know the librarian was highly skilled in all of them but what he was attempting now wouldnt just get him thrown out of the order but probably out of life itself all libraries everywhere are connected in lspace all libraries everywhere and the librarian navigating by booksign carved on shelves by past explorers navigating by smell navigating even by the siren whisperings of nostalgia was heading purposely for one very special one there was one consolation if he got it wrong hed never know it somehow the dragon was worse on the ground in the air it was an elemental thing graceful even when it was trying to burn you to your boots on the ground it was just a damn great animal its huge head reared against the grey of dawn turning slowly lady ramkin and vimes peered cautiously from behind a watertrough vimes had his hand clamped over errols muzzle the little dragon was whimpering like a kicked puppy and fighting to get away its a magnificent brute said lady ramkin in what she probably thought was a whisper i do wish you wouldnt keep saying that said vimes there was a scraping noise as the dragon dragged itself over the stones i knew it wasnt killed growled vimes there were no bits it was too neat it was sent somewhere by some sort of magic i bet look at it its bloody impossible it needs magic to keep it alive what do you mean said lady ramkin not tearing her gaze from its armoured flanks what did he mean what did he mean he thought fast its just not physically possible thats what i mean he said nothing that heavy should be able to fly or breathe fire like that i told you but it looks real enough i mean youd expect a magical creature to be well gauzy guards guards oh its real its real all right said ramkin bitterly but supposing it needs magic like we need like we need sunlight or food its a thaumivore you mean i just think it eats magic thats all said vimes who had not had a classical education i mean all these little swamp dragons always on the point of extinction suppose one day back in prehistoric times some of them found out how to use magic there used to be a lot of natural magic around once said lady ramkin thoughtfully there you are then after all creatures use the air and the sea i mean if theres a natural resource around somethings going to use it arent they then it wouldnt matter about bad digestion and weight and wing size and so on because the magic would take care of it wow but youd need a lot he thought he wasnt certain how much magic youd need to change the world enough to let tons of armoured carcass flit around the sky like a swallow but hed bet it was lots all those thefts someoned been feeding the dragon he looked at the bulk of the unseen university library of magic books the greatest accumulation of distilled magical power on the discworld and now the dragon had learned how to feed itself he became terribly aware that lady ramkin had moved and saw to his horror that she was striding towards the dragon chin stuck out like an anvil what the hell are you doing he whispered loudly if its descended from the swamp dragons then i can probably control it she called back you have to look them in the eye and use a nononsense tone of voice they cant resist a stern human voice they dont have the willpower you know theyre just big softies to his shame vimes realised that his legs were going to have nothing to do with any mad dash to drag her back his pride didnt like that but his body pointed out that it wasnt his pride that stood a very reasonable chance of being thinly laminated to the nearest building through ears burning with embarrassment he heard her say bad boy the echoes of that stern injunction rang out across the plaza terry pratchett oh gods he thought is that how you train a dragon point them at the melted patch on the floor and threaten to rub their nose in it he risked a peep over the horsetrough the dragons head was swinging around slowly like a crane jib it had some difficulty focusing on her right below it vimes could see the great red eyes narrow as the creature tried to squint down the length of its own nose it looked puzzled he wasnt surprised sit bellowed lady ramkin in a tone so undisobeyable that even vimes felt his legs involuntarily sag good boy i think i may have a lump of coke somewhere she patted her pockets eye contact that was the important thing she really vimes thought shouldnt have looked down even for a moment the dragon raised one talon in a leisurely fashion and pinned her to the ground as vimes halfrose in horror errol escaped from his grip and cleared the trough in one leap he bounced across the plaza in a series of wingwhirring arcs mouth gaping emitting wheezing burps trying to flame he was answered with a tongue of bluewhite fire that melted a streak of bubbling rock several yards long but failed to strike the challenger it was hard to pick him out of the air because quite clearly even errol didnt know where he was going to be or what way up he was going to be when he got there his only hope at this point lay in movement and he vaulted and spun between the increasingly furious bursts of fire like a scared but determined random particle the great dragon reared up with the sound of a dozen anchor chains being thrown into a corner and tried to bat the tormenter out of the air vimess legs gave in at that point and decided that they might allow themselves to be heroic legs for a while he scurried across the intervening space sword at the ready for what good it might do grabbed lady ramkin by an arm and a handful of bedraggled ballgown and swung her on to his shoulder he got several yards before the essential bad judgement of this move dawned on him he went gngh his vertebrae and knees were trying to fuse into one lump purple spots flashed on and off in front of his eyes on top of it all something unfamiliar but apparently made of guards guards whalebone was poking sharply into the back of his neck he managed a few more steps by sheer momentum knowing that when he stopped he was going to be utterly crushed the ramkins hadnt bred for beauty theyd bred for healthy solidity and big bones and theyd got very good at it over the centuries a gout of livid dragonfire crackled into the flagstones a few feet away afterwards he wondered if hed only imagined leaping several inches into the air and covering the rest of the distance to the horsetrough at a respectable run perhaps in extremis everyone learned the kind of instant movement that was second nature to nobby anyway the horsetrough was behind him and lady ramkin was in his arms or at least was pinning his arms to the ground he managed to free them and tried to massage a bit of life back what did you do next she didnt seem to be injured he recalled something about loosening a persons clothing but in lady ramkins case that might be dangerous without special tools she solved the immediate problem by grabbing the edge of the trough and hauling herself upright right she said its the slipper for you her eyes focused on vimes for the first time what the hells going on she began again and then caught the scene over his shoulder oh sod she said pardon my klatchian errol was running out of energy the stubby wings were indeed incapable of real flight and he was remaining airborne solely by flapping madly like a chicken the great talons swished through the air one of them caught one of the plazas fountains and demolished it the next one swatted errol neatly he shot over vimess head in a straight rising line hit a roof behind him and slid down it youve got to catch him shouted lady vimes you must its vital vimes stared at her and then dived forward as errols pearshaped body slithered over the edge of the roof and dropped he was surprisingly heavy thank goodness said lady ramkin struggling to her feet they explode so easily you know it could have been very dangerous terry pratchett they remembered the other dragon it wasnt the exploding sort it was the killingpeople kind they turned slowly the creature loomed over them sniffed and then as if they were of no importance at all turned away it sprang ponderously into the air and with one slow flap of its wings began to scull leisurely away down the plaza and up and into the mists that were rolling over the city vimes was currently more concerned with the smaller dragon in his hands its stomach was rumbling alarmingly he wished hed paid more attention to the book on dragons was a stomach noise like this a sign they were about to explode or was the point you had to watch out for the point when the rumbling stopped weve got to follow it said lady ramkin what happened to the carriage vimes waved a hand vaguely in the direction that as far as he could tell the horses had taken in their panic errol sneezed a cloud of warm gas that smelled worse than something walled up in a cellar pawed the air weakly licked vimess face with a tongue like a hot cheesegrater struggled out of his arms and trotted away wheres he off to boomed lady ramkin emerging from the mists dragging the horses behind her they didnt want to come their hooves were scraping up sparks but they were fighting a losing battle hes still trying to challenge it said vimes youd think hed give in wouldnt you they fight like blazes said lady ramkin as he climbed on to the coach its a matter of making your opponent explode you see i thought in nature the defeated animal just rolls on its back in submission and thats an end of it said vimes as they clattered after the disappearing swamp dragon wouldnt work with dragons said lady ramkin some daft creature rolls on its back you disembowel it thats how they look at it almost human really the clouds were clustered thickly over ankhmorpork above them the slow golden sunlight of the discworld unrolled the dragon sparkled in the dawn as it trod the air joyously guards guards doing impossible turns and rolls for the sheer delight of it then it remembered the business of the day theyd had the presumption to summon it below it the rank wandered from side to side up the street of small gods despite the thick fog it was beginning to get busy what dyou call them things like thin stairs said sergeant colon ladders said carrot lot ofem about said nobby he mooched over to the nearest one and kicked it oi a figure struggled down half buried in a string of flags whats going on said nobby the flag bearer looked him up and down who wants to know tiddler he said excuse me we do said carrot looming out of the fog like an iceberg the man gave a sickly grin well its the coronation isnt it he said got to get the streets ready for the coronation got to have the flags up got to get the old bunting out havent we nobby gave the dripping finery a jaundiced look doesnt look that old to me he said it looks new whatre them fat saggy things on that shield those are the royal hippos of ankh said the man proudly reminders of our noble heritage how long have we had a noble heritage then said nobby since yesterday of course you cant have a heritage in a day said carrot it has to last a long time if we havent got one said sergeant colon i bet well soon have had one my wife left me a note about it all these years and she turns out to be a monarchist he kicked the pavement viciously huh he said a man knocks his pipes out for thirty years to put a bit of meat on the table but all shes talking about is some boy who gets to be king for five minutes work know what was for my tea last night beef dripping sandwiches this did not have the expected response from the two bachelors cor said nobby real beef dripping said carrot the kind with the little crunchy bits on top and shiny blobs of fat cant remember when i last addressed the crust on a bowl of terry pratchett dripping mused nobby in a gastronomic heaven with just a bit of salt and pepper youve got a meal fit for a k dont even say it warned colon the best bit is when you stick the knife in and crack the fat and all the browny gold stuff bubbles up said carrot dreamily a moment like that is worth a ki shutup shutup shouted colon youre just what the hell was that they felt the sudden downdraught saw the mist above them roll into coils that broke against the house walls a blast of colder air swept along the street and was gone it was like something gliding past up there somewhere said the sergeant he froze here you dont think we saw it killed didnt we said nobby urgently we saw it vanish said carrot they looked at one another alone and damp in the mistshrouded street there could be anything up there the imagination peopled the dank air with terrible apparitions and what was worse was the knowledge that nature might have done an even better job nah said colon it was probably just somesome big wading bird or something isnt there anything we should do said carrot yes said nobby we should go away quickly remember gaskin maybe its another dragon said carrot we should warn people and no said sergeant colon vehemently because ae they wouldnt believe us and bee weve got a king now s his job dragons sright said nobby hed probably be really angry dragons are probably you know royal animals like deer a man could probably have his tridlins plucked just for thinking about killing one when theres a king around makes you glad youre common said colon commoner corrected nobby tridlins a short and unnecessary religious observance performed daily by the holy balancing dervishes of otherz according to the dictionary of eyewatering words guards guards thats not a very civic attitude carrot began he was interrupted by errol the little dragon came trotting up the middle of the street stumpy tail high his eyes fixed on the clouds above him he went right by the rank without giving them any attention at all whats up with him said nobby a clatter behind them introduced the ramkin coach men said vimes hesitantly peering through the fog definitely said sergeant colon did you see a dragon go past apart from errol well er said the sergeant looking at the other two sort of sir possibly it might of been then dont stand there like a lot of boobies said lady ramkin get in plenty of room inside there was when it was built the coach had probably been the marvel of the day all plush and gilt and tasselled hangings time neglect and the ripping out of the seats to allow its frequent use to transport dragons to shows had taken their toll but it still reeked of privilege style and of course dragons what do you think youre doing said colon as it rattled off through the fog wavin said nobby gesturing graciously to the billows around them disgusting this sort of thing really mused sergeant colon people goin around in coaches like this when theres people with no roof to their heads its lady ramkins coach said nobby shes all right well yes but what about her ancestors eh you dont get big houses and carriages without grindin the faces of the poor a bit youre just annoyed because your missus has been embroidering crowns on her undies said nobby thats got nothing to do with it said sergeant colon indignantly ive always been very firm on the rights of man and dwarf said carrot yeah right said the sergeant uncertainly but all this business about kings and lords its against basic human dignity were all born equal it makes me sick never heard you talk like this before frederick said nobby its sergeant colon to you nobby sorry sergeant terry pratchett the fog itself was shaping up to be a real ankhmorpork autumn gumbo vimes squinted through it as the droplets buckled down to a good days work soaking him to the skin i can just make him out he said turn left here any ideas where we are said lady ramkin business district somewhere said vimes shortly errols progress was slowing a bit he kept looking up and whining cant see a damn thing above us in this fog he said i wonder if the fog as if in acknowledgement lit up ahead of them it blossomed like a chrysanthemum and made a noise like whoomph oh no moaned vimes not again are the cups of integrity well and truly suffused intoned brother watchtower aye suffused full well the waters of the world are they abjured yea abjured full mightily have the demons of infinity been bound with many chains damn said brother plasterer theres always something brother watchtower sagged just once it would be nice if we could get the ancient and timeless rituals right wouldnt it youd better get on with it wouldnt it be quicker brother watchtower if i just did it twice next time said brother plasterer brother watchtower gave this some grudging consideration it seemed reasonable all right he said now get back down there with the others and you should call me acting supreme grand master understand this did not meet with what he considered to be a proper and dignified reception among the brethren noone said anything to us about you being acting supreme grand master muttered brother doorkeeper like a peasouper only much thicker fishier and with things in it youd probably rather not know about guards guards well thats all you know because i bloody well am because supreme grand master asked me to open the lodge on account of him being delayed with all this coronation work said brother watchtower haughtily if that doesnt make me acting supreme grand bloody master id like to know what does all right i dont see why muttered brother doorkeeper you dont have to have a grand title like that you could just be called something like wellrituals monitor yeah said brother plasterer dont see why you should give yourself airs you aint even been taught the ancient and mystic mysteries by monks or anything weve been hanging around for hours too said brother doorkeeper thats not right i thought wed get rewarded brother watchtower realised that he was losing control he tried wheedling diplomacy im sure supreme grand master will be along directly he said lets not spoil it all now eh lads arranging that fight with the dragon and everything getting it all off right that was something wasnt it weve been through a lot right its worth waiting just a bit longer okay the circle of robed and cowled figures shuffled in grudging agreement okay fair enough yeah certainly okay if you say so it began to creep over brother watchtower that something wasnt right but he couldnt quite put a name to it uh he said brothers they too shifted uneasily something in the room was setting their teeth on edge there was an atmosphere brothers repeated brother watchtower trying to reassert himself we are all here arent we there was a worried chorus of agreement of course we are whats the matter yes yes terry pratchett yes there it was again a subtle wrongness about things that you couldnt quite put your finger on because your finger was too scared but brother watchtowers troublesome thoughts were interrupted by a scrabbling sound on the roof a few nubs of plaster dropped into the circle brothers repeated brother watchtower nervously now there was one of those silent sounds a long buzzing silence of extreme concentration and just possibly the indrawing of breath into lungs the size of haystacks the last rats of brother watchtowers selfconfidence fled the sinking ship of courage brother doorkeeper if you could just unbolt the dread portal he quavered and then there was light there was no pain there was no time death strips away many things especially when it arrives at a temperature hot enough to vaporise iron and among them are your illusions the immortal remains of brother watchtower watched the dragon flap away into the fog and then looked down at the congealing puddle of stone metal and miscellaneous trace elements that was all that remained of the secret headquarters and of its occupants he realised in the dispassionate way that is part of being dead you go through your whole life and end up a smear swirling around like cream in a coffee cup whatever the gods games were they played them in a damn mysterious way he looked up at the hooded figure beside him we never intended this he said weakly honestly no offence we just wanted what was due to us a skeletal hand patted him on the shoulder not unkindly and death said congratulations apart from the supreme grand master the only elucidated brother to be away at the time of the dragon was brother fingers hed been sent out for some pizzas brother fingers was always the one sent out for takeaway food it was cheaper hed never bothered to master the art of paying for things when the guards rolled up just behind errol brother fingers guards guards was standing with a stack of cardboard boxes in his hands and his mouth open where the dread portal should have been was a warm melted patch of assorted substances oh my goodness said lady ramkin vimes slid down from the coach and tapped brother fingers on the shoulder excuse me sir he said did you by any chance see what when brother fingers turned towards him his face was the face of a man who has hangglided over the entrance to hell he kept opening and shutting his mouth but no words were coming out vimes tried again the sheer terror frozen in brother fingerss expression was getting to him if you would be so kind to accompany me to the yard said vimes i have reason to believe that you he hesitated he wasnt entirely certain what it was that he had reason to believe but the man was clearly guilty you could tell just by looking at him not perhaps guilty of anything specific just guilty in general terms mmmmmuh said brother fingers sergeant colon gently lifted the lid of the top box what do you make of it sergeant said vimes stepping back er it looks like a klatchian hots with anchovies sir said sergeant colon knowledgeably i mean the man said vimes wearily nnnnn said brother fingers colon peered under the hood oh i know him sir he said bengy lightfoot boggis sir hes a capo de monty in the thieves guild i know him of old sir sly little bugger used to work at the university what as a wizard said vimes odd job man sir gardening and carpentry and that oh did he cant we do something for the poor man said lady ramkin nobby saluted smartly i could kick him in the bollocks for you if you like mlady dddrrr said brother fingers beginning to shake uncontrollably while lady ramkin smiled the ironhard blank smile of a highborn lady who is determined not to show that she has understood what has just been said to her terry pratchett put him in the coach you two said vimes if its all right with you lady ramkin sybil corrected lady ramkin vimes blushed and plunged on it might be a good idea to get him indoors charge him with the theft of one book to whit the summoning of dragons right you are sir said sergeant colon the pizzasre getting cold too you know how the cheese goes all manky when it gets cold and no kicking him either vimes warned not even where it doesnt show carrot you come with me ddddrrraa brother fingers volunteered and take errol added vimes hes driving himself mad here game little devil ill give him that marvellous when you come to think about it said colon errol was trotting up and down in front of the ravaged building whining look at him said vimes cant wait to get to grips his gaze found itself drawn as though by wires up to the rolling clouds of fog its in there somewhere he thought what we going to do now sir said carrot as the carriage rattled off not nervous are you said vimes no sir the way he said it jogged something in vimess mind no he said youre not are you i suppose its being brought up by the dwarfs that did it youve got no imagination im sure i try to do my best sir said carrot firmly still sending all your pay home to your mother yes sir youre a good boy yessir so what are we going to do captain vimes carrot repeated vimes looked around him he walked a few aimless exasperated steps he spread his arms wide and then flopped them down by his sides how should i know he said warn people i guess wed better get over to the patricians palace and then there were footsteps in the fog vimes stiffened put his finger guards guards to his lips and pulled carrot into the shelter of a doorway a figure loomed out of the billows another one of em thought vimes well theres no law about wearing long black robes and deep cowls there could be dozens of perfectly innocent reasons why this person is wearing long black robes and a deep cowl and standing in front of a melteddown house at dawn perhaps i should ask him to name just one he stepped out excuse me sir he began the cowl swung around there was a hiss of indrawn breath i just wonder if you wouldmind after him lanceconstablel the figure had a good start it scuttled along the street and had reached the corner before vimes was halfway there he skidded around it in time to see a shape vanish down an alley vimes realised he was running alone he panted to a halt and looked back just in time to see carrot jog gently around the corner whats wrong he wheezed sergeant colon said i wasnt to run said carrot vimes looked at him vaguely then slow comprehension dawned oh he said i er see i dont think he meant in every circumstance lad he stared back into the fog not that we had much of a chance in this fog and these streets might have been just an innocent bystander sir said carrot what in ankhmorpork yes sir we should have grabbed him then just for the rarity value said vimes he patted carrot on the shoulder come on wed better get along to the patricians palace the kings palace corrected carrot what said vimes his train of thought temporarily shunted its the kings palace now said carrot vimes squinted sideways at him he gave a short mirthless laugh yeah thats right he conceded our dragonkilling king well done that man he sighed theyre not going to like this terry pratchett they didnt none of them did the first problem was the palace guard vimes had never liked them theyd never liked him okay so maybe the rank were only one step away from petty scofflaws but in vimess professional opinion the palace guard these days were only one step away from being the worst criminal scum the city had ever produced a step further down theyd have to reform a bit before they could even be considered for inclusion in the ten most unwanted list they were rough they were tough they werent the sweepings off the gutter they were what you still found sticking to the gutter when the gutter sweepers had given up in exhaustion they had been extremely wellpaid by the patrician and presumably were extremely wellpaid by someone else now because when vimes walked up to the gates a couple of them stopped lounging against the walls and straightened up while still maintaining just the right amount of psychological slouch to cause maximum offence captain vimes said vimes staring straight ahead to see the king its of the utmost importance yeah well itd have to be said a guard captain slimes was it vimes said vimes evenly with a vee one of the guards nodded to his companion vimes he said with a vee fancy said the other guard its most urgent said vimes maintaining a wooden expression he tried to move forward the first guard sidestepped neatly and pushed him sharply in the chest noone is going nowhere he said orders of the king see so you can push off back to your pit captain vimes with a vee it wasnt the words which made up vimess mind it was the way the other man sniggered stand aside he said the guard leaned down whos going to make me he rapped on vimess helmet copper there are times when it is a veritable pleasure to drop the bomb right away guards guards lanceconstable carrot i want you to charge these men said vimes carrot saluted very good sir he said and turned and trotted smartly back the way they had come hey shouted vimes as the boy disappeared around a corner thats what i like to see said the first guard leaning on his spear thats a young man with initiative that young man a bright lad he doesnt want to stop along here and have his ears twisted off thats a young man whos going to go a long way if hes got any sense very sensible said the other guard he leaned the spear against the wall you watch men make me want to throw up he said conversationally poncing around all the time never doing a proper job of work throwing your weight about as if you counted for something so me and clarence are going to show you what real guarding is all about isnt that right i could just about manage one of them vimes thought as he took a few steps backward if he was facing the other way at least clarence propped his spear against the gateway and spat on his hands there was a long terrifying ululation vimes was amazed to realise it wasnt coming from him carrot appeared around the corner at a dead run he had a felling axe in either hand his huge leather sandals flapped on the cobblestones as he bounded closer accelerating all the time and all the time there was this cry deedahdeedahdeedah like something caught in a trap at the bottom of a twotone echo canyon the two palace guards stood rigid with astonishment i should duck if i was you said vimes from near ground level the two axes left carrots hands and whirred through the air making a noise like a brace of partridges one of them hit the palace gate burying half the head in the woodwork the other one hit the shaft of the first one and split it then carrot arrived vimes went and sat down on a nearby bench for a while and rolled himself a cigarette eventually he said i think thats about enough constable i terry pratchett think theyd like to come quietly now yes sir what are they accused of sir said carrot holding one limp body in either hand assaulting an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty andoh yes resisting arrest under section of the public order act of said carrot yes said vimes solemnly yes yes i suppose so but they didnt resist very much sir carrot pointed out well attempting to resist arrest i should just leave them over by the wall until we come back i dont expect theyll want to go anywhere right you are sir dont hurt them mind said vimes you mustnt hurt prisoners thats right sir said carrot conscientiously prisoners once charged have rights sir it says so in the dignity of man act of i keep telling corporal nobbs they have rights i tell him this means you do not put the boot in very well put constable carrot looked down you have the right to remain silent he said you have the right not to injure yourself falling down the steps on the way to the cells you have the right not to jump out of high windows you do not have to say anything you see but anything you do say well i have to take it down and it might be used in evidence he pulled out his notebook and licked his pencil he leaned down further pardon he said he looked up at vimes how do you spell groan sir he said grone i think very good sir oh and constable yes sir why the axes they were armed sir i got them from the blacksmith in market street sir i said youd be along later to pay for them and the cry said vimes weakly dwarfish war yodel sir said carrot proudly its a good cry said vimes picking his words with care but id be grateful if youd warn me first another time all right guards guards certainly sir in writing i think the librarian swung on it was slow progress because there were things he wasnt keen on meeting creatures evolve to fill every niche in the environment and some of those in the dusty immensity of lspace were best avoided they were much more unusual than ordinary unusual creatures usually he could forewarn himself by keeping a careful eye on the kickstool crabs that grazed harmlessly on the dust when they were spooked it was time to hide several times he had to flatten himself against the shelves as a thesaurus thundered by he waited patiently as a herd of critters crawled past grazing on the contents of the choicer books and leaving behind them piles of small slim volumes of literary criticism and there were other things things which he hurried away from and tried not to look hard at and you had to avoid cliches at all costs he finished the last of his peanuts atop a stepladder which was browsing mindlessly off the high shelves the territory definitely had a familiar feel or at least he got the feeling that it would eventually be familiar time had a different meaning in lspace there were shelves whose outline he felt he knew the book titles while still unreadable held a tantalising hint of legibility even the musty air had a smell he thought he recognised he shambled quickly along a side passage turned the corner and with only the slightest twinge of disorientation shuffled into that set of dimensions that people because they dont know any better think of as normal he just felt extremely hot and his fur stood straight out from his body as temporal energy gradually discharged he was in the dark he extended one arm and explored the spines of the books by his side ah now he knew where he was he was home he was home a week ago it was essential that he didnt leave footprints but that wasnt terry pratchett a problem he shinned up the side of the nearest bookcase and under the starlight of the dome hurried onwards lupine wonse glared up redeyed from the heap of paperwork on his desk noone in the city knew anything about coronations hed had to make it up as he went along there should be plenty of things to wave he knew that yes he said abruptly er theres a captain vimes to see you said the flunkey vimes of the watch yes sir says its of the utmost importance wonse looked down his list of other things that were also of the utmost importance crowning the king for one thing the high priests of fiftythree religions were all claiming the honour it was going to be a scrum and then there were the crown jewels or rather there werent the crown jewels somewhere in the preceding generations the crown jewels had disappeared a jeweller in the street of cunning artificers was doing the best he could in the time with gilt and glass vimes could wait tell him to come back another day said wonse good of you to see us said vimes appearing in the doorway wonse glared at him since youre here he said vimes dropped his helmet on wonses desk in what the secretary thought was an offensive manner and sat down take a seat said wonse have you had breakfast yet said vimes now really wonse began dont worry said vimes cheerfully constable carrot will go and see whats in the kitchens this chap will show him the way when they had gone wonse leaned across the drifts of paperwork there had better he said be a very good reason for the dragon is back said vimes wonse stared at him for a while vimes stared back guards guards wonses senses came back from whatever corners theyd bounced into youve been drinking havent you he said no the dragon is back now look wonse began i saw it said vimes flatly a dragon youre sure vimes leaned across the desk no i could be bloody mistaken he shouted it may have been something else with sodding great big claws huge leathery wings and hot fiery breath there must be masses of things like that but we all saw it killed said wonse i dont know what we saw said vimes but i know what saw he leaned back shaking he was suddenly feeling extremely tired anyway he said in a more normal voice its flamed a house in bitwash street just like the other ones any of them get out vimes put his head in his hands he wondered how long it vas since hed last had any sleep proper sleep the sort with sheets or food come to that was it last night or the night before had he ever come to think of it ever slept at all in all his life it didnt seem like it the arms of morpheus had rolled up their sleeves and were giving the back of his brain a right pummelling but bits were fighting back any of them get any of who he said the people in the house of course said wonse i assume there were people in it at night i mean oh oh yes it wasnt like a normal house i think it was some sort of secret society thing vimes managed something was clicking in his mind but he was too tired to examine it magic you mean dunno said vimes could be guys in robes hes going to tell me ive been overdoing it he said hell be right too look said wonse kindly people who mess around with magic and dont know how to control it well they can blow themselves up and blow themselves up terry pratchett and youve had a busy few days said wonse soothingly if id been knocked down and almost burned alive by a dragon i expect id be seeing them all the time vimes stared at him with his mouth open he couldnt think of anything to say whatever stretched and knotted elastic had been driving him along these last few days had gone entirely limp you dont think youve been overdoing it do you said wonse ah thought vimes jolly good he slumped forward the librarian leaned cautiously over the top of the bookcase and unfolded an arm into the darkness there it was his thick fingernails grasped the spine of the book pulled it gently from its shelf and hoisted it up he raised the lantern carefully no doubt about it the summoning of dragons single copy first edition slightly foxed and extremely dragoned he set the lamp down beside him and began to read the first page mmm said vimes waking up brungyou a nice cup of tea capn said sergeant colon and a figgin vimes looked at him blankly youve been asleep said sergeant colon helpfully you was spark out when carrot brought you back vimes looked around at the nowfamiliar surroundings of the yard oh he said me and nobby have been doing some detectoring said colon you know that house that got melted well noone lives there its just rooms that get hired out so we found out who hires them theres a caretaker who goes along every night to put the chairs away and lock up he wasnt half creating about it being burned down you know what caretakers are like he stood back waiting for the applause guards guards well done said vimes dutifully dunking the figgin into the tea theres three societies use it said colon he extracted his notebook to wit viz the ankhmorpork fine art appreciation society hem hem the morpork folkdance and song club and the elucidated brethren of the ebon night why hem hem said vimes well you know fine art its just men paintin pictures of young wimmin in the nudd the altogether explained colon the connoisseur the caretaker told me some of them dont even have any paint on their brushes you know shameful there must be a million stories in the naked city thought vimes so why do i always have to listen to ones like these when do they meet he said mondays admission ten pence said colon promptly as for the folkdance people well no problem there you know you always wondered what corporal nobbs does on his evenings off colons face split into a watermelon grin no said vimes incredulously not nobby yep said colon delighted at the result what jumping about with bells on and waving his hanky in the air he says it is important to preserve old folkways said colon nobby mr steeltoecapsinthegroin iwasjustcheckingthedoorhandleanditopenedallbyitself yeah funny old world aint it he was very bashful about it good grief said vimes it just goes to show you never can tell said colon anyway the caretaker said the elucidated brethren always leave the place in a mess scuffed chalk marks on the floor he said and they never put the chairs back properly or wash out thetea urn theyve been meeting a lot lately he said the nuddy wimmin painters had to meet somewhere else last week what did you do with our suspect said vimes him oh he done a runner captain said the sergeant looking embarrassed why he didnt look in any shape to run anywhere well when we got back here we sat him down by the fire and wrapped him up because he kept on shivering said sergeant colon as vimes buckled his armour on terry pratchett i hope you didnt eat his pizzas errol et em its the cheese see it goes all go on well said colon awkwardly he kept on shivering sort of thing and groaning on about dragons and that we felt sorry for him to tell the truth and then he jumps up and runs out of the door for no reason at all vimes glanced at the sergeants big open dishonest face no reason he prompted well we decided to have a bite so i sent nobby out to the bakers see and well we fought the prisoner ought to have something to eat yes said vimes encouragingly well when nobby asked him if he wanted his figgin toasted he just give a scream and ran off just that said vimes you didnt threaten him in any way straight up captain bit of a mystery if you ask me he kept going on about someone called supreme grand master hmm vimes glanced out of the window grey fog lagged the world with dim light what time is it he said five of the clock sir right well before it gets dark colon gave a cough in the morning sir this is tomorrow sir you let me sleep all day didnt have the heart to wake you up sir no dragon activity if thats what youre thinking dead quiet all round in fact vimes glared at him and threw the window open the fog rolled in in a slow yellowedged waterfall we reckon it must of flown away said colons voice behind him vimes stared up into the heavy rolling clouds hope it clears up for the coronation colon went on in a worried voice you all right sir it hasnt flown away vimes thought why should it fly away we cant hurt it and its got everything it wants right here its up there somewhere you all right sir colon repeated its got to be up high somewhere in the fog theres all kinds of towers and things what times the coronation sergeant he said guards guards noon sir and mr wonse has sent a message about how youre to be in your best armour among all the civic leaders sir oh has he and sergeant hummock and the day squad will be lining the route sir what with said vimes vaguely watching the skies sorry sir vimes squinted upwards to get a better view of the roof hmm he said i said theyll be lining the route sir said sergeant colon its up there sergeant said vimes i can practically smell it yes sir said colon obediently its deciding what to do next yes sir theyre not unintelligent you know they just dont think like us yes sir so be damned to any lining of the route i want you three up on roofs understand yes si what up on the roofs up high when it makes its move i want us to be the first to know colon tried to indicate by his expression that he didnt do you think thats a good idea sir he ventured vimes gave him a blank look yes sergeant i do it was one of mine he said coldly now go and see to it when he was left to himself vimes washed and shaved in cold water and then rummaged in his campaign chest until he unearthed his ceremonial breastplate and red cloak well the cloak had been red once and still was here and there although most of it resembled a small net used very successfully for catching moths there was also a helmet defiantly without plumes from which the moleculethick gold leaf had long ago peeled hed started saving up for a new cloak once whatever had happened to the money there was noone in the guardroom errol lay in the wreckage of the fourth fruit box nobby had scrounged for him the rest had all been eaten or had dissolved terry pratchett in the warm silence the everlasting rumbling of his stomach sounded especially loud occasionally he whimpered vimes scratched him vaguely behind the ears whats up with you boy he said the door creaked open carrot came in saw vimes hunkered down by the ravaged box and saluted were a bit worried about him captain he volunteered he hasnt eaten his coal just lies there twitching and whining all the time you dont think somethings wrong with him do you possibly said vimes but having something wrong with them is quite normal for a dragon they always get over it one way or another errol gave him a mournful look and closed his eyes again vimes pulled his scrap of blanket over him there was a squeak he fished around beside the dragons shivering body pulled out a small rubber hippo stared at it in surprise and then gave it one or two experimental squeezes i thought it would be something for him to play with said carrot slightly shamefaced you bought him a little toy yes sir what a kind thought vimes hoped carrot hadnt noticed the fluffy ball tucked into the back of the box it had been quite expensive he left the two of them and stepped into the outside world there was even more bunting now people were beginning to line the main streets even though there were hours to wait it was still very depressing he felt an appetite for once one that itd take more than a drink or two to satisfy he strolled along for breakfast at hargas house of ribs the habit of years and got another unpleasant surprise normally the only decoration in there was on sham hargas vest and the food was good solid stuff for a cold morning all calories and fat and protein and maybe a vitamin crying softly because it was all alone now laboriouslymade paper streamers crisscrossed the room and he was confronted with a crayonned menu in which the words coronasion and royall figured somewhere on every crooked line vimes pointed wearily at the top of the menu whats this he said guards guards harga peered at it they were alone in the greasewalled cafe it says bye royarl appointmente captain he said proudly whats it mean harga scratched his head with a ladle what it means is he said if the king comes in here hell like it have you got anything that isnt too aristocratic for me to eat then said vimes sourly and settled for a slice of plebeian fried bread and a proletarian steak cooked so rare you could still hear it bray vimes ate it at the counter a vague scraping noise disturbed his thoughts whatre you doing he said harga looked up guiltily from his work behind the counter nothing capn he said he tried to hide the evidence behind him when vimes glared over the knifechewed woodwork come on sham you can show me hargas beefy hands came reluctantly into view i was only scraping the old fat out of the pan he mumbled i see and how long have we known each other sham said vimes with terrible kindness years capn said harga you bin coming in here nearly every day reglar one of my best customers vimes leaned over the counter until his nose was level with the squashy pink thing in the middle of hargas face and in all that time have you ever changed the fat he demanded harga tried to back away well its been like a friend to me that old fat said vimes theres little black bits in there ive grown to know and love its a meal in itself and youve cleaned out the coffee jug havent you i can tell this is loveinacanoe coffee if ever i tasted it the ottjer stuff had flavour well i thought it was time why harga let the pan fall from his pudgy fingers well i thought if the king should happen to come in youre all mad but capn vimess accusing finger buried itself up to the second joint in hargas expansive vest you dont even know the wretched fellows name he shouted terry pratchett harga rallied i do capn he stuttered course i do seen it on the decorations and everything hes called rex vivat very gently shaking his head in despair crying in his heart for the essential servility of mankind vimes let him go in another time and place the librarian finished reading hed reached the end of the text not the end of the book there was plenty more book it had been scorched beyond the point of legibility though not that the last few unburned pages were very easy to read the authors hand had been shaking hed been writing fast and hed blotted a lot but the librarian had wrestled with many a terrifying text in some of the worst books ever bound words that tried to read you as you read them words that writhed on the page at least these werent words like that these were just the words of a man frightened for his life a man writing a dreadful warning it was a page a little back from the burned section that drew the librarians eye he sat and stared at it for some time then he stared at the darkness it was his darkness he was asleep out there somewhere somewhere out there a thief was heading for this place to steal this book and then someone would read this book read these words and do it anyway his hands itched all he had to do was hide the book or drop on to the thief s head and unscrew it by the ears he stared into the darkness again but that would be interfering with the course of history horrible things could happen the librarian knew all about this sort of thing it was part of what you had to know before you were allowed into lspace hed seen pictures in ancient books time could bifurcate like a pair of trousers you could end up in the wrong leg living a life that was actually happening in the other leg talking to people who werent in your leg walking into walls that werent there any more life could be horrible in the wrong trouser of time guards guards besides it was against library rules the assembled librarians of time and space would certainly have something to say about it if he started to tinker with causality he closed the book carefully and tucked it back into the shelf then he swung gently from bookcase to bookcase until he reached the doorway for a moment he stopped and looked down at his own sleeping body perhaps he wondered briefly whether to wake himself up have a little chat tell himself that he had friends and not to worry if so he must have decided against it you could get yourself into a lot of trouble that way instead he slipped out of the door and lurked in the shadows and followed the hooded thief when it came out clutching the book and waited near the dread portal in the rain until the elucidated brethren had met and when the last one left followed him to his home and murmured to himself in anthropoid surprise and then ran back to his library and the treacherous pathways of lspace by midmorning the streets were packed vimes had docked nobby a days salary for wavinga flag and an air of barbed gloom settled over the yard like a big black cloud with occasional flashes of lightning in it get up in a high place muttered nobby thats all very well to say i was looking forward to lining the streets said colon id have got a good view you were going on about privilege and the rights of man the other night said nobby accusingly yes well one of the privileges and rights of this man is getting a good view said the sergeant thats all im saying ive never seen the captain in such a filthy temper said nobby i liked it better when he was on the drink i reckon hes the three rules of the librarians of time and space are silence books must be returned no later than the last date shown and do not interfere with the nature of causality terry pratchett you know i think errol is really ill said carrot they turned towards the fruit basket hes very hot and his skin looks all shiny whats the right temperature for a dragon said colon yeah how do you take it said nobby i think we ought to ask lady ramkin to have a look at him said carrot she knows about these things no shell be getting ready for the coronation we shouldnt go disturbing her said colon he stretched out his hand to errols quivering flanks i used to have a dog that arrgh thats not hot thats boiling ive offered him lots of water and he just wont touch it what are you doing with that kettle nobby nobby looked innocent well i thought we might as well make a cup of tea before we go out its a shame to waste take it off him noon came the fog didnt lift but it did thin a bit to allow a pale yellow haze where the sun should have been although the passage of years had turned the post of captain of the watch into something rather shabby it still meant that vimes was entitled to a seat at official occasions the pecking order had moved it though so that now he was in the lowest tier on the rickety bleachers between the master of the fellowship of beggars and the head of the teachers guild he didnt mind that anything was better than the top row among the assassins thieves merchants and all the other things that had floated to the top of society he never knew what to talk about anyway the teacher was restful company since he didnt do much but clench and unclench his hands occasionally and whimper something wrong with your neck captain said the chief beggar politely as they waited for the coaches what said vimes distractedly you keep on staring upwards said the beggar hmm oh no nothing wrong said vimes the beggar wrapped his velvet cloak around him you couldnt by any chance spare he paused calculating a sum in accordance with his station about three hundred guards guards dollars for a twelvecourse civic banquet could you no fair enough fair enough said the chief beggar amiably he sighed it wasnt a rewarding job being chief beggar it was the differentials that did for you lowgrade beggars made a reasonable enough living on pennies but people tended to look the other way when you asked them for a sixteenbedroom mansion for the night vimes resumed his study of the sky up on the dais the high priest of blind lo who last night by dint of elaborate ecumenical argument and eventually by a club with nails in it had won the right to crown the king fussed over his preparations by the small portable sacrificial altar a tethered billy goat was peacefully chewing the cud and possibly thinking in goat what a lucky billy goat i am to be given such a good view of the proceedings this is going to be something to tell the kids vimes scanned the diffused outlines of the nearest buildings a distant cheering suggested that the ceremonial procession was on its way there was a scuffle of activity around the dais as lupine wonse chivvied a scramble of servants who rolled a purple carpet down the steps across the square amongst the ranks of ankhmorporks faded aristocracy lady ramkins face tilted upwards around the throne which had been hastily created out of wood and gold foil a number of lesser priests some of them with slight head wounds shuffled into position vimes shifted in his seat aware of the sound of his own heartbeat and glared at the haze over the river and saw the wings dear mother and father well the town is on fate for the coronation which is more complicated than at home and now i am on day duty as well this is a shame because i was going to watch the coronation with reet but it does not do to complain i must go now because we are expecting a dragon any minute terry pratchett although it does not exist really your loving son carrot ps have you seen anything of minty lately you idiot sorry said vimes sorry people were climbing back into their seats many of them giving him furious looks wonse was white with fury how could you have been so stupid he raged vimes stared at his own fingers i thought i saw he began it was a ravenl you know what ravens are there must be hundreds of them in the city in the fog you see the size wasnt easy to vimes mumbled and poor master greetling you ought to have known what loud noises do to him the head of the teachers guild had to be led away by some kind people shouting out like that wonse went on look i said im sorry it was an honest mistake ive had to hold up the procession and everything vimes said nothing he could feel hundreds of amused or unsympathetic eyes on him well he muttered id better be getting back to the yard wonses eyes narrowed no he snapped but you can go home if you like or anywhere your fancies take you give me your badge huh wonse held out his hand your badge he repeated my badge thats what i said i want to keep you out of trouble vimes looked at him in astonishment but its my badge and youre going to give it to me said wonse grimly by order of the king what dyou mean he doesnt even know vimes heard the wailing in his own voice wonse scowled but he will he said and i dont expect hell even bother to appoint a successor vimes slowly undipped the verdigrised disc of copper weighed guards guards it in his hand and then tossed it to wonse without a word for a moment he considered pleading but something rebelled he turned and stalked off through the crowd so that was it as simple as that after half a lifetime of service no more city watch huh vimes kicked at the pavement itd be some sort of royal guard now with plumes in their damn helmets well hed had enough it wasnt a proper life anyway in the watch you didnt meet people in the best of circumstances there must be hundreds of other things he could do and if he thought for long enough he could probably remember what some of them were pseudopolis yard was off the route of the procession and as he stumbled into the watch house he could hear the distant cheering beyond the rooftops across the city the temple gongs were being sounded now they are ringing the gongs thought vimes but soon they will they will they will not be ringing the gongs not much of an aphorism he thought but he could work on it he had the time now vimes noticed the mess errol had started eating again hed eaten most of the table the grate the coal scuttle several lamps and the squeaky rubber hippo now he lay in his box again skin twitching whimpering in his sleep a right mess youve made said vimes enigmatically still at least he wouldnt have to tidy it up he opened his desk drawer someone had eaten into that too all that was left was a few shards of glass sergeant colon hauled himself on to the parapet around the temple of small gods he was too old for this sort of thing hed joined for the bell ringing not sitting around on high places waiting for dragons to find him he got his breath back and peered through the fog anyone human still up here he whispered terry pratchett carrots voice sounded dead and featureless in the dull air here i am sergeant he said i was just checking if you were still here said colon im still here sergeant said carrot obediently colon joined him just checking you were not et he said trying to grin i havent been et said carrot oh said colon good then he tapped his fingers on the damp stonework feeling he ought to make his position absolutely clear just checking he repeated part of my duty see going around sort of thing its not that im frightened of being up on the roofs by myself you understand thick up here isnt it yes sergeant everything all okay nobbys muffled voice sidled its way through the thick air quickly followed by its owner yes corporal said carrot what you doing up here colon demanded i was just coming up to check lanceconstable carrot was all right said nobby innocently what were you doing sergeant were all all right said carrot beaming thats good isnt it the two ncos shifted uneasily and avoided looking at one another it seemed like a long way back to their posts across the damp cloudy and above all exposed rooftops colon made an executive decision sod this he said and found a piece of fallen statuary to sit on nobby leaned on the parapet and winkled a damp dogend from the unspeakable ashtray behind his ear heard the procession go by he observed colon filled his pipe and struck a match on the stone beside him if that dragons alive he said blowing out a plume of smoke and turning a small patch of fog into smog then itll have got the hell away from here im telling you not the right sort of place for dragons a city he added in the tones of someone doing a great job of convincing himself itll have gone off to somewhere where theres high places and plenty to eat you mark my words somewhere like the city you mean said carrot shut up said the other two in unison chuck us the matches sergeant said nobby guards guards colon tossed the bundle of evil yellowheaded lucifers across the leads nobby struck one which was immediately blown out shreds of fog drifted past him winds getting up he observed good cant stand this fog said colon what was i saying you were saying the dragonll be miles away prompted nobby oh right well it stands to reason doesnt it i mean wouldnt hang around here if i could fly away if i could fly i wouldnt be sitting on a roof on some manky old statue if i could fly id what statue said nobby cigarette halfway to his mouth this one said colon thumping the stone and dont try to give me the willies nobby you know theres hundreds of mouldy old statues up on small gods no i dont said nobby what i do know is they were all taken down last month when they reloaded the roof theres just the roof and the dome and thats it you have to take notice of little things like that he added when youre detectoring in the damp silence that followed sergeant colon looked down at the stone he was sitting on it had a taper and a scaly pattern and a sort of indefinable taillike quality then he followed its length up and into the rapidlythinning fog on the dome of small gods the dragon raised its head yawned and unfolded its wings the unfolding wasnt a simple operation it seemed to go on for some time as the complex biological machinery of ribs and pleats slid apart then with wings outstretched the dragon yawned took a few steps to the edge of the roof and launched itself into the air after a while a hand appeared over the edge of the parapet it flailed around for a moment until it got a decent grip there was a grunt carrot hauled himself back on to the roof and pulled the other two up behind him they lay flat out on the leads panting carrot observed the way that the dragons talons had scored deep grooves in the metal you couldnt help noticing things like that hadnt he panted hadnt we better warn people colon dragged himself forward until he could look across the city terry pratchett i dont think we need bother he said i think theyll soon find out the high priest of blind lo was stumbling over his words there had never been an official coronation service in ankhmorpork as far as he could find out the old kings had managed quite well with something on the lines of we hath got the crown ifaith and we will kill any whoreson who tries to take it away by the lord harry apart from anything else this was rather short hed spent a long time drafting something longer and more in keeping with the spirit of the times and was having some trouble remembering it he was also being put off by the goat which was watching him with loyal interest get on with it wonse hissed from his position behind the throne all in good time the high priest hissed back this is a coronation ill have you know you might try to show a little respect of course im showing respect now get on there was a shout off to the right wonse glared into the crowd its that ramkin woman he said whats she up to people around her were chattering excitedly now fingers pointed all the same way like a small fallen forest there were one or two screams and then the crowd moved like a tide wonse looked along the wide street of small gods it wasnt a raven out there not this time the dragon flew slowly only a few feet above the ground wings sculling gracefully through the air the flags that crisscrossed the street were caught up and snapped like so much cobweb piling up on the creatures spine plates and flapping back along the length of its tail it flew with head and neck fully extended as if the great body was being towed like a barge the people on the street yelled and fought one another for the safety of doorways it paid them no attention guards guards it should have come roaring but the only sounds were the creaking of wings and the snapping of banners it should have come roaring not like this not slowly and deliberately giving terror time to mature it should have come threatening not promising it should have come roaring not flying gently to the accompaniment of the zip and zing of merry bunting vimes pulled open the other drawer of his desk and glared at the paperwork such as there was of it there wasnt really much in there that he could call his own a scrap of sugar bag reminded him that he now owed the tea kitty six pence odd he wasnt angry yet he would be later on of course by evening hed be furious drunk and furious but not yet not yet it hadnt really sunk in and he knew he was just going through the motions as a preventative against thinking errol stirred sluggishly in his box raised his head and whined whats the matter boy said vimes reaching down upset stomach the little dragons skin was moving as though heavy industry was being carried on inside nothing in diseases of the dragon said anything about this from the swollen stomach came sounds like a distant and complicated war in an earthquake zone that surely wasnt right sybil ramkin said you had to pay great attention to a dragons diet since even a minor stomach upset would decorate the walls and ceiling with pathetic bits of scaly skin but in the past few days well there had been cold pizzas and the ash from nobbys horrible dogends and allinall errol had eaten more or less what he liked which was just about everything to judge by the room not to mention the contents of the bottom drawer we really havent looked after you very well have we said vimes treated you like a dog really he wondered what effect squeaky rubber hippos had on the digestion vimes became slowly aware that the distant cheering had turned to screams he stared vaguely at errol and then smiled an incredibly evil smile and stood up terry pratchett there were sounds of panic and the mob on the run he placed his battered helmet on his head and gave it a jaunty tap then humming a mad little tune he sauntered out of the building errol remained quite still for a while and then with extreme difficulty halfcrawled and halfrolled out of his box strange messages were coming from the massive part of his brain that controlled his digestive system it was demanding certain things that he couldnt put a name to fortunately it was able to describe them in minute detail to the complex receptors in his enormous nostrils they flared subjecting the air of the room to an intimate examination his head turned triangulating he pulled himself across the floor and began to eat with every sign of enjoyment carrots tin of armour polish people streamed past vimes as he strolled up the street of small gods smoke rose into the air from the plaza of broken moons the dragon squatted in the middle of it on what remained of the coronation dais it had a selfsatisfied expression there was no sign of the throne or of its occupant although it was possible that complicated forensic examination of the small pile of charcoal in the wrecked and smouldering woodwork might offer some clue vimes caught hold of an ornamental fountain to steady himself as the crowds stampeded by every street out of the plaza was packed with struggling bodies not noisy ones vimes noticed people werent wasting their breath with screaming any more there was just this solid deadly determination to be somewhere else the dragon spread its wings and flapped them luxuriously the people at the rear of the crowd took this as a signal to climb up the backs of the people in front of them and run for safety from head to head within a few seconds the square was empty of all save the stupid and the terminally bewildered even the badly trampled were making a spirited crawl for the nearest exit vimes looked around him there seemed to be a lot of fallen flags some of which were being eaten by an elderly goat which guards guards couldnt believe its luck he could distantly see cutmeownthroat on his hands and knees trying to restore the contents of his tray by vimess side a small child waved a flag hesitantly and shouted hurrah then everything went quiet vimes bent down i think you should be going home he said the child squinted up at him are you a watch man it said no said vimes and yes what happened to the king watch man er i think hes gone off for a rest said vimes my auntie said i shouldnt talk to watch men said the child do you think it might be a good idea to go home and tell her how obedient youve been then said vimes my auntie said if i was naughty shed put me on the roof and call the dragon said the child conversationally my auntie said it eats you all up starting with the legs sos you can see whats happening why dont you go home and tell your auntie shes acting in the best traditions of ankhmorpork childrearing said vimes go on run along it crunches up all your bones said the child happily and when it gets to your head it look its up there shouted vimes the great big dragon that crunches you up now go homel the child looked up at the thing perched on the crippled dais i havent seen it crunch anyone yet it complained push off or youll feel the back of my hand said vimes this seemed to fit the bill the child nodded understandingly right can i shout hurrah again if you like said vimes hurrah so much for community policing vimes thought he peered out from behind the fountain again a voice immediately above him rumbled say what you like i still swear its a magnificent specimen vimess gaze travelled upwards until it crested the edge of the fountains top bowl terry pratchett have you noticed said sybil ramkin hauling herself upright by a piece of eroded statuary and dropping down in front of him how every time we meet a dragon turns up she gave him an arch smile its a bit like having your own tune or something its just sitting there said vimes hurriedly just looking around as if its waiting for something to happen the dragon blinked with jurassic patience the roads off the square were packed with people thats the ankhmorpork instinct vimes thought run away and then stop and see if anything interesting is going to happen to other people there was a movement in the wreckage near the dragons front talon and the high priest of blind lo staggered to his feet dust and splinters cascading from his robes he was still holding the ersatz crown in one hand vimes watched the old man look upwards into a couple of glowing red eyes a few feet away can dragons read minds whispered vimes im sure mine understand every word i say hissed lady ramkin oh no the silly old fool is giving it the crown but isnt that a smart move said vimes dragons like gold its like throwing a stick for a dog isnt it oh dear said sybil ramkin it might not you know dragons have such sensitive mouths the great dragon blinked at the tiny circle of gold then with extreme delicacy it extended one metrelong claw and hooked the thing out of the priests trembling fingers what dyou mean sensitive said vimes watching the claw travel slowly towards the long horselike face a really incredible sense of taste theyre so well chemically orientated you mean it can probably taste gold whispered vimes watching the crown being carefully licked oh certainly and smell it vimes wondered what the chances were of the crown being made of gold not high he decided gold foil over copper perhaps enough to fool human beings and then he wondered what someones reaction would be if they were offered sugar which turned out once youd put three spoonfuls in your coffee to be salt the dragon removed the claw from its mouth in one graceful guards guards movement and caught the high priest who was just sneaking away a blow which knocked him high into the air when he was screaming at the top of the arc the great mouth came around and gosh said lady ramkin there was a groan from the watchers the temperature of the thing said vimes i mean nothing left just a wisp of smoke there was another movement in the rubble another figure pulled itself upright and leaned dazedly against a broken spar it was lupine wonse under a coating of soot vimes watched him look up into a pair of nostrils the size of draincovers wonse broke into a run vimes wondered what it felt like running away from something like that expecting any minute your backbone to reach very briefly a temperature somewhere beyond the vaporisation point of iron he could guess wonse made it halfway across the square before the dragon darted forward with surprising agility for such a bulk and snatched him up the talon swept on upward until the struggling figure was being held a few feet from the dragons face it appeared to examine him for some time turning him this way and that then moving on its three free legs and flapping its wings occasionally to help with its balance it trotted away across the plaza and headed towards the what once had been the patricians palace to what once had been the kings palace too it ignored the frightened spectators silently pressing themselves against the walls the arched gateway was shouldered aside with depressing ease the doors themselves tall and ironbound and solid lasted a surprising ten seconds before collapsing into a heap of glowing ash the dragon stepped through lady ramkin turned in astonishment vimes had started to laugh there was a manic edge to it and there were tears in his eyes but it was still laughter he laughed and laughed until he slid gently down the edge of the fountain his legs splaying out in front of him hooray hooray hooray he giggled almost choking what on earth dyou mean lady ramkin demanded put out more flags blow the cymbals roast the tocsin weve terry pratchett crowned it weve got a king after all what ho have you been drinking she snapped not yet sniggered vimes not yet but i will be he laughed on knowing that when he stopped black depression was going to drop on him like a lead souffle but he could see the future stretching out ahead of them after all it was definitely noble and it didnt carry money and it couldnt answer back it could certainly do something for the inner cities too like torching them to the bedrock well really do it he thought thats the ankhmorpork way if you cant beat it or corrupt it you pretend it was your idea in the first place vivat draco he became aware that the small child had wandered up again it waved its flag gently at him and said can i shout hurrah again now why not said vimes everyone else will from the palace came the muffled sounds of complicated destruction errol pulled a broomstick across the floor with his mouth and whimpering with effort hauled it upright after a lot more whimpering and several false starts he managed to winkle the end of it between the wall and the big jar of lamp oil he paused for a moment breathing like a bellows and pushed the jar resisted for a moment rocked back and forth once or twice and then fell over and smashed on the flagstones crude very badlyrefined oil spread out in a black puddle errols huge nostrils twitched somewhere in the back of his brain unfamiliar synapses clicked like telegraph keys great balks of information flooded down the thick nerve cord to his nose carrying inexplicable information about triple bonds alkanes and geometric isomerism however almost all of it missed the small part of errols brain that was used for being errol all he knew was that he was suddenly very very thirsty guards guards something major was happening in the palace there was the occasional crash of a floor or thump of a falling ceiling in his ratfilled dungeon behind a door with more locks than a major canal network the patrician of ankhmorpork lay back and grinned in the darkness outside bonfires flared in the dusk ankhmorpork was celebrating noone was quite sure why but theyd worked themselves up for a celebration tonight barrels had been broached oxen had been put on spits one paper hat and celebratory mug had been issued per child and it seemed a shame to waste all that effort anyway it had been a very interesting day and the people of ankhmorpork set great store by entertainment the way i see it said one of the revellers halfway through a huge greasy lump of halfraw meat a dragon as king mightnt be a bad idea when you think it through is what i mean it definitely looked very gracious said the woman to his right as if testing the idea sort of well sleek nice and smart not scruffy takes a bit of a pride in itself she glared at some of the younger revellers further down the table the trouble with people today is they dont take pride in themselves and theres foreign policy of course said a third helping himself to a rib when you come to think about it what dyou mean diplomacy said the ribeater flatly they thought about it and then you could see them turning the idea around and thinking about it the other way in a polite effort to see what the hell he was getting at dunno said the monarchical expert slowly i mean your actual dragon its got these basically two sort of ways of negotiation hasnt it i mean its either roasting you alive or it isnt correct me if im wrong he added thats my point i mean lets say the ambassador from klatch comes along you know how arrogant that lot are suppose he says we want this we want that we want the other thing well he said beaming at them what we say is shut your face unless you want to go home in a jar terry pratchett they tried out this idea for mental fit it had that certain something theyve got a big fleet klatch said the monarchist uncertainly could be a bit risky roasting diplomats people see a pile of charcoal come back on the boat they tend to look a bit askance ah then we say ho there johnny klatchian you no likeum big fella lizard belongsky bake mud hut belongyou pretty damn chopchop we could really say that why not and then we say send plenty tribute toot sweet i never did like them klatchians said the woman firmly the stuff they eat its disgustin and gabblin away all the time in their heathen lingo in the shadows a match flared vimes cupped his hands around the flame sucked on the foul tobacco tossed the match into the gutter and slouched off down the damp puddlepunctuated alley if there was anything that depressed him more than his own cynicism it was that quite often it still wasnt as cynical as real life weve got along with the other guys for centuries he thought jetting along has practically been all our foreign policy now i think ive just heard us declare war on an ancient civilisation that weve always got along with more or less even if they do talk funny and after that the world whats worse well probably win similar thoughts although with a different perspective were going through the minds of the civic leaders of ankhmorpork when next morning each received a short note bidding them to be at the palace for a working lunch by order it didnt say whose order or they noted whose lunch now they were assembled in the antechamber and there had been changes it had never been what you might call a select place the patrician had always felt that if you made people comfortable they might want to stay the furniture had been a few very elderly chairs and around the walls portraits of guards guards earlier city rulers holding scrolls and things the chairs were still there the portraits were not or rather the stained and cracked canvases were piled in a corner but the gilt frames were gone the councillors tried to avoid one anothers faces and sat tapping their fingers on their knees finally a couple of very worriedlooking servants opened the doors to the main hall lupine wonse lurched through most of the councillors had been up all night anyway trying to formulate some kind of policy visavis dragons but wonse looked as though he hadnt been to sleep in years his face was the colour of a fermented dishcloth never particularly wellpadded he now looked like something out of a pyramid ah he intoned good are you all here then perhaps you would step this way gentlemen er said the head thief the note mentioned lunch yes said wonse with a dragon good grief you dont think it would eat you do you said wonse what an idea never crossed me mind said the head thief relief blowing from his ears like steam the very idea haha haha said the chief merchant hoho said the head assassin the very idea no i expect youre all far too stringy said wonse haha haha ahaha hoho the temperature lowered by several degrees so if you would kindly step this way the great hall had changed for one thing it was a great deal greater several walls had been knocked into adjoining rooms and the ceiling and several storeys of upper rooms had been entirely removed the floor was a mass of rubble except in the middle of the room which was a heap of gold well goldish it looked as though someone had scoured the palace for anything that shone or glittered there were the picture frames and the gold thread out of tapestries and silver and the occasional gem there were also tureens from the kitchens candlesticks warming pans fragments of mirror sparkly stuff terry pratchett the councillors were not in a position to pay much attention to this however because of what was hanging above their heads it looked like the biggest badlyrolled cigar in the universe if the biggest badlyrolled cigar in the universe was in the habit of hanging upside down two talons could be dimly seen gripping the dark rafters halfway between the glittering heap and the doorway a small table had been laid the councillors noted without much surprise that the familiar ancient silverware was missing there were china plates and cutlery that looked as though it had very recently been whittled from bits of wood wonse took a seat at the head of the table and nodded to the servants please be seated gentlemen he said i am sorry things are a little different but the king hopes you will bear with it until matters can be more suitably organised the er said the head merchant the king repeated wonse his voice sounded one dribble away from madness oh the king right said the merchant from where he was sitting he had a good view of the big hanging thing there seemed to be some movement there some trembling in the great folds that wrapped it long life to him say i he added quickly the first course was soup with dumplings in it wonse didnt have any the rest of them ate in a terrified silence broken only by the dull chiming of wood on china there are certain matters of decree to which the king feels your assent would be welcome said wonse eventually a pure formality of course and i am sorry to bother you with such petty detail the big bundle appeared to sway in the breeze no trouble at all squeaked the head thief the king graciously desires it to be known said wonse that it would be pleased to receive coronation gifts from the population at large nothing complex of course simply any precious metals or gems they might have by them and can easily spare i should stress by the way that this is by no means compulsory such generosity as he is confident of expecting should be an entirely voluntary act the chief assassin looked sadly at the rings on his fingers and sighed the head merchant was already resignedly unshipping guards guards his gilt chain of office from around his neck why gentlemen said wonse this is most unexpected um said the archchancellor of unseen university you will be that is i am sure the king is aware that traditionally the university is exempt from all city levies and taxes he stifled a yawn the wizards had spent the night directing their best spells against the dragon it was like punching fog my dear sir this is no levy protested wonse i hope that nothing i have said would lead you to expect anything like that oh no no any tribute should be as i said entirely voluntary i hope that is absolutely clear as crystal said the head assassin glaring at the old wizard and these entirely voluntary tributes we are about to make they go on the hoard said wonse ah while i am positive the people of the city will be very generous indeed once they fully understand the situation said the head merchant i am sure the king will understand that there is very little gold in ankhmorpork good point said wonse however the king intends to pursue a vigorous and dynamic foreign policy which should remedy matters ah the councillors chorused rather more enthusiastically this time for example wonse went on the king feels that our legitimate interests in quirm sto lat pseudopolis and tsort have been seriously compromised in recent centuries this will be speedily corrected and gentlemen i can assure you that treasure will positively flow into the city from those anxious to enjoy the kings protection the head assassin glanced at the hoard a very definite idea formed in his mind as to where all that treasure would end up you had to admire the way dragons knew how to put the bite on it was practically human oh he said of course there will probably be other acquisitions in the way of land property and so forth and the king wishes it to be fully understood that loyal privy councillors will be richly rewarded and er said the head assassin who was beginning to feel terry pratchett that he had got a firm grip on the nature of the kings mental processes no doubt the er privy councillors said wonse no doubt they will respond with even greater generosity in the matter of for example treasure i am sure such considerations havent crossed the kings mind said wonse but the point is very well made i thought it would be the next course was fat pork beans and floury potatoes more as they couldnt help noticing fattening food wonse had a glass of water which brings us on to a further matter of some delicacy which i am sure that welltravelled broadminded gentlemen such as yourselves will have no difficulty in accepting he said the hand holding the glass was beginning to shake i hope it will also be understood by the population at large especially since the king will undoubtedly be able to contribute in so many ways to the wellbeing and defence of the city for example i am sure that the people will rest more contentedly in their beds knowing that the dr the king is tirelessly protecting them from harm there can however be ridiculous ancient prejudices which will only be eradicated by ceaseless workon the part of all men of good will he paused and looked at them the head assassin said later that he had looked into the eyes of many men who obviously were very near death but he had never looked into eyes that were so clearly and unmistakably looking back at him from the slopes of hell he hoped he would never he said ever have to look into eyes like that again i am referring said wonse each word coming slowly to the surface like bubbles in some quicksand to the matter of the kingsdiet there was a terrible silence they heard the faint rustle of wings behind them and the shadows in the corners of the hall grew darker and seemed to close in diet said the head thief in a hollow voice yes said wonse his voice was almost a squeak sweat was dripping down his face the head assassin had once heard the word rictus and wondered when you should use it correctly to describe someones expression and now he knew that was guards guards what wonses face had become it was the ghastly rictus of someone trying not to hear the words his own mouth was saying we er we thought said the head assassin very carefully that the dr the king well must have been arranging matters for himself over the weeks ah but poor stuff you know poor stuff stray animals and so forth said wonse staring hard at the tabletop obviously as king such makeshifts are no longer appropriate the silence grew and took on a texture the councillors thought hard especially about the meal they had just eaten the arrival of a huge trifle with a lot of cream on it only served to concentrate their minds er said the head merchant how often is the king hungry all the time said wonse but it eats once a month it is really a ceremonial occasion of course said the head merchant it would be and er said the head assassin when did the king last er eat im sorry to say it hasnt eaten properly ever since it came here said wonse oh you must understand said wonse fiddling desperately with his wooden cutlery that merely waylaying people like some common assassin excuse me the head assassin began some common murderer i mean there is no satisfaction there the whole essence of the kings feeding is that it should be well an act of bonding between king and subjects it is it is perhaps a living allegory reinforcing the close links between the crown and the community he added the precise nature of the meal the head thief began almost choking on the words are we talking about young maidens here sheer prejudice said wonse the age is immaterial marital status is of course of importance and social class something to do with flavour i believe he learned forward and now his voice was painfilled and urgent and they felt genuinely his own for the first time please consider it he hissed after all just one a month in exchange for so much the families of people of use to the king privy councillors such as yourselves would not of terry pratchett course even be considered and when you think of all the alternatives they didnt think about all the alternatives it was enough to think about just one of them the silence purred at them as wonse talked they avoided one anothers faces for fear of what they might see mirrored there each man thought one of the others is bound to say something soon some protest and then ill murmur agreement not actually say anything im not as stupid as that but definitely murmur very firmly so that the others will be in no doubt that i thoroughly disapprove because at a time like this it behooves all decent men to nearly stand up and be almost heard but noone said anything the cowards each man thought and noone touched the pudding or the brickthick chocolate mints served afterwards they just listened in flushed gloomy horror as wonses voice droned on and when they were dismissed they tried to leave as separately as possible so that they didnt have to talk to one another except for the head merchant that is he found himself leaving the palace with the chief assassin and they strolled side by side minds racing the chief merchant tried to look on the bright side he was one of those men who organise singsongs when things go drastically wrong well well he said so were privy councillors now just fancy hmm said the assassin i wonder whats the difference between ordinary councillors and privy councillors wondered the merchant aloud the assassin scowled at him i think he said it is because youre expected to eat shit he turned the glare back on his feet again what kept going through his mind were wonses last words as he shook the secretarys limp hand he wondered if anyone else had heard them unlikely theyd been a shape rather than a sound wonse had simply moved his lips around them while staring fixedly at the assassins moontanned face help me the assassin shivered why him as far as he could see there was only one kind of help he was qualified to give and very few people ever asked for it for themselves in fact they usually paid guards guards large sums for it to be given as a surprise present to other people he wondered what was happening to wonse that made any alternative seem better wonse sat alone in the dark ruined hall waiting he could try running but itd find him again itd always be able to find him it could smell his mind or it would flame him that was worse just like the brethren perhaps it was an instantaneous death it looked an instantaneous death but wonse lay awake at night wondering whether those last microseconds somehow stretched to a subjective whitehot eternity every tiny part of your body a mere smear of plasma and you there alive in the middle of it all not you i would not flame you it wasnt telepathy as far as wonse had always understood it telepathy was like hearing a voice in your head this was like hearing a voice in your body his whole nervous system twanged to it like a bow rise wonse jerked to his feet overturning the chair and banging his legs on the table when that voice spoke he had as much control over his body as water had over gravity come wonse lurched across the floor the wings unfolded slowly with the occasional creak until they filled the hall from side to side the tip of one smashed a window and stuck out into the afternoon air the dragon slowly sensuously stretched out its neck and yawned when it had finished it brought its head around until it was a few inches in front of wonses face what does voluntary mean it er it means doing something of your own free will said wonse but they have no free will they will increase my hoard or i will flame them wonse gulped yes he said but you mustnt the silent roar of fury spun him around there is nothing i mustnt terry pratchett no no no squeaked wonse clutching his head i didnt mean that believe me this way is better thats all better and safer none can defeat me this is certainly the case none can control me wonse flung up his fingerspread hands in a conciliatory fashion of course of course he said but there are ways and ways you know ways and ways all the roaring and flaming you see you dont need it foolish ape how else can i make them do my bidding wonse put his hands behind his back theyll do it of their own free will he said and in time theyll come to believe it was their own idea itll be a tradition take it from me we humans are adaptable creatures the dragon gave him a long blank stare in fact said wonse trying to keep the trembling out of his voice before too long if someone comes along and tells them that a dragon king is a bad idea theyll kill him themselves the dragon blinked for the first time wonse could remember it seemed uncertain i know people you see said wonse simply the dragon continued to pin him with its gaze if you are lying it thought eventually you know i cant not to you and they really act like this oh yes all the time its a basic human trait wonse knew the dragon could read at least the upper levels of his mind they resonated in terrible harmony and he could see the mighty thoughts behind the eyes in front of him the dragon was horrified im sorry said wonse weakly thats just how we are its all to do with survival i think there will be no mighty warriors sent to kill me it thought almost plaintively i dont think so no heroes not any more they cost too much but i will be eating people wonse whimpered guards guards he felt the sensation of the dragon rummaging around in his mind trying to find a clue to understanding he halfsaw halfsensed the flicker of random images of dragons of the mythical age of reptiles and and here he felt the dragons genuine astonishment of some of the less commendable areas of human history which were most of it and after the astonishment came the baffled anger there was practically nothing the dragon could do to people that they had not sooner or later tried on one another often with enthusiasm you have the effrontery to be squeamish it thought at him but we were dragons we were supposed to be cruel cunning heartless and terrible but this much i can tell you you ape the great face pressed even closer so that wonse was staring into the pitiless depths of its eyes we never burned and tortured and ripped one another apart and called it morality the dragon stretched its wings again once or twice and then dropped heavily on to the tawdry assortment of mildly precious things its claws scrabbled at the pile it sneered a threelegged lizard wouldnt hoard this lot it thought there will be better things whispered wonse temporarily relieved at the change in direction there had better be can i wonse hesitated can i ask you a question ask you dont need to eat people surely i think thats the only problem from peoples point of view you see he added his voice speeding up to a gabble the treasure and everything that doesnt have to be a problem but if its just a matter of well protein then perhaps it has occurred to a powerful intellect such as your own that something less controversial like a cow might the dragon breathed a horizontal streak of fire that calcined the opposite wall need need it roared when the sound had died away you talk to me of need isnt it the tradition that the finest flower of womanhood should be sent to the dragon to ensure peace and prosperity but you see we have always been moderately peaceful and reasonably prosperous do you want this state of affairs to continue terry pratchett the force of the thought drove wonse to his knees of course he managed the dragon stretched its claws luxuriantly then the need is not mine it is yours it thought now get out of my sight wonse sagged as it left his mind the dragon slithered over the cutprice hoard leapt up on to the ledge of one of the halls big windows and smashed the stained glass with its head the multicoloured image of a city father cascaded into the other debris below the long neck stretched out into the early evening air and turned like a seeking needle lights were coming on across the city the sound of a million people being alive made a muted deep thrumming the dragon breathed deeply joyfully then it hauled the rest of its body on to the ledge shouldered the remains of the windows frame aside and leapt into the sky what is it said nobby it was vaguely round of a woodish texture and when struck made a noise like a ruler plucked over the edge of a desk sergeant colon tapped it again i give in he said carrot proudly lifted it out of the battered packaging its a cake he said shoving both hands under the thing and raising it with some difficulty from my mother he managed to put it on the table without trapping his fingers can you eat it said nobby its taken months to get here youd think it would go stale oh its to a special dwarfish recipe said carrot dwarfish cakes dont go stale sergeant colon gave it another sharp rap i suppose not he conceded its incredibly sustaining said carrot practically magical the secret has been handed down from dwarf to dwarf for centuries one tiny piece of this and you wont want anything to eat all day get away said colon guards guards a dwarf can go hundreds of miles with a cake like this in his pack carrot went on i bet he can said colon gloomily i bet all the time hed be thinking bloody hell i hope i can find something else to eat soon otherwise its the bloody cake again carrot to whom the word irony meant something to do with metal picked up his pike and after a couple of impressive rebounds managed to cut the cake into approximately four slices there we are he said cheerfully one for each of us and one for the captain he realised what he had said oh sorry yes said colon flatly they sat in silence for a moment i liked him said carrot im sorry hes gone there was some more silence very similar to the earlier silence but even deeper and more furrowed with depression i expect youll be made captain now said carrot colon started me i dont want to be captain i cant do the thinking its not worth all that thinking just for another nine dollars a month he drummed his fingers on the table is that all he got said nobby i thought officers were rolling in it nine dollars a month said colon i saw the pay scales once nine dollars a month and two dollars plumes allowance only he never claimed that bit funny really he wasnt the plumes type said nobby youre right said colon the thing about the captain see i read this book onceyou know weve all got alcohol in our bodiessort of natural alcohol even if you never touch a drop in your life your body sort of makes it anyway but captain vimes see hes one of those people whose body doesnt do it naturally like he was born two drinks below normal gosh said carrot yes so when hes sober hes really sober knurd they call it you know how you feel when you wake up if youve been on the piss all night nobby well he feels like that all the time poor bugger said nobby i never realised no wonder hes always so gloomy so hes always trying to catch up see its just that he doesnt always get the dose right and of course colon glanced at terry pratchett carrot he was brung low by a woman mind you just about anything brings him low so what do we do now sergeant said nobby and do you think hed mind if we eat his cake said carrot wistfully itd be a shame to let it go stale colon shrugged the older men sat in miserable silence as carrot macerated his way through the cake like a bucketwheel rockcrusher in a chalk pit even if it had been the lightest of souffles they wouldnt have had any appetite they were contemplating life without the captain it was going to be bleak even without dragons say what you liked about captain vimes hed had style it was a cynical blacknailed style but hed had it and they didnt he could read long words and add up even that was style of a sort he even got drunk in style theyd been trying to drag the minutes out trying to stretch out the time but the night had come there was no hope for them they were going to have to go out on the streets it was six of the clock and all wasnt well i miss errol too said carrot he was the captains really said nobby anyway lady ramkinll know how to look after him its not as though we could leave anything around either said colon i mean even the lamp oil he even drank the lamp oil and mothballs said nobby a whole box of mothballs why would anyone want to eat mothballs and the kettle and sugar he was a devil for sugar he was nice though said carrot friendly oh ill grant you said colon but its not right really a pet where you have to jump behind a table every time it hiccups i shall miss his little face said carrot nobby blew his nose loudly it was echoed by a hammering on the door colon jerked his head carrot got up and opened it a couple of members of the palace guard were waiting with arrogant impatience they stepped back when they saw carrot who had to bend a bit to see under the lintel bad news like carrot travels fast guards guards weve brung you a proclamation said one of them youve got to whats all that fresh paint on your breastplate said carrot politely nobby and the sergeant peered around him its a dragon said the younger of the guards the dragon corrected his superior ere i know you said nobby youre skully maltoon used to live in mincing street your mum made cough sweets dint she and fell in the mixture and died i never have a cough sweet but i think of your mum hallo nobby said the guard without enthusiasm i bet your old mumd be proud of you you with a dragon on your vest said nobby conversationally the guard gave him a look made of hatred and embarrassment and new plumes on your hat too nobby added sweetly this here is a proclamation what you are commanded to read said the guard loudly and post up on street corners also by order whose said nobby sergeant colon grabbed the scroll in one hamlike fist where as he read slowly tracing the lettering with a hesitant finger it hathe pleassed the derreraager the dragon kerii king of kings and aaberessuhler sweat beaded on the broad pink cliff of his forehead absolute that is reruhlerehrer ruler of he lapsed into the tortured silence of academia his fingertip jerking slowly down the parchment no he said at last thats not right is it its not going to eat someone consume said the older guard its all part of the social social contract said his assistant woodenly a small price to pay im sure you will agree for the safety and protection of the city from what said nobby weve never had an enemy we couldnt bribe or corrupt until now said colon darkly you catch on fast said the guard so youre going to broadcast it on pain of pain carrot peered over colons shoulder whats a virgin he said terry pratchett an unmarried girl said colon quickly what like my friend reet said carrot horrified well no said colon shes not married you know none of mrs palms girls are married well yes said colon well then said carrot with an air of finality were not having any of that kind of thing i hope people wont stand for it said colon you mark my words the guards stepped back out of range of carrots rising wrath they can please themselves said the senior guard but if you dont proclaim it you can try explaining things to his majesty they hurried off nobby darted out into the street dragon on your vest he shouted if your old mum knew about this shed turn in her vat you goin around with a dragon on your vest colon wandered back to the table and spread out the scroll bad business he mumbled its already killed people said carrot contrary to sixteen separate acts in council well yes but that was just like you know the hurlyburly of this and that said colon not that it wasnt bad i mean but people sort of participating just handing over some slip of a girl and standing round watching as if its all proper and legal thats much worse i reckon it all depends on your point of view said nobby thoughtfully what dyou mean well from the point of view of someone being burned alive it probably doesnt matter much said nobby philosophically people wont stand for it i said said colon ignoring this youll see theyll march on the palace and what will the dragon do then eh burn em all said nobby promptly colon looked puzzled it wouldnt do that would it he said dont see whats to prevent it do you said nobby he glanced out of the doorway he was a good lad that boy used to run errands for my grandad whod have thought hed go around with a dragon on his chest guards guards what are we going to do sergeant said carrot i dont want to be burned alive said sergeant colon my wifed give me hell so i suppose weve got to wossname proclaim it but dont worry lad he said patting carrot on one muscular arm and repeating as if he hadnt quite believed himself the first time it wont come to that people never stand for it lady ramkin ran her hands over errols body damned if i know whats going on in there she said the little dragon tried to lick her face whats he been eating the last thing i think was a kettle said vimes a kettle of what no a kettle a black thing with a handle and spout he sniffed it for ages then he ate it errol grinned weakly at him and belched they both ducked oh and then ve found him eating soot out of the chimney vimes went on as their heads rose again over the railings they leaned back over the reinforced bunker that was one of lady ramkins sickbay pens it had to be reinforced usually one of the first things a sick dragon did was lose control of its digestive processes he doesnt look sick exactly she said just fat he whines a lot and you can sort of see things moving under his skin you know what i think you know you said they can rearrange their digestive system oh yes all the stomachs and pancreatic crackers can be hooked up in various ways you see to take advantage of whatever they can find to make flame with said vimes yes i think hes trying to make some sort of very hot flame he wants to challenge the big dragon every time it takes to the air he just sits there whining and doesnt explode not that weve noticed i mean im sure if he did wed spot it he just eats indiscriminately hard to be sure he sniffs everything and eats most things two gallons of lamp oil for example anyway i cant leave him down there we cant look after him properly its not as if we need terry pratchett to find out where the dragon is now he added bitterly i think youre being a bit silly about all this she said leading the way back to the house silly i was sacked in front of all those people yes but it was all a misunderstanding im sure didnt misunderstand it well i think youre just upset because youre impotent vimess eyes bulged whee he said against the dragon lady ramkin went on quite unconcerned you cant do anything about it i reckon this damn city and the dragon just about deserve one another said vimes people are frightened you cant expect much of people when theyre so frightened she touched him gingerly on his arm it was like watching an industrial robot being expertly manipulated to grasp an egg gently not everyones as brave as you she added timidly me the other week when you stopped them killing my dragons oh that thats not bravery anyway that was just people people are easier ill tell you one thing for nothing im not looking up that dragons nose again i wake up at days thinking about that oh she seemed deflated well if youre sure ive got a lot of friends you know if you need any help youve only got to say the duke of sto helit is looking for a guard captain im sure ill write you a letter youll like them theyre a very nice young couple im not sure what i shall do next said vimes more gruffly than he intended im considering one or two offers well of course im sure you know best vimes nodded lady ramkin twisted her handkerchief round and round in her hands well then she said well said vimes i er expect youll be wanting to be off then yes i expect i had better be going there was a pause then they both spoke at once its been very guards guards id just like to say sorry sorry no you were speaking no sorry you were saying oh vimes hesitated ill be off then oh yes lady ramkin gave him a washedout smile cant keep all these offers waiting can you she said she thrust out a hand vimes shook it carefully so ill just be going then he said do call again said lady ramkin more coldly if you are ever in this area and so on im sure errol would like to see you yes well goodbye then goodbye captain vimes he stumbled out of the door and walked hurriedly down the dark overgrown path he could feel her gaze on the back of his neck as he did so or at least he told himself that he could shed be standing in the doorway nearly blocking out the light just watching me but im not going to look back he thought that would be a really silly thing to do i mean shes a lovely person shes got a lot of common sense and an enormous personality but really im not going to look back even if she stands there while i walk all the way down the street sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind so when he heard the door shut when he was only halfway down the drive he suddenly felt very very angry as if he had just been robbed he stood still and clasped and unclasped his hands in the darkness he wasnt captain vimes any more he was citizen vimes which meant that he could do things hed once never dreamt of doing perhaps he could go and smash some windows no that wouldnt be any good he wanted more than that to get rid of that bloody dragon to get his job back to get his hands on whoever was behind all this to forget himself just once and hit someone until he was exhausted he stared at nothing down below the city was a mass of smoke and steam he wasnt thinking of that though he was thinking of a running man and further back in the terry pratchett fuddled mists of his life a boy running to keep up and under his breath he said any of them get out sergeant colon finished the proclamation and looked around at the hostile crowd dont blame me he said i just read the things i dont write em thats human sacrifice that is said someone theres nothing wrong with human sacrifice said a priest ah per say said the first speaker quickly for proper religious reasons and using condemned criminals and so on but thats different from bunging someone to a dragon just because its feeling peckish thats the spirit said sergeant colon taxes is one thing but eating people is another well said if we all say we wont put up with it what can the dragon do nobby opened his mouth colon clamped a hand over it and raised a triumphant fist in the air its just what ive always said he said the people united can never be ignited there was a ragged cheer hang on a minute said a small man slowly as far as we know the dragons only good at one thing it flies around the city setting fire to people im not actually certain what is being proposed that would stop it doing this yes but if we all protest said the first speaker his voice modulated with uncertainty it cant burn everybody said colon he decided to play his new ace again and added proudly the people united can never be ignited there was rather less of a cheer this time people were reserving their energy for worrying a number of religions in ankhmorpork still practised human sacrifice except that they didnt really need to practise any more because they had got so good at it city law said that only condemned criminals should be used but that was all right because in most of the religions refusing to volunteer for sacrifice was an offence punishable by death guards guards im not exactly sure i understand why not why cant it burn everyone and fly off to another city because the hoard said colon it needs people to bring it treasure yeah well maybe but how many exactly what how many people out of the whole city i mean perhaps it wont need to burn the whole city down just some bits do we know what bits look this is getting silly said the first speaker if we go around looking at the problems the whole time well never do anything it just pays to think things through first thats all im saying such as what happens even if we beat the dragon oh come on said sergeant colon no seriously whats the alternative a human being for a start please yourself said the little man primly but i reckon one person a month is pretty good compared to some rulers weve had anyone remember nersh the lunatic or giggling lord smince and his laughaminute dungeon the was a certain amount of mumbling of the hes got a point variety but they got overthrown said colon no they didnt they were assassinated same thing said colon i mean noones going to assassinate the dragon itd take more than a dark night and a sharp knife to see it off i know that i can see what the captain means he thought no wonder he always has a drink after he thinks about things we always beat ourselves before we even start give any ankhmorpork man a big stick and hell end up clubbing himself to death look here you mealymouthed little twerp said the first speaker picking up the little one by his collar and curling his free hand into a fist i happen to have three daughters and i happen to not want any of them et thank you very much yes and the people united will never be colons voice faltered he realised that the rest of the crowd were all staring upward terry pratchett the bugger he thought as rationality began to drain away it must have flannel feet the dragon shifted its position on the ridge of the nearest house flapped its wings once or twice yawned and then stretched its neck down into the street the man blessed with daughters stood with his fist upraised in the centre of a rapidly expanding circle of bare cobbles the little man wriggled out of his frozen grasp and darted into the shadows it suddenly seemed that no man in the entire world was so lonely and without friends i see he said quietly he scowled up at the inquisitive reptile in fact it didnt seem particularly belligerent it was looking at him with something approaching interest i dont care he shouted his voice echoing from wall to wall in the silence we defy you if you kill me you might as well kill all of us there was some uneasy shuffling of feet amongst those sections of the crowd who didnt feel that this was absolutely axiomatic we can resist you you know growled the man cant we everyone what was that slogan about being united sergeant er said colon feeling his spine turn to ice i warn you dragon the human spirit is they never found out what it was or at least what he thought it was although possibly in the dark hours of a sleepless night some of them might have remembered the subsequent events and formed a pretty good and gutchurning insight to whit that one of the things sometimes forgotten about the human spirit is that while it is in the right conditions noble and brave and wonderful it is also when you get right down to it only human the dragon flame caught him full on the chest for a moment he was visible as a whitehot outline before the neat black remains spiralled down into a little puddle of melting cobbles the flame vanished the crowd stood like statues not knowing if it was staying put or running that would attract more attention the dragon stared down curious to see what they were going to do next colon felt that as the only civic official present it was up to him to take charge of the situation he coughed right then he said trying to keep the squeak out of his guards guards voice if you would just move along there ladies and gentlemen move along now move along lets be having you please he waved his arms in a vague gesture of authority as the people shuffled nervously away out of the corner of his eye he saw red flames behind the rooftops and sparks spiralling in the sky havent you got any homes to go to he croaked the librarian knuckled out into the library of the here and now every hair on his body bristled with rage he pushed open the door and swung out into the stricken city someone out there was about to find that their worst nightmare was a maddened librarian with a badge the dragon swooped leisurely back and forth over the nighttime city barely flapping its wings it didnt need to the thermals were giving it the lift it needed there were fires all over ankhmorpork so many bucket chains had formed between the river and various burning buildings that buckets were getting misdirected and hijacked not that you really needed a bucket to pick up the turbid waters of the river ankh a net was good enough downstream teams of smokestained people worked feverishly to close the huge corroded gates under the brass bridge they were ankhmorporks last defence against fire since then the ankh had no outlet and gradually oozingly filled the space between the walls a man could suffocate under it the workers on the bridge were the ones who couldnt or wouldnt run many others were teeming through the gates of the city and heading out across the chilly mistwreathed plains but not for long the dragon looping and curving gracefully above the devastation glided out over the walls after a few seconds the guards saw actinic fire stab down through the mists the tide of humanity flowed back with the dragon hovering over it like a sheepdog the fires of the stricken city glowed redly off the underside of its wings terry pratchett got any suggestions about what we do next sergeant said nobby colon didnt reply i wish captain vimes were here he thought he wouldnt have known what to do either but hes got a much better vocabulary to be baffled in some of the fires went out as the rising waters and the confused tangle of fire chains did their work the dragon didnt appear to be inclined to start any more it had made its point i wonder who itll be said nobby what said carrot the sacrifice i mean sergeant said people wouldnt put up with it said carrot stoically yeah well look at it this way if you say to people whats it to be either your house burned down around you or some girl youve probably never met being eaten well they might get a bit thoughtful human nature see im sure a hero will turn up in time said carrot with some new sort of weapon or something and strike at its voonerable spot there was the silence of sudden intense listening whats one of them said nobby a spot where its voonerable my grandad used to tell me stories hit a dragon in its voonerables he said and youve killed it like kicking it in the wossnames said nobby interestedly dunno i suppose so although nobby ive told you before it is not right to and wheres the spot like oh a different place on each dragon you wait till it flies over and then you say theres the voonerable spot and then you kill it said carrot something like that sergeant colon stared blankly into space hmm said nobby they watched the panorama of panic for a while then sergeant colon said you sure about the voonerables yes oh yes i wish you hadnt been lad they looked at the terrified city again you know said nobby you always told me you used to win guards guards prizes for archery in the army sergeant you said you had a lucky arrow you always made sure you got your lucky arrow back you said you all right all right but this isnt the same thing is it anyway im not a hero why should do it captain vimes pays us thirty dollars a month said carrot yes said nobby grinning and you get five dollars extra responsibility allowance but captain vimes has gone said colon wretchedly carrot looked at him sternly i am sure he said that if he were here hed be the first to colon waved him into silence thats all very well he said but what if i miss look on the bright side said nobby youll probably never know it sergeant colons expression mutated into an evil desperate grin well never know it you mean he said what if you think im standing on some rooftop on my tod you can think again i order you to accompany me anyway he added you get one dollar responsibility allowance too nobbys face twisted in panic no i dont he croaked captain vimes said he was docking it for five years for being a disgrace to the species well you might just get it back anyway you know all about voonerables ive watched you fight carrot saluted smartly permission to volunteer sir he said and i only get twenty dollars a month training pay and i dont mind at all sir sergeant colon cleared his throat then he straightened the hang of his breastplate it was one of those with astonishingly impressive pectoral muscles embossed upon it his chest and stomach fitted into it in the same way that jelly fits into a mould what would captain vimes do now well hed have a drink but if he didnt have a drink what would he do what we need he said slowly is a plan that sounded good that sentence alone sounded worth the pay if you had a plan you were halfway there and already he thought he could hear the cheering of crowds they were lining the streets and they were throwing flowers and terry pratchett he was being carried triumphantly through the grateful city the drawback was he suspected that he was being carried in an urn lupine wonse padded along the draughty corridors to the patricians bedroom it had never been a sumptuous apartment at best and contained little more than a narrow bed and a few battered cupboards it looked even worse now with one wall gone sleepwalk at night now and you could step right into the vast cavern that was the great hall even so he shut the door behind him for a semblance of privacy then cautiously and with many nervous glances at the great space beyond he knelt down in the centre of the floor and pried up a board a long black robe was dragged into view then wonse reached further down into the dusty space between the floors and rummaged around he rummaged still further then he lay down and stuck both arms into the gap and flailed desperately a book sailed across the room and hit him in the back of the head looking for this were you said vimes he stepped out of the shadows wonse was on his knees his mouth opening and shutting whats he going to say vimes thought is it going to be i know what this looks like or will it be how did you get in here or maybe itll be listen i can explain everything i wish i had a loaded dragon in my hands right now wonse said okay clever of you to guess of course that was always an outside chance vimes added under the floorboards he said aloud first place anyoned look rather foolish that was i know i suppose he didnt think anyone would be searching said wonse standing up and brushing the dust off himself im sorry said vimes pleasantly vetinari you know how he was for scheming and things he was involved in most of the plots against himself that was how he ran things he enjoyed it obviously he called it up and couldnt control it something even more cunning than he was guards guards so what were you doing said vimes i wondered if it might be possible to reverse the spell or maybe call up another dragon theyd fight then a sort of balance of terror you mean said vimes could be worth a try said wonse earnestly he took a few steps closer look about your job i know we were both a bit overwrought at the time so of course if you want it back therell be no prob it must have been terrible said vimes imagine what must have gone through his mind he called it up and then found it wasnt just some sort of tool but a real thing with a mind of its own a mind just like his but with all the brakes off you know i wouldnt mind betting that at the start he really thought that what he was doing was all for the best he must have been insane sooner or later anyway yes said wonse hoarsely it must have been terrible ye gods but id like to get my hands on him all those years ive known the man and id never realised wonse said nothing run said vimes softly what run i want to see you run i dont underst i saw someone run away the night the dragon flamed that house i remember thinking at the time that he moved in a funny way sort of bounding along and then the other day i saw you running away from the dragon could almost have been the same man i thought skipping almost like someone running to keep up any of them get out wonse wonse waved a hand in what he might have thought was a nonchalant way thats just ridiculous thats not proof he said i noticed you sleep in here now said vimes i suppose the king likes to have you handy does he youve got no proof at all whispered wonse of course i havent the way someone runs the eager tone of voice thats all but that doesnt matter does it because it wouldnt matter even if i did have proof said vimes theres noone to take it to and you cant give me my job back i can said wonse i can and you neednt just be captain terry pratchett you cant give me my job back repeated vimes it was never yours to take away i was never an officer of the city or an officer of the king or an officer of the patrician i was an officer of the law it might have been corrupted and bent but it was law of a sort there isnt any law now except youll get burned alive if you dont watch out wheres the place in there for me wonse darted forward and grabbed him by the arm but you can help me he said there may be a way to destroy the dragon dyou see or at least we can help people channel things to mitigate the worst of it somehow find a meeting point vimess blow caught wonse on the cheek and spun him around the dragons here he snapped you cant channel it or persuade it or negotiate with it theres no truce with dragons you brought it here and were stuck with it you bastard wonse lowered his hand from the bright white mark where the punch had connected what are you going to do he said vimes didnt know hed thought of a dozen ways that the thing could go but the only one that was really suitable was killing wonse and face to face he couldnt do it thats the trouble with people like you said wonse getting up youre always against anything attempted for the betterment of mankind but you never have any proper plans of your own guards guards he grinned maniacally at vimes didnt expect that did you he said weve still got guards here you know not so many of course not many people want to come in there were footsteps in the passage outside and four of the palace guards padded in swords drawn i wouldnt put up a fight if i were you wonse went on theyre desperate and uneasy men but very highly paid vimes said nothing wonse was a gloater you always stood a chance with gloaters the old patrician had never been a gloater you could say that for him if he wanted you dead you never even heard about it the thing to do with gloaters was play the game according to the rules youll never get away with it he said guards guards youre right youre absolutely right but never is a long time said wonse none of us get away with anything for that long you shall have some time to reflect on this he said and nodded to the guards throw him in the special dungeon and then go about that other little task er said the leader of the guards and hesitated whats the matter man you er want us to attack him said the guard miserably thick though the palace guard were they were as aware as everyone else of the conventions and when guards are summoned to deal with one man in overheated circumstances its not a good time for them the buggers bound to be heroic he was thinking this guard was not looking forward to a future in which he was dead of course you idiot but er theres only one of him said the guard captain and hes smilin said a man behind him probly goin to swing on the chandeliers any minute said one of his colleagues and kick over the table and that hes not even armed shrieked wonse worst kind that said one of the guards with deep stoicism they leap up see and grab one of the ornamental swords behind the shield over the fireplace yeah said another suspiciously and then they chucks a chair at you theres no fireplace theres no sword theres only him now take him screamed wonse a couple of guards grabbed vimes tentatively by the shoulders youre not going to do anything heroic are you whispered one of them wouldnt know where to start he said oh right as vimes was hauled away he heard wonse breaking into insane laughter they always did your gloaters but he was correct about one thing vimes didnt have a plan he hadnt thought much about what was going to happen next hed been a fool he told himself to think that you just had a confrontation and that was the end of it he also wondered what the other task was terry pratchett the palace guards said nothing but stared straight ahead and marched him down across the ruined hall and through the wreckage of another corridor to an ominous door they opened it threw him in and marched away and noone absolutely noone noticed the thin leaflike thing that floated gently down from the shadows of the roof tumbling over and over in the air like a sycamore seed before landing in the tangled gewgaws of the hoard it was a peanut shell it was the silence that awoke lady ramkin her bedroom looked out over the dragon pens and she was used to sleeping to the susurration of rustling scales the occasional roar of a dragon flaming in its sleep and the keening of the gravid females absence of any sound at all was like an alarm clock she had cried a bit before going to sleep but not much because it was no use being soppy and letting the side down she lit the lamp pulled on her rubber boots grabbed the stick which might be all that stood between her and theoretical loss of virtue and hurried down through the shadowy house as she crossed the damp lawn to the kennels she was vaguely aware that something was happening down in the city but dismissed it as not currently worth thinking about dragons were more important she pushed open the door well they were still there the familiar stink of swamp dragons half pond mud and half chemical explosion gusted out into the night each dragon was balancing on its hind legs in the centre of its pen neck arched staring with ferocious intensity at the roof oh she said flying around up there again is it showing off dont you worry about it children mummys here she put the lamp on a high shelf and stamped along to errols pen well now my lad she began and stopped errol was stretched out on his side a thin plume of grey smoke was drifting from his mouth and his stomach expanded and contracted like a bellows and his skin from the neck down was an almost pure white guards guards i think if i ever rewrite diseases youll get a whole chapter all to yourself she said quietly and unbolted the gate of the pen lets see if that nasty temperature has gone down shall we she reached out to stroke his skin and gasped she pulled the hand back hurriedly and watched the blisters form on her fingertips errol was so cold he burned as she stared at him the small round marks that her warmth had melted filmed over with frozen air lady ramkin sat back on her haunches just what kind of dragon are you she began there was the distant sound of a knock at the front door of the house she hesitated for a moment then blew out the lamp crept heavily along the length of the kennels and pulled aside the scrap of sacking over the window the first light of dawn showed her the silhouette of a guardsman on her doorstep the plumes of his helmet blowing in the breeze she bit her lip in panic scuttled back to the door fled across the lawn and dived into the house taking the stairs three at a time stupid stupid she muttered realising the lamp was back downstairs but no time for that by the time she went and got it vimes might have gone away working by feel and memory in the gloom she found her best wig and rammed it on her head somewhere among the ointments and dragon remedies on her dressing table was something called as far as she could remember dew of the night or some such unsuitable name a present long ago from a thoughtless nephew she tried several bottles before she found something that by the smell of it was probably the one even to a nose which had long ago shut down most of its sensory apparatus in the face of the overpoweringness of dragons it seemed well more potent than she remembered but apparently men liked that kind of thing or so she had read damn nonsense really she twitched the top hem of her suddenly far too sensible nightshirt into a position which she hoped revealed without actually exposing and hurried back down the stairs she stopped in front of the door took a deep breath twisted the handle and realised even as she pulled the door open that she should have taken the rubber boots off terry pratchett guards guards why captain she said winsomely this is a who the hell are you the head of the palace guard took several steps backwards and because he was of peasant stock made a few surreptitious signs to ward off evil spirits they clearly didnt work when he opened his eyes again the thing was still there still bristling with rage still reeking of something sickly and fermented still crowned with a skewed mass of curls still looming behind a quivering bosom that made the roof of his mouth go dry hed heard about these sort of things harpies they were called what had it done with lady ramkin the sight of the rubber boots had him confused though legends about harpies were short on references to rubber boots out with it fellow lady ramkin boomed hitching up her nightie to a more respectable neckline dont just stand there opening and shutting your mouth what dyou want lady sybil ramkin said the guard not in the polite way of someone seeking mere confirmation but in the incredulous tones of someone who found it very hard to believe the answer could be yes use your eyes young man who dyou think i am the guard pulled himself together only ive got a summons for lady sybil ramkin he said uncertainly her voice was withering what do you mean a summons to attend upon the palace you see i cant imagine why that is necessary at this time in the morning she said and made to slam the door it wouldnt shut though because of the sword point jammed into it at the last moment if you dont come said the guard i have been ordered to take steps the door shot back and her face pressed against his almost knocking him unconscious with the scent of rotting rose petals if you think youll lay a hand on me she began the guards glance darted sideways just for a moment to the dragon kennels sybil ramkins face went pale you wouldnt she hissed he swallowed fearsome though she was she was only human she could only bite your head off metaphorically there were he told himself far worse things than lady ramkin although admittedly they werent three inches from his nose at this point in time take steps he repeated in a croak she straightened up and eyed the row of guards behind him i see she said coldly thats the way is it six of you to fetch one feeble woman very well you will of course allow me to fetch a coat it is somewhat chilly she slammed the door the palace guards stamped their feet in the cold and tried not to look at one another this obviously wasnt the way you went around arresting people they werent allowed to keep you waiting on the doorstep this wasnt the way the world was supposed to work on the other hand the only alternative was to go in there and drag her out and it wasnt one anyone could summon any enthusiasm for besides the guard captain wasnt sure he had enough men to drag lady ramkin anywhere youd need teams of thousands with log rollers the door creaked open again revealing only the musty darkness of the hall within right men said the captain uneasily lady ramkin appeared he got a brief blurred vision of her bounding through the doorway screaming and it might well have been the last thing he remembered if a guard hadnt had the presence of mind to trip her up as she hurtled down the steps she plunged forward cursing ploughed into the overgrown lawn hit her head on a crumbling statue of an antique ramkin and slid to a halt the doublehanded broadsword she had been holding landed beside her bolt upright and vibrated to a standstill after a while one of the guards crept forward cautiously and tested the blade with his finger bloody hell he said in a voice of mixed horror and respect and the dragon wants to eat her fits the bill said the captain shes got to be the highestborn lady in the city i dont know about maiden he added and right at this minute im not going to speculate someone go and fetch a cart he fingered his ear which had been nicked by the tip of the sword he was not by nature an unkind man but at this moment terry pratchett he was certain that he would prefer the thickness of a dragons hide between himself and sybil ramkin when she woke up werent we supposed to kill her pet dragons sir said another guard i thought mr wonse said something about killing all the dragons that was just a threat we were supposed to make said the captain the guards brow furrowed you sure sir i thought the captain had had enough of this screaming harpies and broadswords making a noise like tearing silk in the air beside him had severely ruined his capacity for seeing the other fellows point of view oh you thought did you he growled a thinker are you do you think youd be suitable for another posting then city guard maybe theyre full of thinkers they are there was an uncomfortable titter from the rest of the guards if youd thought added the captain sarcastically youd have thought that the king is hardly going to want other dragons dead is he theyre probably distant relatives or something i mean it wouldnt want us to go around killing its own kind would it well sir people do sir said the guard sulkily ah well said the captain thats different he tapped the side of his helmet meaningfully thats cos were intelligent vimes landed in damp straw and also in pitch darkness although after a while his eyes became accustomed to the gloom and he could make out the walls of the dungeon it hadnt been built for gracious living it was basically just a space containing all the pillars and arches that supported the palace at the far end a small grille high on the wall let in a mere suspicion of grubby secondhand light there was another square hole in the floor it was also barred the bars were quite rusty though it occurred to vimes that he could probably work them loose eventually and then all he would have to do was slim down enough to go through a nineinch hole what the dungeon did not contain was any rats scorpions cockroaches or snakes it had once contained snakes it was true because vimess sandals crunched on small long white skeletons guards guards he crept cautiously along one damp wall wondering where the rhythmic scraping sound was coming from he rounded a squat pillar and found out the patrician was shaving squinting into a scrap of mirror propped against the pillar to catch the light no vimes realised not propped supported in fact by a rat it was a large rat with red eyes the patrician nodded to him without apparent surprise oh he said vimes isnt it i heard you were on the way down jolly good you had better tell the kitchen staff and here vimes realised that the man was speaking to the rat that there will be two for lunch would you like a beer vimes what said vimes i imagine you would pot luck though i am afraid skrps people are bright enough but they seem to have a bit of a blind spot when it comes to labels on bottles lord vetinari patted his face with a towel and dropped it cm the floor a grey shape darted from the shadows and dragged it away down the floor grille then he said very well skrp you may go the rat twitched its whiskers at him leaned the mirror against the wall and trotted off youre waited on by rats said vimes they help out you know theyre not really very efficient im afraid its their paws but but but said vimes i mean how i suspect skrps people have tunnels that extend into the university lord vetinari went on although i think they were probably pretty bright to start with at least vimes understood that bit it was well known that thaumic radiations affected animals living around the unseen university campus sometimes prodding them towards minute analogues of human civilisation and even mutating some of them into entirely new and specialised species such as the bookworm and the wallfish and as the man said rats were quite bright to start with but theyre helping you said vimes mutual its mutual payment for services rendered you might say said the patrician sitting down on what vimes couldnt help noticing was a small velvet cushion on a low terry pratchett shelf so as to be handy were a notepad and a neat row of books how can you help rats sir he said weakly advice i advise them you know the patrician leaned back thats the trouble with people like wonse he said they never know when to stop rats snakes and scorpions it was sheer bedlam in here when i came the rats were getting the worst of it too and vimes thought he was beginning to get the drift you mean you sort of trained them he said advised advised i suppose its a knack said lord vetinari modestly vimes wondered how it was done did the rats side with the scorpions against the snakes and then when the snakes were beaten invite the scorpions to a celebratory slapup meal and eat them or were individual scorpions hired with large amounts of oh whatever it was scorpions ate to sidle up to selected leading snakes at night and sting them he remembered hearing once about a man who locked up in a cell for years trained little birds and created a sort of freedom and he thought of ancient sailors shorn of the sea by old age and infirmity who spent their days making big ships in little bottles then he thought of the patrician robbed of his city sitting crosslegged on the grey floor in the dim dungeon and recreating it around him encouraging in miniature all the little rivalries power struggles and factions he thought of him as a sombre brooding statue amid paving stones alive with slinking shadows and sudden political death it had probably been easier than ruling ankh which had larger vermin who didnt have to use both hands to carry a knife there was a clink over by the drain haifa dozen rats appeared dragging something wrapped in a cloth they rathandled it past the grille and with great effort hauled it to the patricians feet he leaned down and undid the knot we seem to have cheese chicken legs celery a piece of rather stale bread and a nice bottle oh a nice bottle apparently of merckle and stingbats very famous brown sauce beer i said skrp the leading rat twitched its nose at him sorry about this vimes they cant read you see they dont seem to get the hang of the concept but theyre very good at listening they bring me all the news guards guards i see youre very comfortable here said vimes weakly never build a dungeon you wouldnt be happy to spend the night in yourself said the patrician laying out the food on the cloth the world would be a happier place if more people remembered that we all thought you had built secret tunnels and suchlike said vimes cant imagine why said the patrician one would have to keep on running so inefficient whereas here i am at the hub of things i hope you understand that vimes never trust any ruler who puts his faith in tunnels and bunkers and escape routes the chances are that his heart isnt in the job oh hes in a dungeon in his own palace with a raving lunatic in charge upstairs and a dragon burning the city and he thinks hes got the world where he wants it it must be something about high office the altitude sends people mad you er you dont mind if i have a look around do you he said feel free said the patrician vimes paced the length of the dungeon and checked the door it was heavily barred and bolted and the lock was massive then he tapped the walls in what might possibly be hollow places there was no doubt that it was a wellbuilt dungeon it was the kind of dungeon youd feel good about having dangerous criminals put in of course in those circumstances youd prefer there to be no trapdoors hidden tunnels or secret ways of escape these werent those circumstances it was amazing what several feet of solid stone did to your sense of perspective do guards come in here he demanded hardly ever said the patrician waving a chicken leg they dont bother about feeding me you see the idea is that one should moulder in fact he said up til recently i used to go to the door and groan a bit every now and then just to keep them happy theyre bound to come in and check though said vimes hopefully oh i dont think we should tolerate that said the patrician how are you going to prevent them lord vetinari gave him a pained look terry pratchett guards guards my dear vimes he said i thought you were an observant man did you look at the door of course i did said vimes and added sir its bloody massive perhaps you should have another look vimes gaped at him and then stamped across the floor and glared at the door it was one of the popular dread portal variety all bars and bolts and iron spikes and massive hinges no matter how long he looked at it it didnt become any less massive the lock was one of those dwarfishmade buggers that itd take years to pick all in all if you had to have a symbol for something totally immovable that door was your man the patrician appeared alongside him in heartstopping silence you see he said its always the case is it not that should a city be overtaken by violent civil unrest the current ruler is thrown into the dungeons to a certain type of mind that is so much more satisfying than mere execution well okay but i dont see vimes began and you look at this door and what you see is a really strong cell door yes of course youve only got to look at the bolts and you know im really rather pleased said lord vetinari quietly vimes stared at the door until his eyebrows ached and then just as random patterns in cloud suddenly without changing in any way become a horses head or a sailing ship he saw what hed been looking at all along a sense of terrifying admiration overcame him he wondered what it was like in the patricians mind all cold and shiny he thought all blued steel and icicles and little wheels clicking along like a huge clock the kind of mind that would carefully consider its own downfall and turn it to advantage it was a perfectly normal dungeon door but it all depended on your sense of perspective in this dungeon the patrician could hold off the world all that was on the outside was the lock all the bolts and bars were on the inside the rank clambered awkwardly across the damp rooftops as the morning mist was boiled off by the sun not that there would be any clear air today sticky swathes of smoke and stale steam wreathed the city and filled the air with the sad smell of dampened cinders what is this place said carrot helping the others along a greasy walkway sergeant colon looked around at the forest of chimneys were just above jimkin bearhuggers whisky distillery he said on a direct line see between the palace and the plaza its bound to fly over here nobby looked wistfully over the side of the building i bin in there once he said checked the door one dark night and it just come open in my hand eventually i expect said colon sourly well i had to go in dint i to check there was no miscreanting going on amazing place in there all pipes and stuff and the smell every bottle matured for up to seven minutes quoted colon ha a drop afore ye go it says on the label damn right too i had a drop once and i went all day he knelt down and unwrapped the long sacking package he had been manhandling with extreme difficulty during the climb this revealed a longbow of ancient design and a quiver of arrows he picked up the bow slowly reverentially and ran his pudgy fingers along it you know he said quietly i was damn good with this when i were a lad the captain should of let me have a go the other night you keep on telling us said nobby unsympathetically well i used to win prizes the sergeant unwound a new bowstring looped it around one end of the bow stood up pressed down grunted a bit er carrot he said slightly out of breath yes sarge you any good at stringing bows carrot grasped the bow compressed it easily and slipped the other end of the string into place thats a good start sarge said nobby dont you be sarcastic with me nobby it aint strength its terry pratchett keenness of eye and steadiness of hand what counts now you pass me an arrow not that one nobbys fingers froze in the act of grasping a shaft thats my lucky arrow spluttered colon none of you is to touch my lucky arrow looks just like any other bloody arrow to me sarge said nobby mildly thats the one i shall use for the actual wossname the coup de grass said colon never let me down my lucky arrow didnt hit whatever i shot at hardly even had to aim if that dragons got any voonerables that arrowll find em he selected an identicallooking but presumably less lucky arrow and nocked it then he looked around the rooftops with a speculative eye better get my hand in he muttered of course once you learn you never forget its like riding a riding a riding something you never forget being able to ride he pulled the bowstring back to his ear and grunted right he wheezed as his arm trembled with the tension like a branch in a gale see the roof of the assassins guild over there they peered through the grubby air right then said colon and do you see the weathervane on it do you see it carrot glanced at the arrowhead it was weaving back and forth in a series of figureeights its a long way off sarge said nobby doubtfully never you mind me you keep your eyes on the weathervane groaned the sergeant they nodded the weathervane was in the shape of a creeping man with a big cloak his outstretched dagger was always turned to stab the wind at this distance though it was tiny okay panted colon now dyou see the mans eye oh come on said nobby shutup shutup shutup groaned colon do you see it i said i think i can see it sarge said carrot loyally right right said the sergeant swaying backwards and forwards with effort right good lad okay now keep an eye on it right guards guards he grunted and loosed the arrow several things happened so fast that they will have to be recounted in stopmotion prose probably the first was the bowstring slapping into the soft inner part of colons wrist causing him to scream and drop the bow this had no effect on the path of the arrow which was already flying straight and true towards a gargoyle on the rooftop just across the road it hit it on the ear bounced ricocheted off a wall six feet away and headed back towards colon apparently at a slightly increased speed going past his ear with a silky humming noise it vanished in the direction of the city walls after a while nobby coughed and gave carrot a look of innocent inquiry about how big he said is a dragons voonerables roughly oh it can be a tiny spot said carrot helpfully i was sort of afraid of that said nobby he wandered to the edge of the roof and pointed downwards theres a pond just here he said they use it for cooling water in the stills i reckon its pretty deep so after the sergeant has shot at the dragon we can jump in it what dyou say oh but we dont need to do that said carrot because the sergeants lucky arrow would of hit the spot and the dragonll be dead so we wont have anything to worry about granted granted said nobby hurriedly looking at colons scowling face but just in case you know if by a milliontoone chance he misses im not saying he will mark you you just have to think of all eventualities if by incredible bad luck he doesnt quite manage to hit the voonerable dead on then your dragon is going to lose his rag right and its probably a good idea to not be here its a long shot i know call me a worrywart if you like thats all im saying sergeant colon adjusted his armour haughtily when you really need them the most he said milliontoone chances always crop up wellknown fact the sergeant is right nobby said carrot virtuously you know that when theres just one chance which might just work well it works otherwise thered be no he lowered his voice i mean it stands to reason if last desperate chances didnt work thered be no well the gods wouldnt let it be any other way they wouldnt terry pratchett as one man the three of them turned and looked through the murky air towards the hub of the discworld thousands of miles away now the air was grey with old smoke and mist shreds but on a clear day it was possible to see cori celesti home of the gods site of the home of the gods anyway they lived in dunmanifestin the stuccoed valhalla where the gods faced eternity with the kind of minds that were at a loss to know what to do to pass a wet afternoon they played games with the fates of men it was said exactly what game they thought they were playing at the moment was anyones guess but of course there were rules everyone knew there were rules they just had to hope like hell that the gods knew the rules too its got to work mumbled colon ill be using my lucky arrow n all youre right last hopeless chances have got to work nothing makes any sense otherwise you might as well not be alive nobby looked down at the pond again after a moments hesitation colon joined him they had the speculative faces of men who had seen many things and knew that while you could of course depend on heroes and kings and ultimately on gods you could really depend on gravity and deep water not that well need it said colon virtuously not with your lucky arrow said nobby thats right but just out of interest how far down is it dyou think said colon about thirty feet id say give or take thirty feet colon nodded slowly thats what id reckon and its deep is it very deep ive heard ill take your word for it it looks pretty mucky id hate to have to jump in it carrot slapped him cheerfully on the back nearly pushing him over and said whats up sarge do you want to live for ever dunno ask me again in five hundred years its a good job weve got your lucky arrow then said carrot hmm said colon who seemed to be in a miserable daydream world of his own i mean its a good job weve got a last desperate milliontoone chance to rely on or wed really be in trouble oh yes said nobby sadly lucky old us guards guards the patrician lay back a couple of rats dragged a cushion under his head things are rather bad outside i gather he said yes said vimes bitterly youre right youre the safest man in the city he wedged another knife in a crack in the stones and tested his weight carefully while lord vetinari looked on with interest hed managed to get six feet off the floor and up to a level with the grille now he started to hack at the mortar around the bars the patrician watched him for a while and then took a book off the little shelf beside him since the rats couldnt read the library hed been able to assemble was a little baroque but he was not a man to ignore fresh knowledge he found his bookmark in the pages of lacemaking through the ages and read a few pages after a while he found it necessary to brush a few crumbs of mortar off the book and looked up are you achieving success he inquired politely vimes gritted his teeth and hacked away outside the little grille was a grubby courtyard barely lighter than the cell there was a midden in one corner but currently it looked very attractive more attractive than the dungeon at any rate an honest midden was preferable to the way ankhmorpork was going these days it was probably allegorical or something he stabbed stabbed stabbed the knife blade twanged and shook in his hand the librarian scratched his armpits thoughtfully he was facing problems of his own he had come here full of rage against book thieves and that rage still burned but the seditious thought had occurred to him that although crimes against books were the worst kind of crimes revenge ought perhaps to be postponed it occurred to him that while of course what humans chose to do to one another was all one to him there were certain activities that should be curtailed in case the perpetrators got overconfident and started doing things like that to books too the librarian stared at his badge again and gave it a gentle terry pratchett guards guards nibble in the optimistic hope that it had become edible no doubt about it he had a duty to the captain the captain had always been kind to him and the captain had a badge too yes there were times when an ape had to do what a man had to do the orangutan threw a complex salute and swung away into the darkness the sun rose higher rolling through the mists and stale smoke like a lost balloon the rank sat in the shade of a chimney stack waiting and killing time in their various ways nobby was thoughtfully probing the contents of a nostril carrot was writing a letter home and sergeant colon was worrying after a while he shifted his weight uneasily and said ive fought of a problem wassat sarge said carrot sergeant colon looked wretched weeell what if its not a milliontoone chance he said nobby stared at him what dyou mean he said well all right last desperate milliontoone chances always work right no problem but well its pretty wossname specific i mean isnt it you tell me said nobby what if its just a thousandtoone chance said colon agonisedly what anyone ever heard of a thousandtoone shot coming up carrot looked up dont be daft sergeant he said noone ever saw a thousandtoone chance come up the odds against it are his lips moved millions to one yeah millions agreed nobby so itd only work if its your actual milliontoone chance said the sergeant i suppose thats right said nobby so toone for example colon began carrot shook his head wouldnt have a hope noone ever said its a toone chance but it might just work they stared out across the city in the silence of ferocious mental calculation we could have a real problem here said colon eventually carrot started to scribble furiously when questioned he explained at length about how you found the surface area of a dragon and then tried to estimate the chances of an arrow hitting any one spot aimed mind said sergeant colon i aim nobby coughed in that case its got to be a lot less than a milliontoone chance said carrot it could be a hundredtoone if the dragons flying slowly and its a big spot it could be practically a certainty colons lips shaped themselves around the phrase its a certainty but it might just work he shook his head nah he said so what weve got to do then said nobby slowly is adjust the odds now there was a shallow hole in the mortar near the middle bar it wasnt much vimes knew but it was a start you dont require assistance by any chance said the patrician no as you wish the mortar was halfrotted but the bars had been driven deep into the rock under their crusting of rust there was still plenty of iron it was a long job but it was something to do and required a blessed absence of thought they couldnt take it away from him it was a good clean challenge you knew if you went on chipping away youd win through eventually it was the eventually that was the problem eventually great atuin would reach the end of the universe eventually the stars would go out eventually nobby might have a bath although that would probably involve a radical rethinking of the nature of time terry pratchett he hacked at the mortar anyway and then stopped as something small and pale fell down outside quite slowly peanut shell he said the librarians face surrounded by the innertube jowls of the librarians head appeared upside down in the barred opening and gave him a grin that wasnt any less terrible for being the wrong way up oook the orangutan flopped down off the wall grabbed a couple of bars and pulled muscles shunted back and forward across its barrel chest in a complex pavane of effort the mouthful of yellow teeth gaped in silent concentration there were a couple of dull thungs as the bars gave up and broke free the ape flung them aside and reached into the gaping hole then the longest arms of the law grabbed the astonished vimes under his shoulders and pulled him through in one movement the rank surveyed their handiwork right said nobby now what are the chances of a man standing on one leg with his hat on backwards and a handkerchief in his mouth hitting a dragons voonerables mmph said colon its pretty long odds said carrot i reckon the hanky is a bit over the top though colon spat it out make up your minds he said me legs going to sleep vimes picked himself up off the greasy cobbles and stared at the librarian he was experiencing something which had come as a shock to many people usually in much more unpleasant circumstances such as a brawl started in the mended drum when the ape wanted a bit of peace and quiet to enjoy a reflective pint which was this the librarian might look like a stuffed rubber sack but what it was stuffed with was muscle that was amazing was all he could find to say he looked guards guards down at the twisted bars and felt his mind darken he grabbed the bent metal you dont happen to know where wonse is do you he added eeek the librarian thrust a tattered piece of parchment under his nose eeek vimes read the words it hathe pleased whereas at the stroke of noone a maiden pure yet high born compact between ruler and rated in my city he growled in my bloody city he grabbed the librarian by two handfuls of chest hair and pulled him up to eye height what time is it he shouted oook a long redhaired arm unfolded itself upwards vimess gaze followed the pointing finger the sun definitely had the look of a heavenly body that was nearly at the crest of its orbit and looking forward to a long lazy coasting towards the blankets of dusk im not bloody well going to have it understand vimes shouted shaking the ape back and forth oook the librarian pointed out patiently what oh sorry vimes lowered the ape who wisely didnt make an issue of it because a man angry enough to lift soolbs of orangutan without noticing is a man with too much on his mind now he was staring around the courtyard any way out of here he said without climbing the walls i mean he didnt wait for an answer but loped around the walls until he reached a narrow grubby door and kicked it open it hadnt been locked anyway but he kicked it just the same the librarian trailed along behind swinging on his knuckles the kitchen on the other side of the door was almost deserted the staff having finally lost their nerve and decided that all prudent chefs refrained from working in an establishment where there was a mouth bigger than they were a couple of palace guards were eating a cold lunch now said vimes as they halfrose i dont want to have to they didnt seem to want to listen one of them reached for a crossbow terry pratchett oh the hell with it vimes grabbed a butchers knife from a block beside it and threw it there is an art in throwing knives and even then you need the right kind of knife otherwise it does just what this one did which is miss completely the guard with the bow leaned sideways righted himself and found that a purple fingernail was gently blocking the firing mechanism he looked around the librarian hit him right on top of his helmet the other guard shrank back waving his hands frantically nonono he said its a misunderstanding what was it you said you didnt want to have to do nice monkey oh dear said vimes wrong he ignored the terrified screaming and rummaged through the debris of the kitchen until he came up with a cleaver hed never felt really at home with swords but a cleaver was a different matter a cleaver had weight it had purpose a sword might have a certain nobility about it unless it was the one belonging for example to nobby which relied on rust to hold it together but what a cleaver had was a tremendous ability to cut things up he left the biology lesson that no monkey was capable of bouncing someone up and down by their ankles found a likely door and hurried through it this took him outside again into the big cobbled area that surrounded the palace now he could get his bearings now he could there was a boom in the air above him a gale blew downwards knocking him over the king of ankhmorpork wings outspread glided across the sky and settled for a moment on the palace gateway talons gouging long scars in the stone as it caught its balance the sun glittered off its arched back as it stretched its neck roared a lazy billow of flames and sprang into the air again vimes made an animal a mammalian animal noise in the back of his throat and ran out into the empty streets silence filled the ancestral home of the ramkins the front door swung back and forth on its hinges letting in the common badlybrought up breeze which wandered through the deserted rooms guards guards gawping and looking for dust on the top of the furniture it wound up the stairs and banged through the door of sybil ramkins bedroom rattling the bottles on the dressing table and riffling through the pages of diseases of the dragon a really fast reader could have learned the symptoms of everything from abated heels to zigzag throat and down below in the low warm and foulsmelling shed that housed the swamp dragons it seemed that errol had got them all now he sat in the centre of his pen swaying and moaning softly white smoke rolled slowly from his ears and drifted towards the floor from somewhere inside his swollen stomach came complex explosive hydraulic noises as though desperate teams of gnomes were trying to drive a culvert through a cliff in a thunderstorm his nostrils flared turning more or less of their own volition the other dragons craned over the pen walls watching him cautiously there was another distant gastric roar errol shifted painfully the dragons exchanged glances then one by one they lay down carefully on the floor and put their paws over their eyes nobby put his head on one side it looks promising he said critically we might be nearly there i reckon the chances of a man with soot on his face his tongue sticking out standing on one leg and singing the hedgehog song ever hitting a dragons voonerables would be whatd you say carrot a million to one i reckon said carrot virtuously colon glared at them listen lads he said youre not winding me up are you carrot looked down at the plaza below them oh bloody hell he said softly wassat said colon urgently looking around theyre chaining a woman to a rock the rank stared over the parapet the huge and silent crowd that lined the plaza stared too at a white figure struggling between half a dozen palace guards wonder where they got the rock from said colon were on loam here you know terry pratchett fine strapping wench whoever she is said nobby approvingly as one of the guards wheeled off bowlegged and collapsed thats one lad who wont know what to do with his evenins for a few weeks got a mean right knee so she has anyone we know said colon carrot squinted its lady ramkin he said his mouth dropping open never hes right in a nightie said nobby the buggers colon snatched up his bow and fumbled for an arrow ill give em voonerables wellspoken lady like her its a disgrace er said carrot who had glanced over his shoulder sergeant this is what it comes to muttered colon decent women cant walk down the street without being eaten right you bastards youre youre geography sergeant carrot repeated urgently its history not geography said nobby thats what youre supposed to say history youre history you say well whatever snapped colon lets see how sergeant nobby was looking behind them too oh shit he said cant miss muttered colon taking aim sergeant shut up you two i cant concentrate when you keep shout sergeant its comingl the dragon accelerated the drunken rooftops of ankhmorpork blurred as it passed over wings sneering at the air its neck stretched out straight ahead the pilot flames of its nostrils streamed behind it the sound of its flight panned across the sky guards guards colons hands shook the dragon seemed to be aiming at his throat and it was moving too fast far too fast this is it said carrot he glanced towards the hub in case any gods had forgotten what they were there for and added speaking slowly and distinctly its a milliontoonechance but it might just work fire the bloody thing screamed nobby picking my spot lad picking my spot quavered colon dont you worry lads i told you this is my lucky arrow firstclass arrow this arrow had it since i was a lad youd be amazed at the things i shot at with this dont you worry he paused as the nightmare bore down on him on wings of terror er carrot he said meekly yes sarge did your old grandad ever say what a voonerable spot looks like and then the dragon wasnt approaching any more it was there passing a few feet overhead a streaming mosaic of scales and noise filling the entire sky colon fired they watched the arrow rise straight and true vimes halfran halfstaggered over the damp cobbles out of breath and out of time it cant be like this he thought wildly the hero always cuts it fine but he always get there just in the nick of time only the nick of time was probably five minutes ago and im not a hero im out of condition and i need a drink and i get a handful of dollars a month without plumes allowance thats not heros pay heroes get kingdoms and princesses and they take regular exercise and when they smile the light glints off their teeth ting the bastards sweat stung his eyes the rush of adrenaline that had carried him out of the palace had spent itself and was now exacting its inevitable toll he stumbled to a halt and grabbed a wall to keep him upright while he gasped for air and thus he saw the figures on the rooftop terry pratchett guards guards oh no he thought theyre not heroes either what do they think theyre playing at it was a milliontoone chance and who was to say that somewhere in the millions of other possible universes it might not have worked that was the sort of thing the gods really liked but chance who sometimes can overrule even the gods has casting votes in this universe for example the arrow bounced off a scale and clattered away into oblivion colon stared as the dragons pointed tail passed overhead it missed he mouthed but it couldnt of missed he stared redeyed at the other two it was a sodding last desperate milliontoone chance the dragon twisted its wings swung its huge bulk around on a pivot of air and bore down on the roof carrot grabbed nobby around the waist and laid a hand on colons shoulder the sergeant was weeping with rage and frustration milliontobloodyone last desperate bloody chance sarge the dragon flamed it was a beautifully controlled line of plasma it went through the roof like butter it cut through stairways it crackled into ancient timbers and made them twist like paper it sliced into pipes it punched through floor after floor like the fist of an angry god and eventually reached the big copper vat containing a thousand gallons of freshlymade mature whiskytype spirit it burned into that too fortunately the chances of anyone surviving the ensuing explosion were exactly a milliontoone the fireball rose like a well a rose a huge orange rose streaked with yellow it took the roof with it and wrapped it around the astonished dragon lifting it high into the air in a boiling cloud of broken timber and bits of piping the crowd watched in bemusement as the superhot blast flung it into the sky and barely noticed vimes as he pushed his way wheezing and crying through the press of bodies he shouldered past a row of palace guards and shambled as fast as he could across the flagstones noone was paying him much attention at the moment he stopped it wasnt a rock because ankhmorpork was on loam it was just some huge remnant of mortared masonry probably thousands of years old from somewhere in the city foundations ankhmorpork was so old now that what it was built on by and large was ankhmorpork it had been dragged into the centre of the plaza and lady sybil ramkin had been chained to it she appeared to be wearing a nightie and huge rubber boots by the look of her she had been in a fight and vimes felt a momentary pang of sympathy for whoever else had been involved she gave him a look of pure fury you youl he waved the cleaver vaguely but why you he began captain vimes she said sharply you will oblige me by not waving that thing about and you will start putting it to its proper use vimes wasnt listening thirty dollars a month he muttered thats what they died for thirty dollars and i docked some from nobby i had to didnt i i mean that man could make a melon go rusty captain vimes he focused on the cleaver oh he said yes right it was a good steel cleaver and the chains were elderly and rather rusty iron he hacked away raising sparks from the masonry the crowd watched in silence but several palace guards hurried towards him terry pratchett what the hell do you think youre doing said one of them who didnt have much imagination what the hell do you think youre doing vimes growled looking up they stared at him what vimes took another hack at the chains several loops tinkled to the ground right youve asked for one of the guards began vimess elbow caught him under his rib cage before he collapsed vimess foot kicked savagely at the other ones kneecaps bringing his chin down ready for another stab with the other elbow right said vimes absently he rubbed the elbow it was sheer agony he moved the cleaver to his other hand and hammered at the chains again aware at the back of his mind that more guards were hurrying up but with that special kind of run that guards had he knew it well it was the run that said theres a dozen of us let someone else get there first it said he looks ready to kill noones paying me to get killed maybe if i run slowly enough hell get away no point in spoiling a good day by catching someone lady ramkin shook herself free a ragged cheer went up and started to grow in volume even in their current state of mind the people of ankhmorpork always appreciated a performance she grabbed a handful of chain and wrapped it around one pudgy fist some of those guards dont know how to treat she began no time no time said vimes grabbing her arm it was like trying to drag a mountain the cheering stopped abruptly there was a sound behind vimes it was not particularly a loud noise it just had a peculiarly nasty carrying quality it was the click of four sets of talons hitting the flagstones at the same time vimes looked around and up soot clung to the dragons hide a few pieces of charred wood had lodged here and there and were still smouldering the magnificent bronze scales were streaked with black it lowered its head until vimes was a few feet away from its eyes and tried to focus on him guards guards probably not worth running vimes told himself its not as if ive got the energy anyway he felt lady ramkins hand engulf his jolly well done she said it nearly worked charred and blazing wreckage rained down around the distillery the pond was a swamp of debris covered with a coating of ash out of it dripping slime rose sergeant colon he clawed his way to the bank and pulled himself up like some seadwelling lifeform that was anxious to get the whole evolution thing over with in one go nobby was already there spread out like a frog leaking water is that you nobby said sergeant colon anxiously its me sergeant i glad about that nobby said colon fervently i wish it wasnt me sergeant colon tipped the water out of his helmet and then paused what about young carrot he said nobby pushed himself up on his elbows groggily dunno he said one minute we were on the roof next minute we were jumping they both looked at the ashen waters of the pond i suppose said colon slowly he can swim dunno he never said not much to swim in up in the mountains when you come to think about it said nobby but perhaps there were limpid blue pools and deep mountain streams said the sergeant hopefully and icy tarns in hidden valleys and that not to mention subterranean lakes hed be bound to have learned in and out of the water all day i expect they stared at the greasy grey surface it was probably that protective said nobby praps it filled with water and dragged him down colon nodded gloomily ill hold your helmet said nobby after a while but im your superior officer yes said nobby reasonably but if you get stuck down there youre going to want your best man up here ready to rescue you arent you terry pratchett thatsreasonable said colon eventually thats a good point right then drawback is though what i cant swim colon said how did you get out of that then colon shrugged im a natural floater their eyes once again turned to the dankness of the pond then colon stared at nobby then nobby very slowly unbuckled his helmet there isnt someone still in there is there said carrot behind them they looked around he hoicked some mud out of an ear behind him the remains of the brewery smouldered i thought id better nip out quickly see what was going on he said brightly pointing to a gate leading out of the yard it was hanging by one hinge oh said nobby weakly jolly good theres an alley out there said carrot no dragons in it are there said colon suspiciously no dragons no humans theres noone around said carrot impatiently he drew his sword come on he said where to said nobby hed pulled a damp butt from behind his ear and was looking at it with an expression of deepest sorrow it was obviously too far gone he tried to light it anyway we want to fight the dragon dont we said carrot colon shifted uncomfortably yes but arent we allowed to go home for a change of clothes first and a nice warm drink said nobby and a meal said colon a nice plate of you should be ashamed of yourselves said carrot theres a lady in distress and a dragon to fight and all you can think of is food and drink oh im not just thinking about food and drink said colon we could be all that stands between the city and total destruction yes but nobby began carrot drew his sword and waved it over his head captain vimes would have gone he said all for one guards guards he glared at them and rushed out of the yard colon gave nobby a sheepish look young people today he said all for one what said nobby the sergeant sighed come on then oh all right they staggered out into the alley it was empty whered he go said nobby carrot stepped out of the shadows grinning all over his face knew i could rely on you he said follow me something odd about that boy said colon as they limped after him he always manages to persuade us to follow him have you noticed all for one what said nobby something about the voice i reckon yes but all for one what the patrician sighed and carefully marking his place laid aside his book to judge from the noise there seemed to be an awful lot of excitement going on out there it was highly unlikely any palace guards would be around which was just as well the guards were highlytrained men and it would be a shame to waste them he would need them later on he padded over to the wall and pushed a small block that looked exactly like all the other small blocks no other small block however would have caused a section of flagstone to grind ponderously aside there was a carefully chosen assortment of stuff in there iron rations spare clothes several small chests of precious metals and jewels tools and there was a key never build a dungeon you couldnt get out of the patrician took the key and strolled over to the door as the wards of the lock slid back in their welloiled grooves he wondered again whether he should have told vimes about the key but the man seemed to have got so much satisfaction out of breaking out it would probably have been positively bad for him to have told him about the key anyway it would have spoiled his terry pratchett view of the world he needed vimes and his view of the world lord vetinari swung the door open and silently strode out into the ruins of his palace they trembled as for the second time in a couple of minutes the city rocked the dragon kennels exploded the windows blew out the door left the wall ahead of a great billow of black smoke and sailed into the air tumbling slowly to plough into the rhododendrons something very energetic and hot was happening in that building more smoke poured out thick and oily and solid one of the walls folded in on itself and then another one toppled sluggishly on to the lawn swamp dragons shot determinedly out of the wreckage like champagne corks wings whirring frantically still the smoke unrolled but there was something in there some point of fierce white light that was gently rising it disappeared from view as it passed a stricken window and then with a piece of roof tile still spinning on the top of his head errol climbed above his own smoke and ascended into the skies of ankhmorpork the sunlight glinted off his silver scales as he hovered about a hundred feet up turning slowly balancing nicely on his own flame vimes awaiting death on the plaza realised that his mouth was hanging open he shut it again there was absolutely no sound in the city now but the noise of errols ascent they can rearrange their own plumbing vimes told himself bemusedly to suit circumstances hes made it work in reverse but his thingys his genes surely he must have been halfway to it anyway no wonder the little bugger has got such stubby wings his body must have known he wasnt going to need them except to steer good grief im watching the first ever dragon to flame backwards he risked a glance immediately above him the great dragon was frozen its enormous bloodshot eyes concentrating on the tiny creature guards guards with a challenging roar of flame and a pummelling of air the king of ankhmorpork rose all thought of mere humans forgotten vimes turned sharply to lady ramkin how do they fight he said urgently how do dragons fight i that is well they just flap at each other and blow flame she said swamp dragons that is i mean whos ever seen a noble dragon fight she patted her nightie i must take some notes ive got my memo book somewhere in your nightshirt its amazing how ideas come to one in bed ive always said flames roared into the space where errol had been but he wasnt there the king tried to spin in midair the little dragon circled in an easy series of smoke rings weaving a cats cradle in the sky with the huge adversary gyrating helplessly in the middle more flames hotter and longer stabbed at him and missed the crowd watched in breathless silence allo captain said an ingratiating voice vimes looked down a small and stagnant pond disguised as nobby grinned sheepishly up at him i thought you were dead he said were not said nobby oh good there didnt seem much else to say what do you reckon on the fight then vimes looked back up smoke trails spiralled across the city im afraid its not going to work said lady ramkin oh hallo nobby afternoon maam said nobby touching what he thought was his forelock what dyou mean its not going to work said vimes look at him go it hasnt hit him yet yes but his flame has touched it several times it doesnt seem to have any effect its not hot enough i think oh hes dodging well but hes got to be lucky every time it has only got to be lucky once the meaning of this sank in you mean said vimes all this is just just show hes just doing it to impress snot his fault said colon materialising behind them its terry pratchett like dogs innit doesnt really dawn on the poor little bugger that hes up against a big one hes just ready for a scrap both dragons appeared to realise that the fight was the wellknown klatchian standoff with another smoke ring and a billow of white flame they parted and retreated a few hundred yards the king hovered flapping its wings quickly height that was the thing when dragon fought dragon height was always the thing errol balanced on his flame he seemed to be thinking then he nonchalantly kicked his back legs out as though hovering on your own stomach gases was something dragons had mastered over millions of years somersaulted and fled for a moment he was visible as a silver streak and then he was out over the city walls and gone a groan followed him it came from ten thousand throats vimes threw up his hands dont you worry guv said nobby quickly hes hes probably gone to to have a drink or something maybe its the end of round one or something i mean he ate our kettle and everything said colon uncertainly he wouldnt just run away after eating a kettle stands to reason anyone who could eat a kettle wouldnt run away from anything and my armour polish said carrot it was nearly a whole dollar for the tin there you are then said colon its like i said look said vimes as patiently as he could manage hes a nice dragon i liked him as much as you a very nice little chap but hes just done the sensible thing for gods sake hes not going to get burned to bits just to save us life just doesnt work like that you might as well face it overhead the great dragon strutted through the air and flamed a nearby tower it had won ive never seen that before said lady ramkin dragons normally fight to the death at last theyve bred one whos sensible said vimes morosely lets be honest the chances of a dragon the size of errol beating something that big are a milliontoone there was one of those silences you get after one clear bright note has been struck and the world pauses guards guards the rank looked at one another milliontoone asked carrot nonchalantly definitely said vimes milliontoone the rank looked at one another again milliontoone said colon milliontoone agreed nobby thats right said carrot milliontoone there was another hightoned silence the members of the rank were wondering who was going to be the first to say it sergeant colon took a deep breath but it might just work he said what are you talking about snapped vimes theres no nobby nudged him urgently in the ribs and pointed out across the plains there was a column of black smoke out there vimes squinted running ahead of the smoke speeding over the cabbage fields and closing fast was a silvery bullet the great dragon had seen it too it flamed defiance and climbed for extra height mashing the air with its enormous wings now errols flame wasvisible so hot as to be almost blue the landscape rolled away underneath him at an impossible speed and he was accelerating ahead of him the king extended its claws it was almost grinning errols going to hit it vimes thought gods help us all itll be a fireball something odd was happening out in the fields a little way behind errol the ground appeared to be ploughing itself up throwing cabbage stalks into the air a hedgerow erupted in a shower of sawdust errol passed silently over the city walls nose up wings folded down to tiny flaps his body honed to a mere cone with a flame at one end his opponent blew out a tongue of fire vimes watched errol with a barely noticeable flip of a wing stub roll easily out of its path and then he was gone speeding out towards the sea in the same eerie silence he miss nobby began the air ruptured an endless thunderclap of noise dragged across the city smashing tiles toppling chimneys in midair the king was picked up flattened out and spun like a top in the sonic terry pratchett wash vimes his hands over his own ears saw the creature flame desperately as it turned and became the centre of a spiral of crazy fire magic crackled along its wings it screamed like a distressed foghorn then shaking its head dazedly it began to glide in a wide circle vimes groaned it had survived something that tore masonry apart what did you have to do to beat it you cant fight it he thought you cant burn it you cant smash it theres nothing you can do to it the dragon landed it wasnt a perfect landing a perfect landing wouldnt have demolished a row of cottages it was slow and it seemed to go on for a longtime and rip up a considerable stretch of city wings flapping aimlessly neck waving and spraying random flame it ploughed on through a debris of beams and thatch several fires started up along the trail of destruction finally it came to rest at the end of the furrow almost invisible under a heap of former architecture the silence that it left was broken only by the shouts of someone trying to organise yet another bucket chain from the river to douse the fires then people started to move from the air ankhmorpork must have looked like a disturbed anthill with streams of dark figures flowing towards the wreck of the dragon most of them had some kind of weapon many of them had spears some of them had swords all of them had one aim in mind you know what said vimes aloud this is going to be the worlds first democratically killed dragon one man one stab then youve got to stop them you cant let them kill it said lady ramkin vimes blinked at her pardon he said its wounded lady that was the intention wasnt it anyway its only stunned said vimes i mean you cant let them kill it like this said lady ramkin insistently poor thing guards guards what do you want to do then demanded vimes his temper unravelling give it a strengthening dose of tar oil and a nice comfy basket in front of the stove its butchery suits me fine but its a dragon its just doing what a dragon does it never would have come here if people had left it alone vimes thought it was about to eat her and she can still think like this he hesitated perhaps that did give you the right to an opinion sergeant colon sidled up as they glared whitefaced at one another and hopped desperately from one squelching foot to the other you better come at once captain he said its going to be bloody murder vimes waved a hand at him as far as im concerned he mumbled avoiding sybil ramkins glare its got it coming to it its not that said colon its carrot hes arrested the dragon vimes paused what do you mean arrested he said you dont mean what i think you mean do you could be sir said colon uncertainly could be he was up on the rubble like a shot sir grabbed it by a wing and said youre nicked chummy sir couldnt believe it sir sir the thing is well the sergeant hopped from one foot to the other you know you said prisoners werent to be molested sir it was quite a large and heavy roof timber and it scythed quite slowly through the air but when it hit people they rolled backwards and stayed hit now look said carrot hauling it in and pushing back his helmet i dont want to have to tell anyone again right vimes shouldered his way through the dense crowd staring at the bulky figure atop the mound of rubble and dragon carrot turned slowly the roof beam held like a staff his gaze was like a terry pratchett lighthouse beam where it fell the crowd lowered their weapons and looked merely sullen and uncomfortable i must warn you carrot went on that interfering with an officer in the execution of his duty is a serious offence and i shall come down like a ton of bricks on the very next person who throws a stone a stone bounced off the back of his helmet there was a barrage of jeers let us at it thats right we dont want guards ordering us about quis custodiet custard yeah right vimes pulled the sergeant towards him go and organise some rope lots of rope as thick as possible i suppose we can oh tie its wings together maybe and bind up its mouth so it cant flame colon peered at him are you serious sir were really going to arrest it do it its been arrested he thought as he pushed his way forward personally i would have preferred it to drop in the sea but its been arrested and now weve got to deal with it or let it go free he felt his own feelings about the bloody thing evaporate in the face of the mob what could you do with it give it a fair trial he thought and then execute it not kill it thats what heroes do out in the wilderness you cant think like that in cities or rather you can but if youre going to then you might as well burn the whole place down right now and start again you ought to do it well by the book thats it we tried everything else now we might as well try and do it by the book anyway he added mentally thats a city guard up there weve got to stick together nobody else will have anything to do with us a burly figure in front of him drew back an arm with a halfbrick in it throw that brick and youre a dead man said vimes and then ducked and pushed his way through the press of people while the wouldbe thrower looked around in amazement guards guards carrot halfraised his club in a threatening gesture as vimes climbed up the rubble pile oh hallo captain vimes he said lowering it i have to report i have arrested this yes i can see said vimes did you have any suggestions about what we do next oh yes sir i have to read it its rights sir said carrot i mean apart from that not really sir vimes looked at those parts of the dragon still visible under the rubble how could you kill one of these youd have to spend a day at it a lump of rock ricocheted off his breastplate who did that the voice lashed out like a whip the crowd went quiet sybil ramkin scrambled up on the wreckage eyes afire and glared furiously at the mob i said she said who did that if the person who did it does not own up i shall be extremely angry shame on you all she had their full attention several people holding stones and things let them drop quietly to the ground the breeze flapped the remnants of her nightshirt as her ladyship took up a new haranguing position here is the gallant captain vimes oh gods said vimes in a small voice and pulled his helmet down over his eyes and his dauntless men who have taken the trouble to come here today to save your vimes gripped carrots arm and manoeuvred him down the far side of the heap you all right captain said the lanceconstable youve gone all red dont you start snapped vimes its bad enough getting all those leers from nobby and the sergeant to his astonishment carrot patted him companionably on the shoulder i know how it is he said sympathetically i had this girl back home her name was minty and her father look for the last time there is absolutely nothing between vimes began terry pratchett there was a rattle beside them a small avalanche of plaster and thatch rolled down the rubble heaved and opened one eye one big black pupil floating in a bloodshot glow tried to focus on them we must be mad said vimes oh no sir said carrot theres plenty of precedents in a hen was arrested for crowing on soul cake thursday and during the regime of psychoneurotic lord snapcase a colony of bats was executed for persistent curfew violations that was in august i think great days for the law they were said carrot dreamily in you know a small cloud was prosecuted for covering the sun during the climax of frenzied earl hargaths investiture ceremony i hope colon gets a move on with vimes stopped he had to know how he said what can you do to a cloud the earl sentenced it to be stoned to death said carrot apparently thirtyone people were killed he pulled out his notebook and glared at the dragon can it hear us do you think he said i suppose so well then carrot cleared his throat and turned back to the stunned reptile it is my duty to warn you that you are to be reported for consideration of prosecution on some or all of the following counts to whit one i that on or about th grune last in a place known as sweetheart lane the shades you did unlawfully vent flame in a manner likely to cause grievous bodily harm in contravention of clause seven of the industrial processes act and that one ii that on or about th grune last in a place known as sweetheart lane the shades you caused or did cause to cause the death of six persons unknown vimes wondered how long the rubble would hold the creature down several weeks would be necessary if the length of the charge sheet was anything to go by the crowd went silent even sybil ramkin was standing in astonishment whats the matter said vimes to the upturned faces havent you ever seen a dragon being arrested before sixteen ii on the night of grune th last you did flame or cause to flame those premises known as the old watch guards guards house ankhmorpork valued at two hundred dollars and that sixteen iii on the night of grune th last upon being apprehended by an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty i think we should hurry up whispered vimes its getting rather restive is all this necessary well i believe one can summarise said carrot in exceptional circumstances according to breggs rules for it may come as a surprise but these are exceptional circumstances carrot said vimes and theyre going to be really astonishingly exceptional if colon doesnt hurry up with that rope more rubble moved as the dragon strained to get up there was a thump as a heavy beam was shouldered aside the crowd began to run for it it was at this point that errol came back over the rooftops in a series of minor explosions leaving a trail of smoke rings dipping low he buzzed the crowd and sent the front rank stumbling backwards he was also wailing like a foghorn vimes grabbed carrot and stumbled down the heap as the king started to scrabble desperately to get free hes come back for the kill he shouted it probably took him all this time just to slow down now errol was hovering over the fallen dragon and hooting shrilly enough to bust bottles the great dragon stuck its head up in a cascade of plaster dust it opened its mouth but instead of the lance of white fire that vimes tensed himself to expect it merely made a noise like a kitten admittedly a kitten shouting into a tin bath at the bottom of a cave but still a kitten broken spars fell aside when the huge creature got unsteadily to its feet the great wings opened showering the surrounding streets with dust and bits of thatch some of it clanged off the helmet of sergeant colon hurrying back with what looked like a small washing line coiled over his arm youre letting it get up vimes shouted pushing the sergeant to safety youre not supposed to let it get up errol dont let it get up lady ramkin frowned thats not right she said they terry pratchett never usually fight like that the winner usually kills the loser right on shouted nobby and then half the time he explodes with the excitement in any case look its me vimes yelled as errol hovered unconcernedly over the scene i bought you the fluffy ball the one with the bell in it you cant do this to us no wait a minute said lady ramkin laying a hand on his arm im not sure we havent got hold of the wrong end of the stick here the great dragon leapt into the air and brought its wings down with a whump that flattened a few more buildings the huge head swung around the bleary eyes caught sight of vimes there seemed to be some thought going on inside them errol arced across the sky and hovered protectively in front of the captain facing the thing down for a moment it looked as though he might be turned into a small flying charcoal biscuit and then the dragon lowered its gaze in a slightly embarrassed way and started to rise it climbed in a wide spiral gathering speed as it did so errol went with it orbiting the huge body like a tug around a liner its its as though hes fussing over it said vimes add up the bastard shouted nobby enthusiastically total nobby said colon you mean total vimes felt lady ramkins gaze on the back of his neck he looked at her expression realisation dawned oh he said lady ramkin nodded really said vimes yes she said i really ought to have thought of it before it was such a hot flame of course and theyre always so much more territorial than the males why dont you fight the bastard shouted nobby at the dwindling dragons bitch nobby said vimes quietly not bastard bitch why dont you fi what its a member of the female gender explained lady ramkin what we meant that if you tried your favourite kick nobby it wouldnt work said vimes guards guards its a girl translated lady ramkin but its sodding enormous said nobby vimes coughed urgently nobbys rodent eyes slid sideways to sybil ramkin who blushed like a sunset a fine figure of a dragon i mean he said quickly er wide eggbearing hips said sergeant colon anxiously statueskew nobby added fervently shut up said vimes he brushed the dust off the remains of his uniform adjusted the hang of his breastplate and set his helmet on squarely he patted it firmly this wasnt where it ended he knew that this was where it all got started you men come with me come on hurry while everyones still watching them he added but what about the king said carrot or queen or whatever it is now vimes stared at the rapidly shrinking shapes i really dont know he said thats up to errol i suppose weve got other things to do colon saluted still fighting for breath where we going sir he managed to the palace any of you still got a sword you can use mine captain said carrot he handed it over right said vimes quietly he glared at them lets go the rank trailed behind vimes through the stricken streets he started to walk faster the rank started to trot to keep up vimes began to trot to keep ahead the rank broke into a canter then as if on an unspoken word of command they broke into a run then into a gallop people scurried away as they rattled past carrots enormous sandals hammered on the cobbles sparks flew up from the scads of nobbys boots colon ran quietly for such a fat man as fat men often do face locked in a scowl of concentration they pounded along the street of cunning artificers turned into hogsback alley emerged into the street of small gods and thundered towards the palace vimes kept barely in the lead terry pratchett mind currently empty of everything except the need to run and run at least nearly everything but his head buzzed and resonated manically with those of all city guards everywhere all the pavementpounding meatheads in the multiverse who had ever just occasionally tried to do what was right far ahead of them a handful of palace guards drew their swords took a second look thought better of it darted back inside the wall and started to close the gates they clanged together as vimes arrived he hesitated panting for breath and looked at the massive things the ones that the dragon had burned had been replaced by gates even more forbidding from behind them came the sound of bolts sliding back this was no time for half measures he was a captain godsdammit an officer things like this didnt present a problem for an officer officers had a tried and tested way of solving problems like this it was called a sergeant sergeant colon he snapped his mind still buzzing with universal policemanhood shoot the lock off the sergeant hesitated what sir with a bow and arrow sir i mean vimes hesitated i mean open these gates sir colon saluted he glared at the gates for a moment right he barked lanceconstable carrot one stepa forwarda takel lanceconstable carrot inna youra owna timer open these gatesa yes sir carrot stepped forward saluted folded an enormous hand into a fist and rapped gently on the woodwork open up he said in the name of the law there was some whispering on the other side of the gates and eventually a small hatch halfway up the door slid open a fraction and a voice said why because if you dont it will be impeding an officer of the watch in the execution of his duty which is punishable by a fine of not less than thirty dollars one months imprisonment or being remanded in custody for social inquiry reports and half an hour with a redhot poker said carrot there was some more muffled whispering the sound of bolts being drawn and then the gates opened about halfway i guards guards there was noone visible on the other side vimes put a finger to his lips he motioned carrot towards one gate and dragged nobby and colon to the other push he whispered they pushed hard there was a sudden eruption of pained cursing from behind the woodwork run shouted colon no shouted vimes he walked around the gate four semicrushed palace guards glowered at him no he said no more running i want these men arrested you wouldnt dare said one of the men vimes peered at him clarence isnt it he said with a c well clarence with a c watch my lips either you can be charged with aiding and abetting or he leaned closer and glanced meaningfully at carrot with an axe swivel on that one doggybag added nobby jumping from one foot to the other in vicious excitement clarences little piggy eyes glared at the looming bulk that was carrot and then at vimess face there was absolutely no mercy there he appeared to reach a reluctant decision jolly good said vimes lock them in the gatehouse sergeant colon drew his bow and squared his shoulders you heard the man he rasped one false move and youreyoure he took a desperate stab at it youre home economics yeah slam em up in the banger shouted nobby if worms could turn nobby was revolving at generating speeds doucheballs he sneered at their retreating backs aiding and abetting what captain said carrot as the weaponless guards trooped away you have to aid and abet something i think in this case it will just be generalised abetting said vimes persistent and reckless abetment yeah said nobby cant stand abettors slimebreaths colon handed captain vimes the guardhouse key its not very secure in there captain he said theyll be able to break out eventually i hope so said vimes because the very first drain we come to youre going to drop the key down it everyone here right follow me terry pratchett lupine wonse scurried along the ruined corridors of the palace the summoning of dragons under one arm the glittering royal sword grasped uncertainly in one hand he halted panting in a doorway not a lot of his mind was currently in a state sane enough to have proper thoughts but the small part that was still in business kept insisting that it couldnt have seen what it had seen or heard what it had heard someone was following him and hed seen vetinari walking through the palace he knew the man was securely put away the lock was completely unpickable he remembered the patrician being absolutely insistent that it be an unpickable lock when it was installed there was movement in the shadows at the end of the passage wonse gibbered a bit fumbled with the doorhandle beside him darted in slammed the door and leaned against it fighting for breath he opened his eyes he was in the old private audience room the patrician was sitting in his old seat one leg crossed on the other watching him with mild interest ah wonse he said wonse jumped scrabbled at the doorhandle leapt into the corridor and ran for it until he reached the main staircase rising now through the ruins of the central palace like a forlorn corkscrew stairs height high ground defence he ran up them three at a time all he needed was a few minutes of peace then hed show them the upper floors were more full of shadows what they were short on was structural strength pillars and walls had been torn out by the dragon as it built its cave rooms gaped pathetically on the edge of the abyss dangling shreds of wallhanging and carpet flapped in the wind from the smashed windows the floor sprang and wobbled like a trampoline as wonse scurried across it he struggled to the nearest door that was commendably fast said the patrician wonse slammed the door in his face and ran squeaking down a corridor sanity took a brief hold he paused by a statue there was no sound no hurrying footsteps no whirr of hidden doors he gave guards guards the statue a suspicious look and prodded it with the sword when it failed to move he opened the nearest door and slammed it behind him found a chair and wedged it under the handle this was one of the upper state rooms bare now of most of its furnishings and lacking its fourth wall where it should have been was just the gulf of the cavern the patrician stepped out of the shadows now you have got it out of your system he said wonse spun around sword raised you dont really exist he said youre a a ghost or something i believe this is not the case said the patrician you cant stop me ive got some magic stuff left ive got the book wonse took a brown leather bag out of his pocket ill bring back another one youll see i urge you not to said lord vetinari mildly oh you think youre so clever so incontrol so swave just because ive got a sword and you havent well ive got more than that ill have you know said wonse triumphantly yes ive got the palace guards on my side they follow me not you noone likes you you know noone ever liked you he swung the sword so that its needle point was a foot from the patricians thin chest so its back to the cells for you he said and this time ill make sure you stay there guards guards there was the clatter of running feet outside the door rattled the chair shook there was a moments silence and then door and chair erupted in splinters take him away screamed wonse fetch more scorpions put him inyoure not the put the sword down said vimes while behind him carrot picked bits of door out of his fist yeah said nobby peering around the captain up against the wall and spread em motherbreath eh whats he supposed to spread whispered sergeant colon anxiously nobby shrugged dunno he said everything i reckon safest way wonse stared at the rank in disbelief ah vimes said the patrician you will terry pratchett shut up said vimes calmly lanceconstable carrot sir read the prisoner his rights yes sir carrot produced his notebook licked his thumb flicked through the pages lupine wonse he said aka lupin squiggle secy pp wha said wonse currently domiciled in the domicile known as the palace ankhmorpork it is my duty to inform you that you have been arrested and will be charged with carrot gave vimes an agonised look a number of offences of murder by means of a blunt instrument to whit a dragon and many further offences of generalised abetting to be more specifically ascertained later you have the right to remain silent you have the right not to be summarily thrown into a piranha tank you have the right to trial by ordeal you have the this is madness said the patrician calmly i thought i told you to shut up snapped vimes spinning around and shaking a finger under the patricians nose tell me sarge whispered nobby do you think were going to like it in the scorpion pit say anything er but anything you do say will be written down er here in my notebook and er may be used in evidence carrots voice trailed into silence well if this pantomime gives you any pleasure vimes said the patrician eventually take him down to the cells ill deal with him in the morning wonse made no signal there was no scream or cry he just rushed at the patrician sword raised options flickered across vimess mind in the lead came the suggestion that standing back would be a good plan let wonse do it disarm him afterwards let the city clean itself up yes a good plan and it was therefore a total mystery to him why he chose to dart forward bringing carrots sword up in a halfbaked attempt at blocking the stroke perhaps it was something to do with doing it by the book there was a clang not a particularly loud one he felt something bright and silver whirr past his ear and strike the wall guards guards wonses mouth fell open he dropped the remnant of his sword and backed away clutching the summoning youll be sorry he hissed youll all be very sorry he started to mumble under his breath vimes felt himself trembling he was pretty certain he knew what had zinged past his head and the mere thought was making his hands sweat hed come to the palace ready to kill and thered been this minute just this minute when for once the world had seemed to be operating properly and he was in charge of it and now now all he wanted was a drink and a nice weeks sleep oh give up he said are you going to come quietly the mumbling went on the air began to feel hot and dry vimes shrugged thats it then he said and turned away throw the book at him carrot right sir vimes remembered too late dwarfs have trouble with metaphors they also have a very good aim the laws and ordinances of ankh and morpork caught the secretary on the forehead he blinked staggered and stepped backwards it was the longest step he ever took for one thing it lasted the rest of his life after several seconds they heard him hit five storeys below after several more seconds their faces appeared over the edge of the ravaged floor what a way to go said sergeant colon thats a fact said nobby reaching up to his ear for a dogend killed by a wossname a metaphor dunno said nobby looks like the ground to me got a light sarge that was right wasnt it sir said carrot anxiously you said to yes yes said vimes dont worry he reached down with a shaking hand picked up the bag wonse had been holding and tipped out a pile of stones every one had a hole in it why he thought a metallic noise behind him made him look around the patrician was holding the remains of the royal sword as the captain watched the man wrenched the other half of the sword terry pratchett out of the far wall it was a clean break captain vimes he said sir that sword if you please vimes handed it over he couldnt right now think of anything else to do he was probably due for a scorpion pit of his very own as it was lord vetinari examined the rusty blade carefully how long have you had this captain he said mildly isnt mine sir belongs to lanceconstable carrot sir lance me sir your graciousness said carrot saluting ah the patrician turned the blade over and over slowly staring at it as if fascinated vimes felt the air thicken as though history was clustering around this point but for the life of him he couldnt think why this was one of those points where the trousers of time bifurcated themselves and if you werent careful youd go down the wrong leg wonse arose in a world of shades icy confusion pouring into his mind but all he could think of at the moment was the tall cowled figure standing over him i thought you were all dead he mumbled it was strangely quiet and the colours around him seemed washedout muted something was very wrong is that you brother doorkeeper he ventured the figure reached out metaphorically it said and the patrician handed the sword to carrot very well done young man he said captain vimes i suggest you give your men the rest of the day off thank you sir said vimes okay lads you heard his lordship but not you captain we must have a little talk guards guards yes sir said vimes innocently the rank scurried out giving vimes sympathetic and sorrowful glances the patrician walked to the edge of the floor and looked down poor wonse he said yes sir vimes stared at the wall i would have preferred him alive you know sir misguided yes but a useful man his head could have been of further use to me yes sir the rest of course we could have thrown away yes sir that was a joke vimes yes sir the chap never grasped the idea of secret passages mind you no sir that young fellow carrot you called him yes sir keen fellow likes it in the watch yes sir right at home sir you saved my life sir come with me he stalked away through the ruined palace vimes trailing behind until he reached the oblong office it was quite tidy it had escaped most of the devastation with nothing more than a layer of dust the patrician sat down and suddenly it was as if hed never left vimes wondered if he ever had he picked up a sheaf of papers and brushed the plaster off them sad he said lupine was such a tidyminded man yes sir the patrician steepled his hands and looked at vimes over the top of them let me give you some advice captain he said yes sir it may help you make some sense of the world sir i believe you find life such a problem because you think there are the good people and the bad people said the man youre terry pratchett wrong of course there are always and only the bad people but some of them are on opposite sides he waved his thin hand towards the city and walked over to the window a great rolling sea of evil he said almost proprietorially shallower in some places of course but deeper oh so much deeper in others but people like you put together little rafts of rules and vaguely good intentions and say this is the opposite this will triumph in the end amazing he slapped vimes goodnaturedly on the back down there he said are people who will follow any dragon worship any god ignore any iniquity all out of a kind of humdrum everyday badness not the really high creative loathesomeness of the great sinners but a sort of massproduced darkness of the soul sin you might say without a trace of originality they accept evil not because they say yes but because they dont say no im sorry if this offends you he added patting the captains shoulder but you fellows really need us yes sir said vimes quietly oh yes were the only ones who know how to make things work you see the only thing the good people are good at is overthrowing the bad people and youre good at that ill grant you but the trouble is that its the only thing youre good at one day its the ringing of the bells and the casting down of the evil tyrant and the next its everyone sitting around complaining that ever since the tyrant was overthrown noones been taking out the trash because the bad people know how to plan its part of the specification you might say every evil tyrant has a plan to rule the world the good people dont seem to have the knack maybe but youre wrong about the rest said vimes its just because people are afraid and alone he paused it sounded pretty hollow even to him he shrugged theyre just people he said theyre just doing what people do sir lord vetinari gave him a friendly smile of course of course he said you have to believe that i appreciate otherwise youd go quite mad otherwise youd think youre standing on a featherthin bridge over the vaults of hell otherwise existence would be a dark agony and the only hope would be that there is no life after death i quite understand g u a r d s g u a r d s he looked at his desk and sighed and now he said there is such a lot to do im afraid poor wonse was a good servant but an inefficient master so you may go have a good nights sleep oh and do bring your men in tomorrow the city must show its gratitude it must what said vimes the patrician looked at a scroll already his voice was back to the distant tones of one who organises and plans and controls its gratitude he said after every triumphant victory there must be heroes it is essential then everyone will know that everything has been done properly he glanced at vimes over the top of the scroll its all part of the natural order of things he said after a while he made a few pencil annotations to the paper in front of him and looked up i said he said that you may go vimes paused at the door do you believe all that sir he said about the endless evil and the sheer blackness indeed indeed said the patrician turning over the page it is the only logical conclusion but you get out of bed every morning sir hmm yes what is your point id just like to know why sir oh do go away vimes theres a good fellow in the dark and draughty cave hacked from the heart of the palace the librarian knuckled across the floor he clambered over the remains of the sad hoard and looked down at the splayed body of wonse then he reached down very gently and prised the summoning of dragons from the stiffening fingers he blew the dust off it he brushed it tenderly as if it was a frightened child he turned to climb down the heap and stopped he bent down again and carefully pulled another book from among the glittering rubble it wasnt one of his except in the wide sense that all books came under his domain he turned a few pages carefully terry pratchett keep it said vimes behind him take it away put it somewhere the orangutan nodded at the captain and rattled down the heap he tapped vimes gently on the kneecap opened the summoning of dragons leafed through its ravaged pages until he found the one hed been looking for and silently passed the book up vimes squinted at the crabbed writing yet draggons are notte liken unicornes i willen they dwellyth in some realm defined bye thee fancie of the wille and thus it myte bee thate whomsoever calleth upon them and giveth them theyre patheway unto thys worlde calleth theyre owne dragon of the mind yette i trow the pure in harte maye stille call a draggon of power as a forse for goode in thee worlde and this ane nighte the grate worke will commense all hathe been prepared i hath laboured most mytily to be a worthie vessle a realm of fancy vimes thought thats where they went then into our imaginations and when we call them back we shape them like squeezing dough into pastry shapes only you dont get gingerbread men you get what you are your own darkness given shape vimes read it through again and then looked at the following pages there werent many the rest of the book was a charred mass vimes handed it back to the ape what kind of a man was de malachite he said the librarian gave this the consideration due from someone who knew the dictionary of city biography by heart then he shrugged particularly holy said vimes the ape shook his head well noticeably evil then the ape shrugged and shook his head again if i were you said vimes id put that book somewhere very safe and the book of the law with it theyre too bloody dangerous oook vimes stretched and now he said lets go and have a drink oook guards guards but just a small one oook and youre paying eeek vimes stopped and stared down at the big mild face tell me he said ive always wanted to know is it better being an ape the librarian thought about it oook he said oh really said vimes it was next day the room was walltowall with civic dignitaries the patrician sat on his severe chair surrounded by the council everyone present was wearing the shiny waxen grins of those bent on good works lady sybil ramkin sat off to one side wearing a few acres of black velvet the ramkin family jewels glittered on her fingers neck and in the black curls of todays wig the total effect was striking like a globe of the heavens vimes marched the rank to the centre of the hall and stamped to a halt with his helmet under his arm as per regulations hed been amazed to see that even nobby had made an effort the suspicion of shiny metal could be seen here and there on his breastplate and colon was wearing an expression of almost constipated importance carrots armour gleamed colon ripped off a textbook salute for the first time in his life all present and correct sah he barked very good sergeant said vimes coldly he turned to the patrician and raised an eyebrow politely lord vetinari gave a little wave of his hand stand easy or whatever it is you chaps do he said im sure we neednt wait on ceremony here what do you say captain just as you like sir said vimes now men said the patrician leaning forward we have heard some remarkable accounts of your magnificent efforts in defence of the city vimes let his mind wander as the golden platitudes floated past for a while he derived a certain amount of amusement from terry pratchett watching the faces of the council a whole sequence of expressions drifted across them as the patrician spoke it was of course vitally important that there be a ceremony like this then the whole thing could be neat and settled and forgotten just another chapter in the long and exciting history of eckcetra eckcetra ankhmorpork was good at starting new chapters his trawling gaze fell on lady ramkin she winked vimess eyes swivelled front again his expression suddenly as wooden as a plank token of our gratitude the patrician finished sitting back vimes realised that everyone was looking at him pardon he said i said we have been trying to think of some suitable recompense captain vimes various publicspirited citizens the patricians eyes took in the council and lady ramkin and of course myself feel that an appropriate reward is due vimes still looked blank reward he said it is customary for such heroic endeavour said the patrician a little testily vimes faced forward again really havent thought about it sir he said cant speak for the men of course there was an awkward pause out of the corner of his eye vimes was aware of nobby nudging the sergeant in the ribs eventually colon stumbled forward and ripped off another salute permission to speak sir he muttered the patrician nodded graciously the sergeant coughed he removed his helmet and pulled out a scrap of paper er he said the thing is saving your honours presence we think you know what with saving the city and everything or sort of or what i mean is we just had a go you see man on the spot and that sort of thingthe thing is we reckon were entitled if you catch my drift the assembled company nodded this was exactly how it should be do go on said the patrician so we like put our heads together said the sergeant a bit of a cheek i know guards guards please carry on sergeant said the patrician you neednt keep stopping we are well aware of the magnitude of the matter right sir well sir first its the wages the wages said lord vetinari he stared at vimes who stared at nothing the sergeant raised his head his expression was the determined expression of a man who is going to see it through yes sir he said thirty dollars a month its not right we think he licked his lips and glanced behind him at the other two who were making vague encouraging motions we think a basic rate of er thirtyfive dollars a month he stared at the patricians stony expression with increments as per rank we thought five dollars he licked his lips again unnerved by the patricians expression we wont go below four he said and thats flat sorry your highness but there it is the patrician glanced again at vimess impassive face then looked back at the rank thats it he said nobby whispered in colons ear and then darted back the sweating sergeant gripped his helmet as though it was the only real thing in the world there was another thing your reverence he said ah the patrician smiled knowingly theres the kettle it wasnt much good anyway and then errol et it it was nearly two dollars he swallowed we could do with a new kettle if its all the same your lordship the patrician leaned forward gripping the arms of his chair i want to be clear about this he said coldly are we to believe that you are asking for a petty wage increase and a domestic utensil carrot whispered in colons other ear colon turned two bulging wateryrimmed eyes to the dignitaries the rim of his helmet was passing through his fingers like a millwheel well he began sometimes we thought you know when we has our dinner break or when its quite like at the end of a watch as it may be and we want to relax a bit you know wind down his voice trailed away terry pratchett yes colon took a deep breath i suppose a dartboard would be out of the question the thunderous silence that followed was broken by an erratic snorting vimess helmet dropped out of his shaking hand his breastplate wobbled as the suppressed laughter of the years burst out in great uncontrollable eruptions he turned his face to the row of councillors and laughed and laughed until the tears came laughed at the way they got up all confusion and outraged dignity laughed at the patricians carefully immobile expression laughed for the world and the saving of souls laughed and laughed and laughed until the tears came nobby craned up to reach colons ear i told you he hissed i said theyd never wear it i knew a dartboardd be pushing our luck youve upset em all now dear mother and father you will never guess i have been in the watch only a few weeks and already i am to be a full constable captain vimes said the patrician himself said i was to be one and that also he hoped i should have a long and successful career in the watch as well and he would follow it with special interest also my wages are to go up by ten dollars and we had a special bonus of twenty dollars that captain vimes paid for out of his own pocket sgt colon said please find money enclosed i am keeping a little bit by though because i went to see reet and mrs palm said all the girls had been following my career with great interest as well and i am to come to dinner on my night off sgt colon has been telling me about how to start courting which is very interesting and not at all complicated it appears i arrested a dragon but it got away i hope mr varneshi is well i am as happy as anyone can be in the whole world your son carrot vimes knocked on the door an effort had been made to spruce up the ramkin mansion he noticed the encroaching shrubbery had been pitilessly hacked guards guards back an elderly workman atop a ladder was nailing the stucco back on the walls while another with a spade was rather arbitrarily defining the line where the lawn ended and the old flower beds had begun vimes stuck his helmet under his arm smoothed back his hair and knocked hed considered asking sergeant colon to accompany him but had brushed the idea aside quickly he couldnt have tolerated the sniggering anyway what was there to be afraid of hed stared into the jaws of death three times four if you included telling lord vetinari to shut up to his amazement the door was eventually opened by a butler so elderly that he might have been resurrected by the knocking yerss he said captain vimes city watch said vimes the man looked him up and down oh yes he said her ladyship did say i believe her ladyship is with her dragons he said if you like to wait in ere i will i know the way said vimes and set off around the overgrown path the kennels were a ruin an assortment of battered wooden boxes were lying around under an oilcloth awning from their depths a few sad swamp dragons whiffled a greeting at him a couple of women were moving purposefully among the boxes ladies rather they were far too untidy to be mere women no ordinary women would have dreamed of looking so scruffy you needed the complete selfconfidence that comes with knowing who your greatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather was before you could wear clothes like that but they were vimes noticed incredibly good clothes or had been once clothes bought by ones parents but so expensive and of such good quality that they never wore out and were handed down like old china and silverware and gout dragon breeders he thought you can tell theres something about them its the way they wear their silk scarves old tweed coats and granddads riding boots and the smell of course a small wiry woman with a face like old saddle leather caught sight of him ah she said youll be the gallant captain she tucked an errant strand of white hair back under a headscarf and extended a veiny brown hand brenda rodley thats rosie devantmolei terry pratchett she runs the sunshine sanctuary you know the other woman who had the build of someone who could pick up carthorses in one hand and shoe them with the other gave him a friendly grin samuel vimes said vimes weakly my father was a sam said brenda vaguely you can always trust a sam he said she shooed a dragon back into its box were just helping sybil old friends you know the collections all to blazes of course theyre all over the city the little devils i dare say theyll come back when theyre hungry though what a bloodline eh im sorry sybil reckons he was a sport but i say we should be able to breed back into the line in three or four generations im famed for my stud you know she said thatd be something though a whole new type of dragon vimes thought of supersonic contrails crisscrossing the sky er he said yes well we must get on er isnt lady ramkin around said vimes i got this message that it was essential she said for me to come here shes indoors somewhere said miss rodley said she had something important to see to oh do be careful with that one rose you silly gel more important than dragons said vimes yes cant think whats come over her brenda rodley fished in the pocket of an oversized waistcoat nice to have met you captain always good to meet new members of the fancy do drop in any time youre passing id be only too happy to show you around she extracted a grubby card and pressed it into his hand must be off now weve heard that some of them are trying to build nests on the university tower cant have that must get em down before it gets dark vimes squinted at the card as the women crunched off down the drive carrying nets and ropes it said brenda lady rodley the dower house quirm castle quirm what it meant he realised was that striding away down the path like an animated rummage stall was the dowager duchess of quirm who owned more country than you could see from a very high mountain on a very clear day nobby would not have approved there seemed to be a special kind of poverty guards guards that only the very very rich could possibly afford that was how you got to be a power in the land he thought you never cared a toss about whatever anyone else thought and you were never ever uncertain about anything he padded back to the house a door was open it led into a large but dark and musty hall up in the gloom the heads of dead animals haunted the walls the ramkins seemed to have endangered more species than an ice age vimes wandered aimlessly through another mahogany archway it was a dining room containing the kind of table where the people at the other end are in a different time zone one end had been colonised by silver candlesticks it was laid for two a battery of cutlery flanked each plate antique wineglasses sparkled in the candlelight a terrible premonition took hold of vimes at the same moment as a gust of captivation the most expensive perfume available anywhere in ankhmorpork blew past him ah captain so nice of you to come vimes turned around slowly without his feet appearing to move lady ramkin stood there magnificently vimes was vaguely aware of a brilliant blue dress that sparkled in the candlelight a mass of hair the colour of chestnuts a slightly anxious face that suggested that a whole battalion of skilled painters and decorators had only just dismantled their scaffolding and gone home and a faint creaking that said underneath it all mere corsetry was being subjected to the kind of tensions more usually found in the heart of large stars i er he said if you er if youd said er id er dress more suitable er extremely er very er she bore down upon him like a glittering siege engine in a sort of dream he allowed himself to be ushered to a seat he must have eaten because servants appeared out of nowhere with things stuffed with other things and came back later and took the plates away the butler reanimated occasionally to fill glass after glass with strange wines the heat from the candles was enough to cook by and all the time lady ramkin talked in a bright and brittle way about the size of the house the responsibilities of a huge estate the feeling that it was time to terry pratchett i guards guards take ones position in society more seriously while the setting sun filled the room with red and vimess head began to spin society he managed to think didnt know what was going to hit it dragons werent mentioned once although after a while something under the table put its head on vimess knee and dribbled vimes found it impossible to contribute to the conversation he felt outflanked beleaguered he made one sally hoping maybe to reach high ground from which to flee into exile where do you think theyve gone he said where what said lady ramkin temporarily halted the dragons you know errol and his wi female oh somewhere isolated and rocky i should imagine said lady ramkin favourite country for dragons but it shes a magical animal said vimes whatll happen when the magic goes away lady ramkin gave him a shy smile most people seem to manage she said she reached across the table and touched his hand your men think you need looking after she said meekly oh do they said vimes sergeant colon said he thought wed get along like a maison en flambe oh did he and he said something else she said what was it now oh yes its a million to one chance said lady ramkin i think he said but it might just work she smiled at him and then it arose and struck vimes that in her own special category she was quite beautiful this was the category of all the women in his entire life who had ever thought he was worth smiling at she couldnt do worse but then he couldnt do better so maybe it balanced out she wasnt getting any younger but then who was and she had style and money and commonsense and selfassurance and all the things that he didnt and she had opened her heart and if you let her she could engulf you the woman was a city and eventually under siege you did what ankhmorpork had always done unbar the gates let the conquerors in and make them your own how did you start she seemed to be expecting something he shrugged and picked up his wine glass and sought for a phrase one crept into his wildly resonating mind heres looking at you kid he said the gongs of various midnights banged out the old day and further towards the hub where the ramtop mountains joined the forbidding spires of the central massif where strange hairy creatures roamed the eternal snows where blizzards howled around the freezing peaks the lights of a lone lamasery shone out over the high valleys in the courtyard a couple of yellowrobed monks stacked the last case of small green bottles on to a sleigh ready for the first leg of the incredibly difficult journey down to the distant plains the box was labelled in careful brushstrokes mstr cmot dibbler ankhmorpork you know lobsang said one of them one cannot help wondering what it is he does with this stuff corporal nobbs and sergeant colon lounged in the shadows near the mended drum but straightened up as carrot came out bearing a tray detritus the troll stepped aside respectfully here we are lads said carrot three pints on the house bloody hell i never thought youd do it said colon grasping a handle what did you say to him i just explained how it was the duty of all good citizens to help the guard at all times said carrot innocently and i thanked him for his cooperation yeah and the rest said nobby no that was all i said then you must have a really convincing tone of voice ah well make the most of it lads while it lasts said colon they drank thoughtfully it was a moment of supreme peace a few minutes snatched from the realities of real life it was a brief bite of stolen fruit and enjoyed as such noone in the whole city seemed to be fighting or stabbing or making affray and just for now it was possible to believe that this wonderful state of affairs might continue and even if it didnt then there were memories to get them terry pratchett through of running and people getting out of the way of the looks on the faces of the horrible palace guard of when all the thieves and heroes and gods had failed of being there of nearly doing things nearly right nobby shoved the pot on a convenient window sill stamped some life back into his feet and blew on his fingers a brief fumble in the dark recesses of his ear produced a fragment of cigarette what a time eh said colon contentedly as the flare of a match illuminated the three of them the others nodded yesterday seemed like a lifetime ago even now but you could never forget something like that no matter who else did no matter what happened from now on if i never see any bloody king itll be too soon said nobby i dont reckon he was the right king anyway said carrot talking of kings anyone want a crisp theres no right kings said colon but without much rancour ten dollars a month was going to make a big difference mrs colon was acting very differently towards a man bringing home another ten dollars a month her notes on the kitchen table were a lot more friendly no but i mean theres nothing special about having an ancient sword said carrot or a birthmark i mean look at me ive got a birthmark on my arm my brothers got one too said colon shaped like a boat mines more like a crown thing said carrot oho that makes you a king then grinned nobby stands to reason i dont see why my brothers not an admiral said colon reasonably and ive got this sword said carrot he drew it colon took it from his hand and turned it over and over in the light from the flare over the drums door the blade was dull and short and notched like a saw it was wellmade and there might have been an inscription on it once but it had long ago been worn into indecipherability by sheer use its a nice sword he said thoughtfully wellbalanced but not one for a king said carrot kings swords are big and shiny and magical and have jewels on and when you hold them up they catch the light ting ting said colon yes i suppose they have to really guards guards im just saying you cant go round giving people thrones just because of stuff like that said carrot thats what captain vimes said nice job mind said nobby good hours kinging hmm colon had momentarily been lost in a little world of speculation real kings had shiny swords obviously except except except maybe your real real king of like days of yore he would have a sword that didnt sparkle one bit but was bloody efficient at cutting things just a thought i say kingings a good job nobby repeated short hours yeah yeah but not long days said colon he gave carrot a thoughtful look ah theres that of course anyway my father says being kings too much like hard work said carrot all the surveying and assaying and everything he drained his pint its not the kind of thing for the likes of us us he looked proudly guards you all right sergeant hmm what oh yes colon shrugged what about it anyway maybe things turned out for the best he finished the beer best be off he said what time was it about twelve oclock said carrot anything else carrot gave it some thought and alls well he said right just testing you know said nobby the way you say it lad you could almost believe it was true let the eye of attention pull back this is the disc world and mirror of worlds borne through space on the back of four giant elephants who stand on the back of great atuin the sky turtle around the rim of this world the ocean pours off endlessly into the night at its hub rises the tenmile spike of the cori celesti on whose glittering summit the gods play games with the fates of men if you know what the rules are and who are the players on the far edge of the disc the sun was rising the light of the morning began to flow across the patchwork of seas and terry pratchett continents but it did so slowly because light is tardy and slightly heavy in the presence of a magical field on the dark crescent where the old light of sunset had barely drained from the deepest valleys two specks one big one small flew out of the shadow skimmed low across the swells of the rim ocean and struck out determinedly over the totally unfathomable stardotted depths of space perhaps the magic would last perhaps it wouldnt but then what does
