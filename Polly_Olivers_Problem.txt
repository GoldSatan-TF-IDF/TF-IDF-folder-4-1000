olivers problem pretty polly oliver my hope and my fear pretty polly oliver ive loved you so dear dinah maria mulock chapter i a declaration of independence i have determined only one thing definitely said polly oliver and that is the boarders must go oh how charming that sounds i ve been thinking it ever since i was old enough to think but i never cast it in such an attractive decisive form before the boarders must go to a california girl it is every bit as inspiring as the chinese must go if i were nt obliged to set the boarders table i d work the motto on a banner this very minute and march up and down the plaza with it followed by a crowd of small boys with toy drums the chinese never did go said mrs oliver suggestively from the sofa oh thats a trifle they had a treaty or something and besides there are so many of them and they have such an object in staying you cant turn people out of the house on a moments warning certainly not give them twentyfour hours if necessary we can choose among several methods of getting rid of them i can put up a placard with boarders ho printed on it in large letters and then assemble them in the banquethall and make them a speech you would insult them objected mrs oliver feebly and they are perfectly innocent insult them oh mamma how unworthy of you i shall speak to them firmly but very gently ladies and gentlemen i shall begin you have done your best to make palatable the class of human beings to which you belong but you have utterly failed and you must go board if you must ladies and gentlemen but not here sap if you must the foundations of somebody elses private paradise but not ours in the words of the poeet take thy beaks from off our door then it will be over and they will go out slink out i should say murmured pollys mother very well slink out replied polly cheerfully i should like to see them slink after they ve been rearing their crested heads round our table for generations but i think you credit them with a sensitiveness they do not and in the nature of things cannot possess there is something in the unnatural life which hardens both the boarder and those who board her however i dont insist on that method let us try bloodless eviction set them quietly out in the street with their trunks or strategy put one of them in bed and hang out the smallpox flag oh i can get rid of them in a week if i once set my mind on it there is no doubt of that said mrs oliver meekly pollys brain continued to teem with sinister ideas i shall make mr talbots bed so that the clothes will come off at the foot every night he will remonstrate i shall tell him that he kicks them off and intimate that his conscience troubles him or he would never be so restless he will glare i shall promise to do better yet the clothes will come off worse and worse and at last perfectly disheartened he will go i shall tell mr greenwood at the breakfasttable what i have been longing for months to tell him that we can hear him snore distinctly through the partition he will go i shall put cold milk in mrs caldwells coffee every morning i shall mean well you know but i shall forget she will know that i mean well and that it is only girlish absentmindedness but she will not endure it very long she will go and so by the exercise of a little ingenuity they will depart one by one remarking that mrs olivers boardinghouse is not what it used to be that pauline is growing a little slack polly and mrs oliver half rose from the sofa i will not allow you to call this a boardinghouse in that tone of voice a boardinghouse as i take it argued polly is a house where the detestable human vipers known as boarders are taken in and done for but we have always prided ourselves on having it exactly like a family said her mother plaintively you know we have not omitted a single refinement of the daintiest homelife no matter at what cost of labor and thought certainly thats the point and there you are a sofainvalid and here am i with my disposition ruined for life such a wreck in temper that i could blow up the boarders with dynamite and sleep peacefully after it now be reasonable little daughter think how kind and grateful the boarders have been at least almost always how appreciative of everything we have done for them of course it is nt every day they can secure an an elderly juno like you to carve meat for them or a well just for the sake of completing the figure of speech a blooming hebe like me i ve always wondered why it was nt shebe to dispense their tea and coffee to say nothing of broma for mr talbot cocoa for mr greenwood cambric tea for mrs hastings and hot water for the darlings i have to keep a schedule and refer to it three times a day this alone shows that boarders are nt my vocation a bit of conversation gives the clue to character so easily that mrs oliver and her daughter need little more description you can see the pretty fragile mother resting among her pillows and i need only tell you that her dress is always black her smile patient her eyes full of peace and her hands never idle save in this one daily restinghour prescribed by the determined miss polly who mounts guard during the appointed time like a jailer who expects his prisoner to escape if he removes his eagle eye for an instant the aforesaid impetuous miss polly has also told you something of herself in this brief interview she is evidently a person who feels matters rather strongly and who is wont to state them in the strongest terms she knows every word she utters shows you that young as she looks she is the real head of the family and that her vigorous independence of thought and speech must be the result of more care and responsibility than ordinarily fall to the lot of a girl of sixteen certain of her remarks must be taken with a grain of salt her assertion of willingness to blow up innocent boarders in their beds would seem for instance to indicate a vixenish and vindictive sort of temper quite unwarranted by the circumstances but a glance at the girl herself contradicts the thought item a firm chin she will take her own way if she can possibly get it but item a sweet lovable mouth framed in dimples a mouth that breaks into smiles at the slightest provocation no matter how dreary the outlook a mouth that quivers at the first tender word and so the best of all correctives to the determined little chin below item a distinctly saucy nose an aggressive impertinent spirited little nose with a few freckles on it a nose that probably leads its possessor into trouble occasionally item two bright eyes a trifle overproud and willful perhaps but candid and full of laughter item a head of brilliant auburn hair lively independent frisky hair each glittering thread standing out by itself and asserting its own individuality tempestuous hair that never stays put capricious hair that escapes hairpins and comes down unexpectedly hoydenish hair that makes the meekest hats look daring for the rest a firm round figure no angles everything including elbows in curves blooming cheeks and smoothskinned taperfingered hands tanned a very honest brown the hands of a person who loves beauty polly olivers love of beautiful things was a passion and one that had little gratification but luckily though good music pictures china furniture and purple and fine linen were all conspicuous by their absence she could feast without money and without price on the changeful loveliness of the santa ynez mountains the sapphire tints of the placid pacific and the gorgeous splendor of the californian wildflowers so that her sense of beauty never starved her hand was visible in the modest sittingroom where she now sat with her mother for it was pretty and homelike although its simple decorations and furnishings had been brought together little by little during a period of two years so that the first installments were all worn out polly was wont to remark plaintively before the last additions made their appearance the straw matting had japanese figures on it while a number of rugs covered the worn places and gave it an opulent look the tablecovers curtains and portiиres were of blue jean worked in outline embroidery and mrs olivers couch had as many pillows as that of an oriental princess for pollys summers were spent camping in a caсon and she embroidered sofacushions and draperies with frenzy during these weeks of outofdoor life upon the cottage piano was a blue canton gingerjar filled with branches of feathery bamboo that spread its lacelike foliage far and wide over the ceiling and walls quite covering the large spot where the roof had leaked various stalks of tropicallooking palms distributed artistically about concealed the gaping wounds in the walls inflicted by the benton children who had once occupied this same apartment mexican waterjars bearing peacock feathers screened mr bentons two favorite places for scratching matches the lounge was the sort of lounge that looks well only between two windows but polly was obliged to place it across the corner where she really needed the table because in that position it shielded from the public view the enormous black spots on the wall where reginald benton had flung the inkbottle at his angel sister pansy belle then there was an umbrellalamp bestowed by a boarder whom mrs oliver had nursed through typhoid fever a banjo plenty of books and magazines and an open fireplace with a great pitcher of yellow wildflowers standing between the oldfashioned brass andirons little miss olivers attitude on the question of the boarders must stand quite without justification it is a part of polly sighed her mother and must be borne with christian fortitude colonel oliver had never fully recovered from a wound received in the last battle of the civil war and when he was laid to rest in a quiet new england churchyard so much of mrs olivers heart was buried with him that it was difficult to take up the burden of life with any sort of courage at last her delicate health prompted her to take the baby daughter born after her husbands death and go to southern california where she invested her small property in a house in santa barbara she could not add to her income by any occupation that kept her away from the baby so the boarders followed as a matter of course a house being suitable neither for food nor clothing and a constantly changing family of pleasant people helped her to make both ends meet and to educate the little daughter as she grew from babyhood into childhood now as polly had grown up among the boarders most of whom petted her no one can account for her slightly ungrateful reception of their goodwill but it is certain that the first time she was old enough to be trusted at the table she grew very red in the face slipped down from her high chair and took her bowl of bread and milk on to the porch she was followed and gently reasoned with but her only explanation was that she did nt yike to eat wiv so many peoples persuasion bore no fruit and for a long time miss polly ate in solitary grandeur indeed the feeling increased rather than diminished until the child grew old enough to realize her mothers burden when with passionate and protecting love she put her strong young shoulders under the load and lifted her share never so very prettily or gracefully it is no use trying to paint a halo round pollys head but with a proud courage and a sort of desperate resolve to be as good as she could which was not very good she would have told you she would come back from the beautiful home of her friend bell winship and look about on her own surroundings never with scorn or sense of bitterness she was too sensible and sweetnatured for that but with an inward rebellion against the existing state of things and a secret determination to create a better one if god would only give her power and opportunity but this pentup feeling only showed itself to her mother in bursts of impulsive nonsense at which mrs oliver first laughed and then sighed oh for a little little breakfasttable polly would say as she flung herself on her mothers couch and punched the pillows desperately oh for a father to say steak polly dear instead of my asking steakorchop over and over every morning oh for a lovely grownup blackhaired sister who would have hundreds of lovers and let me stay in the room when they called oh for a tiny baby brother fat and dimpled who would crow and spill milk on the tablecloth and let me sit on the floor and pick up the things he threw down but instead of that a new big strange family different people every six months people who dont like each other and have to be seated at opposite ends of the table ladies whose lips tremble with disappointment if they dont get the second joint of the chicken and gentlemen who are sulky if any one else gets the liver oh mamma i am sixteen now and it will soon be time for me to begin taking care of you but i warn you i shall never do it by means of the boarders are you so weak and proud little daughter as to be ashamed because i have taken care of you these sixteen years by means of the boarders as you say no no mamma dont think so badly of me as that that feeling was outgrown long ago do i not know that it is just as fine and honorable as anything else in the world and do i not love and honor you with all my heart because you do it in so sweet and dignified a way that everybody respects you for it but it is nt my vocation i would like to do something different something wider something lovelier if i knew how and were ever good enough it is easy to dream noble things dear but hard to do them all day long my own feeling is if one reaches the results one is struggling for and does ones work as well as it lies in one to do it that keeping boarders is as good service as any other bit of the worlds work one is not always permitted to choose the beautiful or glorious task sometimes all one can do is to make the humble action fine by doing it as it is done in heaven remember they also serve who only stand and wait yes mamma said polly meekly but stretching out her young arms hopefully and longingly it must be that they also serve who stand and dare and i m going to try that first then i ll wait if god wants me to what if god wants you to wait first little daughter polly hid her face in the sofacushions and did not answer chapter ii forecasting the future two of mrs olivers sittingroom windows looked out on the figtrees and the third on a cosy piazza corner framed in passionvines where at the present moment stood a round table holding a crystal bowl of gold of ophir roses a brown leather portfolio and a dish of apricots against the table leaned an old spanish guitar with a yellow ribbon round its neck and across the corner hung a gorgeous hammock of persian colored threads with two or three pillows of canarycolored china silk in one end a bamboo loungingchair and a shaker rocker completed the picture and the passerby could generally see miss anita ferguson reclining in the one and a young but not wise man from the east in the other it was not always the same young man any more than the decorations were always of the same color thats another of my troubles said polly to her friend margery noble pulling up the windowshade one afternoon and pointing to the now empty cosy corner i dont mind miss fergusons sitting there though it used always to be screened off for my dollhouse and i love it dearly but she pays to sit there and she ought to do it besides she looks prettier there than any one else isnt it lovely the other day she had pink oleanders in the bowl the cushions turned the pink side up you see they are canary and rosecolor a pink muslin dress and the guitar trimmed with a fringe of narrow pink ribbons she was a dream margery but she does nt sit there with her young men when i am at school nor when i am helping ah foy in the diningroom nor of course when we are at table she sits there from four to six in the afternoon and in the evening the only times i have with mamma in this room we are obliged to keep the window closed lest we should overhear the conversation that is tiresome enough in warm weather you see the other windows are shaded by the figtrees so here we sit in egyptian darkness mamma and i during most of the pleasant afternoons and if anything ever came of it we would nt mind but nothing ever does there have been so many young men i could nt begin to count them but they have worn out the seats of four chairs and why does nt one of them take her away then we could have a nice plain young lady who would sit quietly on the front steps with the old people and who would nt want me to carry messages for her three times a day at the present moment however miss anita ferguson clad in a black habit with a white rose in her buttonhole and a neat black derby with a scarf of white crкpe de chine wound about it had gone on the mesa for a horseback ride so polly and margery had borrowed the cosy corner for a chat margery was crocheting a babys afghan and polly was almost obscured by a rumpled yellow dress which lay in her lap you observe my favorite yellow gown she asked yes what have you done to it gin sing picked blackberries in the colander i supposing the said colander to be a pan with the usual bottom took it in my lap and held it for an hour while i sorted the berries result a hideous stain a foot and a half in diameter to say nothing of the circumference mr greenwood suggested oxalic acid i applied it and removed both the stain and the dress in the following complete manner and polly put her brilliant head through an immense circular hole in the front breadth of the skirt it s hopeless is nt it for of course a patch wont look well said margery hopeless not a bit you see this pretty yellow and white striped lawn i have made a long narrow apron of it and ruffled it all round i pin it to my waist thus and the hole is covered but it looks like an apron and how do i contrive to throw the public off the scent i add a yoke and sash of the striped lawn and people see simply a combinationdress i do the designing and my beloved little mother there will do the sewing forgetting her precious pollys carelessness in making the hole and remembering only her cleverness in covering it capital said margery it will be prettier than ever oh dear that dress was new when we had our last lovely summer in the caсon shall we ever go again all together i wonder just think how we are all scattered the winships traveling in europe i ll read you bells last letter by and by geoffrey strong studying at leipsic jack howard at harvard with elsie and her mother watching over him in cambridge philip and i on the ranch as usual and you here we are so divided that it does nt seem possible that we can ever have a complete reunion does it no said polly looking dreamily at the hummingbirds hovering over the honeysuckle and if we should everything would be different bless dear old bells heart what a lovely summer she must be having i wonder what she will do do echoed margery yes it always seemed to me that bell winship would do something in the world that she would never go along placidly like other girls she has so many talents yes but so long as they have plenty of money dr and mrs winship would probably never encourage her in doing anything it would be all the better if she could do something because she loved it and with no thought of earning a living by it is nt it odd that i who most need the talents should have fewer than any one of our dear little group bell can write sing dance or do anything else in fact elsie can play like an angel you can draw but it seems to me i can do nothing well enough to earn money by it and that is precisely what i must do you ve never had any special instruction polly dear else you could sing as well as bell or play as well as elsie well i must soon decide mamma says next summer when i am seventeen she will try to spend a year in san francisco and let me study regularly for some profession the question is what or whether to do something without study i read in a magazine the other day that there are now three hundred or three thousand i cant remember which vocations open to women if it were even three hundred i could certainly choose one to my liking and there would be two hundred and ninetynine left over for the other girls mrs weeks is trying to raise silkworms that would be rather nice because the worms would be silent partners in the business and do most of the work but you want something without any risks you know said margery sagely you would have to buy ground for the silkworms and set out the mulberries and then a swarm of horrid insects might happen along and devour the plants before the worms began spinning competition is the life of trade said polly no that is nt what i mean nothing venture nothing have thats it then how would hens do ever so many women raise hens hens have diseases and they never lay very well when you have to sell the eggs by the way clarence jones who sings in the choir you know the man with the pink cheeks and cornsilk hair advertises in the daily press for a live partner now there s a chance on an established henranch if he does nt demand capital or experience its a better chance for miss ferguson but she does nt like mr jones because when he comes to call his coatpockets are always bulging with brown paper packages of a henfood that he has just invented the other day when he came to see her she was out and he handed me his card it had a picture and advertisement of the royal dishfaced berkshire pig on it and i m sure by her expression when she saw it that she will never be his live partner no i dont think i ll have an outofdoor occupation its so trying to the complexion now how about millinery i could be an apprentice and gradually rise until i imported everything direct from paris but polly objected margery you know you never could tie a bow or even put a ribbon on your sailor hat but i could learn do you suppose all the milliners were called to their work by a consciousness of genius perish the thought if that were true there wouldnt be so many hideous hats in the shop windows however i dont pine for millinery its always a struggle for me to wear a hat myself you ve done beautifully the last year or two dear and you ve reaped the reward of virtue for you ve scarcely a freckle left oh that isnt hats rejoined polly thats the law of compensation when i was younger and did nt take the boarders so much to heart i had freckles given to me for a cross but the moment i grew old enough to see the boarders in their true light and note their effect on mamma the freckles disappeared now here s an idea i might make a complexion lotion for a living let me see what i ve been advised by elderly ladies to use in past years ammonia lemonjuice cucumbers morning dew milk pork rinds kerosene and a few other household remedies of course i m not sure which did the work but why could nt i mix them all in equal parts if they would mix you know and let those stay out that would nt and call it the olivera complexion lotion the trademark might be a cucumber a lemon and a morning dewdrop rampant and a frightened little brown spot couchant then on the neat label pasted on the bottles above the trademark there might be a picture of a spotted girl thats miss oliver before using her lotion and a copy of my last photograph thats miss oliver radiant in beauty after using her lotion margery laughed as she generally did at pollys nonsense that sounds very attractive but if you are anxious for an elegant and dignified occupation which shall restore your mother to her ancestral position it certainly has its defects i know everything has its defects everything except one and i wont believe that has a single weak point oh polly you deceiver you have a secret leaning toward some particular thing after all yes though i have nt talked it over fully yet even with mamma lest she should think it one of my wild schemes but margery i want with all my heart to be a kindergartner like miss mary denison there would be no sting to me in earning my living if only i could do it by working among poor ragged little children as she does i run in and stay half an hour with her whenever i can and help the babies with their sewing or weaving and i always study and work better myself afterward i dont know whether its the children or miss denison or the place or all three and the other day when i was excused from my examinations i stayed the whole morning in the kindergarten when it was time for the games and they were all on the circle they began with a quiet play they call silent greeting and oh margery they chose me to come in of their own accord when i walked into the circle to greet that smallest walker baby my heart beat like a triphammer i was so afraid i should do something wrong and they would never ask me in again then we played the hen and chickens and afterward something about the birds in the greenwood and one of the makebelieve birds flew to me i was a tree you know a whispering elmtree and built its nest in my branches and then i smoothed its feathers and sang to it as the others had done and it was like heaven after the play was over we modeled clay birds and just as we were making the tables tidy professor hohlweg came in and asked miss denison to come into the large hall to play for the marching as the musicteacher was absent then what did miss denison do but turn to me and say miss oliver you get on so nicely with the children would you mind telling them some little story for me i shall be gone only ten or fifteen minutes oh margery it was awful i was more frightened than when i was asked to come into the circle but the children clapped their hands and cried yes yes tell us a story i could only think of the hen that hatched ducks but i sat down and began and as i talked i took my clay bird and molded it into a hen so that they would look at me whether they listened or not of course one of the big sevenyearold boys began to whisper and be restless but i handed him a large lump of clay and asked him to make a nest and some eggs for my hen and that soon absorbed his attention they listened so nicely you can hardly believe how nicely they listened when i finished i looked at the clock it had been nine minutes and i could nt think what to do the other dreadful minutes till miss denison should come back at last my eye fell on the blackboard and that gave me an idea i drew a hens beak and then a ducks a hens foot and then a ducks to show them the difference just then miss denison came in softly and i confess i was bursting with pride and delight there was the blackboard with the sketches not very good ones it is true the clay hen and nest and eggs and all the children sitting quietly in their wee red chairs and miss denison said how charming of you to carry out the idea of the morning so nicely my dear little girl you were made for this sort of thing did you know it well i should nt think you had patience enough for any sort of teaching said margery candidly neither did i suppose so myself and i have nt any patience to spare that is for boarders or dishes or beds but i love children so dearly that they never try my patience as other things do you have had the play side of the kindergarten polly while miss denison had the care there must be a workaday side to it im sure miss denison very often looks tired to death of course cried polly i know it s hard work but who cares whether a thing is hard or not if one loves it i dont mind work i only mind working at something i dislike and can never learn to like why margery at the sundayschool picnics you go off in the broiling sun and sit on a campchair and sketch while i play fox and geese with the children and each of us pities the other and thinks she must be dying with heat it s just the difference between us you carry your easel and stool and paintboxes and umbrella up the steepest hill and never mind if your back aches i bend over miss denisons children with their drawing or building and never think of my backache do you see yes but i always keep up my spirits by thinking that though i may be tired and discouraged it is worth while because it is art i am working at and for the sake of being an artist i ought to be willing to endure anything you would nt have that feeling to inspire and help you i should like to know why i would nt exclaimed polly with flashing eyes i should like to know why teaching may not be an art i confess i dont know exactly what an artist is or rather what the dictionary definition of art is but sit down in miss burkes room at the college you cant stay there half an hour without thinking that rather than have her teach you anything you would be an ignorant little cannibal on a desert island she does nt know how and there is nothing beautiful about it but look at miss denison when she comes into her kindergarten it is like the sunrise and she makes everything blossom that she touches it is all so simple and sweet that it seems as if anybody could do it but when you try it you find that it is quite different whether she plays or sings or talks or works with the children it is perfect it all seems so easy when you do it i said to her yesterday and she pointed to the quotation for the day in her calendar it was a sentence from george macdonald ease is the lovely result of forgotten toil now it may be that miss mary denison is only an angel but i think that she s an artist on second thoughts perhaps you are right in your meaning of the word though it does nt follow that all teachers are artists no nor that all the painters are retorted polly think of that poor miss thomas in your outdoor class last week when you were sketching the cow in front of the old barn i sat behind her for half an hour her barn grew softer and softer and her cow harder and harder till when she finished the barn looked as if it were molded in jelly and the cow as if it were carved in red sandstone she ought not to be allowed to paint said margery decisively of course she ought nt thats just what i say and i ought not to be allowed to keep boarders and i wont i must say you have wonderful courage polly it seems so natural and easy for you to strike out for yourself in a new line that it must be you feel a sense of power and that you will be successful pollys manner changed abruptly as she glanced in at her mothers empty chair before she replied courage sometimes i think i have nt a morsel i am a gilded sham my knees tremble whenever i think of my future career as i call it mamma thinks me filled with a burning desire for a wider sphere of action and so i am but chiefly for her sake courage there s nothing like having a blessed tired little mother to take care of a mother whom you want to snatch from the jaws of a horrible fate that s a trifle strong but its dramatic you see margery a woman like my mother is not going to remain forever in her present rank in her profession she is too superior she is bound to rise now what would become of her if she rose why first she would keep a country hotel and sit on the front piazza in a red rocker and chat with the commercial travelers and then she would become the head of a summer resort with a billiardroom and a bowlingalley i must be selfsupporting and i will never desert mr micawber so i should make beds and dust in hotel number one and in hotel number two entertain the guests with my music and my sprightly manners thats what mr greenwood calls them and the only reason i am sorry we live in a republic is that i cant have him guillotined for doing it but must swallow my wrath because he pays twenty dollars a week and seldom dines at home finally in hotel number three i should probably marry the ninepinman or the head clerk so as to consolidate the management and save salaries and there would end the annals of the olivers no margery cried polly waving the scissors in the air everybody is down on the beach and i can make the welkin ring if i like so hear me the boarders must go how when and where they shall go are three problems i have nt yet solved and what i shall find to take the place of them when they do go is a fourth problem and the knottiest one of all chapter iii the doctor gives polly a prescription as the summer wore away mrs oliver daily grew more and more languid until at length she was forced to ask a widowed neighbor mrs chadwick to come and take the housekeeping cares until she should feel stronger but beeftea and drives saltwater bathing and tonics seemed to do no good and at length there came a day when she had not sufficient strength to sit up the sight of her mother actually in bed in the daytime gave polly a sensation as of a cold hand clutching at her heart and she ran for dr edgerton in an agony of fear but good dr george as he was always called because he began practice when his father the old doctor was still living came home with her cheered her by his hopeful view of the case and asked her to call at his office that afternoon for some remedies after dinner was over polly kissed her sleeping mother laid a rose on her pillow for goodby and stole out of the room her heart was heavy as she walked into the office where the doctor sat alone at his desk goodday my dear he said cordially as he looked up for she was one of his prime favorites bless my soul how you do grow child why you are almost a woman i am quite a woman said polly with a choking sensation in her throat and you have something to say to me dr george or you would nt have asked me to leave mamma and come here this stifling day you would have sent the medicine by your officeboy dr george laid down his pen in mild amazement you are a woman in every sense of the word my dear bless my soul how you do hit it occasionally you sprig of a girl now sit by that window and we ll talk what i wanted to say to you is this polly your mother must have an entire change six months ago i tried to send her to a restcure but she refused to go anywhere without you saying that you were her best tonic two tears ran down pollys cheeks tell me that again please she said softly looking out of the window she said if you will have the very words and all of them that you were sun and stimulant fresh air medicine and nourishment and that she could not exist without those indispensables even in a restcure pollys head went down on the windowsill in a sudden passion of tears hoitytoity that s a queer way of receiving a compliment young woman she tried to smile through her april shower it makes me so happy yet so unhappy dr george mamma has been working her strength away so many years and i ve been too young to realize it and too young to prevent it and now that i am grown up i am afraid it is too late not too late at all said dr george cheerily only we must begin at once and attend to the matter thoroughly your mother has been in this southern climate too long for one thing she needs a change of air and scene san francisco will do though it s not what i should choose she must be taken entirely away from her care and from everything that will remind her of it and she must live quietly where she will not have to make a continual effort to smile and talk to people three times a day being agreeable polite and goodtempered for fifteen years without a single lapse will send anybody into a decline you ll never go that way my polly now pardon me but how much ready money have you laid away three hundred and twelve dollars whew it is a good deal said polly with modest pride and it would have been more yet if we had not just painted the house a good deal my poor lambkin i hoped it was at least but however you have the house and that is as good as money the house must be rented at once furniture boarders and all as it stands it ought to bring or a month in these times and you can manage on that with the as a reserve what if the tenant should give up the house as soon as we are fairly settled in san francisco asked polly with an absolutely new gleam of caution and business in her eye brava why do i attempt to advise such a capable little person well in the first place there are such things as leases and in the second place if your tenant should move out the agent must find you another in short order and you will live meanwhile on the reserve fund but joking aside there is very little risk it is going to be a great winter for santa barbara and your house is attractive convenient and excellently located if we can get your affairs into such shape that your mother will not be anxious i hope and think that the entire change and rest together with the bracing air will work wonders i shall give you a letter to a physician a friend of mine and fortunately i shall come up once a month during the winter to see an old patient who insists on retaining me just from force of habit and in another year dr george i shall be ready to take care of mamma myself and then she shall sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam and feast upon strawberries sugar and cream assuredly my polly assuredly the doctor was pacing up and down the office now hands in pockets eyes on floor the world is your oyster open it my dear open it by the way with a sharp turn with what do you propose to open it i dont know yet but not with boarders dr george tut tut child must nt despise small things such as mr greenwood said polly irrepressibly weight two hundred and ninety pounds and mrs darling height six feet one inch no i ll try not to despise small things thank you well if there s a vocation it will call you know polly i d rather like you for an assistant to drive my horse and amuse my convalescents bless my soul you d make a superb nurse except except what sir you re not in equilibrium yet my child you are either up or down generally up you bounce so to speak now a nurse must nt bounce she must be poised as it were or suspended betwixt and between like mahomets coffin but thank heaven for your high spirits all the same they will tide you over many a hard place and the years will bring the inevitable yoke soon enough polly and here dr george passed behind the girls chair and put his two kind hands on her shoulders polly can you be really a woman can you put the littlegirl days bravely behind you i can dr george this in a very trembling voice can you settle all these details for your mother and assume responsibilities can you take her away as if she were the child and you the mother all at once i can this more firmly can you deny yourself for her as she has for you can you keep cheerful and sunny can you hide your fears if there should be cause for any in your own heart can you be calm and strong if no no gasped polly dropping her head on the back of the chair and shivering like a leaf no no dont talk about fears dr george she will be better she will be better very soon i could not live it is nt so easy to die my child with plenty of warm young blood running pellmell through your veins and a sixteenyearold heart that beats like a chronometer i could not bear life without mamma dr george a human being made in the image of god can bear anything child but i hope you wont have to meet that sorrow for many a long year yet i will come in tomorrow and coax your mother into a full assent to my plans meanwhile fly home with your medicines there was a time when you used to give my tonics at night and my sleepingdraught in the morning but i believe in you absolutely from this day polly put her two slim hands in the kind doctors and looking up with brimming eyes into his genial face said dear dr george you may believe in me indeed indeed you may dr george looked out of his office window and mused as his eyes followed polly up the shaded walk under the peppertrees oh these young things these young things how ones heart yearns over them he sighed there she goes full tilt notwithstanding the heat hat swinging in her hand instead of being on her pretty head her heart bursting with fond schemes to keep that precious mother alive its a splendid nature that girls one that is in danger of being wrecked by its own impetuosity but one so full and rich that it is capable of bubbling over and enriching all the dull and sterile ones about it now if all the money i can rake and scrape together need not go to those languid boneless children of my languid boneless sisterinlaw i could put that brave little girl on her feet i think she will be able to do battle with the world so long as she has her mother for a motivepower the question is how will she do it without chapter iv the boarders stay and the olivers go dr george found mrs oliver too ill to be anything but reasonable after a long talk about her own condition and pollys future she gave a somewhat tearful assent to all his plans for their welfare and agreed to make the change when a suitable tenant was found for the house so polly eased the anxiety that gnawed at her heart by incredible energy in the direction of housecleaning superintending all sorts of scrubbings polishings and renovating of carpets with the aid of an extra chinaman who was fresh from his native ricefields and stupid enough to occupy any ones mind to the exclusion of other matters each boarder in turn was asked to make a trip to the country on a certain day and on his return found his room in spotless order while all this time the tired mother lay quietly in her bed knowing little or nothing of her daughters superhuman efforts to be good but a month of rest worked wonders and mrs oliver finally became so like her usual delicate but energetic self that polly almost forgot her fears although she remitted none of her nursing and fond but rigid discipline at length something happened and one glorious saturday morning in october polly saddled blanquita the white mare which bell winship had left in pollys care during her european trip and galloped over to the nobles ranch in a breathless state of excitement blanquita was happy too for polly had a light hand on the rein and a light seat in the saddle she knew there would be a long rest at the journeys end and that too under a particularly shady peppertree so both horse and rider were in a golden humor as they loped over the dusty road the blue pacific on the one hand and the brown hills thirsty for rain on the other polly tied blanquita to the peppertree caught her habit in one hand and ran up the walnuttree avenue to the nobles house there was no one in but that was nothing unusual since a house is chiefly useful for sleeping purposes in that lovely climate no one on the verandas no one in the hammocks after seeking for some little time she came upon margery and her mother at work in their orangetree sittingroom mrs noble with her mendingbasket margery painting as usual the orangetree sittingroom was merely a platform built under the trees which in the season of blossoms shed a heavy fragrance in the warm air and later on hung their branches of golden fruit almost into your very lap here you are cried polly plunging through the trees as she caught sight of margerys pink dress you have nt any hats to swing so please give three rousing cheers the house is rented and a lease signed for a year that is good news indeed exclaimed mrs noble laying down her needle and who is the tenant whom do you suppose mrs chadwick herself she has been getting on very nicely with the housekeeping part of the credit belongs to me but no one would ever believe it and the boarders have been gradually weaned from mamma and accustomed to the new order of things so they are tolerably content ah foy also has agreed to stay and that makes matters still more serene since he is the best cook in santa barbara mrs chadwick will pay eightyfive dollars a month dr george thinks we ought to get more but mamma is so glad to have somebody whom she knows and so relieved to feel that there will be no general breaking up of the sweet sweet home that she is glad to accept the eightyfive dollars and i am sure that we can live in modest penury on that sum of course mrs chadwick may weary in welldoing or she may die or she may even get married though thats very unlikely unless one of the boarders cant pay his board and wants to make it up to her in some way heigho i feel like a princess like a capitalist like a gilded society lady sighed polly fanning herself with her hat and now you and your mother will come to us for a week or two as you promised wont you asked mrs noble that will give you time to make your preparations comfortably polly took a note from her pocket and handed it to mrs noble mrs oliver presents her compliments to mrs noble and says in this letter that we accept with pleasure mrs nobles kind invitation to visit her said letter was not to be delivered in case mrs noble omitted to renew the invitation but as all is right i dont mind announcing that we are coming the day after tomorrow oh polly polly how am i ever to live without you sighed margery first elsie then bell now you live for your art with a big a peggy but its not forever by and by when you are a successful artist and i am a successful something in short when we are both careering which is my verb to express earning ones living by the exercise of some splendid talent we will career together in some great metropolis our mothers shall dress in lyons velvet and pointlace their delicate fingers no longer sullied by the vulgar dishcloth and duster shall glitter with priceless gems while you and i the humble authors of their greatness will heap dimes on dimes until we satisfy ambition mrs noble smiled i hope your career as you call it will be one in which imagination will be of use polly i dont really imagine all the imaginations you imagine i imagine said polly soberly as she gave mrs nobles hand an affectionate squeeze a good deal of it is whistling to keep my courage up but everything looks hopeful just now mamma is so much better everybody is so kind and do you know i dont loathe the boarders half so much since we have rented them with the house they grow in beauty side by side they fill our home with glee now that i can look upon them as personal property part of our goods and chattels they have ceased to be disagreeable even mr greenwood you remember him margery the fat old man who calls you sprightly the very same but he has done worse since that to be called sprightly is bad enough but yesterday he said that he shouldnt be surprised if i married well in course of time nothing but italics would convey the biting sarcasm of pollys inflections and no capitals in a printers case could picture her flashing eyes or the vigor with which she prodded the earth with her ridingwhip i agree with him that it is not impossible said mrs noble teasingly after a moment of silence now dearest aunty meg dont take sides with that odious man if in the distant years you ever see me on the point of marrying well simply mention mr greenwoods name to me and i ll draw back even if i am walking up the middle aisle with an ivory prayerbook in my hand just to spite mr greenwood that would be sensible said margery you could nt be so calm if you had to sit at the same table with him day after day he belongs at the second table by by every law of his nature but as i was saying now that we have rented him to mrs chadwick with the rest of the furniture and will have a percentage on him just as we do on the piano which is far more valuable i have been able to look at him pleasantly you ought to be glad that the boarders like you said margery reprovingly they dont as a rule only the horrors and the elderly gentlemen approve of me but goodby for today aunty meg come to the gate peggy dear the two friends walked through the orangegrove their arms wound about each other girlfashion they were silent for each was sorry to lose the other and a remembrance of the dear old times the unbroken circle the peaceful schooldays and merry vacations stole into their young hearts together with visions of the unknown future as polly untied blanquita and gave a heroic cinch to the saddle she gave a last searching look at margery and said finally peggy dear i am very sure you are blue this morning tell your faithful old pollykins all about it one word was enough for margery in her present mood and she burst into tears on pollys shoulder is it edgar again whispered polly yes she sobbed father has given him three months more to stay in the university and unless he does better he is to come home and live on the cattleranch mother is heartbroken over it for you know polly that edgar will never endure such a life and yet dearly as he loves books he is nt doing well with his studies the president has written father that he is very indolent this term and often absent from recitations and one of the santa barbara boys a senior writes philip that he is not choosing good friends nor taking any rank in his class mother has written him such a letter this morning if he can read it without turning his back upon his temptations whatever they may he i shall never have any pride in him again and oh polly i have been so proud of him my brilliant handsome charming brother poor edgar i cant believe it is anything that will last he is so bright and lovable every one thought he would take the highest honors why margery he is or was the most ambitious boy i ever knew and surely surely he cannot have changed altogether surely he will come to himself when he knows he may have to leave college unless he does his best i m so sorry dear old peggy it seems heartless that my brighter times should begin just when you are in trouble perhaps mamma and i can do something for edgar we will try you may lie sure goodby dearest i shall see you again very soon ten days later polly stood on the deck of the orizaba just at dusk looking back on lovely santa barbara as it lay in the lap of the foothills freshened by the first rains the dull redtiled roofs of the old spanish adobes gleamed through the green of the peppertrees the tips of the tall straggling bluegums stood out sharply against the sky and the twin towers of the old mission rose in dazzling whiteness above a wilderness of verdure the friendly faces on the wharf first merged themselves into a blurred mass of moving atoms then sank into nothingness polly glanced into her stateroom mrs oliver was a good sailor and was lying snug and warm under her blankets so polly took a campchair just outside the door wrapped herself in her fur cape crowded her tamoshanter tightly on and sat there alone as the sunset glow paled in the western sky and darkness fell upon the face of the deep the mesa faded from sight and then the lighthouse where she had passed so many happy hours in her childhood the bright disk of flame shone clear and steady across the quiet ocean seeming to say let your light so shine let your light so shine good luck polly keep your own lamp filled and trimmed like a wise little virgin and her heart answered goodby dear light i am leaving my littlegirl days on the shore with you and i am out on the open sea of life i shall know that you are shining though i cannot see you goodby shine on dear light i am going to seek my fortune chapter v told in letters extracts from polly olivers correspondence san francisco november dear margery i have been able to write you only scraps of notes heretofore but now that we are quite settled i can tell you about our new home we were at a hotel for a week as long as i the family banker felt that we could afford it at the end of that time by walking the streets from morning till night looking at every house with a sign to let on it and taking mamma to see only the desirable ones we found a humble spot to lay our heads it is a tiny upper flat which we rent for thirty dollars a month the landlady calls it furnished but she has an imagination which takes even higher flights than mine still with the help of the pretty things we brought with us we are very cosy and comfortable there is a tiny parlor which with our santa barbara draperies tablecovers afternoon teatable grasses and books looks like a corner of the dear home sittingroom out of this parlor is a sunny bedroom with two single brass bedsteads and space enough to spare for mammas rockingchair in front of a window that looks out on the golden gate the diningroom just holds by a squeeze the extensiontable and four chairs and the dot of a kitchen with an enchanting gasstove completes the suite we are dining at a restaurant a short distance off at present and i cook the breakfasts and luncheons but on monday as mamma is so well i begin school from nine to twelve each day under a special arrangement and we are to have a little chinese boy who will assist in the work and go home at night to sleep his wages will be eight dollars a month and the washing probably four dollars more this with the rent takes fortytwo dollars from our eightyfive and it remains to be seen whether it is too much i shall walk one way to school although it is sixteen squares and all up and down hill the rains thus far have been mostly in the night and we have lovely days mamma and i take long rides on the cablecars in the afternoon and stay out at the cliff house on the rocks every pleasant saturday then we ve discovered nice sheltered nooks in the sand dunes beyond the park and there we stay for hours mamma reading while i study we are so quiet and so happy we were never alone together in our lives before you dear peggy who have always had your family to yourself can hardly think how we enjoy being at table together just we two i take mammas coffee to her and kiss her on the right cheek then follows an egg with another kiss on the left cheek then a bit of toast with a bearhug and so on we have a few pleasant friends here you know and they come to see mamma without asking her to return the calls as they see plainly she has no strength for society polly p s we have a remarkable front door which opens with a spring located in the wall at the top of the stairs it is a modern improvement and i never tire of opening it even though each time i am obliged to go downstairs to close it again when dr george came last week he rang the bell and being tired with the long pull up the hill leaned against the door to breathe of course i knew nothing of this and as soon as i heard the bell i flew to open the door with my usual neatness and dispatch when who should tumble in full length but poor dear dr george he was so surprised and the opposite neighbors were so interested and i was so sorry that i was almost hysterical dr george insists that the door is a trap laid for unsuspecting country people november the first week is over and the finances did nt come out right at all i have a system of bookkeeping which is original simple practical and absolutely reliable the housemoney i keep in a cigarbox with three partitions formerly used for birds eggs and i divide the months money in four parts and pay everything weekly the money for carfare clothing and sundries i keep in an old silver sugarbowl and the reserve fund which we are never to touch save on the most dreadful provocation in a japanese gingerjar with a cover these plainly marked repose in my upper drawer mamma has no business cares whatever and everything ought to work to a charm as it will after a while but this first week has been discouraging and i have had to borrow enough from compartment two cigarbox to pay debts incurred by compartment one cigarbox this is probably because we had to buy a bag of flour and ten pounds of sugar of course this wont happen every week i wrote ah foy a note after we arrived for he really seems to have a human affection for us i inclose his answer to my letter it is such a miracle of chinese construction that it is somewhat difficult to get his idea still i think i see that he is grateful for past favors that he misses us that the boarders are going on very happy and joy that he is glad mamma is better and pleased with the teacher i selected for him but here it is judge for yourself santa barbara november dear my frend i was joy pleased to received a letter from you how are your getting along and my dear if your leaves a go we but now i been it is here i am very sorry for are a your go to in san francisco if any now did you been it is that here very happy and joy i am so glad for your are to do teachers for me but i am very much thank you dear my frend goodby ah foy november the first compartment cigarbox could nt pay back the money it borrowed from the second compartment and so this in turn had to borrow from the third compartment i could have made everything straight i think if we had nt bought a feather duster and a gallon of kerosene the first will last forever and the second for six weeks so it is nt fair to call compartment number two extravagant at the end of this month i shall remove some of the partitions in the cigarbox and keep the housemoney in two parts balancing accounts every fortnight november my bookkeeping is in a frightful snarl there is neither borrowing nor lending in the cigarbox now for all the money for the month is gone at the end of the third week the water it seems was not included in the thirty dollars for the rent and compartment three had to pay two dollars for that purpose when compartment two was still deeply in its debt if compartment two had only met its rightful obligations compartment three need nt have failed up as they say in new england but as it is poor compartment four is entirely bankrupt and will have to borrow of the sugarbowl or the gingerjar as these banks are not at all in the same line of business they ought not to be drawn into the complications of the cigarbox for they will have their own troubles by and by but i dont know what else to do december it came out better at the end of the month than i feared for we spent very little last week and have part of the ten pounds of sugar kerosene feather duster scrubbingbrush blancmange mould tapioca sago and spices with which to begin the next month i suffered so with the debts losses business embarrassments and failures of the four compartments that when i found i was only four dollars behind on the whole months expenses i knocked out all the compartments and am not going to keep things in weeks i made up the deficit by taking two dollars out of the reserve fund and two dollars out of my tendollar gold piece that dr george gave me on my birthday i have given the gingerjar a note of hand for two dollars from the cigarbox and it has resumed business at the old stand compartment four cigarbox which is perfectly innocent as it was borrowed out of house and home by compartment three also had to give a note to the sugarbowl and i made the gingerjar give me a note for my two dollars birthdaymoney whether all these obligations will be met without lawsuits i cannot tell but i know by the masterly manner in which i have fought my way through these intricate affairs with the loss of only four dollars in four weeks that i possess decided business ability and this gives me courage to struggle on december we are having hard times dear old margery though i do not regret coming to san francisco for mamma could not bear the slightest noise or confusion nor lift her hand to any sort of work in her present condition at any rate we came by dr georges orders so my conscience is clear mrs chadwick has sent us only sixtyfive dollars this month instead of eightyfive some of the boarders are behind in their payments the darlings have gone away and she hopes to do better next month mamma cannot bear to press her she is so kind and wellmeaning so do not for the world mention the matter to dr george i will write to him when i must not before meanwhile i walk to school both ways saving a dollar and a quarter a month have found a cheaper laundry one dollar more saved cut down fruit bill one dollar more blacked my white straw sailor with shoeblacking trimmed it with two neckties and an old blackbird badly molted result perfectly hideous but the sugarbowl clothing and sundry fund are out of debt and doing well had my faded gray dress dyed black and trimmed the jacket with pieces of my motheaten cocksfeather boa perfectly elegant almost too gorgeous for my humble circumstances mamma looks at me sadly when i don these ancient garments and almost wishes i had nt such a wealthy look i tell her i expect the girls to say when i walk into the schoolyard on monday who is this that cometh with dyed garments from bozrah mamma has decided that i may enter a trainingschool for kindergartners next year so i am taking the studies that will give me the best preparation and i hope to earn part of my tuition fees when the time comes by teaching as assistant i go over to berkeley once a week to talk spanish with kind professor salazar and his wife they insist that it is a pleasure and will not allow mamma to pay anything for the lessons i also go every tuesday to tell stories at the childrens hospital it is the dearest hour of the week when i am distracted about bills and expenses and mammas health and mrs chadwicks mismanagements and yung lees mistakes for he is beautiful as an angel and stupid as a toad i put on my hat and go out to the children poor little things they always have a welcome for me bless them and i always come back ready to take up my trials again edgar is waiting to take this to the postbox so i must say goodnight he is such a pleasure to us and such a comfort to mamma i know for the first time in my life the fun of having a brother ever your affectionate pollykins the foregoing extracts from pollys business letters give you an idea only of her financial difficulties she was tempted to pour these into one sympathizing ear inasmuch as she kept all annoyances from her mother as far as possible though household economies as devised by her lost much of their terror mrs oliver was never able to see any great sorrow in a monthly deficit when polly seated herself before her cashboxes and explained her highly original financial operations one would be indeed in dire distress of mind could one refrain from smiling when having made the preliminary announcement the great feminine financier of the century is in her countingroom let the earth tremble she planted herself on the bed oriental fashion took pencil and accountbook in lap spread cigarbox sugarbowl and gingerjar before her on the pillows and ruffled her hair for the approaching contest chapter vi polly tries a little missionary work one change had come over their life during these months which although not explained in pollys correspondence concerns our little circle of people very intimately the olivers had been in san francisco over a month but though edgar noble had been advised of the fact he had not come over from berkeley to see his old friends polly had at length written him a note which still remained unanswered when she started one afternoon on a trip across the bay for her first spanish conversation with professor salazar she had once visited the university buildings but professor salazar lived not only at some distance from the college but at some distance from everything else still she had elaborate written directions in her pocket and hoped to find the place without difficulty she had no sooner alighted at the station than she felt an uneasy consciousness that it was not the right one and that she should have gone farther before leaving the railway however there was no certainty about it in her mind so after asking at two houses half a mile apart and finding that the inmates had never heard of professor salazars existence she walked down a shady road hoping to find another household where his name and fame had penetrated the appointed hour for the lessons was half past three on fridays but it was after four and polly seemed to be walking farther and farther away from civilization i shall have to give it up she thought i will go back to the station where i got off and wait until the next train for san francisco comes along which will be nobody knows when how provoking it is and how stupid i am professor salazar will stay at home for me and very likely mrs salazar has made buttercakes and coffee and here am i floundering in the woods i ll sit down under these trees and do a bit of spanish while i m resting for the walk back just at this moment a chorus of voices sounded in the distance then some loud talking then more singing it is some of the students thought polly as she hastily retired behind a tree until they should pass illustration it is some of the students but unfortunately they did not pass just as they came opposite her hidingplace they threw themselves down in a sunny spot on the opposite side of the road and lighted their cigarettes no hurry said one let s take it easy the train does nt leave till where are you going ned home i suppose where i was going when you met me i told you i could only walk to the turn home no you dont expostulated half a dozen laughing voices we ve unearthed the wouldbe hermit and we mean to keep him cant go with you tonight boys worse luck repeated the second speaker got to cram for that examination or be plucked again and one more plucking will settle this childs university career oh let the examinations go to the dickens what s the use all the same a hundred years hence the idea of cramming friday night come on cant do it old chaps but next time goes see you monday tata polly peeped cautiously from behind her tree i believe that voice is edgar nobles or else i m very much mistaken i thought of it when i first heard them singing yes it is now those hateful boys are going to get him into trouble just at this moment four of the boys jumped from the ground and singing vociferously he wont go home any more he wont go home any more he wont go home any more way down on the bingo farm rushed after young noble pinioned him and brought him back see here noble expostulated one of them who seemed to be a commanding genius among the rest see here dont go and be a spoilsport what s the matter with you we re going to chip in for a good dinner go to the minstrels and then oh then we ll go and have a game of billiards you play so well that you wont lose anything and if you want money wills flush he ll lend you a tenner you know there wont be any fun in it unless you re there we ll get the last boat back tonight or the first in the morning a letter from his mother lay in edgars pocket a letter which had brought something like tears to his eyes for a moment and over which he had vowed better things but he yielded nevertheless that it was with reluctance did nt do any particular good to anybody though the recording angels may have made a note of it and strolled along with the other students who were evidently in great glee over their triumph meanwhile polly had been plotting her brain was not a great one but it worked very swiftly dr george called it chaffingly a small mind in a very active state scarcely stopping to think lest her courage should not be equal to the strain of meeting six or eight young men face to face she stepped softly out of her retreat walked gently down the road and when she had come within ten feet of the group halted and clearing her throat desperately said i beg your pardon the whole party turned with one accord a good deal of amazement in their eyes as there had not been a sign of life in the road a moment before and now here was a sort of woodland sprite a nutbrown mayde with a remarkably sweet voice i beg your pardon but can you tell me the way to professor salazars house why this with a charming smile and expression as of one having found an angel of deliverance why it is is nt it edgar noble of santa barbara edgar murmuring polly oliver by jove lifted his hat at once and saying excuse me boys turned back and gallantly walked at pollys side why miss polly this is an unexpected way of meeting you very unexpected thought polly is it not indeed i wrote you a note the other day telling you that we hoped to see you soon in san francisco yes said edgar i did nt answer it because i intended to present myself in person tomorrow or sunday what are you doing in this vicinity he continued or to put it poetically pray why are you loitering here pretty maid no wonder you ask i am floundering at present i came over to a spanish lesson at professor salazars and i have quite lost my way if you will be kind enough to put me on the right road i shall be very much obliged though i dont like to keep you from your friends said polly with a quizzical smile you see the professor wont know why i missed my appointment and i cant bear to let him think me capable of neglect he has been so very kind but you cant walk there you must have gotten off at the wrong station it is quite a mile even across the fields and what is a mile sir have you forgotten that i am a country girl and she smiled up at him brightly with a look that challenged remembrance i remember that you could walk with any of us said edgar thinking how the freckles had disappeared from pollys roseleaf skin and how particularly fetching she looked in her brown felt sailorhat well if you really wish to go there i ll see you safely to the house and take you over to san francisco afterward as it will be almost dark i was going over at any rate and one train earlier or later wont make any difference perhaps it wont and perhaps it will thought polly if you are sure it wont be too much trouble then not a bit excuse me a moment while i run back and explain the matter to the boys the boys did not require any elaborate explanation oh the power of a winsome face no better than many other good things but surely one of them and when it is united to a fair amount of goodness something to be devoutly thankful for it is to be feared that if a lumpish dumpish sort of girl good as gold you know but not suitable for occasions when a fellows will has to be caught on the fly and held until it settles to its work if that lumpish dumpish girl had asked the way to professor salazars house edgar noble would have led her courteously to the turn of the road lifted his hat and wished her a pleasant journey but polly was wearing her sunday dress of brown cloth and a jaunty jacket trimmed with sable the best bits of an old pelisse of mrs olivers the sun shone on the loosedropping coil of the waving hair that was only caught in place by a tortoiseshell arrow the wind blew some of the dazzling tendrils across her forehead the eyes that glanced up from under her smart little sailorhat were as blue as sapphires and edgar as he looked suddenly feared that there might be vicious bulls in the meadows and did nt dare as a gentleman to trust polly alone he had nt remembered anything special about her but after an interval of two years she seemed all at once as desirable as dinner as tempting as the minstrels almost as fascinating as the billiards when one has just money enough in ones pocket for ones last weeks bills and none at all for the next the boys as i say had imagined edgars probable process of reasoning polly was standing in the highroad where a wayfaring man though a fool could look at her and when edgar explained that it was his duty to see her safely to her destination they all bowed to the inevitable the one called tony even said that he would be glad to swap with him and the whole party offered to support him in his escort duty if he said the word he agreed to meet the boys later as pollys quick ear assured her and having behaved both as a man of honor and knight of chivalry he started unsuspectingly across the fields with his wouldbe guardian she darted a searching look at him as they walked along oh how old and gentlemanly you look edgar i feel quite afraid of you i m glad you do there used to be a painful lack of reverence in your manners miss polly there used to be a painful lack of politeness in yours mr edgar oh dear i meant to begin so nicely with you and astonish you with my new grownup manners now edgar let us begin as if we had just been introduced if you will try your best not to be provoking i wont say a single disagreeable thing polly shall i tell you the truth you might try it would be good practice even if you did nt accomplish anything how does that remark conform with your late promises however i ll be forgiving and see if i receive any reward i ve tried every other line of action what i was going to say when you fired that last shot was this i agree with jack howard who used to say that he would rather quarrel with you than be friends with any other girl it is nice said polly complacently i feel a sort of pleasant glow myself whenever i ve talked to you a few minutes but the trouble is that you used to fan that pleasant glow into a raging heat and then we both got angry if the present raging heat has faded into the pleasant glow i dont mind telling you that you are very much improved said edgar encouragingly your temper seems much the same but no one who knew you at fourteen could have foreseen that you would turn out so exceedingly well do you mean that i am better looking asked polly with the excited frankness of sixteen years exactly oh thank you thank you edgar i m a thousand times obliged i ve thought so myself lately but its worth everything to have your grownup college opinion of course red hair has come into vogue thats one point in my favor though i fear mine is a little vivid even for the fashion margery has done a water color of my head which phil says looks like the explosion of a tomato then my freckles are almost gone and that is a great help if you examine me carefully in this strong light you can only count seven and two of those are getting fainthearted nothing can be done with my aspiring nose i ve tried in vain to push it down and now i m simply living it down edgar examined her in the strong light mischievously turn your profile he said thats right now do you know i rather like your nose and its a very valuable index to your disposition i dont know whether if it were removed from your face it would mean so much but taken in connection with its surroundings its a very expressive feature it warns the stranger to be careful in fact most of your features are danger signals polly i m rather glad i ve been taking a course of popular medical lectures on first aid to the injured and so with a great deal of nonsense and a good sprinkling of quiet friendly chat they made their way to professor salazars house proffered pollys apologies and took the train for san francisco chapter vii where ignorance is bliss the trip from berkeley to san francisco was a brilliant success from edgars standpoint but polly would have told you that she never worked harder in her life i ll just say how do you do to your mother and then be off said edgar as they neared the house oh but you surely will stay to dinner with us said polly with the most innocent look of disappointment on her face a look of such obvious grief that a person of any feeling could hardly help wishing to remove it if possible you see edgar putting the latchkey in the door mamma is so languid and ill that she cannot indulge in many pleasures and i had quite counted on you to amuse her a little for me this evening but come up and you shall do as you like after dinner i ve brought you a charming surprise mamacita called polly from the stairs an old friend whom i picked up in the woods like a wildflower and brought home to you wildflower is a good name for him she thought mrs oliver was delighted to see edgar but after the first greetings were over polly fancied that she had not closed the front door and edgar offered to go down and make sure in a second polly crossed the room to her mothers side and whispered impressively edgar must be kept here until after midnight i have good reasons that i will explain when we are alone keep him somehow anyhow mrs oliver had not lived sixteen years with polly without learning to leap to conclusions run down and ask mrs howe if she will let us have her hallbedroom tonight she replied nod your head for yes when you come back and i ll act accordingly i have a request to make of edgar and am glad to have so early an opportunity of talking with him we did close the door after all said edgar coming in again what a pretty little apartment you have here i have nt seen anything so cosy and homelike for ages then make yourself at home in it said mrs oliver while polly joined in with is nt that a pretty fire in the grate i ll give you one rosecolored lamp with your firelight here mamacita is the rocker for you on one side here edgar is our one mans chair for you on the other stretch out your feet as lazily as you like on my new goatskin rug you are our only homefriend in san francisco and oh how mamma will spoil you whenever she has the chance now talk to each other cosily while the angel of the house cooks dinner it may be mentioned here that as mrs chadwicks monthly remittances varied from sixty to seventyfive dollars but never reached the promised eightyfive polly had dismissed little yung lee for a month two weeks of which would be the christmas vacation and hoped in this way to make up deficiencies the sugarbowl and gingerjar were stuffed copiously with notes of hand signed cigarbox but held a painfully small amount of cash cant i go out and help polly asked edgar a little later i should never have agreed to stay and dine if i had known that she was the cook go out by all means but you need nt be anxious ours is a sort of dollhousekeeping we buy everything cooked as far as possible and polly makes play of the rest it all seems so simple and interesting to plan for two when we have been used to twelve and fourteen may i come in called edgar from the tiny diningroom to polly who had laid aside her sunday finery and was clad in brown scotch gingham mostly covered with ruffled apron yes if you like but you wont be spoiled here so dont hope it mamma and i are two very different persons tie that apron round your waist i ve just begun the saladdressing is your intelligence equal to stirring it round and round and pouring in oil drop by drop while i take up the dinner fully just try me i ll make it stand on its head in three minutes meanwhile polly set on the table a platter of lambchops some delicate potato chips which had come out of a pasteboard box a dish of canned french peas and a mound of currantjelly that is good she remarked critically coming back to her apprentice who was toiling with most unnecessary vigor so that the veins stood out boldly on his forehead youre really not stupid for a boy and you have nt made a mess which is more than i hoped now please pour the dressing over those sliced tomatoes set them on the sidetable in the banquethall put the plate in the sink dont stare at me open a bottle of apollinaris for mamma dig out the cork with a hairpin i ve lost the corkscrew move three chairs up to the diningtable oh its so charming to have three light the silver candlesticks in the centre of the table go in and bring mamma out in style see if the fire needs coal and ill be ready by that time i can never remember but i fly oh what an excellent slavedriver was spoiled in you said edgar the simple dinner was delicious and such a welcome change from the long boardinghouse table at which edgar had eaten for over a year the candles gave a soft light there was a bowl of yellow flowers underneath them mrs oliver looked like an elderly dresdenchina shepherdess in her pale blue wrapper and polly did nt suffer from the brown gingham with its wide collar and cuffs of buff embroidery and its quaint full sleeves she had burned two small blisters on her wrist they were scarcely visible to the naked eye but she succeeded in obtaining as much sympathy for them as if they had been mortal wounds her mother murmured poor darling wrist and kissed the place to make it well edgar found a bit of thin cambric and bound up the injured member with cooling flour mistress polly looking demurely on thinking meanwhile how much safer he was with them than with the objectionable tony after the lambchops and peas had been discussed edgar insisted on changing the plates and putting on the tomato salad then polly officiated at the next course bringing in coffee sliced oranges and delicious cake from the neighboring confectioners cant i wash the dishes asked edgar when the feast was ended they are not going to be washed at least by us this is a great occasion and the little girl downstairs is coming up to clear away the dinner things then there was the pleasant parlor again and when the candles were lighted in the oldfashioned mirror over the fireplace everything wore a festive appearance the guitar was brought out and edgar sang college songs till mrs oliver grew so bright that she even hummed a faint second from her cosy place on the sofa and then polly must show edgar how she had made austin dobsons milkmaid song fit nelly ely and she must teach him the pretty words across the grass i saw her pass she comes with tripping pace a maid i know and march winds blow her hair across her face hey dolly ho dolly dolly shall be mine before the spray is white with may or blooms the eglantine by this time the bandage had come off the burned wrist and edgar must bind it on again and polly shrieked and started when he pinned the end over and edgar turned pale at the thought of his brutal awkwardness and polly burst into a ringing peal of laughter and confessed that the pin had nt touched her and edgar called her a deceitful little wretch this naturally occupied some time and then there was the second verse the march winds blow i watch her go her eye is blue and clear her cheek is brown and soft as down to those who see it near hey dolly ho dolly dolly shall be mine before the spray is white with may or blooms the eglantine after this singinglesson was over it was nearly eleven oclock but up to this time edgar had shown no realizing sense of his engagements the dinner is over and the theatre party is safe thought polly now comes the tug of war that mysterious game of billiards but mrs oliver was equal to the occasion when edgar looked at his watch she said polly run and get mrs nobles last letter dear and then when she was alone with edgar my dear boy i have a favor to ask of you and you must be quite frank if it is not convenient for you to grant it as tomorrow will be saturday perhaps you have no recitations and if not would it trouble you too much to stay here all night and attend to something for me in the morning i will explain the matter and then you can answer me more decidedly i have received a letter from a washington friend who seems to think it possible that a pension may be granted to me he sends a letter of introduction to general m at the presidio who he says knew colonel oliver and will be able to advise me in the matter i am not well enough to go there for some days and of course i do not like to send polly alone if you could go out with her give him the letter of introduction and ask him kindly to call upon us at his leisure and find out also if there is any danger in a little delay just now while i am ill it would be a very great favor of course i will with all the pleasure in life mrs oliver replied edgar with the unspoken thought confound it there goes my game i promised the fellows to be there and they ll guy me for staying away however there s nothing else to do i should nt have the face to go out now and come in at one or two oclock in the morning polly entered just then with the letter edgar is kind enough to stay all night with us dear and take you to the presidio on the pension business in the morning if you will see that his room is all right i will say goodnight now our guestchamber is downstairs edgar i hope you will be very comfortable breakfast at half past eight please when the door of mrs howes bedroom closed on edgar polly ran upstairs and sank exhausted on her own bed now mamma listen to my tale of woe i got off at the wrong station yes it was stupid but wait perhaps i was led to be stupid i lost my way could nt find professor salazars house could nt find anything else as i was wandering about in a woodsy road trying to find a house of some kind i heard a crowd of boys singing vociferously as they came through the trees i did n t care to meet them all alone as i was though of course there was nothing to be afraid of so i stepped off the road behind some trees and bushes until they should pass it turned out to be half a dozen university students and at first i did nt know that edgar was among them they were teasing somebody to go over to san francisco for a dinner then to the minstrels and then to wind up with a game of billiards and other gayeties which were to be prolonged indefinitely what dreadful things may have been included i dont know a wretch named tony did most of the teasing and he looked equal to planning any sort of mischief all at once i thought i recognized a familiar voice i peeped out and sure enough it was edgar noble whom they were coaxing he did nt want to go a bit i ll say that for him but they were determined that he should i didnt mind his going to dinners and minstrels of course but when they spoke of being out until after midnight or tomorrow morning and when one beetlebrowed vulgarlooking creature offered to lend him a tenner i thought of the mortgage on the noble ranch and the trouble there would be if edgar should get into debt and i felt i must do something to stop him especially as he said himself that everything depended on his next examinations but how did you accomplish it asked mrs oliver sitting up in bed and glowing with interest they sat down by the roadside smoking and talking it over there was nt another wellborn wellbred looking young man in the group edgar seemed a prince among them and i was so ashamed of him for having such friends i was afraid they would stay there until dark but they finally got up and walked toward the station i waited a few moments went softly along behind them and when i was near enough i cleared my throat oh it was a fearful moment and said i beg your pardon but can you direct me to professor salazars house and then in a dramatic tone why it is is nt it edgar noble of santa barbara he joined me of course oh i cant begin to tell you all the steps of the affair i am so exhausted suffice it to say that he walked to professor salazars with me to make my excuses came over to town with me came up to the house i trembling for fear he would slip through my fingers at any moment then you know he stayed to dinner i in terror all the time as the fatal hours approached and departed and there he is the captive of my bow and spear tucked up in mrs howes best bed thanks to your ingenuity i could never have devised that last plot mamma it was a masterpiece you did a kind deed little daughter said mrs oliver with a kiss but poor mrs noble what can we do for her we cannot play policemen all the time we are too far from edgar to know his plans and any interference of which he is conscious would be worse than nothing i cannot believe that he is far wrong yet he certainly never appeared better so polite and thoughtful and friendly well we must let the morrow bring counsel i hope that smirking odious tony is disappointed said polly viciously as she turned out the gas i distinctly heard him tell edgar to throw a handkerchief over my hair if we should pass any wild cattle how i d like to banish him from this vicinity invite edgar to dinner next week mamma not too soon or he will suspect missionary work boys hate to be missionaried and i m sure i dont blame them i hope he is happy downstairs in his little prison he ought to be if ignorance is bliss chapter viii two fireside chats it was five oclock saturday afternoon and edgar noble stood on the olivers steps mrs oliver waving her hand from an upper window and polly standing on the stairs saying goodby come over to dinner some night wont you edgar she asked carelessly any night you like wednesday thursday friday wednesday please as it comes first said edgar roguishly may i help cook it you not only may but you must goodby polly went upstairs and after washing the lunchdishes in a reflective turn of mind which did away with part of the irksomeness of the task went into the parlor and sat on a stool at her mothers feet a soft rain had begun to fall the fire burned brightly the bamboo cast feathery shadows on the wall from a house across the street came the sound of a beautiful voice singing oh holy night the stars are brightly shining it is the night of the dear saviours birth all was peaceful and homelike if it would only last thought polly you are well tonight mamacita a look of repressed pain crossed mrs olivers face as she smoothed the bright head lying in her lap very comfortable dear and very happy as who would not be with such a darling comfort of a daughter always sunny always helpful these last dear weeks cook housekeeper nurse banker all in one with never a complaint as one burden after another is laid on her willing shoulders dont mamma whispered polly seeking desperately for her handkerchief i can stand scolding but compliments always make me cry you know they do if ferdinand and isabella had told columbus to discover my pocket instead of america he would nt have been as famous as he is now there i ve found it now mamma you know your whole duty is to be well well well and i ll take care of everything else i ve been thinking about edgar polly and i have a plan but i shall not think of urging it against your will you are the mistress of the house nowadays i know what it is sighed polly you think we ought to take another boarder a desire for boarders is like a taste for strong drink once acquired it is almost impossible to eradicate it from the system i do think we ought to take this boarder not because it will make a difference in our income but i am convinced that if edgar can have a pleasant home and our companionship just at this juncture he will break away from his idle habits and perhaps his bad associations and take a fresh start i feel that we owe it to our dear old friends to do this for them if we can of course if it proves too great a tax upon you or if i should have another attack of illness it will be out of the question but who knows perhaps two or three months will accomplish our purpose he can pay me whatever he has been paying in berkeley less the amount of his fare to and fro we might have little yung lee again and mrs howe will be glad to rent her extra room it has a fireplace and will serve for both bedroom and study if we add a table and studentlamp i dont believe he will come said polly we are all very well as a diversion but as a constancy we should pall upon him i never could keep up to the level i have been maintaining for the last twentyfour hours that is certain it is nothing short of degradation to struggle as hard to amuse a boy as i have struggled to amuse edgar i dont believe he could endure such exhilaration week after week and i am very sure it would kill me besides he will fancy he is going to be watched and reported at headquarters in santa barbara i think very likely you are right but perhaps i can put the matter so that it will strike him in some other light very well mamacita i m resigned it will break up all our nice little twoing but we will be his guardian angel i will be his guardian and you his angel and oh how he would dislike it if he knew it but wait until odious mr tony meets him tonight what business is it of his if my hair is red when he chaffs him for breaking his appointment i dare say we shall never see him again you are so jolly comfortable here this house is the next best thing to mother said edgar with boyish heartiness as he stood on the white goatskin with his back to the olivers cheerful fireplace it was wednesday evening of the next week polly was clearing away the dinner things and edgar had been arranging mrs olivers chair and pillows and footstool like the gentle young knight he was by nature what wonder that all the fellows even smirking tony liked him and sought his company he who could pull an oar throw a ball leap a bar ride a horse or play a game of skill as if he had been born for each particular occupation what wonder that the neerdowells and idlers and scamps and dullards battered at his door continually and begged him to leave his books and come out and stir up things if you think it is so jolly said mrs oliver how would you like to come here and live with us awhile this was a bombshell the boy hesitated naturally being taken quite by surprise confound it he thought rapidly how shall i get out of this scrape without being impolite they would nt give me one night out a week if i came i d like it immensely you know he said aloud and its awfully kind of you to propose it and i appreciate it but i dont think i dont see that is how i could come mrs oliver in the first place i m quite sure my home people would dislike my intruding on your privacy and then well you know i am out in the evening occasionally and should nt like to disturb you besides i m sure miss polly has her hands full now of course you would be often out in the evening though i dont suppose you are a midnight reveler you would simply have a latchkey and go out and come in as you liked mrs howes room is very pleasant as you know and you could study there before your open fire and join us when you felt like it is it as convenient and pleasant for you to live on this side of the bay and go back and forth oh yes i dont mind that part of it this is worse than the inquisition i dont know but that she will get me in spite of everything oh dear thought mrs oliver he does nt want to come and i dont want him to come and i must urge him to come against his will how very disagreeable missionary work is to be sure i sympathize with him too he is afraid of petticoat government and fears that he will lose some of his precious liberty if i had fifty children i believe i should want them all girls besides dear mrs oliver continued edgar after an awkward pause i dont think you are strong enough to have me here i believe you re only proposing it for my good you know that i m in a forlorn students boardinghouse and you are anxious to give me all the comforts of a home for my blessed mothers sake regardless of your own discomforts come here a moment and sit beside me on pollys footstool you were nearly three years old when polly was born you were all staying with me that summer did you know that you were my first boarders you were a tiny fellow in kilts very much interested in the new baby and very anxious to hold her i can see you now rocking the cradle as gravely as a man polly has hard times and many sorrows before her edgar you are old enough to see that i cannot stay with her much longer edgar was too awed and too greatly moved to answer i should be very glad to have you with us both because i think we could in some degree take the place of your mother and margery and because i should be glad to feel that in any sudden emergency which i do not in the least expect we should have a near friend to lean upon ever so little edgars whole heart went out in a burst of sympathy and manly tenderness in that moment he felt willing to give up every personal pleasure if he might lift a feathers weight of care from the fragile woman who spoke to him with such sweetness and trust for there is nothing hopeless save meanness and poverty of nature and any demand on edgar nobles instinct of chivalrous protection would never be discounted i will come gladly gladly mrs oliver he said if only i can be of service though i fear it will be all the other way please borrow me for a son just to keep me in training and i ll try to bear my honors worthily thank you dear boy then it is settled if you are sure that the living in the city will not interfere with your studies that is the main thing we all look to you to add fresh laurels to your old ones are you satisfied with your college life thus far they have nt told her anything that s good thought edgar oh yes fairly well i dont i dont go in for being a dig mrs oliver i shall never be the valedictorian and all that sort of thing it does nt pay who ever hears of valedictorians twenty years after graduation class honors dont amount to much i suppose they can be overestimated but they must prove some sort of excellence which will stand one in good stead in after years i should never advise a boy or girl to work for honors alone but if after doing ones very best the honors come naturally they are very pleasant half the best scholars in our class are prigs said edgar discontentedly always down on the live fellows who want any sport sometimes i wish i had never gone to college at all unless you deny yourself every pleasure and live the life of a hermit you cant take any rank my father expects me to get a hundred and one per cent in every study and thinks i ought to rise with the lark and go to bed with the chickens i dont know whether he ever sowed any wild oats if he did it was so long ago that he has quite forgotten i must sow mine some time he ought to be thankful they are such a harmless sort i dont understand boys very well said mrs oliver smilingly you see i never have had any to study and you must teach me a few things now about this matter of wild oats why is it so necessary that they should be sown is margery sowing hers i dont know that polly feels bound to sow any i dare say they are not necessities laughed edgar coloring perhaps they are only luxuries mrs oliver looked at the fire soberly i know there may be plenty of fine men who have a discreditable youth to look back upon a youth finally repented of and atoned for but that is rather a weary process i should think and they are surely no stronger men because of the wild oats but rather in spite of them i suppose so sighed edgar but its so easy for women to be good i know you were born a saint to begin with you dont know what it is to be in college and to want to do everything that you cant and ought nt and nothing that you can and ought and get all tangled up in things you never meant to touch however we ll see polly peeped in at the door very softly they have nt any light that s favorable he s sitting on my footstool he need nt suppose he is going to have that place i think she has her hand on his arm yes she has and he is stroking it oh you poor innocent child you do not realize that that soft little hand of my mothers never lets go it slips into a five and threequarters glove but you ll be surprised mr edgar when you discover you cannot get away from it very well then it is settled i ll go back and put the salt fish in soak for my boarders breakfast i seem to have my hands rather full a house to keep an invalid mother and now a boarder the very thing i vowed that i never would have another boarder what grandmamma would have called an unstiddy boy boarder and as polly clattered the pots and pans the young heathen in the parlor might have heard her fresh voice singing with great energy shall we whose souls are lighted with wisdom from on high shall we to men benighted the lamp of life deny chapter ix hard times the new arrangement worked exceedingly well as to edgars innermost personal feelings no one is qualified to speak with any authority whether he experienced a change of heart vowed better things prayed to be delivered from temptation or simply decided to turn over a new leaf no one knows the principal fact in his life at this period seems to have been an unprecedented lack of time for any great foolishness certain unpleasant things had transpired on that eventful friday night when he had missed his appointment with his fellowstudents which had resulted in an open scandal too disagreeable to be passed over by the college authorities the redoubtable tony had been returned with thanks to his fond parents in a distant part of the state and two others had been temporarily suspended edgar noble was not too blind to see the happy chance that interfered with his presence on that occasion and was sensible enough to realize that had he been implicated in the least degree he scorned the possibility of his taking any active part in such scurrilous proceedings he would probably have shared tonys fate existence was wearing a particularly dismal aspect on that afternoon when edgar had met polly oliver in the berkeley woods he felt nagged injured blue out of sorts with fate he had not done anything very bad he said to himself at least nothing half so bad as lots of other fellows and yet everybody frowned on him his father had in his opinion been unnecessarily severe while his mother and sister had wept over him by letter as if he were a thief and a forger instead of a fellow who was simply having a little fling he was annoyed at the conduct of scott burton king of snobs and prigs he named him who had taken it upon himself to inform philip noble of his edgars own personal affairs and he was enraged at being preached at by that said younger brother but of late everything had taken an upward turn and by way of variety existence turned a smiling face toward him he had passed his examinations most unexpectedly to himself with a respectable percentage to spare there was a time when he would have been ashamed of this meagre result he was now just a little but the feeling was somewhat submerged in his gratitude at having squeaked through at all a certain inspired professor hope who wondered what effect encouragement would have on a fellow who did nt deserve any but might possibly need it came up to him after recitations one day and said noble i want to congratulate you on your papers in history and physics they show signal ability there is a plentiful lack of study evinced but no want of grasp or power you have talents that ought to put you among the first three men in the university sir i do not know whether you care to take the trouble to win such a place it is a good deal of trouble but you can win it if you like thats all i have to say noble goodmorning this unlookedfor speech fell like balm on edgars wounded selfrespect and made him hold his head higher for a week and naturally while his head occupied this elevated position he was obliged to live up to it he also felt obliged to make an effort rather reluctantly to maintain some decent standing in the classes of professor hope even if he shirked in all the rest and now life on the whole save for one carking care that perched on his shoulder by day and sat on his eyelids at night was very pleasant though he could not flatter himself that he was absolutely a free agent after all ordinary engagements of concerts theatres lectures or what not he entered the house undisturbed and noiselessly sought his couch but one night when he ventured to stay out till after midnight just as he was stealing in softly mrs olivers gentle voice came from the head of the stairs saying goodnight edgar the lamp is lighted in your room edgar closed his door and sat down disconsolately on the bed cane in hand hat on the back of his head the fire had burned to a few glowing coals his slippers lay on the hearth and his christmas easy jacket hung over the back of his great armchair his books lay open under the studentlamp and there were two vases of fresh flowers in the room that was pollys doing mrs oliver was awake and listening for me worrying about me probably i dare say she thought i d been waylaid by bandits he muttered discontentedly i might as well live in the young womens christian association i cant get mad with an angel but i did nt intend being one myself good gracious why dont they hire me a nurse and buy me a perambulator but all the rest was perfect and his chief chums envied him after they had spent an evening with the olivers polly and he had ceased to quarrel and were on good frank friendly terms she is no end of fun he would have told you has no nonsensical younglady airs about her is always ready for sport sings all kinds of songs from grave to gay knows a good joke when you tell one and keeps a fellow up to the mark as well as a maiden aunt all this was delightful to everybody concerned meanwhile the household affairs were as troublesome as they could well be mrs oliver developed more serious symptoms and dr george asked the san francisco physician to call to see her twice a week at least the san francisco physician thought a year at carlsbad and a year at nice would be a good thing but failing these he ordered copious quantities of expensive drugs and the reserve fund shrank though the precious three hundred and twelve dollars was almost intact poor mrs chadwick sent tearful monthly letters accompanied by checks of fifty to sixtyfive dollars one of the boarders had died two had gone away the season was poor ah foy had returned to china mr greenwood was difficult about his meals the roof leaked provisions were dear mrs holmes in the next street had decided to take boarders eastern people were grumbling at the weather saying it was not at all as reported in the guidebooks realestate and rents were very low she hoped to be able to do better next month and she was mrs olivers affectionate clementine churchill chadwick polly had held a consultation with the principal of her school who had assured her that as she was so well in advance of her class she could be promoted the next term if she desired accordingly she left school in order to be more with her mother and as she studied with edgar in the evening she really lost nothing mrs howe remitted four dollars from the monthly rent in consideration of spanish lessons given to her two oldest children this experiment proved a success and polly next accepted an offer to come three times a week to the house of a certain mrs baer to amuse instructively the four little baer cubs while the mother baer wrote a history of the dressreform movement in englishspeaking nations for this service polly was paid ten dollars a month in gold coin while the amount of spiritual wealth which she amassed could not possibly be estimated in dollars and cents the ten dollars was very useful for it procured the services of a kind strong woman who came on these three afternoons of pollys absence put the entire house in order did the mending rubbed mrs olivers tired back and brushed her hair until she fell asleep so polly assisted in keeping the wolf from the door and her sacrifices watered her young heart and kept it tender money may always be a beautiful thing it is we who make it grimy edgar shared in the business conferences now he had gone into convulsions of mirth over pollys system of accounts and insisted much against her will in teaching her bookkeeping striving to convince her that the cash could be kept in a single box and the accounts separated in a book these lessons were merry occasions for there was a conspicuous cavity in pollys brain where the faculty for mathematics should have been your imbecility is so unusual that it s a positive inspiration edgar would say it is nt like any ordinary stupidity there does nt seem to be any bottom to it you know it s abnormal it s fascinating polly polly glowed under this unstinted praise i am glad you like it she said i always like to have a thing firstclass of its kind though i cant pride myself that it compares with your spanish accent edgar that stands absolutely alone and unapproachable for badness i dont worry about my mathematical stupidity a bit since i read dr holmes who says that everybody has an idiotic area in his mind there had been very little bookkeeping tonight it was raining in torrents mrs oliver was talking with general m in the parlor while edgar and polly were studying in the diningroom polly laid down her book and leaned back in her chair it had been a hard day and it was very discouraging that a new year should come to ones door laden with vexations and anxieties when everybody naturally expected new years to be happy through january and february at least edgar she sighed plaintively i find that this is a very difficult world to live in sometimes edgar looked up from his book and glanced at her as she lay back with closed eyes in the chinese loungingchair she was so pale so tired and so very very pretty just then her hair falling in bright confusion round her face her whole figure relaxed with weariness and her lips quivering a little as if she would like to cry if she dared polly with dimples playing hide and seek in rosy cheeks with dazzling eyes and laughing lips and saucy tongue was sufficiently captivating but polly with bright drops on her lashes with a pathetic droop in the corners of her mouth and the suspicion of a tear in her voice this polly was irresistible whats the matter pretty poll nothing specially new the baer cubs were naughty as little demons today one of them had a birthdayparty yesterday with four kinds of frosted cake mrs baers system of management is nt like mine and until i convince the children i mean what i say they give me the benefit of the doubt the baer place is so large that mrs baer never knows where disobedience may occur and that she may be prepared she keeps one of mr baers old slippers on the front porch one in the carriagehouse one in the arbor one in the nursery and one under the rose hedge at the front gate she showed me all these haunts and told me to make myself thoroughly at home i felt tempted today but i resisted you are working too hard polly i propose we do something about mrs chadwick you are bearing all the brunt of other peoples faults and blunders but edgar everything is so mixed mrs chadwicks year of lease is nt over i suppose she cannot be turned out by main force and if we should ask her to leave the house it might go unrented for a month or two and the loss of that money might be as much as the loss of ten or fifteen dollars a month for the rest of the year i could complain of her to dr george but there again i am in trouble if he knew that we are in difficulties he would offer to lend us money in an instant and that would make mamma ill i am sure for we are under all sorts of obligations to him now for kindnesses that can never be repaid then too he advised us not to let mrs chadwick have the house he said that she had nt energy enough to succeed but mamma was so sorry for her and so determined to give her a chance that she persisted in letting her have it we shall have to find a cheaper flat by and by for i ve tried every other method of economizing for fear of making mamma worse with the commotion of moving chapter x edgar goes to confession i m afraid i make it harder polly and you and your mother must be frank with me and turn me out of the garden of eden the first moment i become a nuisance will you promise you are a help to us edgar we told you so the other night we could nt have yung lee unless you lived with us and i could nt earn any money if i had to do all the housework i d like to be a help but i m so helpless we are all poor together just now and that makes it easier i am worse than poor edgar declared what can be worse than being poor asked polly with a sigh drawn from the depths of her boots to be in debt said edgar who had not the slightest intention of making this remark when he opened his lips now the olivers had only the merest notion of edgars college troubles they knew simply what the nobles had told them that he was in danger of falling behind his class this they judged was a contingency no longer to be feared as various remarks dropped by the students who visited the house and sundry bits of information contributed by edgar himself in sudden bursts of high spirits convinced them that he was regaining his old rank and certainly his old ambition to be in debt repeated edgar doggedly and to see no possible way out of it polly i m in a peck of trouble i ve lost money and i m at my wits end to get straight again lost money how much do you mean that you lost your pocketbook no no not in that way you mean that you spent it said polly you mean you overdrew your allowance of course i did good gracious polly there are other ways of losing money than by dropping it in the road i believe girls dont know anything more about the world than the geography tells them that its a round globe like a ball or an orange dont be impolite the less they know about the old world the better they get on i dare say your colossal fund of worldly knowledge does nt seem to make you very happy just now how could you lose your money i ask you re nothing but a student and you are not in any business are you yes i am in business and pretty bad business it is too what do you mean i mean that i ve been winding myself up into a hard knot the last six months and the more i try to disentangle myself the worse the thing gets my allowance is nt half enough nobody but a miser could live on it i ve been unlucky too i bought a dog and some one poisoned him before i could sell him then i lamed a horse from the liverystable and had to pay damages and so it went the fellows all kept lending me money rather than let me stay out of the little club suppers and since i ve shut down on expensive gayeties theyve gone back on me and all want their money at once so does the liverystable keeper and the owner of the dog and a dozen other individuals in fact the debtors prison yawns before me upon my word i m ashamed of you said polly with considerable heat to waste money in that way when you knew perfectly well you could nt afford it was well it was downright dishonest thats what it was to hear you talk about dogs and lame horses and club suppers anybody would suppose you were a sporting man pray what else do they do in that charming college set of yours i might have known you would take that tone but i did nt somehow i told you just because i thought you were the one girl in a thousand who would understand and advise a fellow when he knows hes made a fool of himself and acted like a cur i did nt suppose you would call hard names and be so unsympathizing after all we have gone through together i m not i did nt i wont do it again said polly incoherently as she took a straight chair planted her elbows on the table and leaned her chin in her two palms now lets talk about it tell me everything quickly how much is it nearly two hundred dollars dont shudder so provokingly polly that s a mere bagatelle for a college man but i know its a good deal for me a good deal more than i know how to get at all events where is the debtors prison asked polly in an awestruck whisper oh there is nt any such thing nowadays i was only chaffing but of course the men to whom i am in debt can apply to father and get me in a regular mess i ve pawned my watch to stave one of them off you see polly i would rather die than do it nevertheless i would write and tell father everything and ask him for the money but circumstances conspire just at this time to make it impossible you know he bought that great ranch in ventura county with albert harding of new york harding has died insolvent and father has to make certain payments or lose control of a valuable property its going to make him a rich man some time but for a year or two we shall have to count every penny of course the fruit crop this season has been the worst in ten years and of course there has been a frost this winter the only severe one within the memory of the oldest inhabitant thats the way it always is and there i am i suppose you despise me polly yes i do hotly no i dont altogether and i m not good enough myself to be able to despise people besides you are not a despisable boy you were born manly and generous and truehearted and these hateful things that you have been doing are not a part of your nature a bit but i m ashamed of you for yielding to bad impulses when you have so many good ones and oh dear i do that very same thing myself now that i stop to think about it but how could you you edgar noble take that evileyed fatnosed common tony selling for a friend i wonder at you he is nt so bad in some ways i owe him eighty dollars of that money and he says he ll give me six months to pay it i m glad he has some small virtues polly replied witheringly now what can we do edgar let us think what can what can we do and she leaned forward reflectively clasping her knee with her hands and wrinkling her brow with intense thought that little we fell on edgars loneliness of spirit consolingly for it adds a new pang to selfdistrust when righteous people withdraw from one in utter disdain even if they are only girls who know little of a boys temptations if you can save something each month out of your allowance edgar said polly finally with a brighter look i can spare fifty or even seventyfive dollars of our money and you may pay it back as you can we are not likely to need it for several months and your father and mother ought not to be troubled with this matter now that its over and done with the blood rushed to edgars face as he replied stiffly i may be selfish and recklessly extravagant but i dont borrow money from girls if you wanted to add the last touch to my shame you ve done it dont you suppose i have eyes polly oliver dont you suppose i ve hated myself ever since i came under this roof when i have seen the way you worked and planned and plotted and saved and denied yourself dont you suppose i ve looked at you twenty times a day and said to myself you miserable selfish puppy getting yourself and everybody who cares for you into trouble just look at that girl and be ashamed of yourself down to the ground and now you offer to lend me money oh polly i wouldnt have believed it of you polly felt convicted of sin although she was not very clear as to the reason she blushed as she said hastily your mother has been a very good friend to us edgar why should nt we help you a little just for once now let us go in to see mamma and talk it all over together if you pity me polly dont tell her i could not bear to have that saint upon earth worried over my troubles it was mean enough to add a feathers weight to yours well we wont do it then said polly with maternal kindness in her tone do stop pacing up and down like a caged panther we ll find some other way out of the trouble but boys are such an anxiety do you think edgar that you have reformed bless your soul i ve kept within my allowance for two or three months as susan nipper says i may be a camel but i m not a dromedary when i found out where i was i stopped i had to stop and i knew it i m all right now thanks to several things in fact i ve acquired a kind of appetite for behaving myself now and if the rascally debts were only out of the way i should be the happiest fellow in the universe you cannot apply to your father so there is only one thing to do that is to earn the money but how when i m in the classroom three fourths of the day i dont know said polly hopelessly i can tell you what to do but not how to do it i m nothing but a miserable girl i must stay in college and i must dig and make up for lost time so most of my evenings will be occupied you must put all your musts together said polly decisively and then build a bridge over them or tunnel through them or span them with an arch we ll keep thinking about it and im sure something will turn up i m not discouraged a bit you see edgar and pollys face flushed with feeling as she drew patterns on the tablecloth with her tortoiseshell hairpin you see of course the good fairies are not going to leave you in the lurch when you ve turned your back on the ugly temptations and are doing your very best and now that we ve talked it all over edgar i m not ashamed of you mamma and i have been so proud of your successes the last month she believes in you of course said edgar dolefully because she knows only the best but i know the best and the worst too and i believe in you it seems to me the best is always the truest part of one after all no we are not going to be naughty any more we are going to earn that hateful tonys money we are going to take all the class honors just for fun not because we care for such trifles and we are going home for the summer holidays in a blaze of glory edgar rose with a lighter heart in his breast than he had felt there for many a week goodnight parson polly he said rather formally for he was too greatly touched to be able to command his tones add your prayers to your sermons and perhaps you ll bring the black sheep safely into the fold the quick tears rushed to pollys eyes for edgars stiff manner sat curiously on him and she feared she had annoyed him by too much advice oh edgar she said with a quivering lip i did nt mean to pose or to preach you know how full of faults i am and if i were a boy i should be worser i was only trying to help a little eves if i am younger and a girl dont dont think i was setting myself up as better than you thats so mean and conceited and small edgar dear i am so proud to think you told me your troubles dont turn away from me or i shall think you are sorry you trusted me and polly laid a persuasive disarming hand on the lads shoulder suddenly edgars heart throbbed with a new feeling he saw as in a vision the purity fidelity and tender yearning of a true womans nature shining through a girls eyes in that moment he wished as never before to be manly and worthy he seemed all at once to understand his mother his sister all women better and with a quick impulsive gesture which he would not have understood a month before he bent his head over astonished pollys hand kissed it reverently then opened the door and went to his room without a word chapter xi the lady in black i ve had a little adventure said polly to her mother one afternoon i went out for the sake of the ride on the sutler street cablecars with milly foster when we came to the end of the line milly walked down to greary street to take her car home i went with her to the corner and as i was coming back i saw a lady in black alighting from an elegant carriage she had a coachman and a footman both with weeds on their hats and she seemed very sad and grave but she had such a sweet beautiful face that i was sorry for her the first moment i looked at her she walked along in front of me toward the cemetery and there we met those boys that stand about the gate with bouquets she glanced at the flowers as if she would like to buy some but you know how hideous they always are every color of the rainbow crowded in tightly together and she looked away dissatisfied i dont know why she had nt brought some with her she looked rich enough to buy a whole conservatory perhaps she had nt expected to drive there however milly foster had given me a whole armful of beautiful flowers you know she has a white garden there were white sweet peas lamarque roses and three stalks of snowy eucharist lilies i need nt tell my own mother that i did nt stop to think twice i just stepped up to her and said i should like to give you my flowers please i dont need them and i am sure they are just sweet and lovely enough for the place you want to lay them the tears came into her eyes she was just ready to cry at anything you know and she took them at once and said squeezing my hand very tightly i will take them dear the grave of my own and my only little girl lies far away from this the snow is falling on it today but whenever i cannot give the flowers to her i always find the restingplaces of other children and lay them there i know it makes her happy for she was born on christmas day and she was full of the christmas spirit always thinking of other people never of herself she did look so pale and sad and sweet that i began to think of you without your troublesome polly or your troublesome polly without you and she was pleased with the flowers and glad that i understood and willing to love anything that was a girl or that was young oh you know mamacita and so i began to cry a little too and the first thing i knew i kissed her which was most informal if not positively impertinent but she seemed to like it for she kissed me back again and i ran and jumped on the car and here i am you will have to eat your dinner without any flowers madam for you have a vulgarly strong healthy daughter and the poor lady in black has nt this was pollys first impression of the lady in black and thus began an acquaintance which was destined before many months to play a very important part in pollys fortunes and misfortunes what the lady in black thought of polly then and subsequently was told at her own fireside where she sat some six weeks later chatting over an afterdinner cup of coffee with her brotherinlaw take the armchair john said mrs bird for i have lots to tell you as the young folks say i was in the childrens hospital about five oclock today i have nt been there for three months and i felt guilty about it the matron asked me to go upstairs into the childrens sittingroom the one donald and i fitted up in memory of carol she said that a young lady was telling stories to the children but that i might go right up and walk in i opened the door softly though i dont think the children would have noticed if i had fired a cannon in their midst and stood there spellbound by the loveliest most touching scene i ever witnessed the room has an open fire and in a low chair with the firelight shining on her face sat that charming impulsive girl who gave me the flowers at the cemetery i told you about her she was telling stories to the children there were fifteen or twenty of them in the room all the semiinvalids and convalescents i should think and they were gathered about her like flies round a saucer of honey every child that could was doing its best to get a bit of her dress to touch or a finger of her hand to hold or an inch of her chair to lean upon they were the usual pale wearylooking children most of them with splints and weights and crutches and through the foldingdoors that opened into the next room i could see three more tiny things sitting up in their cots and drinking in every word with eagerness and transport and i dont wonder there is magic in that girl for sick or sorrowing people i wish you could have seen and heard her her hair is full of warmth and color her lips and cheeks are pink her eyes are bright with health and mischief and beaming with love too her smile is like sunshine and her voice as glad as a wild birds i never saw a creature so alive and radiant and i could feel that the weak little creatures drank in her strength and vigor without depleting her as flowers drink in the sunlight as she stood up and made ready to go she caught sight of me and ejaculated with the most astonished face why it is my lady in black then with a blush she added excuse me i spoke without thinking i always do i have thought of you very often since i gave you the flowers and as i did nt know your name i have always called you my lady in black i should be very glad to be your lady in any color i answered and my other name is mrs bird then i asked her if she would not come and see me she said yes with pleasure and told me also that her mother was ill and that she left her as little as possible whereupon i offered to go and see her instead now here endeth the first lesson and here beginneth the second namely my new plan on which i wish to ask your advice you know that all the money donald and i used to spend on carols nurses physicians and what not we give away each christmas day in memory of her it may be that we give it in monthly installments but we try to plan it and let people know about it on that day i propose to create a new profession for talented young women who like to be helpful to others as well as to themselves i propose to offer this little miss oliver say twentyfive dollars a month if she will go regularly to the childrens hospital and to the various orphan asylums just before supper and just before bedtime and sing and tell stories to the children for an hour i want to ask her to give two hours a day only going to each place once or twice a week but of course she will need a good deal of time for preparation if she accepts i will see the managers of the various institutions offer her services and arrange for the hours i am confident that they will receive my protegee with delight and i am sure that i shall bring the good old art of storytelling into fashion again through this gifted girl now john what do you think i heartily approve as usual it is a novelty but i cannot see why it s not perfectly expedient and i certainly can think of no other way in which a monthly expenditure of twentyfive dollars will carry so much genuine delight and comfort to so many different children carol would sing for joy if she could know of your plan perhaps she does know it said mrs bird softly and so it was settled pollys joy and gratitude at mrs birds proposal baffles the powers of the narrator it was one of those things pleasant to behold charming to imagine but impossible to describe after mrs birds carriage had been whirled away she watched at the window for edgar and when she saw him nearing the steps did not wait for him to unlock the door but opened it from the top of the stairs and flew down them to the landing as lightly as a feather as for edgar himself he was coming up with unprecedented speed and they nearly fell into each others arms as they both exclaimed in one breath hurrah and then in another who told you how did you know it asked edgar has tom mills been here what is anybody by the name of mills to me in my present state of mind exclaimed polly have you some good news too if so speak out quickly good news i should think i had what else were you hurrahing about i ve won the scholarship and i have a chance to earn some money tom millss eyes are in bad condition and the oculist says he must wear blue goggles and not look at a book for two months his father wrote to me today and he asks if i will read over the days lessons with tom every afternoon or evening so that he can keep up with the class and says that if i will do him this great service he will be glad to pay me any reasonable sum he ventured to write me on professor hopes recommendation oh edgar that is too too good cried polly jumping up and down in delight now hear my news what do you suppose has happened turnedup noses have come into style insulting that is nt the spirit i showed when you told me your good news you ve found the leak in the gas stove on the contrary i dont care if all the gas in our establishment leaks from now to the millennium guess again stupid somebody has left you a million no no scornfully well i cant wait your snails pace my lady in black mrs donald bird has been here all the afternoon and she offers me twentyfive dollars a month to give up the baer cubs and tell stories two hours a day in the orphan asylums and the childrens hospital just what i love to do just what i always longed to do just what i would do if i were a billionaire is nt it heavenly well well we are in luck polly hurrah fortune smiles at last on the nobleoliver household lets have a jollification oh i forgot tom mills wants to come to dinner will you mind let him come goggles and all we ll have the lame and the halt as well as the blind if we happen to see any mamma wont care i told her we d have a feast tonight that should vie with any of the old roman banquets here s my purse please go down on sutter street ride both ways and buy anything extravagant and unseasonable you can find get forced tomatoes well have chops and tomato sauce а la mrs bardell order fried oysters in a browned loaf get a quart of ice cream the most expensive variety they have a loaf of the richest cake in the bakery and two chocolate eclairs apiece buy hothouse roses or orchids for the table and give five cents to that dirty little boy on the corner there in short as frank stockton says let us so live while we are up that we shall forget we have ever been down and polly plunged upstairs to make a toilet worthy of the occasion the banquet was such a festive occasion that yung lees chinese reserve was sorely tried and he giggled more than once while waiting on the table polly had donned a trailing black silk skirt of her mothers with a white chuddah shawl for a court train and a white lace waist to top it her hair was wound into a knot on the crown of her head and adorned with three long black ostrich feathers which soared to a great height and presented a most magnificent and queenly appearance tom mills whose father was four times a millionaire wondered why they never had such gay times at his home and tried to fancy his sister blanche sparkling and glowing and beaming over the prospect of earning twentyfive dollars a month then when bedtime came polly and her mother talked it all over in the dark oh mamacita i am so happy its such a lovely beginning and i shall be so glad so glad to do it i hope mrs bird did nt invent the plan for my good for i have been frightfully shabby each time she has seen me but she says she thinks of nothing but the children now we will have some pretty things wont we and oh do you think not just now but some time in the distant centuries i can have a string of gold beads i do indeed sighed mrs oliver you are certainly in no danger of being spoiled by luxury in your youth my poor little pollykins but you will get all these things some time i feel sure if they are good for you and if they belong to you you remember the lines i read the other day hast not thy share on winged feet lo it rushes thee to meet and all that nature made thy own floating in air or pent in stone will rive the hills and swim the sea and like thy shadow follow thee yes said polly contentedly i am satisfied my share of the worlds work is rushing to meet me tonight i could just say with sarah jewetts country doctor my god i thank thee for my future chapter xii the great silence the months of april and may were happy ones the weather was perfect as only california weather understands the art of being the hills were at their greenest the wind almost forgot to blow the fields blazed in wildflowers day after day rose in cloudless splendor and day after day the golden gate shone like a sapphire in the sun polly was inwardly nervous she had the awe of prosperity in her heart and everything seemed too bright to last both she and edgar were very busy but work that one loves is no hardship especially when one is strong and young and hopeful and when one has great matters at stake such as the health and wealth of an invalid mother or the paying off of disagreeable debts even the limp mrs chadwick shared in the general joy for mr greenwood was so utterly discouraged with her mismanagement of the house so determined not to fly to ills he knew not of and so anxious to bring order out of chaos that on the spur of the moment one day he married her on the next day he discharged the cook hired a better one the third dunned the delinquent boarder the fourth and collected from him on the fifth so the may check signed clementine chadwick greenwood was made out for eightyfive dollars but in the midst of it all when everything in the outside world danced with life and vigor and the little house could hardly hold its sweet content without a glimmer of warning without a moments fear or dread without the precious agony of parting mrs oliver slipped softly gently safely into the great silence mercifully it was edgar not polly who found her in her accustomed place on the cushions lying with closed eyelids and smiling lips it was half past five polly must have gone out at four as usual and would be back in half an hour yung lee was humming softly in the little kitchen in five minutes edgar noble had suffered lived and grown ten years he was a man and then came polly and mrs bird with her thank heaven polly breathless and glowing looking up at the bay window for her mothers smile of welcome in a few seconds the terrible news was broken and polly overpowered with its awful suddenness dropped before it as under a physical blow it was better so mrs bird carried her home for the night as she thought but a merciful blur stole over the childs tired brain and she lay for many weeks in a weary illness of delirium and stupor and fever meanwhile edgar acted as brother son and man of the house he it was who managed everything from the first sorrowful days up to the closing of the tiny upper flat where so much had happened not great things of vast outward importance but small ones little miseries and mortifications and struggles and selfdenials and victories that made the past half year a milestone in his life a week finished it all it takes a very short time he thought to scatter to the winds of heaven all the gracious elements that make a home only a week and in the first days of june edgar went back to santa barbara for the summer holidays without even a sight of his brave helpful girlcomrade he went back to his brothers congratulations his sisters kisses his mothers happy tears and his fathers hearty handclasp full of renewed pride and belief in his eldest son but there was a shadow on the lads high spirits as he thought of gay courageous daring polly stripped in a moment of all that made life dear i wish we could do something for her poor little soul he said to his mother in one of their long talks in the orangetree sittingroom tongue cannot tell what mrs oliver has been to me and i m not a bit ashamed to own up to pollys influence even if she is a girl and two or three years younger than i am hang it i d like to see the fellow that could live under the same roof as those two women and not do the best that was in him has nt polly some relatives in the east no near ones and none that she has ever seen still she is not absolutely alone as many girls would be under like circumstances we would be only too glad to have her here the howards have telegraphed asking her to spend the winter with them in cambridge i am confident dr winship will do the same when the news of mrs olivers death reaches europe and mrs bird seems to have constituted herself a sort of fairy godmother in chief you see everybody loves polly and she will probably have no less than four homes open to her the fact is if you should put polly on a desert island the bees and the butterflies and the birds would gather about her she draws everything and everybody to her magically then too she is not penniless rents are low and she cannot hope to get quite as much for the house as before but even counting repairs taxes and furnishings we think she is reasonably certain of fifty dollars a month she will never be idle unless this sorrow makes a great change in her polly seems to have been created to become by doing yet she does not in the least relish work edgar i never knew a girl with a greater appetite for luxury one cannot always see the deepest reasons in gods providence as applied to ones own life and character but it is often easy to understand them as one looks at other people and notes their growth and development for instance pollys intense love for her invalid mother has kept her from being selfish the straitened circumstances in which she has been compelled to live have prevented her from yielding to selfindulgence or frivolity even her hunger for the beautiful has been a discipline for since beautiful things were never given to her readymade she has been forced to create them her lot in life which she has always lamented has given her a selfcontrol a courage a power which she never would have had in the world had she grown up in luxury she is too young to see it but it is very clear to me that polly oliver is a glorious product of circumstances but objected edgar that is not fair you are giving all the credit to circumstances and none to pollys own nature not at all if there had not been the native force to develop experience would have had nothing to work upon as it is her lovely childish possibilities have become probabilities and i look to see the girlish probabilities blossom into womanly certainties meanwhile polly it must be confessed was not at the present time quite justifying the good opinion of her friends she had few of the passive virtues she could bear sharp stabs of misfortune which fired her energy and pride but she resented pin pricks she could carry heavy splendid burdens cheerfully but she fretted under humble cares she could serve by daring but not by waiting she would have gone to the stake or the scaffold i think with tolerable grace but she would probably have recanted any article of faith if she had been confronted with lifeimprisonment trouble that she took upon herself for the sake of others and out of love she accepted sweetly sorrows that she did not choose which were laid upon her without her consent and which were just the ones she did not want and did not need and would not have and could not bear these sorrows found her unwilling bitter and impatient yet if life is a school and we all have lessons to learn in it the great teacher will be unlikely to set us tasks which we have already finished some review there must be for certain things are specially hard to keep in mind and have to be gone over and over lest they fade into forgetfulness but there must be continued progress in a life school there is no parrot repetition singsong meaningless of words that have ceased to be vital new lessons are to be learned as fast as the old ones are understood of what use to set polly tasks to develop her bravery when she was already brave courage was one of the little jewels set in her fairy crown when she was born but there was a round empty space beside it where patience should have been further along was daring making a brilliant show but again there was a tiny vacancy waiting for prudence the crown made a fine appearance on the whole because the large jewels were mostly in place and the light of these blinded you to the lack of the others but to the eye of the keen observer there was a want of symmetry and completeness polly knew the unfinished state of her fairy crown as well as anybody else she could not plead ignorance as an excuse but though she would have gone on polishing the great gems with a fiery zeal she added the little jewels very slowly and that only on compulsion there had been seven or eight weeks of partial unconsciousness when the sorrow and the loneliness of life stole into her waking dreams only vaguely and at intervals when she was unhappy and could not remember why and slept to wake and wonder and sleep again then there were days and weeks when the labor of living was all that the jaded body could accomplish when memory was weak when life began at the pillow and ended at the foot of the bed and the universe was bounded by the chamber windows but when her strength came back and she stood in the middle of the floor clothed and in her right mind well enough to remember oh then indeed the deep waters of bitterness rolled over poor pollys head and into her heart and she sank beneath them without a wish or a struggle to rise if it had been anything else she sobbed why did god take away my most precious my only one to live for when i was trying to take care of her trying to be good trying to give back the strength that had been poured out on me miserable worthless me surely if a girl was willing to do without a father and sisters and brothers without good times and riches willing to work like a galley slave willing to scrimp and plan and save for ever and ever surely they might be willing that she should keep her mother poor polly providence at this time seemed nothing more than a collection of demons which she classified under the word they and which she felt certain were scourging her pitilessly and needlessly she could not see any reason or justification in their cruelties for that was the only term she could apply to her afflictions mrs bird had known sorrow and she did her best to minister to the troubled and wrong little heart but it was so torn that it could be healed only by the soft balm of time perhaps a long while after such a grief it is always perhaps in a great crisis though the certainty is ours if we will but grasp it perhaps the hidden meaning of the sorrow steals gently into our softened hearts we see as in a vision a new light by which to work we rise cast off the outgrown shell and build us a more stately mansion in which to dwell till god makes that home also too small to hold the evergrowing soul chapter xiii a garden flower or a baniantree in august mr john bird took polly to the nobles ranch in santa barbara in the hope that the old scenes and old friends might soothe her and give her strength to take up the burden of life with something of her former sunshiny spirit edgar was a junior now back at his work sunburned and strong from his summers outing he had seen polly twice after his return to san francisco but the first meeting was an utter failure and the second nearly as trying neither of them could speak of the subject that absorbed their thoughts nor had either courage enough to begin other topics of conversation the mere sight of edgar was painful to the girl now it brought to mind so much that was dear so much that was past and gone in the serenity of the ranchlife the long drives with margery and philip the quiet chats with mrs noble polly gained somewhat in strength but the old spring vitality and enthusiasm had vanished for the time and the little circle of friends marveled at this polly without her nonsense her ready smiles her dancing dimples her extravagances of speech once a week at least dr george would steal an hour or two and saddle his horse to take polly for a gallop over the hills through the caсons or on the beach his halfgrave halfcheery talks on these rides did her much good he sympathized and understood and helped even when he chided and polly sometimes forgot her own troubles in wondering whether dr george had not suffered and overcome a good many of his own you make one great error my child he once said in response to one of pollys outbursts of grief and it is an error young people very naturally fall into you think that no one was ever chastened as you are you say with jeremiah no prophet is afflicted like unto this prophet now you are simply bearing your own share of the worlds trouble how can you hope to escape the universal lot there are dozens of people within sight of this height of land who have borne as much and must bear as much again i know this must seem a hard philosophy and i should not preach it to any but a stout little spirit like yours my polly these things come to all of us they are stern facts they are here and they must be borne but it makes all the difference in the world how we bear them we can clench our fists close our lips tightly and say since i must i can or we can look up and say cheerfully i will the first method is philosophical and strong enough but there is no sweetness in it if you have this burden to carry make it as light not as heavy as you can if you have this grief to endure you want at least to come out of it sweeter and stronger than ever before it seems a pity to let it go for nothing in the largest sense of the word you can live for your mother now as truly as you did in the old times you know very well how she would have had you live polly felt a sense of shame steal over her as she looked at dr georges sweet strong smile and resolute mouth and she said with the hint of a new note in her voice i see and i will try but how does one ever learn to live without loving i mean the kind of loving i had in my life i know i can live for my mother in the largest sense of the word but to me all the comfort and sweetness seems to tuck itself under the word in its little sense i shall have to go on developing and developing until i am almost developed to death and go on growing and growing in grace until i am ready to be caught up in a chariot of fire before i can love my mother in the largest sense of the word i want to cuddle my head on her shoulder thats what i want oh dr george how does one contrive to be good when one is not happy how can one walk in the right path when there does nt seem to be any brightness to go by my dear little girl and dr george looked soberly out on the ocean dull and lifeless under the gray october sky when the sun of ones happiness is set one lights a candle called patience and guides ones footsteps by that if only i were not a rich heiress said polly next morning i dare say i should be better off for then i simply could nt have gone to bed for two or three months and idled about like this for another but there seems to be no end to my money edgar paid all the bills in san francisco and saved twenty out of our precious three hundred and twelve dollars then mrs greenwoods rentmoney has been accumulating four months while i have been visiting you and mrs bird and the greenwoods are willing to pay sixty dollars a month for the house still even though times are dull so i am hopelessly wealthy but on the whole i am very glad the old desire to do something and be something seems to have faded out of my life with all the other beautiful things i think i shall go to a girls college and study or find some other way of getting through the hateful endless years that stretch out ahead why i am only a little past seventeen and i may live to be ninety i do not see how i can ever stand this sort of thing for seventythree years mrs noble smiled in spite of herself just apply yourself to getting through this year polly dear and let the other seventytwo take care of themselves they will bring their own cares and joys and responsibilities and problems little as you realize it now this year grievous as it seems will fade by and by until you can look back at it with resignation and without tears i dont want it to fade cried polly passionately i never want to look back at it without tears i want to be faithful always i want never to forget and never to feel less sorrow than i do this minute take that bluecovered emerson on the table polly open it at the essay on compensation and read the page marked with the orange leaf the tears were streaming down pollys cheeks but she opened the book and read with a faltering voice we cannot part with our f fr friends we cannot let our angels go sob we do not see that they only go out that archangels may come in we do not believe there is any force in today to rival or recreate that beautiful yesterday sob we linger in the ruins of the old tent where once we had shelter we cannot again find aught so dear so sweet so graceful sob but we sit and weep in vain we cannot stay amid the ruins the voice of the almighty saith up and onward for evermore the sure years reveal the deep remedial force that underlies all sorrow the man or woman who would have remained a sunny garden flower with no room for its roots and too much sunshine for its head by the falling of the walls and the neglect of the gardener is made the banian of the forest yielding shade and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men illustration she opened the book and read do you see polly yes i see but oh i was so happy being a garden flower with the sunshine on my head and i cant seem to care the least little bit for being a baniantree well said mrs noble smiling through her own tears i fear that god will never insist on your yielding shade and fruit to wide neighborhoods of men unless you desire it not all sunny garden flowers become baniantrees by the falling of the walls some of them are crushed beneath the ruins and never send any more color or fragrance into the world the garden flower had happiness before the walls fell said polly it is happiness i want the baniantree had blessedness after the walls fell and it is blessedness i want but then i am fortyseven and you are seventeen sighed mrs noble as they walked through the orange orchard to the house chapter xiv edgar discourses of scarlet runners one day in the middle of october the mail brought polly two letters the first from edgar who often dashed off cheery scrawls in the hope of getting cheery replies which never came and the second from mrs bird who had a plan to propose edgar wrote i have a new boardingplace in san francisco a stones throw from mrs birds whose mansion i can look down upon from a lofty height reached by a flight of fifty wooden steps good training in athletics mrs morton is a kind landlady and the house is a home in a certain way but oh the difference to me twixt tweedledum and tweedledee there is a morton girl too but she neither plays nor sings nor jokes nor even looks in fine she is not polly i have come to the conclusion now that girls in a house are almost always nuisances i mean of course when they are not pollies oh why are you so young and so loaded with this worlds goods that you will never need me for a boarder again mrs bird is hoping to see you soon and i chose my humble lodging on this hilltop because from my attics lonely height i can watch you going in and out of your marble halls and you will almost pass my door as you take the car in view of this pleasing prospect now alas somewhat distant i send you a scrap of newspaper verse which prophesies my sentiments it is signed m e w and tom mills says whoever wrote it knows you when polly goes by t is but poorly i m lodged in a little sidestreet which is seldom disturbed by the hurry of feet for the floodtide of life long ago ebbed away from its homely old houses rainbeaten and gray and i sit with my pipe in the window and sigh at the buffets of fortune till polly goes by there s a flaunting of ribbons a flurry of lace and a rose in the bonnet above a bright face a glance from two eyes so deliriously blue the midsummer seas scarcely rival their hue and once in a while if the wind s blowing high the sound of soft laughter as polly goes by then up jumps my heart and begins to beat fast she s coming it whispers she s here she has passed while i throw up the sash and lean breathlessly down to catch the last glimpse of her vanishing gown excited delighted yet wondering why my senses desert me if polly goes by ah she must be a witch and the magical spell she has woven about me has done its work well for the morning grows brighter and gayer the air that my landlady sings as she sweeps down the stair and my poor lonely garret up close to the sky seems something like heaven when polly goes by p s tony has returned to the university he asked after the health of the sunsethaired goddess yesterday you d better hurry back and take care of me no joking aside dont worry about me little missionary i ve outgrown tony and i hope i dont need to be reformed oftener than once a year yours ever edgar p s no ii i saw you twice after you know and i was dumb on both occasions of all people in the world i ought to have been able to say something helpful to you in your trouble i who lived with you and your dear mother through all those happy months before she left us it will be just the same when i see you again i shall never be able to speak partly i suppose because i am a man or on the road to becoming one i know this is making you cry i can see the tears in your eyes across all the distance but it is better even that you should cry than that you should think me cold or unmindful of your sorrow do you know one of the sacred memories of my life it is that on that blessed night when your mother asked me to come and live under her roof she said she should be glad to feel that in any sudden emergency you and she would have a near friend to lean upon there was a royal accolade if you like i felt in an instant as if she had bestowed the order of knighthood upon me and as if i must live more worthily in order to deserve her trust how true it is polly that those who believe in us educate us do you remember dont cry dear that night by the fireside the night when we brought her out of her bedroom after three days of illness when we sat on either side of her each holding a hand while she told us the pretty romance of her meeting and loving your father i slipped the loose wedding ring up and down her finger and stole a look at her now and then she was like a girl when she told that story and i could not help thinking it was worth while to be a tender honorable faithful man to bring that look into a womans face after eighteen years well i adored her that is all i can say and i cant say even that i have to write it dont rob me polly of the right she gave me that of being a near friend to lean upon i am only afraid because you more than any one else know certain weaknesses and follies of mine and indeed pulled me out of the pit and held me up till i got a new footing i am afraid you will never have the same respect for me nor believe that a fellow so weak as i was could be strong enough to lean upon try me once polly just to humor me wont you give me something to do something hard lean just a little polly and see how stiff i ll be no bother it i wont be stiff ill be firm to tell the truth i can never imagine you as leaning though they say you are pale and sad and out of sorts with life you remind me of one of the gay scarlet runners that climb up the slender poles in the garden below my window the pole holds up the vine at first of course but the vine keeps the pole straight not in any ugly and commonplace fashion but by winding round and round about it and hanging its blossoms in and out and here and there till the poor serviceable pole is forgotten in the beauty that makes use of it goodby little scarlet runner you will bloom again some day when the storm that has beaten you down has passed over and the sky is clear and the sun warm dont laugh at me polly always yours whether you laugh or not edgar p s no iii i should nt dare add this third postscript if you were near enough to slay me with the lightning of your eye but i simply wish to mention that a wise gardener chooses young strong timber for poles saplings in fact mr john bird is too old for this purpose well seasoned he is of course and suitable as a prop for a centuryplant but not for a scarlet runner i like him you know but i m sure he d crack if you leaned on him in point of fact he s a little cracked now e n the ghost of a smile shone on pollys april face as she folded edgars letter and laid it in its envelope first came a smile then a tear then a dimple then a sob then a wave of bright color edgar is growing up so fast she thought i shall soon be afraid to scold him or advise him and what will poor robin do then poor thing upon my word if i caught him misbehaving nowadays i believe i should hesitate to remonstrate with him he will soon be capable of remonstrating with me at this rate he is a goose oh there s no shadow of doubt as to that but he s an awfully nice goose mrs birds letter ran thus my dearest pollykinswe have lived without you just about as long as we can endure it the boys have returned to school and college mr bird contemplates one more trip to honolulu and brother john and i need some one to coddle and worry over i have not spoken to you of your future because i wished to wait until you opened the subject it is too late for you to begin your professional training this year and i think you are far too delicate just now to undertake so arduous a work however you are young and that can wait for a bit as to the storytelling in the hospitals and asylums i wish you could find courage and strength to go on with that not for your own sake alone but for the sake of others as i have told you before the money is set aside for that special purpose and the work will be carried on by somebody of course i can get a substitute if you refuse and that substitute may after a little time satisfy the impatient children who flatten their noses against the windowpanes and long for mias pauline every day of their meagre lives but i fear the substitute will never be polly she may rattle round in your place as somebody said under different circumstances but she can never fill it why not spend the winter with us and do this lovely work keeping up other studies if you are strong enough it will be so sweet for you to feel that out of your own sadness you can comfort and brighten the lives of these lonely suffering children and these motherless or fatherless ones it will seem hard to begin no doubt but new life will flow in your veins when you take up your active useful work again the joyousness that god put into your soul before you were born my polly is a sacred trust you must not hide it in a napkin dear or bury it or lose it it was given to you only that you should share it with others it was intended for the world at large though it was bestowed upon you in particular come dear to one who knows all about it one whom you are sweet enough to call your fairy godmother mrs noble said polly with a sober smile the ancon sails on the th and i am going to sail with her so soon what for dear i am going to be a baniantree if you please answered polly chapter xv life in the birds nest polly settled down in the birds nest under the protecting wing of mrs bird and a very soft and unaccustomed sort of shelter it was a room had been refurnished expressly for the welcome guest and as mrs bird pushed her gently in alone the night of her arrival she said this is the pilgrim chamber polly it will speak our wishes for us it was not the room in which polly had been ill for so many weeks for mrs bird knew the power of associations and was unwilling to leave any reminder of those painful days to sadden the girls new life as polly looked about her she was almost awed by the dazzling whiteness the room was white enough for an angel she thought the straw matting was almost concealed by a mammoth rug made of white japanese goatskins sewed together the paint was like snow and the furniture had all been painted white save for the delicate silver lines that relieved it there were soft full curtains of white bunting fringed with something that looked like thistledown and the bedstead had an overhanging canopy of the same an open fire burned in the little grate and a big white and silver rattan chair was drawn cosily before it there was a girlish dressingtable with its oval mirror draped in dotted muslin a dainty writingdesk with everything convenient upon it and in one corner was a low bookcase of white satinwood on the top of this case lay a card with the best wishes of john bird and along the front of the upper shelf were painted the words come tell us a story below this there was a rich array of good things the grimms laboulaye and hans christian andersen were all there mrs ewings jackanapes and charles kingsleys waterbabies jostled the seven little sisters series hawthornes wonderbook lay close to lambs tales from shakespeare and whittiers childlife in prose and poetry stood between mary howitts childrens year and robert louis stevensons childs garden of verses polly sat upon the floor before the bookcase and gloated over her new treasures each of which bore her name on the flyleaf as her eye rose to the vase of snowy pampas plumes and the pictured madonna and child above the bookcase it wandered still higher until it met a silver motto painted on a blue frieze that finished the top of the walls where they met the ceiling polly walked slowly round the room studying the illuminated letters and they laid the pilgrim in an upper chamber and the name of the chamber was peace this brought the ready tears to pollys eyes god seems to give me everything but what i want most she thought but since he gives me so much i must not question any more i must not choose i must believe that he wants me to be happy after all and i must begin and try to be good again she did try to be good she came down to breakfast the next morning announcing to mrs bird with her grateful morning kiss that she meant to live up to her room but its going to be difficult she confessed i shall not dare to have a naughty thought in it it seems as if it would be written somewhere on the whiteness you can come and be naughty in my bachelor den polly said mr bird smiling mrs bird does nt waste any girlish frills and poetic decorations and mystical friezes on her poor brotherinlaw he is done up in muddy browns as befits his age and sex polly insisted on beginning her work the very next afternoon but she had strength only for three appointments a week and mrs bird looked doubtfully after her as she walked away from the house with a languid gait utterly unlike her old buoyant step edgar often came in the evenings as did tom and blanche mills and milly foster but though polly was cheerful and composed she seldom broke into her old flights of nonsense on other nights when they were alone she prepared for her hours of storytelling and in this she was wonderfully helped by mr birds suggestions and advice for he was a student of literature in many languages and delighted in bringing his treasures before so teachable a pupil she has a sort of genius that astonishes me said he one morning as he chatted with mrs bird over the breakfasttable polly had excused herself and stood at the farther library window gazing up the street vaguely and absently as if she saw something beyond the hills and the bay mrs birds heart sank a little as she looked at the slender figure in the black dress there were no dimples about the sad mouth and was it the dress or was she not very white these latter days so white that her hair encircled her face with absolute glory and startled one with its color it is a curious kind of gift continued mr bird glancing at his morning papers she takes a long tale of hans andersens for instance and after an hour or two when she has his idea fully in mind she shows me how she proposes to tell it to the younger children at the orphan asylum she clasps her hands over her knees bends forward toward the firelight and tells the story with such simplicity and earnestness that i am always glad she is looking the other way and cannot see the tears in my eyes i cried like a schoolgirl last night over the ugly duckling she has natural dramatic instinct a great deal of facial expression power of imitation and an almost unerring taste in the choice of words which is unusual in a girl so young and one who has been so imperfectly trained i give her an old legend or some fragment of folklore and straightway she dishes it up for me as if it had been bone of her bone and marrow of her marrow she knows just what to leave out and what to put in somehow you had one of your happy inspirations about that girl margaret she is a born storyteller she ought to wander about the country with a lute under her arm is the olivers house insured good gracious jack you have a kangaroo sort of mind how did you leap to that subject im sure i dont know but what difference does it make anyway a good deal of difference he answered nervously looking into the library yes polly had gone out because the house the furniture and the stable were burned to the ground last night so the morning paper says mrs bird rose and closed the doors that does seem too dreadful to be true she said the poor childs one bit of property her only standby in case of need oh it cant be burned and if it is it must be insured i m afraid a second blow would break her down completely just now when she has not recovered from the first mr bird went out and telegraphed to dr george edgerton is oliver house burned what was the amount of insurance if any answer john bird at four oclock the reply came house and outbuildings burned no insurance have written particulars nothing but piano and family portraits saved george edgerton in an hour another message marked collect followed the first one house burned last night defective flue no carelessness on part of servants or family piano portraits icecream freezer and washboiler saved by superhuman efforts of husband have you any instructions have taken to my bed accept love and sympathy clementine chadwick geeenwood so it was true the buildings were burned and there was no insurance i know you will say there never is in stories where the heroines courage is to be tested even if the narrator has to burn down the whole township to do it satisfactorily but to this objection i can make only this answer first that this house really did burn down secondly that there really was no insurance and thirdly if this combination of circumstances did not sometimes happen in real life it would never occur to a storyteller to introduce it as a test for heroes and heroines well said mrs bird despairingly polly must be told now will you do it or shall i of course you want me to do it men never have any courage about these things nor any tact either at this moment the subject of conversation walked into the room hat and coat on and an unwonted color in her cheeks edgar noble followed behind polly removed her hat and coat leisurely sat down on a hassock on the hearth rug and ruffled her hair with the old familiar gesture almost forgotten these latter days mrs bird looked warningly at the telltale yellow telegrams in mr birds lap and strove to catch his eye and indicate to his dull masculine intelligence the necessity of hiding them until they could devise a plan of breaking the sad news mrs birds glance and mr birds entire obliviousness were too much for pollys gravity to their astonishment she burst into a peal of laughter my lodging is on the cold cold ground and hard very hard is my fare she sang to the tune of believe me if all those endearing young charms so you know all about it too how did you hear it gasped mrs bird i bought the evening paper to see if that lost child at the asylum had been found edgar jumped on the car and seemed determined that i should not read the paper until i reached home he was very kind but slightly bungling in his attentions i knew then that something was wrong but just what was beyond my imagination unless jack howard had been expelled from harvard or bell winship had been lost at sea on the way home so i persisted in reading and at last i found the fatal item i dont know whether edgar expected me to faint at sight i m not one of the fainting sort i m relieved that you can take it so calmly i have been shivering with dread all day and jack and i have been quarreling as to which should break it to you break it to me echoed polly in superb disdain my dear fairy godmother you must think me a weak sort of person as if the burning down of one patrimonial estate could shatter my nerves what is a passing home or so let it burn by all means if it likes he that is down need fear no fall it is your only property said mr bird trying to present the other side of the case properly and it was not insured what of that she asked briskly am i not housed and fed like a princess at the present moment have i not two hundred and fifty dollars in the bank and am i not earning twentyfive dollars a month with absolute regularity avaunt cold fear how was it that the house was not insured asked mr bird i m sure i dont know it was insured once upon a time if i remember right when it got uninsured i cant tell how do things get uninsured mr bird the insurance lapses of course if the premium is nt regularly paid oh that would account for it said polly easily there were quantities of things that were nt paid regularly though they were always paid in course of time you ought to have asked me if we were insured edgar you were the boy of the house insurance is nt a girls department let me see the telegrams please they all laughed heartily over mrs greenwoods characteristic message think of husband bearing that aged icecream freezer and that leaky boiler to a place of safety exclaimed polly all that was left of them left of six hundred well my family portraits piano freezer and boiler will furnish a humble cot very nicely in my future spinster days by the way the land did nt burn up i suppose and that must be good for something is nt it rather answered edgar a corner lot on the best street in town four blocks from the new hotel site its worth eighteen hundred or two thousand dollars at least then why do you worry about me good people i m not a heroine if i were sitting on the curbstone without a roof to my head and did nt know where i should get my dinner i should cry but i smell my dinner here she sniffed pleasurably and i think it s chicken you see its so difficult for me to realize that i m a pauper living here a pampered darling in the halls of wealth with such a large income rolling up daily that i shall be a prey to fortunehunters by the time i am twenty pshaw dont worry about me this is just the sort of diet i have been accustomed to from my infancy i rather enjoy it whereupon edgar recited an impromptu nonsense verse there s a queer little maiden named polly who always knows when to be jolly when ruined by fire her spirits rise higher this most inconsistent miss polly chapter xvi the candle called patience the burning of the house completely prostrated mrs clementine churchill chadwick greenwood who it is true had the actual shock of the conflagration to upset her nervous system though she suffered no financial loss mr greenwood was heard to remark that he wished he could have foreseen that the house would burn down for now he should have to move anyway and if he had known that a few months before why here the sentence always ended mysteriously and the neighbors finished it as they liked the calamity affected polly on the other hand very much like a tonic she felt the necessity of bracing to meet the fresh responsibilities that seemed waiting for her in the near future and night and day in sleeping and waking resting and working a plan was formulating itself in the brain just roused from its six months apathy a novel astonishing enchanting revolutionary plan which she bided her time to disclose the opportunity came one evening after dinner when mrs bird and her brother edgar and herself were gathered in the library the library was a good place in which to disclose plans or ask advice or whisper confidences the great carved oak mantel held on the broad space above the blazing logs the graven motto esse quod opto the walls were lined with books from floor halfway to ceiling and from the tops of the cases plato socrates marcus aurelius and the sage of concord looked down with benignant wisdom the table in the centre was covered with a methodical litter of pamphlets and magazines and a soft light came from the fire and from two tall shaded lamps mr bird as was his wont leaned back in his leather chair puffing delicate rings of smoke into the air edgar sat by the centre table idly playing with a paperknife mrs bird sat in her low rockingchair with a bit of fancywork and polly on the hearth rug leaned cosily back against her fairy godmothers knees the clinging tendrils in pollys nature left hanging so helplessly when her mother was torn away reached out more and more to wind themselves about lovely mrs bird who notwithstanding her three manly sons had a place in her heart left sadly vacant by the loss of her only daughter polly broke one of the pleasant silences an open fire makes such delightful silences if you ever noticed when you sit in a room without it the gaps in the conversation make everybody seem dull the last comer rises with embarrassment and thinks he must be going and you wish that some one would say the next thing and keep the ball rolling the open fire arranges all these little matters with a perfect tact and grace all its own it is acknowledged to be the centre of attraction and the people gathered about it are only supernumeraries it blazes and crackles and snaps cheerily the logs break and fall the coals glow and fade and glow again and the dull man can always poke the fire if his wit desert him who ever feels like telling a precious secret over a steamheater polly looked away from everybody and gazed straight into the blaze i have been thinking over a plan for my future work she said and i want to tell it to you and see if you all approve and think me equal to it it used to come to me in flashes after this fairy godmother of mine opened an avenue for my surplus energy by sending me out as a storyteller but lately i have nt had any heart for it work grew monotonous and disagreeable and hopeless and i m afraid i had no wish to be useful or helpful to myself or to anybody else but now everything is different i am not so rich as i was i wish mr bird you would not smile so provokingly when i mention my riches and i must not be idle any longer so this is my plan i want to be a storyteller by profession perhaps you will say that nobody has ever done it but surely that is an advantage i should have the field to myself for a while at least i have dear mrs birds little poor children as a foundation now i would like to get groups of other children together in somebodys parlor twice a week and tell them stories the older children one day in the week and the younger ones another of course i have nt thought out all the details because i hoped my fairy godmother would help me there if she approved of my plan but i have ever so many afternoons all arranged and enough stories and songs at my tongues end for three months do you think it impossible or nonsensical mr bird no said he thoughtfully after a moments pause it seems on the first hearing to be perfectly feasible in fact in one sense it will not be an experiment at all you have tried your powers gained selfpossession and command of your natural resources developed your ingenuity learned the technicalities of your art so to speak already you propose now as i understand to extend your usefulness widen your sphere of action address yourself to a larger public and make a profession out of what was before only a side issue in your life its a new field and it s a noble one taken in its highest aspect as you have always taken it my motto for you polly is goethes couplet what you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it make way for the storyteller cried edgar i will buy season tickets for both your groups if you will only make your limit of age include me i am only five feet ten and i ll sit very low if you ll admit me to the charmed circle shall you have a stage name i would suggest the seraphic sapphira now dont tease said polly with dignity this is in sober earnest what do you think fairy godmother i ve written to my dear miss mary denison in santa barbara and she likes the idea i think it is charming in fact i can hardly wait to begin i will be your business manager my pollykins and we ll make it a success if it is possible if you ll take me into your confidence and tell me what you mean to do i will plan the hows and whens and wheres you see dear people continued polly it is really the only thing that i know how to do and i have had several months experience so that i m not entirely untrained i m not afraid any more so long as it is only children though the presence of one grown person makes me tonguetied grownup people never know how to listen somehow and they make you more conscious of yourself but when the children gaze up at you with their shining eyes and their parted lips the smiles just longing to be smiled and the teardrops just waiting to glisten i dont know what there is about it but it makes you wish you could go on forever and never break the spell and it makes you tremble too for fear you should say anything wrong you seem so close to children when you are telling them stories just as if a little little silken thread spun itself out from one side of your heart through each of theirs until it came back to be fastened in your own again and it holds so tight so tight when you have done your best and the children are pleased and grateful for days after this discussion polly felt as if she were dwelling on a mysterious height from which she could see all the kingdoms of the earth she said little and thought much oh that this should come to be written of polly oliver the past which she had regretted with such passionate fervor still fought for a place among present plans and future hopes but she was almost convinced in these days that a benevolent power might after all be helping her to work out her own salvation in an appointed way with occasional weariness and tears like the rest of the world it was in such a softened mood that she sat alone in church one sunday afternoon at vespers she had chosen a place where she was sure of sitting quietly by herself and where the rumble of the organ and the words of the service would come to her soothingly the late afternoon sun shone through the stainedglass windows bringing out the tender blue on the madonnas gown the white on the wings of angels and robes of newborn innocents the glow of rose and carmine with here and there a glorious gleam of tyrian purple then her eyes fell on a memorial window opposite her a mother bowed with grief was seated on some steps of roughhewn stones the glory of her hair swept about her knees her arms were empty her hands locked her head bent above stood a little child with hand just extended to open a great door which was about to unclose and admit him he reached up his hand fearlessly and that is faith thought polly and at the same time he glanced down at his weeping mother as if to say look up mother dear i am safely in just then the choir burst into a grand hymn which was new to polly and which came to her with the force of a personal message the son of god goes forth to war a kingly crown to gain his bloodred banner streams afar who follows in his train who best can drink his cup of woe triumphant over pain who patient bears his cross below he follows in his train verse after verse rang in splendid strength through the solemn aisles of the church ending with the lines o god to us may strength be given to follow in his train dr georges voice came to polly as it sounded that gray october afternoon beside the sea when the sun of ones happiness is set one lights a candle called patience and guides ones footsteps by that she leaned her head on the pew in front of her and breathed a prayer the minister was praying for the rest of the people but she needed to utter her own thought just then father in heaven i will try to follow i have lighted my little candle help me to keep it burning i shall stumble often in the darkness i know for it was all so clear when i could walk by my darling mothers light which was like the sun so bright so pure so strong help me to keep the little candle steady so that it may throw its beams farther and farther into the pathway that now looks so dim polly sank to sleep that night in her white bed in the pilgrim chamber and the name of the chamber was peace indeed for she had a smile on her lips a smile that looked as if the little candle had in truth been lighted in her soul and was shining through her face as though it were a window chapter xvii polly launches her ships there were great doings in the birds nest a hundred dainty circulars printed in black and scarlet on irish linen paper had been sent to those ladies on mrs birds callinglist who had children between the ages of five and twelve that being pollys chosen limit of age these notes of invitation read as follows come tell us a story the childrens hour mrs donald bird requests the pleasure of your company from to oclock on mondays or thursdays from november to march inclusive first group mondays children from to years second group thursdays years each group limited in number to twentyfour miss pauline oliver will tell stories suitable to the ages of the children adapted to their prevailing interests and appropriate to the special months of the year these stories will be chosen with the greatest care and will embrace representative tales of all classes narrative realistic scientific imaginative and historical they will be illustrated by songs and blackboard sketches terms for the series twenty hours five dollars rsvp polly felt an absolute sense of suffocation as she saw mrs bird seal and address the last square envelope if anybody does come she said somewhat sadly i am afraid it will be only that the story hour is at your lovely house dont be so foolishly independent my child if i gather the groups it is only you who will be able to hold them together i am your manager and it is my duty to make the accessories as perfect as possible when the scenery and costumes and stagesettings are complete you enter and do the real work i retire and the sole responsibility for success or failure rests upon your shoulders i should think that would be enough to satisfy the most energetic young woman i had decided on the library as the scene of action an open fire is indispensable and that room is delightfully large when the centretable is lifted out but i am afraid it is hardly secluded enough and that people might trouble you by coming in so what do you think of the musicroom upstairs you will have your fire your piano plenty of space and a private entrance for the chicks who can lay their wraps in the hall as they pass up i will take the large turkish rug from the red guestchamber that will make the room look warmer and i have a dozen other charming devices which i will give you later as surprises if i were half as sure of my part as i am of yours dear fairy godmother we should have nothing to fear i have a general plan mapped out for the stories but a great deal of the work will have to be done from week to week as i go on i shall use the same programme in the main for both groups but i shall simplify everything and illustrate more freely for the little ones telling the historical and scientific stories with much more detail to the older group this is what mr bird calls my basic idea which will be filled out from week to week according to inspiration for november i shall make autumn the harvest and thanksgiving the startingpoint i am all ready with my historical story of the first thanksgiving for i told it at the childrens hospital last year and it went beautifully i have one doll dressed in dutch costume to show how the children looked that the little pilgrims played with in holland and another dressed like a puritan maiden to show them the simple old new england gown then i have two fine pictures of miles standish and the indian chief massasoit for december and january i shall have christmas and winter and frost and ice and snow with the contrasts of eastern and californian climates i can get the immigration bureau to give you a percentage on that story polly said uncle jack bird who had strolled in and taken a seat just make your facts strong enough and you can make a handsome thing out of that idea dont interrupt us jack said mrs bird and go directly out if you please you were not asked to this party where was i continued polly oh yes the contrast between californian and eastern winters and january will have a moral story or two you know new years resolutions and all that february will be full of sentiment and patriotism st valentines day and washingtons birthday i can hardly wait for that there are so many lovely things to do in that month march will bring in the first hint of spring the winds will serve for my science story and as it chances to be a presidential year we will celebrate inauguration day and have some history if a good many subscribers come in why do you say if polly multitudes of names are coming in i have told you so from the beginning very well then when a sufficient number of names are entered i should like to spend ten dollars on a very large sandtable which i can use with the younger group for illustrations it is perfectly clean work and i have helped miss denison and her children to do the loveliest things with it she makes geography lessons plains hills mountains valleys rivers and lakes or the children make a picture of the story they have just heard i saw them do over the river and through the wood to grandfathers house we go washingtons winter camp at valley forge and the midnight ride of paul revere i have ever so many songs chosen and those for november and december are almost learned without my notes i shall have to work very hard to be ready twice a week too hard i fear said mrs bird anxiously oh no not a bit too hard if the children are only interested i shall not mind any amount of trouble by the way dear mrs bird you wont let the nurses or mothers stand in the doorways you will please see that i am left quite alone with the children wont you certainly no mothers shall be admitted if they make you nervous it is the childrens hour but after two or three months when you have all become acquainted and the children are accustomed to listening attentively i almost hope you will allow a few nurses to come in and sit in the corners the ones who bring the youngest children for example it would be such a means of education to them there s another idea for you next year a nurses class in storytelling it would be rather nice would nt it and i should be older then and more experienced i really think i could do it if miss denison would help me by talks and instructions she will be here next year oh how the little plan broadens out and polly you have chosen to pay for your circulars and propose to buy your sandtable this i agree to if you insist upon it though why i shouldnt help my godchild i cannot quite understand but knowing you were so absorbed in other matters that you would forget the frivolities and remembering that you have been wearing the same two dresses for months i have ventured to get you some pretty gowns for the story hours and i want you to accept them for your christmas present they will serve for all your afternoons and for our home dinners as you will not be going out anywhere this winter oh how kind you are mrs bird you load me with benefits and how can i ever repay you you do not have to repay them to me necessarily my child you can pass them over as you will be constantly doing to all these groups of children day after day i am a sort of stupid rich old lady who serves as a source of supply my chief brilliancy lies in devising original methods of getting rid of my surplus in all sorts of odd and delightful ways left untried for the most part by other people i ve been buying up splendid old trees in the outskirts of certain new england country towns trees that were in danger of being cut down for wood twentyfive to forty dollars buys a glorious tree and it is safe for ever and ever to give shade to the tired traveler and beauty to the landscape each of my boys has his pet odd scheme for helping the world to go right donald for instance puts stamps on the unstamped letters displayed in the cambridge postoffice and sends them spinning on their way he never receives the thanks of the careless writers but he takes pleasure in making things straight paul writes me from phillips academy that this year he is sending the nine ruggles children a poor family of our acquaintance to some sort of entertainment once every month hugh has just met a lovely girl who has induced him to help her maintain a boarding establishment for sick and deserted cats and dogs and there we are but i m a young strong girl and i fear i m not so worthy an object of charity as a tree an unstamped letter an infant ruggles or a deserted cat still i know the dresses will be lovely and i had quite forgotten that i must be clothed in purple and fine linen for five months to come it would have been one of my first thoughts last year i am afraid but lately this black dress has shut everything else from my sight it was my thought that you should give up your black dress just for these occasions dear and wear something more cheerful for the childrens sake the dresses are very simple for i ve heard you say you can never tell a story when you are dressed up but they will please you i know they will be brought home this evening and you must slip them all on and show yourself to us in each they would have pleased anybody even a princess polly thought as she stood before her bed that evening patting the four pretty new waists and smoothing with childlike delight the folds of the four pretty skirts it was such an odd sensation to have four dresses at a time they were of simple and inexpensive materials as was appropriate but mrs birds exquisite taste and feeling for what would suit pollys personality made them more attractive than if they had been rich or expensive there was a white china silk with belt and shoulderknots of black velvet a white japanese crepe with purple lilacs strewed over its surface and frills of violet ribbon for ornament a christmas dress of soft white camels hair with bands of whitefox fur round the slightly pointed neck and elbowsleeves and last of all a quaker gown of silvergray nuns cloth with a surplice and full undersleeves of white crкpelisse i m going to be vain mrs bird cried polly with compunction in her voice i ve never had a real beautiful undyed unmadeover dress in my whole life and i shall never have strength of character to own four at once without being vain this speech was uttered through the crack of the library door outside of which polly stood gathering courage to walk in and be criticised think of your aspiring nose sapphira came from a voice within oh are you there too edgar of course i am and so is tom mills the news that you are going to try on is all over the neighborhood if you have cruelly fixed the age limit so that we cant possibly get in to the performances we are going to attend all the dress rehearsals oh ye little fishes what a seraphic sapphira i wish tony were here she was pretty there was no doubt about it as she turned around like a revolving wax figure in a showwindow and assumed absurd fashionplate attitudes and pretty chiefly because of the sparkle intelligence sunny temper and vitality that made her so magnetic nobody could decide which was the loveliest dress even when she had appeared in each one twice in the lilac and white crepe with a bunch of dark parma violets thrust in her corsage uncle jack called her a poem edgar asserted openly that in the christmas toilet he should like to have her modeled in wax and put in a glass case on his table but mrs bird and tom mills voted for the quaker gray in which she made herself inexpressibly demure by braiding her hair in two discreet braids down her back the dress rehearsal is over goodnight all she said as she took her candle i will say handsome is as handsome does fifty times before i go to sleep and perhaps i only say perhaps i may be used to my beautiful clothes in a week or two so that i shall be my usual modest self again goodnight polly said the boys we will see you tomorrow pauline if you please not polly i ceased to be polly this morning when the circulars were posted i am now miss pauline oliver storyteller by profession chapter xviii the childrens hour reported in a letter by an eyewitness it was the last monday in march and i had come in from my country home to see if i could find my old school friend margaret crosby who is now mrs donald bird and who is spending a few years in california the directory gave me her address and i soon found myself on the corner of two beautiful streets and before a very large and elegant house this did not surprise me as i knew her husband to be a very wealthy man there seemed to be various entrances for the house stood with its side to the main street but when i had at last selected a bell to ring i became convinced that i had not after all gone to the front door it was too late to retreat however and very soon the door was opened by a pretty maidservant in a white cap and apron you need nt have rung m they goes right in without ringing today she said pleasantly can i see mrs bird i asked well m she said hesitatingly she s in paradise lovely margaret crosby dead how sudden it must have been i thought growing pale with the shock of the surprise but the pretty maid noticing that something had ruffled my equanimity went on hastily excuse me m i forgot you might be a stranger but the nurses and mothers always comes to this door and we re all a bit flustered on account of its bein miss paulines last afternoon and the mothers call the musicroom paradise m and mr john and the rest of us have took it up without thinkin very much how it might sound to strangers oh i see i said mechanically though i did nt see in the least but although the complicated explanation threw very little light on general topics it did have the saving grace of assuring me that margaret bird was living could you call her out for a few minutes i asked i am an old friend and shall be disappointed not to see her i m sorry m but i could nt possibly call her out it would be as much as my place is worth her strict orders is that nobody once inside of paradise door shall be called out that does seem reasonable i thought to myself but she continued mrs bird told me to let young mr noble up the stairs so t he could peek in the door and as you re an old friend i hev nt no objections to your goin up softly and peekin in with him till miss pauline s through it wont be long m my curiosity was aroused by this time and i came to the conclusion that peekin in the door of paradise with young mr noble would be better than nothing so up i went like a thief in the night the room was at the head of the stairs and one of the doors was open and had a heavy portiere hanging across it behind this was young mr noble peekin most greedily together with a middleaged gentleman not described by the voluble parlor maid they did nt seem to notice me they were otherwise occupied or perhaps they thought me one of the nurses or mothers i had heard the sound of a piano as i crossed the hall but it was still now i crept behind young mr noble and took a good peek into paradise it was a very large apartment one that looked as if it might have been built for a ballroom at least there was a wide cushioned bench running around three sides of it close to the wall on one side behind some black and gold japanese screens where they could hear and not be seen sat a row of silent capped and aproned nursemaids and bonneted mammas mrs bird was among them lovely and serene as an angel still though she has had her troubles there was a great fireplace in the room but it was banked up with purple and white lilacs there was a bowl of the same flowers on the grand piano and a clump of bushes sketched in chalk on a blackboard just then a lovely young girl walked from the piano and took a low chair in front of the fireplace before her there were grouped ever so many children twentyfive or thirty perhaps the tots in the front rows were cosy and comfortable on piles of cushions and the seven or eight year olds in the back row were in seats a little higher each child had a sprig of lilac in its hand the young girl wore a soft white dress with lavender flowers scattered all over it and a great bunch of the flowers in her belt she was a lovely creature at least i believe she was i have an indistinct remembrance that her enemies if she has any might call her hair red but i could nt stop looking at her long enough at the time to decide precisely what color it was and i believe now that several days have passed that her nose turned up but at the moment whenever i tried to see just how much it wandered from the grecian outline her eyes dazzled me and i never found out as she seated herself in their midst the children turned their faces expectantly toward her like flowers toward the sun you know it s the last monday dears she said and we ve had our goodby story tell it again sing it again came from two kilted adorers in the back row not today and she shook her head with a smile you know we always stop within the hour and that is the reason we are always eager to come again but this sprig of lilac that you all hold in your hands has something to tell not a long story just a piece of one for another goodby i think when we go home it we all press the flowers in heavy books and open the books sometimes while we are away from each other this summer that the sweet fragrance will come to us again and the faded blossom will tell its own story to each one of us and this is the story she said as she turned her spray of lilac in her fingers there was once a little lilacbush that grew by a childs window there was no garden there only a tiny bit of ground with a few green things in it and because there were no trees in the crowded streets the birds perched on the lilacbush to sing and two of them even built a nest in it once for want of something larger it had been a very busy lilacbush all its life drinking up moisture from the earth and making it into sap adding each year a tiny bit of wood to its slender trunk filling out its leafbuds making its leaves larger and larger and then oh happy happy time hanging purple flowers here and there among its branches it always felt glad of its hard work when hester came to gather some of its flowers just before easter sunday for one spray went to the table where hester and her mother ate together one to hesters teacher one to the gray stone church around the corner and one to a little lame girl who sat and sat quite still day after day by the window of the next house but one year this very last year children the lilacbush grew tired of being good and working hard and the more it thought about it the sadder and sorrier and more discouraged it grew the winter had been dark and rainy the ground was so wet that its roots felt slippery and uncomfortable there was some disagreeable moss growing on its smooth branches the sun almost never shone the birds came but seldom and at last the lilacbush said i will give up i am not going to bud or bloom or do a single thing for easter this year i dont care if my trunk does nt grow nor my buds swell nor my leaves grow larger if hester wants her room shaded she can pull the curtain down and the lame girl can do without it was going to say but it did nt dare oh it did nt dare to think of the poor little lame girl without any comforting flowers so it stopped short and hung its head six or eight weeks ago hester and her mother went out one morning to see the lilacbush it does nt look at all as it ought said hester shaking her head sadly the buds are very few and they are all shrunken see how limp and flabby the stems of the leaves look perhaps it is dead said hesters mother or perhaps it is too old to bloom i like that thought the lilacbush i m not dead and i m not dying though i d just as lief die as to keep on working in this dark damp unpleasant winter or spring or whatever they call it and as for being past blooming i would just like to show her if it was nt so much trouble how old does she think i am i wonder there is nt a thing in this part of the city that is over ten years old and i was nt planted first by any means and then hester said my darling darling lilacbush easter wont be easter without it and lame jenny leans out of her window every day as i come from school and asks is the lilac budding oh dear sighed the little bush i wish she would nt talk that way it makes me so nervous to have jenny asking questions about me it starts my sap circulating and i shall grow in spite of me let us see what we can do to help it said hesters mother take your trowel and dig round the roots first they ll find a moist and sticky place and be better able to sympathize with me thought the lilac then put in some new earth the richest you can get and we ll snip off all the withered leaves and dry twigs and see if it wont take a new start i shall have to i believe whether i like it or not if they make such a fuss about me thought the lilacbush it seems a pity if a thing cant stop growing and be let alone and die if it wants to but though it grumbled a trifle at first it felt so much better after hester and her mother had spent the afternoon caring for it that it began to grow a little just out of gratitude and what do you think happened george washington came and chopped it down with his little hatchet said an eager person in front the lame girl came to look at it sang out a small chap in the back row no the young girl answered with an irrepressible smile it was a cherrytree that george washington chopped lucy and i told you horatio that the poor lame girl could nt walk a step but the sun began to shine that is the first thing that happened day after day the sun shone because everything seems to help the people and the things that help themselves the rich earth gave everything it had to give for sap and the warm air dried up the ugly moss that spoiled the beauty of its trunk then the lilacbush was glad again and it could hardly grow fast enough because it knew it would be behind time at any rate for of course it could nt stand still grumbling and doing nothing for weeks and get its work done as soon as the other plants but it made sap all clay long and the buds grew into tiny leaves and the leaves into larger ones and then it began to group its flowerbuds among the branches by this time it was the week before easter and it fairly sat up nights to work hester knew that it was going to be more beautiful than it ever was in its life before that was because it had never tried so hard though of course hester could nt know that but she was only afraid that it would nt bloom soon enough it was so very late this spring but the very morning before easter sunday hester turned in her sleep and dreamed that a sweet sweet fragrance was stealing in at her open window a few minutes later she ran across her room and lo every cluster of buds on the lilacbush had opened into purple flowers and they were waving in the morning sunshine as if to say we are ready hester we are ready after all and one spray was pinned in the teachers dress it was shabby and black and she was glad of the flower because it reminded her of home and one spray stood in a vase on hesters diningtable there was never very much dinner in hesters house but they did not care that day because the lilac was so beautiful one bunch lay on the table in the church and one the loveliest of all stood in a cup of water on the lame girls windowsill and when she went to bed that night she moved it to the table beside her head and put her thin hand out to touch it in the dark and went to sleep smiling and each of the lilac flowers was glad that the bush had bloomed the children drew a deep breath they smoothed their flowersprays gently and one pale boy held his up to his cheek as if it had been a living thing tell it again cried the tomboy is it true asked the boy in kilts i think it is said the girl gently of course tommy the flowers never tell us their secrets in words but i have watched that lilacbush all through the winter and spring and these are the very blossoms you are holding today it seems true doesnt it yes they said thoughtfully shall you press yours miss polly and will it tell you a story too when you look at it asked one little tot as they all crowded about her for a goodby kiss miss polly caught her up in her arms and i saw her take the childs apron and wipe away a tear as she said yes dear it will tell me a story too a long sad sweet helpful story
