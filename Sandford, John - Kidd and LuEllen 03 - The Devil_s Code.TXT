the devils code john sandford chapter st john corbeil a beautiful fall night in glen burnie a thursday autumn leaves kicking along the streets a bicycle with a flickering headlamp a dog running alongside a sense of quiet a good night for a cashmere sportcoat or small black pearls at an intimate restaurant down in the district maybe white notre damestyle tapers and a rich controversial senator eating trout with a pretty woman not his wife like that terrence lighter would have none of it not tonight anyway tonight he was on his own walking back from a bookstore with a copy of smartmoney in his hand and a pornographic videotape in his jacket pocket he whistled as he walked his wife april was back in michigan visiting her mother and he had a twelvepack of beer in the refrigerator and a bag of bluecorn nachos on the kitchen counter and the tape the way he saw it was this hed get back to the house pop a beer stick the tape in the vcr spend a little time with himself and then switch over to thursday night football at halftime hed call april about the garden fertilizer he could never remember the numbers or or whatever then hed catch the second half of the game and after the final gun hed be ready for the tape again an unhappy thought crossed his mind dallas what they hell were they doing out in dallas with those recon photos whered they dig those up howd that geek get his hands on them something to be settled next week he hadnt heard back from dallas and if he hadnt heard by monday afternoon hed memo the deputy director just to cover his ass that was for next week tonight he had the tape the beer and the nachos not a bad night for a fiftythreeyearold highranking bureaucrat with a sexually distant wife not bad at all lighter was a block and a half from his home when a man stepped out of a lilac bush beside a darkened house he was dressed all in black and lighter didnt see him until the last minute the man said nothing at all but his arm was swinging up lighters last living thought was a question gun a silenced mm the man fired once into lighters head and the impact twisted the bureaucrat to his right he took one dead step onto the grass swale and was down the man fired another shot into the back of the dead mans skull then felt beneath his coat for a wallet found it felt the videotape and took that too he left the body where it had fallen and ran athletically lightly across the lawn past the lilac to the back lot line and along the edge of a flower garden to the street he ran a hundred fifty yards quiet in his running shoes invisible in his black jogging suit hed worked out the route during the afternoon spotting fences and dogs and stone walls a second man was waiting in the car on a quiet corner the shooter ran up to the corner slowed then walked around it if anyone had been coming up the street they wouldnt have seen him running as they rolled away the second man asked everything all right went perfect the shooter dug through the dead mans wallet we even got four hundred bucks and a fuck flick they were out again the next night this time the target was an aging s rambler in the workingclass duplex lands southwest of dallas a twoyearold porsche boxster was parked in the circular driveway in front of the house lights shone from a back window and a lamp with a yellow shade was visible through a crack in the drapes of the big front window the thin odor of bratwurst was in the aira backyard barbecue maybe at a house further down the block kids were playing in the streets a block or two over their screams and shouts small and contained by the distance like static on an old vinyl disk the two men cut across a lawn as dry as shredded wheat and stepped up on the concrete slab that served as a porch the taller of the two touched the pistol that hung from his shoulder holster he tried the front door locked he looked at the shorter man who shrugged leaned forward and pushed the doorbell john james morrison was the same age as the men outside his door but thinner taller without the easy coordination a gawky bespectacled ichabod crane with a fine white smile and a strange ability to draw affection from women he lived on cinnamonflavored candies called hot tamales and diet coke with pepperoni pizza for protein he sometimes shook with the rush of sugar and caffeine and he liked it the men outside his door stressed exercise and drug therapy mixed creatine with androstenedione and vitamins e c b and a the closest morrison got to exercise was a habitual onefooted twirl in his thousanddollar herman miller aeron office chair which he took with him on his crosscountry consulting trips morrison and the chair rolled through a shambles of perforated widecarriage printer paper and diet coke cans in the smaller of the ramblers two bedrooms a rancid threedayold dominos box stinking of pepperoni and soured cheese was jammed into an overflowing trash can next to the desk hed do something about the trash later right now he didnt have the time morrison peered into the flat bluewhite glow of the computer screen struggling with the numbers checking and rechecking code an optimus transportable stereo sat on the floor in the corner with a stack of cds on top of the right speaker morrison pushed himself out of his chair and bent over the cds looked for something he wouldnt have to think about he came up with a harry connick jr disk and dropped it in the changer love is here to stay burbled from the speakers and morrison took a turn around in the chair did a little dance step maybe another hit of caffeine the doorbell rang eleven oclock at night and morrison had no good friends in dallas nobody to come calling late he took another two steps to the office door and looked sideways across the front room through a crack in the front drapes he could see the front porch one or two men their bulk visible in the lamplight he couldnt see their faces but he recognized the bulk oh shit he stepped back into the office clicked on a computer file and dragged it to a box labeled shredder he clicked shred waited until the confirmation box came up clicked yes im sure the shredder was set to the highest level if the file was completely shredded it couldnt be recovered but that would take time he had to make some he killed the monitors but let the computer run he picked up his laptop turned off the lights in the office and pulled the door most of the way closed leaving a crack of an inch or two so they could see the room was dark maybe they wouldnt go in right away and the shredder would have more time to grind the laptop he earned into the kitchen turning it on as he walked he propped it open on the kitchen counter and pulled a stool in front of it the doorbell rang again and he hurried out the door and called just a minute he looked back in the computer room just a glance and could see the light blinking on the hard drive he was shredding only one gigabyte of the twenty that he had still it would take time he was out of it the man outside was pounding on the door he headed back through the house snapped on the living room overhead lights to let them know he was coming looked out through the drapesanother ten seconds goneand unlocked the front door had to get my pants on he said to the two men on the stoop whats up they brought morrison into the building through the back up a freight elevator through a heavily alarmed lockout room at the top and into the main security area corbeil was waiting st john corbeil was a hard man in his early forties his squarecut face seamed with stress and sun and wind his blue eyes were small intelligent and deeply set beneath his brow ridge his nose and lips narrow hawklike he wore a tight military haircut with just a hint of a fifties flattop mr morrison he said i have a tape i want you to listen to morrison was nervous but not yet frightened thered been a couple of threats back at the house but not of violence if he didnt come with them theyd said he would be dismissed on the spot and ammath would sue him for violating company security policies industrial espionage and theft of trade secrets he wouldnt work for a serious company again they told him the threats resonated if they fired him and sued him nobody would hire him again trust was allimportant when a company gave a man root in its computer system when you were that deep in the computers everything was laid bare everything on the other hand if he could talk with them maybe he could deal he might lose this job but they wouldnt be suing him they wouldnt go public so he went with them he and the escort drove in his carso we dont have to drag your ass all the way back here the security guy saidwhile the second security agent said hed be following he hadnt yet shown up so morrison stood nervously shoulders slumped like a peasant dragged before the king as corbeil pushed an audiotape into a tape recorder he recognized the voice terrence lighter john what the hell are you guys doing out there this geek shows up on my doorstep shit they had him he decided to tough it out i came across what i thought was anomalous worknothing to do with clipper but it was obviously top secret and the way it was being handled it shouldnt have been handled that way morrison told corbeil he was standing like a petitioner while corbeil sat in a terminal chair when i was working at the jet propulsion laboratory i was told that if i ever found an anomaly like that i should report it at least two levels up so that it couldnt be hidden and so that security problems could be fixed so you went to lighter i didnt think i had a choice and you should remember that i did talk to lighter morrison said now i think we should give the fbi a ring see what they say you silly cunt corbeil slipped a cell phone from a suit pocket punched a button waited a few seconds then asked anything apparently not he said okay drop the disks were gonna go ahead on this end corbeils security agent whod been waiting patiently near the door looked at his watch and said if were gonna do it we better get it done goodies gonna be starting up here in the next fifteen minutes and i gotta run around the building and get in place corbeil gave morrison a long look and morrison said what corbeil shook his head got up stepped over to the security agent and said let me the agent slipped out his smith and handed it to corbeil who turned and pointed it at morrison you better tell us what you did with the data or youre gonna get your ass hurt real bad he said quietly dont point the gun at me dont point the gun morrison said corbeil could feel the blood surging into his heart hed always liked this part hed shot the iraqi colonels and a few other ragheads and deer and antelope and elk and javelina and moose and three kinds of bear and groundhogs and prairie dogs and more birds than he could count and it all felt pretty good he shot morrison twice in the chest morrison didnt gape in surprise stagger slap a hand to his wounds or open his eyes wide in amazement he simply fell down christ my ears are ringing corbeil said to the security agent he didnt mention the sudden erection wasnt much he said nothing like iraq but his hand was trembling when he passed over the gun the agent had seen it before hunting on the ranch lets get the other shot done the agent said yes they got the from a desk drawer wrapped morrisons dead hand around it and fired it once into a stack of newspapers so you better get going corbeil said ill dump the newspapers ill be to goodies right thats your left the agent said i know that corbeil said impatiently well jesus dont forget it the agent said i wont forget it corbeil snapped sorry but remember remember ill be to your left and you gotta reload now and take the used shell with you ill remember it all william this is my life as much as it is yours okay the agents eyes drifted toward the crumbled form of morrison what a schmuck we had no choice it was a milliontoone that hed find that stuff corbeil said he glanced at his watch you better move larry goodie hitched up his gun belt sighed and headed for the elevators as he did the alarm buzzed on the employees door and he turned to see william hart checking through with his key card asshole goodie said to himself he continued toward the elevators but slower now only one elevator ran at night and hart would probably want a ride to the top as hart came through goodie pushed the elevator button and found a smile for the security man hows it going larry hart asked slow night goodie said thats how its supposed to be isnt it hart asked spose goodie said when was the last time you had a fast night goodie knew he was being hazed and he didnt like it the guys from trenddirect were fine the people with ammath the people from upstairs were assholes most of em are a little slow he admitted had some trouble with the card reader that one time everybody coming and going the elevator bell dinged at the tenth floor and they both got off goodie turned left and hart turned right toward his office then hart touched goodies sleeve and said larry was that lock like that goodie followed harts gaze something wrong with the lock on gerald r kinds office he stepped closer and looked somebody had used a prybar on the door no i dont believe it was i was up here an hour ago goodie said he turned and looked down the hall the lights in the security area were out the security area was normally lit twentyfour hours a day we better check hart said dropping his voice hart eased open the office door and goodie saw that another door on the other side stood open quiet hart whispered he led the way through the door and out the other side into a corridor that led to the secure area the door at the end of the hall was open and the secure area beyond it was dark look at that screen hart whispered as they slipped down the hall a computer screen had a peculiar glow to it as if it had just been shut down i think theres somebody in there ill get the lights goodie whispered back his heart was thumping nothing like this had ever happened better arm yourself hart said hart slipped an automatic pistol out of a belt holster and goodie gulped and fumbled out his own revolver hed never actually drawn it before ready hart asked maybe we ought to call the cops goodie whispered just get the lights hart whispered he barely breathed the words at the other man just reach through the switch is right inside goodie got to the door frame reached inside with one hand and somebody screamed at him no goodie jerked around and saw a ghostly oval a face and then wham the flash blinded him and he felt as though hed been hit in the ribs with a ball bat he went down backwards and saw the flashes from harts weapon straight over his head wham wham wham wham goodie didnt count the shots but his whole world seemed to consist of noise then the back of his head hit the carpet and his mouth opened and he groaned and his body was on fire he lay there not stirring until harts face appeared in his line of vision hold on larry goddamnit hold on im calling an ambulance hold on chapter the canadian winter arrived on friday morning bleak thomas and i had been fishing lateseason northern pike along the english river sunny days and cold crisp nights the bugs knocked down by the frost pushing our luck down a lingering ontario autumn the bad weather came in overnight wed gotten up to a hazy sunshine but by nine oclock a dark wedge of cloud was piling in from the northwest we could smell the cold it wasnt a scent exactly but had something to do with the sense of smell you turn your face to it and your nose twitches and you think winter the bad weather was no surprise wed seen it on satellite pictures forming up as a lowpressure system in the arctic before we left the floatplane base five days earlierbut waiting for the plane on the last morning looking at our watches as we listened for the noisy singleengine cessna with nickelsized snowflakes drifting in from the northwest maybe we began to wonder what would happen if the plane had gone down and if thered been a mixup and the people at the base thought wed gone down with it winter was long in northwest ontario and bleak thomas probably wouldnt taste that good bleak might have been thinking along the same lines with a change of menu when the cessna turned the corner at the end of the lake like a silver wink and the roar of the aircraft engine rolled across the water bleak said only an hour late really i thought he was a little early i yawned and stretched sure bleak said thats why you chewed your fingernails down to your armpits the pilot was in a hurry he taxied up to the rickety dock pushed along by a gust of snow bleak and i threw our gear onboard and we were gone bouncing across the whitecaps and into the air the pilot didnt bother to check that the boats had been rolled or that the fire was dead in the potbellied stove he took our word for it ten minutes after takeoff we broke out of the snow and he said good i always land better when i can find the lake then to me you got some woman calling about every ten minutes yeah did she say what her name was i was thinking luellen because she was the only woman i knew who might want to get in touch in a hurry but the pilot said lane ward i shook my head dont know her well she knows you and shes hot to talk the pilot said we were halfshouting over the noisy clatter of the engine she didnt say what about she says shes traveling and doesnt have a callback number he didnt have much to say after that we all concentrated on the lakes and canyons flicking by eight hundred feet below in three weeks the pilot would need skis to land a few miles out of the base as the pilot slipped the plane sideways to line up with the long axis of the lake bleak leaned forward from the backseat and said we were getting a little worried about you back there had a little trouble with the plane getting off this morning the pilot said i was warming her up and the prop come off we both looked out at the prop and then over at the pilot he just barely grinned and said that joke was old when pontius was a pilot the pilots wifes name was moony she was a leftover hippie with a toothy grin paisley shifts and a little weed growing in the window box after thirty years of cooking for flyin fishermen she still couldnt put together a decent meal clients would take her flapjacks down to the lake and skip them off the water like rocks when they sank the fish wouldnt touch them moony offered to throw together a quick lunch but we hastily declined jumped in the rented station wagon and drove down to kenora six hours later we were walking up the stairs at the localcarrier ramp at minneapolisst paul international i been on worse trips i guess bleak said his way of saying hed had a good time bleak was a furniture maker who got a thousand dollars for a chair and fifteen thousand for one of his handcarved tenplace craftsmanstyle walnut dining sets he gave most of the money away through the lutheran social services bleak believed that craftsmen who got rich got soft a sentiment i didnt share not that he was a religious fanatic he was on his fifth wife and all five of them had been excellent women and as we walked up the stairs into the terminal he spotted a darkhaired woman standing at the top and said quietly look at the ass on this one kidd jesus bleak you cant talk like that in minnesota i muttered and looked intended purely as a compliment thomas said under his breath the woman turned and was looking us over as we climbed the steps taking in the duffels and gear bags and rod tubes she checked bleak for a minute the way a lot of women check bleakhe had long black hair and was bronzed like an indian guidethen her eyes drifted back to me as we crossed the top of the steps she asked are you kidd i am i said im lane ward she looked like her father might have been mexican she had the black hair and matching eyes and the round face but she was pale like an irishwoman she stuck out her hand and i shook it and picked up the faintest scent something light flowery french im jack morrisons sister jack i said how is he hes dead she said he was shot to death a week ago today that stopped me i looked at bleak and he said yow the parking garage at minneapolisst paul international airport is under permanent reconstruction a running joke perpetrated by the metropolitan airports commission since parking is impossible wed all taken taxis in bleak would take a cab down south of the cities to his workshop and lane and i got a cab to my place in st paul howd you know i was kiddthat bleak wasnt me i asked as we waited for a cab to come up you looked more like a criminal she said thanks but im an artist oh bullshit i know about anshiser she said i know what you and jack did that she knew about anshiser was disturbing anshiser had been a rough operation which in the end had taken down a major aircraft corporation if id known jack would tell her about it i wouldnt have worked with jack but then that might not be realistic all kinds of people knew a little bit about what i did they just didnt know each other so they could compare notes you think i look like a criminal you look tougher than your friend with your nose hell ive always thought i was a goodlooking guy fortysomething six feet and a bit hardly any white in my hair and i still have all of it the nose i admit had been broken a couple of times and never gotten quite straight i thought it lent my face a certain charm its part of my charm i said wounded as the cab came up i held the back door for her jack said you can be charming if you wanted to be he said you didnt want to be that often she got in the cab and i slid in beside her what happened to jack i asked lets wait until we get over to your place she said her eyes going to the back of the drivers head though winter was on the way for the moment it was still in ontario st pauls trees were shedding their leaves but the temperature was in the sixties as we crossed the mississippi and headed down west seventh street into st paul lane was quiet checking out the local color most notably a cigarchewing guy humping along slowly on an ancient honda dream he was wearing knee shorts and black dress socks sophisticated place for a midwestern capital city she said yeah were blessed with individualism i said we spent the rest of the ride in idle chitchat and i sort of took her in physically she was pretty with a good figure but a figure that came from a careful diet rather than exercise a magazinemodels figure not an athletes she had an undergraduate degree from berkeley in philosophy and mathematics and a couple of graduate degrees in computer science from stanford she now lived in palo alto and divided her time between an internet startup and teaching at stanford the startup called eaccountant would provide billing collection accounting and tax services to web sites too small to efficiently do it on their own she expected to get modestly rich from it she was no longer married to the guy named ward he always said he wanted children but he always wanted one more thing first she said a car or a boat or a house or a vacation place i told him that i couldnt wait any longer and if he didnt want to start on a kid i was going to pull the plug even then he couldnt decide so you pulled the plug uhhuh any candidates for the eventual fatherhood i asked yes a very nice man at stanford an anthropologist hes working on his own divorce ah were you involved in his problem no he doesnt even know hes a candidate for the new position she said although he should be getting that idea pretty soon now hell be an excellent father i think good for him i said the cab drivers eyes came up in the rearview mirror and i caught him smiling pretty women are easily amusing im not sure how glad your heart should be when you arrive home in a taxicab with the grieving sister of a friend whod just been shot to death but when the cab dropped us i was happy always happy to head up north always happy to get back the water gives you ideas and if youre up there long enough you develop an irresistible urge to work to get the ideas on paper bleak was the same way leave him in a cabin long enough and hell start improving the furniture with his pocket knife and things were going on around home we had to walk up five flights of stairs because the elevator was jammed full of alice becks stoneware and porcelain pieces which she was moving out for a show alice yelled down the atrium sorry kidd well be out in ten minutes we traipsed on up the stairs me with the duffel and rod tubes lane carrying the tackle bag we stopped on the third floor for a moment so lane could look at some of alices vases she liked them and alice invited us to the opening two days away lane shook her head id love to but weve got a funeral to go to she said and we continued on up at the next flight she looked down and said quietly beautiful stuff and i nodded and said people say shes as good as lucie rie but im afraid shes gonna burn the building down some day shes got a marathon gas kiln in her back room i can hear it roaring away at night that whooshing sound like the cremation of sam mcgee is that legal the cremation of sam mcgee no stupid the kiln i doubt it i said have you complained nah i helped her carry it up home and the cat was in he was sitting on the back of the couch looking out at the mississippi a red tigerstripe with a head the size of a general electric steam iron he didnt bother to hop down when i came in in fact he pretended not to notice an old lady artist downstairs a painter kept him fed for me while i was gone and he had his own flap so he didnt need a cat pan except in deepest winter hey cat i said he looked awaybut hed come creeping around about bedtime looking for a scratch he looks like you lane said who the cat thanks i supposed that could be a flattering comment on the other hand the cat was pretty beat up one ear had been damn near chewed off and sometimes on cold mornings hed limp a little and look up at me and meow like he was asking for a couple of aspirin i dumped the duffel stepped into the kitchen and said to lane tell me about jack and asked want some coffee she agreed to the coffee i think he was murdered she said as we waited for the water to heat in the microwave he was supposedly shot to death after he broke into a secure area of a company called ammath in dallas he was shot twice in the chest and died immediately another man was wounded but not killed not killed so he could tell you what they were doing the microwave beeped and i took the cups out no no no the man who was wounded was supposedly shot by jack she said they say that jack had a gun and opened fire when he was caught there were two guards or security men whatever you call them and supposedly jack shot one and the second guard shot jack jack you had to know him exactly she said theres no way that jack would shoot at somebody he wouldnt shoot at somebody to save his own life much less to keep from getting caught in a burglary or whatever he was supposedly doing unless she looked sideways at me and her eyes sort of hooked on yeah unless working with you you taught him to take a gun along a technique or something i shook my head never i never take a gun the only thing you can do with a gun is shoot somebody im not gonna shoot somebody over the schematics for a microchip thats what he told me she said that nothing you did involved violence nothing that jack knew about involved violence i thought but violence had been done a time or two or three as much as i tried to avoid it and regretted it or to be honest as much as i regretted some of it id met a sonofabitch down the mississippi one time who if he came back from the dead id cheerfully run through a stump chipper what was jack doing i stirred instant coffee crystals into the hot water and handed her a cup she had a way of looking at you directly and standing an inch too close that might have bent the attention of a lesser man nobody will say exactly all they will say is that he entered a highsecurity area in ammaththeyre the people doing clipper iiand that he opened fire when they walked in on him she said clipper ii was an orwellian nightmare come true a practical impossibility or a huge joke at the taxpayers expensetake your pick it was designed in response to a fear of the us government that unbreakable codes would make interceptintelligence impractical and really they had a point but their solution was so draconian that it was doomed to failure from the start the clipper ii chiplike the original clipper chip before itwas a chip designed to handle strong encryption if it was made mandatory everyone would have to use it and the encryption was guaranteed secure absolutely unbreakable except that the chip contained a set of keys just for the government just in case if they needed to they could look up the key for a particular chip get a wiretap permit and decrypt any messages that were sent using the chip they would thereby bring to justice all kinds of mafiosos drug dealers money launderers and other lowlifes hackers of course hated the idea they were already using encryption so strong that nobody including the government could break it the idea of going back to less secure encryption so that the government could spy on whoever it wanted drove them crazy no hacker on earth really believed that the government would carefully seek wiretap permits before doing the tap itd be tap first ask later just like it is now with phone taps the good part of the whole controversy was that everybody seriously concerned with encryption knew it was too late for the clipper ii it had been too late for the clipper i a decade earlier strong encryption was out of the bag and it would be impossible to push it back in lane had taken a sip of coffee winced and asked something but thinking about clipper ii i missed it huh she repeated the question do people kill for software not me but windows is software and it made the creator a hundred billion dollars in parts of some cities you could get a killing done for twelve dollars ninetyfive so some software could get some killing done i said we both thought about that for a minute then if it really happened like you say it didhang on let me finishif jack shot somebody it wasnt for the software necessarily it was to keep from getting caught and maybe sent to prison prison in texas but you know and i know she continued that jack didnt shoot anybody since somebody shot the guard there had to be somebody else in the room when jack was shot even though the company says nobody else was there but the guard and another security man maybe one security guy shot the other to make it look like jack shot first i said it in a notquitejoking way but she took it seriously no i thought about that but the guard who was shot was hurt bad the bullet went right through his lung hes an old guy and he almost died on the way to the hospital so the whole thing holds together almost too well she said there arent any seams at all they searched jacks house and found some supposedly secret files on a jaz disk hidden in a shoe very convenient that really nailed it down the only thing that doesnt work is the shooting jack hated guns they scared him he wouldnt even pick one up she was getting hot i slowed her down with a straight factual question what was he doing in dallas a contract job she said hed been there three months and had maybe another three to go ammath had a couple of old supercomputers crays that theyd bought from the weather service and they were having trouble keeping them talking jack had done some work on them years ago and they hired him to straighten out the operating software i said huh because i couldnt think of anything wiser ask me why i came to see you she said all right whyd you come to see me first to ask if you were in dallas ever with jack no i shook my head jack and i havent worked together for two years youre sure yeah im sure he rewrote some software for me so id be able to plug into a toyota design computer anytime i needed to two years ago november then whats this mean she dug in her purse and handed me a printout of an email letter look at the last couple of lines i scanned all of it most was just brothersister talk about their fathers estatetheir parents were both dead now their father dying nine months back the last two lines of jacks letter said im into something a little weird here i dont want to worry you but if anything unusual should happen get in touch with kidd okay just say bobby and ratsass chapter if you look in the shaving mirror in the morning and ask what youve become and the answer is artist professional criminal then you may have taken a bad turn down lifes dark alley while other people were wistfully contemplating the grassy fork in the road not taken id lurched down a gutter full of broken wine bottles and kicked asses and people telling me to go fuck myself nobody to blame really well maybe the army the army had left me a roster of dead friends a vicious dislike for bureaucratic organization and a few unusual skills and hell it was interesting at least im not stuck in a garret somewhere with a pointy little beard and a special rap for victim women trying to peddle my paintings to assholes in shiny italian suits at least im not that what i am is an artist a painter i make decent money from it but even though i was working harder than ever my productionartists actually talk about things like productionhad been falling over the years id always been a little fussy about what i sold and id gotten fussier as id gotten older so even as my prices went up my income actually declined a little the year before id sold six paintings id gotten a little more than but let me tell you about the taxes or maybe not i sound a little too republican when i get started on taxes in any case i still worked at my night job i stole things computer code schematics for new chips or new computers designs for new cars i suppose i could have stolen jewelry or cash but i wasnt interested in jewelry or cashand besides that kind of thievery didnt pay as well as my kind i knew that for sure because my best friend is a woman named luellen who was exactly that kind of thief she stole cash and jewelry and com collections and even stampsor anything else that was portable and could easily and invisibly be turned into cash luellen and i had known each other since i caught her trying to break into another guys apartment in my building that was several years ago ever since wed been friends and sometimes more than friends even with that history i had no idea what luellens real last name was or where exactly she lived she was comfortable with my ignorance im not exactly embarrassed by the night job though ive often thought id give it up if i could make nine paintings a year instead of six then again i might not if i were french and philosophical i might even argue that professional criminal wasnt that far from freedom fighter but there was always that skeptical face in the mirror the face that asked whether freedom fighting should generate large amounts of expendable income i could sayhey even freedom fighters gotta eat but what do you do when the face in the mirror asks yeah but should freedom fighters get condos in new orleans and painting trips to siena and fishing jaunts to ontario and season tickets for the wolves being neither french nor philosophicalrather a believer in the great god wysiwyg that what you see is what you geti had no ready answer for the question except you gotta shave faster i did not immediately believe or believe in lane ward believe that i was getting what i was seeing let me get out on the net for a couple of minutes i said check me out ward asked see if ive got mail i said politely ratsass sounds like a password she said so whos bobby she had large dark eyes id first thought maybe mexican with an irish complexion now i was thinking oriental one of the robustyetdelicate japanese ladies of the hiroshige woodcuts something about the eyebrows i would like to draw her from a quarter angle off her face to get the brow ridge the cheekbone and the ear i didnt say that bobby runs an information service i said an information service for people like me i might have addedbut i didnt add it ratsass is probably the password on one of bobbys mailboxes so lets see whats in it she looked around wheres your computer in the back ive been in the apartment for a while i own it part of a deal the city of st paul had going years ago to bring people back downtown ive got a tiny kitchen with a small breakfast nook off to one side a compact living room with a river view a workroom with maybe three thousand books two hundred various bits and pieces of software and most of the time three or four operating computers a studio with a wall of windows facing northeast and a bedroom on the way back to the workroom lane paused in the door of the studio looked up at the wall of windows the big beatup easel and all the crap that goes with painting and asked whats this im a painter i said thats what i really do the computer stuff is a sideline you really are an artist yeah jack never told me she said she peered at me for a second as if doing a reevaluation jack didnt know me that way i said we mostly knew each other on the net i only met him twice face to face he came here no no i saw him once when he was between planes out at the airport and once when i had some business out in redmond redmond she said and huh she stepped over to a painting id propped against a wall id finished it a few weeks before the fishing trip a line of stone buildings dropping down a hill in the flat yellow light of a minnesota september the light is thin then but yellowcreamyalmost like the light you get in central italy on hot summer evenings although in st paul it only lasts three weeks after a few seconds of peering at the painting lane cocked her head and did a little shuffle step to get a better look only two dimensions and all that light she said but it looks so like it might be i shrugged and she said jeez i really like it i never know what to say so i said the workrooms down this way an old cowbox pentium was set up on a table at the far end of the workroom a shoulderhigh stack of dell chassis were sitting on the floor with a couple of big cardboard boxes she looked at the chassis and asked whatre you doing here some people in chicago want to build an americas cup boat i said they need a supercomputer to design the hull but they cant afford it so im making one with a friend yeah neat she wasnt particularly impressed as though shed done the same thing a time or two herself whats the setup were gonna chain sixtyfour dell pentium ills with an ethernet array running through these stacked hubsi whacked a stack of cardboard boxes with the palm of my handas a single distributed os we got the operating system off a freeware site love the freeware she said and my friendshes really doing the numberswill come over and write whatever connections she needs and go to work cool she looked around again taking in the books wheres your net hookup i took her down to the cowbox machine some previous owner or more likely the wife or girlfriend of a previous owner had written fuck you fat boy on the beige front panel of the monitor in pink indelible ink top of the line huh she asked what can i tell you you dont need a workstation to read your email when we were up i said why dont you uh go look at the dells why because im gonna dial a number i dont want you to see and follow a procedure i also dont want you to see really she asked so its out in the dark okay i forgot what she smiled for the first time a smile bordering on greatness that youre a crook she wandered down to the end of the room and i dialed bobbys number a number im sure that at t doesnt know about since ten digits follow the i then waited through ten seconds of electronic silence in the eleventh second the modem burped and a appeared on the screen i typed eight digits got another and typed k and got a further i typed male which was either a deliberate misspelling in the interests of security or a joke when the final appeared i typed ratsass a letter popped up oh fuck unless im reading this myself i could be in deep shit kidd get down to dallas and find mei might be in jail this is the deal i contracted with ammath to overhaul their system software which job i got because i have a dod clearance from when i was at jpl its all supposed to be secret but everybody knows that theyre working on software for the clipper iiits been in the newspapers so i figure thats no big deal because clipper ii is dead in the house and even deader in the senate and everybody except the intelligence goofs in washington knows its too late anyway but around here theyre acting like its a new atomic bomb and these people aint goofs in fact they scare me a little bit the other day i was manipulating a bunch of stuff in a file called oms just to see if the system was right i got to reading some of it and fuck me with a phone pole if it has anything to do with clipper i was still reading through it when a security guy came down from corporate and asked me what i was doing i told him access tests and told him i wasnt really reading anything and he tells me to stay off that link unless i give prior notice i say ok they mustve had a tripwire on it so anyway im going back tonight with a bunch of jaz disks im gonna disconnect the trip wire and dump the oms file anyway just in case ill stash copies in the safest possible place if youre reading this im probably in a jam the guy to watch is a security asshole named wllliam hart there are rumors that he used to be some kind of military security guy or something and he got kicked out one of the secretaries told me that hed done time in prison before he came to ammath so you want to stay away from him so thats it i hope to hell im reading this and not you if its you come get me say hello to luellen for me dont take any wooden pussy jack that did not sound good i looked at if for a couple of minutes then buzzed bobby bobbys always available after i buzzed him i got the again and went back with a k he was on immediately kidd where you been fishing been trying to find you saw airline to kenora and then lost you out of touch whats happening you read about firewall i know nothing just back now go out on net look at papers new york times wall street journal washington post we need to find firewall and give them to cops but firewall names are not good you are not firewall stanford is not oneoxford is not carlg is not i dont know what youre talking about read papers and get back your name is on list do you know stanford is dead stanford was jacks working name there was a pause something you didnt get with bobby dead are you sure when and where last friday in dallas supposedly shot to death during breakin at software company called ammath did not know will check immediately stanford is on firewall list do you know lane ward no ive heard name computers at berkeley i need brothers and sisters for lane ward and also photo for ward soonest wlll dump to your box one hour you must go out on net read firewall i will check on stanford ok will call back dial tone and out i read down the screen once more wiped out everything but the letter printed it and then said hey lane drifted back what she asked a letter from your brother aw jeez i pulled it out of the printer and handed it to her she took a minute reading it a little vertical line between her eyes then she read it again and a tear trickled down one cheek finally she looked up why would he do that curiosity jack was a computer guy if you tell a computer guy not to look in a file hell look in the file especially if he thinks of himself as some kind of cool james bond guy she said like it was my fault do you know anything about a group called firewall i asked she gave me a long look and then asked are you working for the government that took a while to sort out i told her about bobbys strange anxiety and she suggested that i do what bobby wanted that i look up firewall in the papers and on the net i went back out with lane looking over my shoulder eight days earlier as id been sitting on my living room floor sorting out pike lures a national security agency bureaucrat named lighter had been murdered walking near his home in maryland jack was killed the next night twelve hours before i flew out to kenora according to the online papers the lighter killing was at first thought to be a random mugging although the detectives working the murder had been disturbed by some of its aspects there was no sign that lighter had fought his assailants or tried to run hed simply been gunned down lighters wife told police that hed been mugged once before when they lived in washington and that he had calmly handed over his wallet while he tried to reassure the muggers that he was not a threat in other words there was no reason to kill him to get his money and hed been shot down on a quiet suburban street where mugging much less murder was almost unknown a couple of days later rumors began to surface on the net that hed been killed by a radical hacker group calling itself firewall firewall claimed to be taking preemptive revenge for the clipper ii although the clipper ii was widely believed to be a dead issue and some names had surfaced carlg dave bobby firstoctober rasputiniv k lotuselan oneoxford stanford whitey oh shit i said what to cover myself do you know your brothers working name you mean yellowjacket thats his gamer name i never heard that hed always been stanford i tapped the list on the screen theyve got him listed as a member of this firewall she looked stanford is jack huh she turned away slowly thinking what you dont talk with the government she said a statement with a question inside no of course not i have she said slowly they asked me not to tell anyone i talked to them on tuesday i was interviewed for two hours by the fbi about firewall where jack had been traveling and who his friends are i didnt know any of that except some friends we have in common jack would travel about once a year to europe but that was about it the last time he was out of the country was six months ago you didnt mention me no of course not i know better than that she said what do you know about firewall nothing id never heard of it jack would have told me if he was involved but those little net conspiracies you know what they are theyre socially retarded geeks who think theyre living a comic book jack wouldnt have anything to do with them neither would i executing a guy because hes working on clipper ii that doesnt sound like socially retarded geeks i said oh no she asked then who else could it be murdering somebody over a chipnot even a real chip and who else would care besides geeks the mafia oh bullshit she rolled her eyes its too physical she put her hands on her hips look at yourself for christs sakes kidd youre some kind of aging jocknerdengineerfishermanartist with a broken nose what if its somebody just like you with a taste for blood no answer to that the question was urgent if the feds and spy people and god knew who else were tearing up the countryside because bobby was on the list and so was i i was k lane kept going back to jacks letter wheres the safest possible place she asked somewhere i could get at them i guess i had an idea but wasnt about to show it not until i knew her better maybe he shipped them somewhere ive got a bunch of mailboxes scattered around ive even got one at aol check them i went back online checked them and came up empty lane was reading jacks letter again she snapped it with a fingertip and said one thing that bothers me about the letter is the line about not taking any wooden pussy wooden what id barely noticed the line pussy the thing that bothers me is i dont think jack talked like that are we sure this is from jack i had to laugh because it sounded exactly like jack and exactly the kind of thing that jack would never say around say a sister or any other woman yeah he did talk that way sometimes i said then is it possible that you really didnt know jack as well as you thought you did that he might have a life that you didnt know about maybe involving guns no she said positively i mean im sure he did things i dont know about that hed hide from me he got along very well with a certain kind of ditzy chick maybe hed say pussyhe just didnt say it to me but with the guns were talking basic rockbottom personality he didnt shoot anybody okay then i noticed something a little odd you say he was killed on friday yes friday night she caught the puzzled look as i read the letter again why because the letter was timestamped on sundaythe sunday before he was killed he said he was going in then what have i been telling you theres something seriously wrong with the whole thing we talked about the possibilities and in the back of my head there was that k floating around out there the feds were looking for k so are you going back to dallas with me she asked eventually youre going back ive got to ive got to sign papers and everything when theyre done with him another tear popped out and i turned away i dont deal well with weeping women i tend to babble so are you going i made a reservation for you i could really use somebody to lean on yeah yeah okay i said but dont cry huh please shed made a reservation for that same night on the last plane out i took a moment to go downstairs to tell alice to watch after the cat and then i went back out on the net and read everything i could find on firewall there was a ton of stuff but mostly bullshit then i went to my box at bobbys and found a picture and a note the picture was of lane ward looking nice in a professorial business suit a wall of books in the background the note said her only brother was jm finally i called the wee blue inn in duluth on a voice line and got weenie the ownerbartender hes a toothpickchewing fat man with a steelgray butch an apron that he laundered every month whether it needed it or not and who always smells like greasy hamburgers and barbequed onion rings i said this is the guy from st paul i need to talk to luellen shes off right now he said i can take a message luellen was always off weenie theoretically paid her a year as a waitress and she paid taxes on the plus in tips in reality weenie stuck the taxfree in his pocket and sent luellen the w form weenie was her answering service the w form explained to the government how she paid for her house wherever that was tell her that stanford was killed i said the funerals set for santa cruz next wednesday im going to dallas but ill be in santa cruz for the funeral ill tell her weenie said thats stanford like in the university on the way out the door on the way to the airport i stopped lane already in the hall went back to the workroom and got a small wooden box made in poland i stuck it in my jacket pocket just in case at the airport i picked up the major papers and as soon as we were off the ground began looking for firewall stories they all carried at least one but nothing on the front page firewall appeared to be suffering media death while i read lane kicked back and slept she was not a large woman and could snuggle into the seat like a squirrel on a pillow i stared at the seat in front of me for a while and when she was asleep took the wooden box out of my pocket inside i kept a ryderwaite tarot deck wrapped in a silk cloth im not superstitious more than that i refuse superstition ghosts and goblins and astrology and numerology and phrenology and all the new age bullshit of mother goddesses and wicca the world would be a happier place if itd die quietly tarot is different tarot iscan bea kind of gaming system that forces you out of a particular mindset lets say youre trying to oh say steal something your mindset says x is a danger and y is a danger but the tarot says think about z so you start thinking about things outside of the mindset and when you finally do the entry youve considered a whole spread of possibilities that otherwise would have gone unsuspected nothing magic about it and it will definitely save your ass so i did one quick spread of my own invention working toward a key card the card came up the devil interesting i sat looking at the evil fuck for a few seconds sighed stood up got my bag out of the overhead bin and stowed the tarot deck thought about it for a second then dug out the little eightcake winsor newton watercolor tin and my sketchbook i got a glass of water from the stewardess and started doing quick watercolor sketches of lane the cabin and the two business guys across the aisle the closest business guy looked like a salesmanbalding pudgy triplechinned exhausted he sat headdown and dozing his red yellow and black necktie splashing down his chest and stomach like a waterfall the guy behind him was just as exhausted but was too thin his skull plainly carving the shape of his head i got three good ones of the two of them the thin man like deaths shadow behind the fat one i struggled to get the red necktie right working the planes as it twisted down his shirt a stewardess stopped to watch for a few minutes then disappeared into the front of the plane a couple of minutes later the copilot came back watched for a while said he did a little watercolor himself and asked me if id ever seen the cockpit of a ds at night i hadnt and he showed me the way i did a halfdozen sketches of the crew at work and left them behind they all seemed pleased and so was i in the twenty years after i got out of college i dont think i went a day without drawing or painting something except during a couple of hospital visits even then when i could start moving the first thing i did was ask for a pencil in all those years the work got tighter and tighter and tighter until i felt like i hardly had the muscle to pick up a pencil or a pen or a brush i could wear myself out in an hour just moving a brush around then i broke through the brush got lighter and the work became fluid the actual breakthrough came during a rough visit to washington dc id left behind the washington nightmareshadnt had one for a couple of years nowbut the fluidity seemed to hang around i got back to my seat restowed the winsor newton tin and the sketchbook and buckled up for the landing when the wheels came down lane started stirred woke up and yawned covering her mouth with a balled fist pushed up the window shade and looked out at the lights of dallas and then as we turned of fort worth my mouth tastes like something died inside it she said her voice a little husky a good voice to wake up to she looked me over whatd you do sit there and stare at the seat back not exactly i said going out the door the stewardess squeezed my arm and said thanks so much youre really good lane looked like she might drop dead of curiosity as we walked up the ramp but then she finally asked what was that all about i said oh you know be a jerk she said but she was smiling we stayed overnight at a marriott early the next morning she was pounding on my door and at nine oclock we were headed down to dallas police headquarters lane wanted me to go inside with her but i dont talk to cops when i can avoid it she went in alone a little pissed twenty minutes later she was back and told me about it as we drove back to the hotel the cops had been pretty straightforward about it she said i got into their faces a little bit but they wouldnt budge this guy i talked to said jack was into something tricky thats the word he used tricky and thats what theyve got thats all that he was doing something tricky no she was reluctant to talk i had to pry it out of her they say they traced the gun he supposedly used it was stolen in san jose six years ago uhoh i said yeah i kept saying jack would never use a gun and they kept saying then how come the gun came from san jose she was looking up at me with her dark eyes pleading with me to understand that what the cops had said was all bullshit they said ammath framed him using a gun that was stolen six years ago in san jose how did they do that good question i said jack would not shoot anybody lane insisted you cant always tell what somebody will do when hes cornered and he thinks that his life may be ruined or that he might go to prison i said or maybe he thought the guard was about to shoot him and it was selfdefense she didnt want to hear about it and after wed snarled at each other for a few minutes i let it go so thats itthey got a gun there were a couple more things she said reluctantly then watch it i hit the brakes a blue toyota pickup chopped us off just as we headed up a freeway onramp he never knew i was there i shook my head and said asshole and then listen lane you gotta tell me everything they said i dont want to have to drag it out of you im supposed to be on your side its all bullshit you shouldve come in then you could have heard it for yourself whatre the other things the cop had explained that there were three doors into the secure areatwo of them alarmed the third door came out of a short hallway connected to the system administrators office and the main entrance of his office was well down the hall from the secure area but if you knew which doors were wired with alarms you could force the door into the system administrators office which had the corridor leading directly into the secure area that one locked from the system administrators side so it would not have to be forced an outsider trying to intrude into the secure area would not know any of that and would be stuck with trying to find a way around the alarms what else it turns out that the guard wasnt responding to anything he was making his regular rounds another guy this security guy was on his way to his office and they went up together in the elevator and the guard noticed that the door to the office suite had some damage around the door knob so they went in she stopped shaking her head so what theyre saying is it wasnt like there was a sudden shooting and then a bunch of explanations it was just a guards routine trip through the building it still could have been set up she said stubbornly yeah but boy didnt sound good i concentrated on driving for a couple of minutes getting us out of a pod of texans headed up the freeway in what seemed to be a test of chaos theory you sensed an order in their driving but you couldnt say exactly what it was i could see the toyota pickup at the head of the pack like the lead dolphin after the shooting lane said the police went to a house jack had rented with a second security man from ammath and found a bunch of computer diskstwo of them were in a pair of shoes in the closet which doesnt sound like jack at alland a lot of other unauthorized stuff from ammath including manuals and confidential information about the clipper ii ammath wanted to take it but the cops wouldnt give it to them instead they called in the fbi theyve still got it yes the fbi and thats all well they say the back entrance and the secure area at ammath are covered with cameras a call came into the building computer at trenddirectthats the building ownerand the security cameras were interfered with the scanning range for the one in the back was changed so that it didnt scan a door at the end of the building and the camera that watches the secure area was turned off the guards didnt see that werent the cameras monitored i asked that she said the camera in back constantly scans back and forth and the only change was to cut out part of the range the other camera is one of about ten around the premises with a constant cycle three seconds at each station and they cut out one station they never noticed the changes we sat and thought about that for a moment then lane sighed and said they said we can probably get his computers back not the hard drives but the rest of them and the monitors and his personal stuff what about jack i mean the body ive got to go to the medical examiners office and sign for him theyve released it him huh so maybe we should stop by his house and take a look around i said over time id crept up on the blue toyota he edged over to make it onto an exit and i chopped him off nearly sending him into the retaining wall at the bottom of the ramp i went right and he went left but i could see his middle finger wagging out the window for what lane was unaware of the drama those jaz disks he said hed put them in the safest possible place you know what that means i thought it was just a phrase she said maybe but we could look around the house is sealed yeah i said with a piece of tape chapter the rest of the afternoon was taken up with the melancholy routines of violent death claiming the body signing for a bag full of personal effects that the cops didnt wantbesides the routine junk jack had in his wallet unless somebody had clipped it along the way and lanes high school graduation photo which made her cry again she also signed a contract with a local funeral home to handle shipment of the body by air freight the coffin cost and came with a guarantee that neither of us was interested in reading when lane was in dallas the first time to identify the body shed gone to look at jacks rented house although she hadnt been allowed inside we cruised it late in the afternoon a twobedroom lshaped cementblock rambler painted an awful shade of electric pink the exact shade i thought of a lawn flamingo a short circular driveway took up most of the front yard there was no carport or garage we could see only one door right in the middle of the house under an aluminum awning we continued around the block and from the other side could see a small screened porch jutting into the backyard and there was a fireplace chimney not much of one but there was one he always rented the cheapest livable place lane said hed fly back to california on weekends didnt like texas not a california kind of place she said some people would count that as a blessing most texans for example she let the comment go by as we cruised the house again how do we get in i dont know well have to see what lights are on with the neighbors if we can get in the back porch well have some cover okay she said simple faith we did the block once more and i looked for kids swing sets and bikes basketball hoops and dogs luellen had trained me if there are kids around the parents in a family tend to be at home in the evening and awake and alert basketball hoops often means teenagers and teenagers come and go at weird inconvenient times dogs are the worst dogs bark thats how they earn their money and in this neighborhood theyd probably be listened to the house on the south side of jacks had a hurricane fence around the backyard which could mean either kids or dogs the one on the north side a noxiousgreen one was as simple and plain as jacks with no sign of life the house directly behind jacks had an aboveground swimming pool in the backyard which probably meant kids if there were kids running around or splashing in the pool wed have to forget it if not the biggest problem might be the streetlight across the street and down one house what do you think lane asked we probably ought to skydive onto the roof and cut our way into the house with a keyhole saw kidd we ought to sneak around the back between the green house and jacks place if the green house doesnt show any lights then cut our way into the screen porch and see what the situation is there usually theres a way in if we break in theyll know it was us i shook my head no they wont were leaving for san francisco at eleven oclock tonight if they dont get around to the house for a few days well who knows what might have happened and really who cares theyve already searched the place we found a walmart and bought burglary toolsmight as well have the bestspent some time eating texmex dropped the rental car with the airport avis and checked in with the airline when we were set to fly we rented another car from hertz using a perfectly good wisconsin drivers license and amex gold card issued to my old pal and fishing buddy harry olson of hayward wisconsin harry didnt exist but he had money in the bank a great credit rating and a perfect driving record the fake id convinced lane that we really were going to break into her brothers house shed been relaxed all afternoon but now she was tightening up the question we have to ask ourselves she said is whether this is worth the trouble we could get into we wont know unless we find the jaz disks like youve been telling me there are some odd things about this killing if jack was killed because of something with my name on it i want to know what that something is without the cops getting it first hmm you dont have to go in i said all you have to do is show up with the car when im ready to leave if youre going in im going in that would help we could cut the search time in half so i didnt say no though i had the feeling that if i had said no and insisted on it she might have given in we wont go in if the situation looks bad if the neighborhoods lit up or we see people on the street okay thats sensible when we got back to the house the neighborhood wasnt all lit up and there were no people on the street the green house on the north side of jacks house was dark there was no car in the drive or in front of it we cruised it once and i stopped a block away you remember everything i said were joggers i remember i remember she said if were gonna do it lets go we jogged down the street loose sweatpants and tshirts i was carrying a small olivedrab towel wrapped around our walmart tools if we ran into cops i was hoping i could pitch the towel into a bush before we had to talk with them that was the plan or as lane put it thats the plan the night was warm and you could still feel the days unnatural heat radiating from the blacktop we stopped two houses away from jacks as though we were catching a breather moved to the sidewalk the streetlight was only about halfbright and the shadows it cast seemed even darker than the other unlit spots anything i asked no she giggled nervously god im going nuts be cool we sauntered on down the sidewalk looking looking at the green house we turned up the driveway walked halfway around the loop then cut across the lawn and in five seconds we were between the two houses in the shadows if caught and questioned at that moment lane was finding a bush to pee behind we waited for a minute two minutes threeabout a century and a half in alland nothing happened no lights went on we saw no movement no dogs the house behind jacks with the pool showed a backyard light and lights in the windows but there was a croton hedge along the back fence and it cast a shadow over us no sauntering casual bullshit here we duckwalked to the back porch found the screen door locked and the crack in the lock covered with a length of yellow plastic tape and a notice i carefully peeled them off the door wanted to rattle when i touched it it was flimsy meant to keep out nothing stronger than a bluebottle fly i unwrapped the towel pulled out a short steel prybar pried the door back enough that we could force the locktongue across the strike plate we eased the door open and slipped inside crawling now listened again nothing at all or almost nothing cars on a major street three blocks away a crazed bird somewhere chirping into the dark an air conditioner with a bad compressor hope the rest is this easy lane whispered shh we pulled on thin vinyl cleaning gloves and i stood up to look at the porch the porch had been framed with twobyfours and around the top where the twobyfours met the screen panels there was an inchwide ledge if i was naive enough to try to hide a house key thats where i would have hidden it hoping that reports of black widows and brown recluse spiders were exaggerated i ran my fingers down the length of the twobyfours until in the second panel from the end of the porch i knocked a key off it tinkled onto the concrete floor and we stopped breathing for a moment then i got down on a knee and groped around until i found it the key still worked it was a little corroded but i polished it on my sweatpants slipped it in and out of the door lock a few times and we were in the interior of the house was almost dark with some illumination leaking in from the front from the streetlight and through the back windows the place smelled like carpet cleaner we groped our way to a hall and i switched on one of our flashlightsid taped the lens to get a single needlethin beam of light remember i said never turn the flashlight up always keep it down if you dont bounce it off a window nobodyll see us yeah yeah yeah she said she headed for the bedroomoffice while i went to the living room i knew exactly where i was going jack had met luellen in redmond and wed had a couple of beers together at a motel bar the conversation had drifted to burglary which wasnt unusual given the circumstances of our being in redmond in the first place luellen had told jack about a guy who lived in grosse point farms michigan and had a lockbox built into the floor of his fireplace the fireplace was one of those remotecontrol gas things and all the heat went straight upand the fireproof box under the fireplace was not only invisible it was absolutely completely counterintuitive whod put valuables where there was a fire luellen had said he thought it was the safest possible place and it would have been id never have found it in a million years if his wife hadnt told me about it jack had laughed about that the safest possible place was the line in the letter just an easy clichй maybe a few minutes later i was ready to give up this was an old crappy concretewithsteel firebox one of the instant fireplaces installed by the millions in lowend ramblers there was a flue which could be opened but i could neither see nor feel anything inside it when i got down on my hands and knees for an inchbyinch inspection with the flashlight there was no sign of a crack a seam a false plate lane came out just as i was backing away what are you doing she whispered i thought he might have hidden it around the fireplace i said why i explained quickly and she said that should have worked but it hadnt there is a crawl space up above under the eaves she said theres a hatch in the bathroom the feds probably already looked i said we should take a peek anyway the hatch was right in the middle of the bathroom ceiling i stood on the toilet and pushed it up and could just barely feel around the edges of the opening all i could feel was insulation anything lane asked cant reach far enough in i grunted stretching up as far as i could make me a step and boost me up she said i hopped off the toilet interlaced my fingers she stepped into it and i lifted her bellyhigh into the hole she pushed herself the rest of the way up and whispered down give me a couple of minutes theres a walkboard up here but theres all this insulation i stepped out of the bathroom and tried to think might the fireplace have some kind of hatch in the back to shovel out cinders id seen those on other i stepped back into the bathroom ill be right back i said to lane keeping my voice low i want to look in the utility room okay i found my way back to the utility room passed on the washer dryer and water heater and went to the furnace the furnace was one of those baby things you find in the south no bigger than a twentygallon can with a grill on the front and an access hatch on the back the access hatch was crammed with switches and valves with no space for anything else so i pulled off the grill nothing there was a dark space above the grill opening small pipes twisting around some furnace apparatus i didnt know about i couldnt see anything and just reached inside and felt something hard square and loose i rattled it and a taped bundle of jazdisk boxes almost fell on my feet i pushed the grill back in place and headed for the bathroom and that involved moving slowly along the frontroom wall now that my eyes had adjusted i could see a little better in the gloom especially with the front room curtains half open as i moved along the frontroom wall my eye caught a movement in the yard i froze uncertain that id seen it then i saw it again a mans shoulder on the sidewalk apparently walking up to the house i continued back to the bedroom almost tripped over the tool towel picked it up and hissed up at the hatch lane what a white patch her face hovered over the hatch somebody coming i said im gonna hand you the towel as i said it i heard a scratching at the front door somebody was peeling the police tape off the front and taking care to be quiet about it i stood on the toilet handed her the tool towel take the disks i said you found them move back im coming up i had to stand on my tiptoes to get my hands around the joists at the edge of the hatch i heard the key in the lock got a grip and did a pullup and then a pushup through the hatch the door opened outside and lane whispered now what and i whispered shut up shine your light on the hatch she turned her light on the hatch board i picked it up and carefully settled it back into its slot as long as nobody was doing a thorough search whoever was down below us was as quiet as wed been after a few minutes lane said are you sure theyre down there i nodded i heard a key in the lock a minute later i dont hear anybody she said quiet i was standing on a joist a long plank ran down to the end of the house to a headsized vent that looked out over the front yard half hunched against the low overhead i eased down the board and peered through the vent a sports utility vehiclemaybe a runner or a pathfinder i could only see the front end of itwas parked in front of the green house a spot that had been empty when we came in there was no other movement on the street although i could see a television through a window across the street then i heard the door open below me softly and a man stepped out onto the curved driveway he looked back and said hurry goddamnit as he turned to talk i caught an image of his face eyeblink quick a second man pushed the door shut and they hurried toward the suv the second guy was carrying what looked like a gas can i said aloud ah shit i turned back toward lane get out get out i said get the hatch up get the hatch up get what what she was looking toward me still whispering as i scrambled frantically down the plank and she was not lifting the hatch get the goddamn hatch i was almost on top of her before she lifted it up still uncertain drop through i said urgently hurrytheyre going to burn the place she got it no question she put her feet over the edge held on with her hands for a second dangled and then dropped into the bathroom disks i said i handed the bundle down then dropped into the bathroom myself i stepped into the hallway and the air was thick with gasoline fumes and something else out the back what shed taken a step toward the front room to see what was happening i took a step after her caught her arm just beyond her a burning rag hung from a string that must have been taped or thumbtacked to the ceiling the something else odor was burning cotton as i caught her arm the string already burning parted and the rag dropped to the floor the gas went with a whump like a giant pilot lightor napalm for that matterand i jerked her back and her sweatshirt was burning and i beat at it with my hands as i dragged her through the firelight to the back door she was screaming and beat at her shirt with her free hand i twisted her and got the bottom of the back of the shirt and ripped it up over her head and off and she groaned and said im burned and i led her out the door and around the house and said run run run and we ran through the backyards of the green house and the next house over and then around onto the sidewalk and down the street in one minute we were at the car in three minutes we were a mile away how bad i asked my arms my hands my face she said i dont think its too bad gotta find a good light i said we found a good light at a hotbed motel a couple of miles from the airport i checked in with the harry olson id the clerk was locked behind a thick bulletproof glass window and i said well want to check out early we got a real early flight he grunted said drop the key in the box pointed at a locked box hung on the side of the motel and went back to a gun magazine whose lead story was exposed handgun control incs year plan to disarm america read it and weep inside we got the good light lane had been burned on the backs of her hands her forearms and under her chin her eyebrows were singed and the dark hair over her forehead had taken on some new curls the burns were pink rather than white or black the worst were on her arms the biggest burn under her chin was the size of her palm what do you think she asked holding her hands away from her body palms up she was hurting you probably ought to have a doctor look at it i said then the police will know but if you can stand it we could catch our flight and you could go to the doctoror to an emergency roomout on the west coast we could tell them that you burned yourself with charcoal lighter at a barbecue but didnt think it was bad until it started hurting overnight it hurts now she said which is good i said really bad burns dont hurt right away the nerve endings are destroyed she actually smiled which suddenly made me like her a lot and said if the burns arent too bad i really dont think they are but theyll hurt i said then i can stand it better than going to jail she said and im not a doctor do you think the airline people will notice she asked i shook my head no you dont look bad at all keep your jacket over your arms let me handle the tickets then lets go i checked my watch weve got some time yet im gonna find a pharmacy see if i can get some sunburn painkiller or whatever i can get that could help good i held on to the disks she turned her head up to smile at me again and winced i guess i dont want to move my head too fast she said ill go get the stuff dont tarry she said the woman with the big dark eyes chapter st john corbeil st john corbeil was sitting in a leather armchair reading light from the floor lamp glinting from the steel rims of his military spectacles as he readorwells homage to cataloniahe threaded and rethreaded a diamond necklace between his stubby fingers as though it were a string of worry beads he liked the cool sensuality of the necklace and the money it represented hed had it made to his specifications by harry winston of new york one hundred diamonds excellent cut clarity and color in each and each a single carat in size the winston people had thought that curioushed seen the curiosity unspoken in their eyesbecause a hundreddiamond necklace doesnt carry the flash of say a big central stone or two surrounded by a constellation of smaller diamonds corbeil had good reasons onecarat diamonds were easy to move easy to sell and anonymous the necklace was a bank account if you popped the diamonds out of their settings you could put in the toes of your shoes another good reason was the sensuality of the stones corbeils face might have been chopped from a block of oak but he was a sensual man he liked the feel of a woman the sound of a zipper coming down on the back of a womans dress the smell of chanel he liked fast cars driven fast french cooking and california wine italian suits and english shoes and diamonds he hadnt been able to afford the very best in women wine and song until ammath now he had them and he would be damned if he would give them up the doorbell rang hed been expecting it he put the book down slipped the necklace into a shirt pocket crossed to the intercom and pushed the button yes hart and benson william harts voice four men were involved in various parts of the operation corbeil himself as coordinator hart and benson as security and technicians and tom woods a computerencryption expert who loved only money more than codes woods was not aware of the morrison lighter or ward difficulties other than that morrison had been killed in a breakin he was a nervous man come in corbeil pressed the doorrelease button buzzing them in done hart said corbeil nodded so theres no reason to think that anything remains here in texas not as far as we know corbeil turned away fished the diamond necklace out of his pocket and began unconsciously pouring it from hand to hand as though it were a slinky there remains the possibility that he sent his sister something he could have sent something to anybody but we cant find any really close friends no girlfriends right now the sisters the obvious candidate i mean were still backgrounding him but if theres somebody else its not obvious hart said i wish wed had time to interrogate him corbeil said but the pressure to get him out of the way well we couldnt both interrogate him and have a credible disappearance could we hart shrugged the other man benson stood silently listening a follower hart asked so now what shut down the ranch for a while that wont be necessary corbeil said we can do it by pushing a button no point in pushing it before we have to theres a lot of money out there right now ill tell you mr corbeil this whole incident scared the shit out of me im still scared and les is just as nervous as i am hart glanced at the silent man looking for support and got a nod thats why weve been so careful setting it up corbeil said theyd need evidence to put us in jail and theres no physical evidence of anything if i tell tom woods to push the destruct button everything is gone not even we could get it back thats well and good but theres still lane ward hart said if she does have something or if morrison set up some kind of deadmans drop so we need to go out and look at her house thats dangerous hart objected you didnt have any trouble getting into morrisons place out there or here either that was different he was supposed to be out of town and we knew he was dead so nobody would be coming around to visit with ward we dont know the neighborhood we dont even know what wed be looking for it might be on a disk on a hard drive it might be stashed online somewhere it might not exist but if it does and if it were sent on to the fbi wed be in desperate trouble corbeil said its worth the risk if the worst happened and you were caught we might explain it as a security matter something that we were terribly worried about something that you did on your own to keep the nations secrets from falling into unfriendly hands if you did go to jail for a whilewhat would you get for an unsuccessful burglary six monthsif that did happen there would be a magnificent bonus at the end of the time how much hart asked bluntly say two million a year prorated for lesser amounts of time corbeil said hart looked at benson then turned back to corbeil so we look at her house actually theres an opportunity coming up corbeils eyebrows went up and when hart explained corbeil smiled with pleasure i so like working with you william he said benson spoke up for the first time you know what i dont like mr corbeil i think were really okay with this morrison character and his sister i dont think he sent anything we caught on too quick and he was relying on lighter to take care of the problem but what i see corbeil was made impatient by the preface yes im worried about woods ever since morrison was killed hes been walking around with this doggy face i think he knows something happened they used to hang out a little corbeil nodded and said all right les thats a legitimate concern you know tom woods is a friend of mine an old confidant who came over with me from the factory and a mathematical genius to boot i know that sir but corbeil raised one hand if he becomes a problem i will take care of it i promise but we already have two deaths that are too closely connected a third one if it becomes necessary to remove lane ward would almost certainly draw attention if tom woods had died in the interim well hart said unless tom was the architect of it all corbeil said you took the thought right out of my head william we can perhaps begin to prepare some documents so you travel to san francisco hart nodded tomorrow well call back after we see what weve got we can make a call on the ward chick take her out or leave her corbeil said mmm and smiled chapter the plane touched down in san francisco a little after three in the morning taking a turn out to sea then landing across the stem of highway lights between the ocean and the bay when we touched down a tight wire in my spine suddenly relaxed whatever happened now we could fake it in dallas where the cops could look at us where they could see the burns we were in trouble a purely selfish reaction because lane hurt id found some solarcaine in a drugstore and shed smeared it on the burns and shed taken a halfdozen ibuprofen though we werent sure theyd help much that was about the best we could do before we left for the airport at the checkin counter lane hung back the shy little woman in a longsleeved blouse head down while i handled the tickets on the plane she sat on the aisle and got up twice to go to the bathroom to lather on more of the solarcaine you okay i asked after the second trip ill make it she said through her teeth the ibuprofen didnt help much she said i hope i dont scar it doesnt look that bad i said i she held up the bottom side of her arm and showed me a halfdozen blisters the size of quarters im afraid to lance them cause of infection she said ah jesus halfway through the flight i halfstood and looked around the woman in the seat in front of lane was asleep her mouth hanging open there was nobody behind us and the guy across the aisle had spread across two seats and had his head propped uncomfortably against a window shade you know i said quietly the police know we left dallas this evening and the house burned down before we left theyre gonna want to talk to you oh boy youre right youre gonna have to lie a little i said im gonna have to lie a lot she said you can pull it off if you think about it i said youve gotta be surprised and youve gotta be pissed its their faultthe cops faultthat the place burned down you told them that something was going on that your brother had been murdered you gotta yell at them not yell but ill be mad i am mad she said somebody did murder him you gotta insist that you go back to dallas and you have to demand to look at the hard drives on the computers that might keep them from having a local cop come around to talk to you theres no reason for them to suspect that you were burned in the fire theres no reason for them to think that they have to see you right away and you do have to stay here for the funeral so it depends on how long it takes the burns to heal she said yes but you cant stall them you just have to be busy you have to leave them with the impression that youre pissed off and youre gonna be back in their faces as soon as you have the time she thought about it for a minute then said i can do that cops arent dummies not most of them anyway maybe he wont be the same guy i talked to last time i mean i talked to a different cop the first time thatd make it easier whoever it is youve got to be careful and youve got to be real cops got builtin bullshit detectors i said at san francisco we picked up her car from a satellite lot and drove south to palo alto went straight to her house dumped the luggage emergency room i said ive got a doctor i see emergency room is right now and its anonymous and it may stop the pain i said she didnt argue we even managed to get a little sleep that night at ten oclock in the morning after five hours in bed i heard somebody knocking around in the house i rolled off the bedid crashed in her spare roomand pulled on my jeans and tshirt she was in the kitchen making coffee how is it hurts she said shed gotten cleaned up as best she could but said that water hurt the burns she was wearing loose khaki pants with a longsleeved cotton peasant shirt and again i could sense just a dab of the flowery french scent she smelled terrific and looked terrific in the peasant blouse if you didnt know that she was dressed to hide new burns her face was all right the burn there resembled a bad sunburn and would heal soon enough her arms were the worst of it the doc had lanced the blisters the night before to relieve the pressure but they were filling again the anesthetic doesnt help i asked shed gotten a sprayon topical anesthetic at the hospital the doctors had said it was stronger than the solarcaine helps for a while she said then it starts to hurt again im sorry not your fault she said but i dont think i could do what you do for a living i mean this usually isnt a part of it i said sometimes it must be she looked me over and i couldnt deny that thered been trouble in the past nothing like fire i said fire scares me me too now she reached toward her neck as though she were going to scratch stopped herself and smiled and said im going to be a really bitchy patient i went out and got a sack of bagels and some cream cheese and we toasted bagels and drank coffee and talked about jack and the jaz disks when we finished she said she was going to try to lie down againthe pain really isnt terrible it just makes me want to scream its giving me a headache all right point me to your computer first you got a jaz drive no but were about two minutes from a compusa she showed me her office with its standard beige desktop dell and then went off to lie down i walked out to the compusa bought an external jaz drive and a bunch of disks lugged it all back hooked up the drive and got the disks wed taken from jacks house i started with the top one and the first thing i found was a file called simply notes i opened it and found a couple of random emails apparently picked up from somewhere else on the disk jack had been picking out things that might be significant making notes the first one said add carlg rasputiniv to list high correlation on both carlg and rasputiniv were on the list of firewall members mentioned in the web rumors and now being investigated by the fbi the second note said check endodays exdeus fillyjonk laguna omeomi pixystyx more hacker names they sounded right was this some kind of security thing was ammath worried about firewall or dealing with firewall or maybe it was firewall i started browsing the rest of the files all under the general heading of oms and twice found the heading old man of the sea theyd gotten the hemingway title wrong if thats what it was meant to be anyway the only easily comprehensible part of the files was a huge batch of email and memos that jack had apparently copied out raw i looked at maybe three hundred pieces of it out of fifteen thousand or so and all of it was routine company stuff days off raises complaints scheduling of the twenty gigabytes of information on the four disks the most interesting files i couldnt really open at all they were five hundred megabytes each and lanes computer only had megs of ram i looked at the first few blocks of each though and figured out that the files were graphics of some kind probably photographs bored and frustrated i spent a while making two copies of each of the jaz disks as i finished lane got up wandered out to the kitchen and began dabbing anesthetic on her burns i shut down the computer and went out to tell her what id found did his work file did that have a time stamp on it she asked i didnt even look i said and we headed back to her office and cranked the computer up lane was standing four inches away from me looking at the screen waiting through all the stupid windowsopening stuff she was an attractive woman she looked like shed feel good i had the sudden feeling that if i touched her somehow something might happen but i didnt i sat looking at the screen and the moment passed she moved a little and wound up a few extra inches away and when we opened jacks work file it did have a time stamp it was last closed on sunday five days before he was killed so he did go in on sunday she said you said the cops said he made a phone call from his house and turned off the security system a camera and motion detectors i reminded her yes thats something we could check i said how she reached down to her arm unconsciously to scratch the burns and caught herself the phone company has these things called message unit details or message unit records i said we called them mothers back in the badoldphonephreak days theyll tell you where all the phone calls from your telephones went how do we get them that guy i called from st paulbobby the one i didnt want you to know aboutcould get them in two minutes i said so lets get them she said i have to go out to a pay phone i said you wouldnt want to call that number from here and if we go out to a pay phone then i wont know it she said it wont be on my longdistance bill that too i said we went out to a mall and i hooked up my own laptop at a pay phone using a pair of oldfashioned acousticadapter earmuffs after going through the security rigamarole i got bobby online and asked him to get me the numbers dialed from all phones at jacks house on sunday night and then on friday night when he was killed he said it would take a few minutes but he should have them by the time we got back to the house i said fine and then added that i needed a mailing address to send him a package what gb jaz disks need more eyes looking at them come from stanford send to john he will bring to me lane was looking over my shoulder and said so he doesnt mind calling in as long as we dont call out if you managed to trace the incoming call itd probably go back to the local bagel bakery or pontiac dealer or something hes weird about telephones i said what does this guy do for a living bobby databases thousands of them he still does some phone work but mostly to cover up his database entries about the only things he cant get into are the ones without an outside connection and thats damn few of them anymore maybe some military or national security computers stuff at that level would be pretty tough though i know hes in some of them hes been there forever hes like an unknown unofficial systems administrator the phone was ringing when we got back to the house not bobbyit was an air freight place jacks body would arrive the following day and would be taken to a local funeral home lane put the phone down to say something but it rang against almost instantly again not bobby yes this is lane yes what what do you mean burned down well how much is left did it get all of his personal stuff well how bad aw jeez i told you guysi hold you guys responsible im gonna talk to an attorney you never let me in there and then i told you somebody killed my brother and now they burned his house and you guys didnt even have time to look into it bullshit bullshit im gonna come there im gonna come there as soon as the funeral is over and im going to want to talk to whoever is in charge was i good she asked when she hung up you were very good i said bobby called ten minutes later we got the tone i hastily slapped the muffs on and two columns of numbers popped up between six and midnight sunday jack made three phone calls on friday he made a longdistance call to california at seven oclock that lasted twenty minutes thats our isp i have the same one lane said he made another call at nine fortyfive and nothing later so the nine fortyfive call must be the one to the security computers i said we can check that but he didnt call that number on sunday night lane said which means he didnt turn off the camera on sunday night i said which means that maybe he hadnt found the security system i wonder if the cameras out in the open i scratched my head and thought about it for a couple of minutes and finally said you know i think maybe they killed him ive been telling you that yeah but i didnt believe you i said there was too much weight on the other side but if jack knew about the security system on sunday he would have turned it off before he went in if he found out about the system between sunday night and friday night hed have known he was in troublethat the camera would have picked him up if he knew all that then why didnt he add anything to the letter he sent me if they scared him and he knew he was in trouble i just thought of something else lane said they say he broke into the secure area on friday night well if he went in there on sunday night why didnt he have to break in that time why was the first breakin on friday when we know he was there on sunday one of the first things we do is try to figure out how to get into a place without anybody knowing i said luellen and i talked to jack about that a little about not leaving a mark thats why i looked for the house key at jacks place better to ease your way in than to break something and he knew that i took a turn around the kitchen working it through finally shook my head i can see how they could have set it up itd take two guys but theyd have to be brutal assholes to shoot that old man the guard two guys came to burn down the house she said she said it quietly like a scholar making the killing point goddamnit i said after a while i think they killed him chapter we sent the second copies of the jaz disks off to bobbys friend john smithalso a friend of mine and an artist himselfand i spent the next two days trying to find something that made sense on the jaz disks and working along the edges of the bay with watercolor salty water has a different quality from fresh water a heavier more viscous feel the heaviness was compounded by the light which was very green and hard i never got it quite right lane stayed at the house getting ready for the funeral doing a little telecommuting and some restless reading she also spent some time poking through the jaz disks but neither of us found much three days after the fire the blisters on her arms were drying to unsightly splotches of itchy dead skin while the redness under her neck had begun to fade to brown i brought in meals during the day and in the cool evenings we walked out to dinner at a dimly lit italian place where the burns wouldnt be visible the funeral took place on a beautiful california morning fifty people gathered in an oldfashioned spanishstyle stucco chapel where an episcopalian priest said all the right words with the right dignity the women cried the men shook hands and harry connick jrs sunny side of the street played through the sound system as jacks childhood friends carried his casket out the side door luellen walked in the door a few seconds after the service started i almost didnt recognize her in the new york black dress hat and wraparound sunglasses she lifted a hand to me and slipped into a pew across the way lane didnt noticeshe was out of it struggling through the worst week of her life struggling to get her older brother into the ground at the end of the service lane went to the front door to shake hands luellen drifted over to me and said bummer i said yeah and then youre looking nice the black dress i was working in new york she said luellen was something of a chameleon in black without lipstick with her closecropped frostedblond hair she could have been a london model except that she was too short and her shoulders a tad too wide when she put on western shirts the kind with the arrows at the corners and cowboy boots youd swear shed come straight back from hauling hay out to a horse barn in wyoming a rosycheeked goodtime country girl in miami she could have been a drug dealers bimbo in san diego a slightly used navy wife on the lookout for a coronado island admiral but she was a lot more than all of that anything good i asked coin dealer let it go way too much protection she looked around with the kind of eyedrooping standback attitude she tended to develop after a couple of weeks of pushing her way around manhattan not like you need the money i said not yet anyway she said she nodded at lane whos the chick jack wasnt married was he his sister lane ward oh yeah when you look at her close you can see it she looked at lane and then back up at me too much makeup for my style she said theres a story behind it i told her about the house and the fire so shes flash burned on her neck and arms and the cops want to talk to her were trying to bullshit our way through the funeral then get her out of sight until shes healed gotta hurt she said luellen was unimpressed by pain her own or anybody elses it does the doc said itd take eight or ten days to heal so weve got a while to go can we talk with her around i think so but i havent given her anything on you at all except your first name and ill keep it that way all right she said then you getting laid not by lane if thats what youre asking by who software lady back in the cities were building a computer together i couldnt see her eyes but i could tell they were rolling nerd love she said nerd love i agreed how about you nothing right now ive been working pretty hard i did a hundred and seventy thousand in miami a couple of months ago scared myself brainless come close not to getting caught but the people bunch of pecker wood meth manufacturers if theyd figured me out they wouldve cut me up with a chainsaw and i shit you not sometimes luellen and i were in bed sometimes not she had a taste for slender darkhaired latin men with big white teeth im not any of that we hadnt been in the sack for a while but i expected that shed be back or i would or something wed probably be buried next to each other sooner or later funeral thoughts on the way out of the church i introduced her to lane who smiled and nodded and we went outside id driven lane to the church in her car but shed ride to the cemetery with friends i decided to go with luellen and pick up lanes car on the way back you know what wouldnt be a bad way to go luellen asked on the way out to the cemetery you know your time has come its all over go up in the north woods in the wintertime where there are wolves around you sit down take your coat off and chill out wouldnt hurt youd just go to sleep and instead of rotting youd be a dinner for the wolves something usefuland youd wind up as a wolf yourself sort of wouldnt hurt as long as the wolves didnt get there early i said thats really romantic she said or youd probably wind up getting eaten by field mice voles shut up kidd half the people at the church followed to the cemetery jack was buried in a smoothly curving piece of the earth framed by a dozen small redwoods nice spot the funeral was one of those where after the coffin is let down into the ground the bystanders walk by and toss a handful of dirt into the grave we filed past luellen a step ahead of me and when i turned past the top of the grave saw a thicknecked man in a suit and sunglasses standing a hundred yards away half concealed behind a granite gravestone id seen him once before i thought outside the house in dallas his face silhouetted by a streetlight got a problem i muttered to luellen you got your cameras in the car she said she looked right at me too smart to look for trouble im gonna turn and if you look past my shoulder youll see a guy in a gray suit and black sunglasses about a hundred yards off what are the chances of getting a shot i turned and she turned with me smiling saying yadda yadda yadda and then all right i got him hes not a cop unless hes some kind of federal spook that i dont want to know about hes not a cop i said he could be private security he could be a major asshole the people at the funeral were starting to look around ready to start moving as soon as the last handful of dirt was dropped in the grave luellen said let me give you a peck say goodbye and i leaned over and she gave me a peck on the cheek and started for her car lifting a hand to wave goodbye as she went she was the first to go her car was only fifty feet down the cemetery lane she popped the trunk with a remote key pulled out a shoulder bag tossed it across the front seat started the car and drove away i turned casually saw the man in the gray suit still standing there but faced in a different direction looking ninety degrees away from us the last handful of dirt went in the grave and lane shook hands with a couple of people and took the arm of a guy who with his wife had driven her to the cemetery their oldest friends jacks and lanes and from what id seen nice people as lane started moving toward the car the man in gray started to move down away from the stone where he was standing i couldnt see a carit was apparently behind an evergreencovered knoll out of sight luellen had only had a couple of minutes to set up and i wasnt sure if she was ready yet nothing to do about it and since id come with her i had nothing to do but wait the man in the gray suit came to watch couldnt be that simple everybody was moving now but lane about to get in the backseat of her friends car saw me standing watching and called kidd wheres your friend i strolled over and said give me a hug with a question on her face she stepped over to give me a hug and i said quietly as i could one of the people who burned jacks house is here oh no she took my arm and led me a few steps away from the car looking up at me earnestly as if giving comfort what she said was whats he doing do you see him he left as soon as you started to i gotta get back to your house im afraid he might have been here to keep an eye on you while the other guy broke in are jacks disks on my desk both copies shit but we sent a set to bobby yeah but if they get the others theyll know that weve at least looked at them i said or that you have anyway but we dont know anything not really she said they dont know that luellens rental car whipped around the knoll moving too fast on the narrow blacktopped cemetery lane she pulled up popped the door and said got him and got his plate good weve gotta get back to lanes place like now call the police lane said luellen and i glanced at each other she caught it and said okay ill call the police well find a pay phone on the way out the guy who was here knows we cant get back there for half an hour if there is another guy maybe the police could still catch him worth a try i said wait for me she went back to her friends car leaned in the back said something got her purse and hurried back to us im riding with you she said we drove out to a gas station spotted a driveup coin phone luellen dialed and passed the phone to lane who said look i dont want to get involved in this but i think i saw a man breaking into a house no i dont want to get involved she gave the address hung up and we were gone luellen would not have anything more to do with any cops ill drop you at the church so you can get lanes car and ill call you from a motel sure luellen looked at lane if the cops are there when you get there ill be surprised tell them that you were at your brothers funeral right up front first thing why thatll fit you into a slot for the cops dopers hit houses during funerals the neighbors have gotten used to people coming and going and during the funeral itself the house is usually empty so its a good time to go in its like a thing like an mo lane said right exactly luellen said like television the cops were there two squads four officers we pulled up and one of them came trotting over lane got out and asked whats wrong do you live here maam yes its my house we think it may have been broken into we got an anonymous nineoneone call and when we checked we found the front door had been forced lanes hand went to her throat and she said is the man we dont think hes inside we talked to one of the neighbors and he said he saw a man exit the back door and walk away down the streetthat was just about the time we got the nineoneone call he had a fifteenminute start on us by the time we talked to the neighbor so hes miles away his car was probably right around the corner oh my god lane said and she started walking toward the house i said to the cop we were just at her brothers funeral youre not her husband one of the cops asked as the others started after lane no im just a friend of her brothers i drove her car to the church we better check the house just in case he said inside as the cops moved from one room to the next lane looked at me and shook her head silently mouthed theyre gone also gone her laptop a jewelry box with a few hundred dollars worth of jewelryand a lot of memories lane saida minolta mm camera and three lenses a checkbook a couple of hundred english pounds that she kept in a bureau drawer and a broken rolex watch given her by her exhusband making it look like they were here for the highvalue stuff laptops cameras making it look like junkies i muttered goddamn animals the cops were decent about it they told her there wasnt much they could do absent any indication of who might have broken in they apologized as though it were their fault told her to get better locks and left lane and i spent the next ten minutes teasing out the consequences of the burglary there were a couple if the people who took the disks were worried about what jack knew and were willing to kill him to keep his mouth shut then the same might apply to lane on the other hand they might look at the disks and conclude that nothing on them was worth killing forthat another death would just draw attention to them flip a coin luellen called and i told her about the burglary the cops are gone were gonna have a war council ive got a room at the holiday inn she said ill change clothes and come over listen you dont have a package do you no maybe yeah luellen had reverted to her usual dress by the time she arrived at lanes jeans and cowboy boots and an orange silk blouse under a jean jacket she had the figure of a gymnast to go with the jeansshe looked spectacular if you like cowgirls she brought along a roll of mm polaroid color slide film a compact polaroid filmdevelopment machine a singleslide cabin projector and a box of empty slide holders she popped the film out of the camera and we sat around the kitchen table while she developed it cut out the individual frames and snapped the frames into the plastic slide holders if shes gonna be around here shes gonna need somebody looking out for her luellen said talking to me as if lane werent there i nodded you know who im thinking about im thinking about john smith hes in on this already and he lived in oakland i bet hed know somebody whos john smith lane asked hes a guy an artist i told her he was a young kid in oakland back in the early seventies when the black panthers were going hes still out there on the left still knows a lot of hard people howd you meet him we helped him organize a communist revolution in the mississippi delta i said unsuccessfully i take it no no it worked out fine luellen said that might have been an overstatement bobby had convinced us that there might be some money involved in overthrowing a little strongarm dictatorship in a small town of the mississippi river by the time we finished wed made some money all right and our friends were running the place but there was blood on the ground and some of the dead were good people luellen doesnt always seem to remember that part of it or she does but finds no point in dwelling on it she looked at me so we call him shed finished with the film got the little cabin projector plugged it in and projected a slide against the white front of lanes refrigerator thats the guy i said id bet on it lane shivered and said he looks mean she was right he had that thicknecked tightmouthed linebacker look with a crew cut to make the point im sure he is i said the next slide showed the same man caught as he climbed into a red toyota camry with california plates i jotted down the number who does camrys i asked luellen hertz she said time to make some calls i said luellen and i drove out to the pay phone again and i hooked up my laptop called bobby and gave him the tag number for the camry rental car could be hertz need to know the drivers name and anything else you can find driver probably lives in dallas area probably flew into san francisco in the last day or two dump to my cache site ill pick it up later plan to call john smith for some help talk to him then we called john kidd goddamnit its been a while he pulled his mouth away from the phone long enough to yell you guys be quiet for a minute okay daddys on the telephonehey marvel its kidd then he was back whats up then marvel picked up and i said hows the commie state senator and she laughed and the bullshit rolled on for a few minutes then luellen wanted to talk and we had a longdistance oldhome week i finally took the phone back and said listen john weve got a problem out here in californiawere in palo altoand i was hoping you might be able to hook me up with somebody what kind of trouble i gave him a quick and slightly vague answer and mentioned bobby he didnt press for details since he knew what we all did for a living and finally said i dont know a guy but i know a guy whod know a guy thats cool we can pay whatever probably be at least two hundred dollars a day dont ask dont tell cash no tax fine let me give you the phone number i gave him lanes number and john said somebody would call that afternoon listen i added if you need to get in touch drop mail at bobbys but dont call that number yourself things could get tricky home luellen shook her head we need to go into san francisco the jimmy cricket golf shop and lanny roses beauty boutique i got directions golf shop yeah im taking up the game and i want to look good while im playing jimmy crickethe claimed that was his real namewas a nicely weathered gent wearing a black polo sweatshirt over a golf shirt and jeans with tassels on his loafers he was regripping a ping driver when we came through the door he smiled and asked what can i do for you folks weenie called you earlier today luellen said the gray twosome he said as though wed just shown up for our teetime i thought you were a single nope luellen said mr and mrs gray weenie said to tell you that all cats are gray in the dark okay well weenies word is good with me if youll step into the back we went through a flipup countertop into the back room cricket extracted a tan duffel bag from a pile of empty golfclub shipping boxes placed it on a workbench and dug out five ragwrapped hand guns four magnum revolvers and a mm semiauto i brought the auto just in case he told luellen were not gonna need it she said she picked up one of the guns flipped out the cylinder pointed it at one of her eyes and held her thumbnail under the open chamber to reflect light back up the barrel picked up another and did the same thing cant tell much but they look okay theyre all perfect mechanically cricket said they are clean and cold luellen looked at all five then pushed one at cricket and asked how much six he wouldnt come down on the price but he threw in two boxes of shells one of special and one on the way out the door luellen spotted a pair of shooters earmuffs and gave cricket another ten dollars now we can play guns she said lanny roses beauty boutique looked like it was permanently closed with fifteenyearold pastel green walkins accepted signs fading and badly askew in the windows luellen insisted on banging on the door anyway and a minute later lanny peered out from behind the closed sign he saw us popped the door and said jesus christ you almost knocked the front of the bidnis in weenie said the world looks better through rosecolored glasses luellen said yeah yeah fuck a bunch of weenies lanny said but he pushed the door open a bit and luellen and i followed him through the gloomy beauty parlor into a back room when we got there he was hanging a pale blue drape on a wall using pushpins stand there smile but only a little he said i stood and he took my picture twice with a polaroid passport camera then he took two pictures of luellen and said ill be back in a minute luellen said i think ill come along and watch she had her hand in her pocket and lanny said weenie promised you wouldnt be no trouble we wont be im just coming along to watch luellen said my friend will sit out here in front and read a magazine they were gone for twenty minutes i sat in a dusty beautyparlor chair and read a story in a fouryearold cosmo about how women can keep their men interested by learning the latest in blowjob techniquesthe techniques themselves were described blow by blow so to speak by a panel of successful new york advertising and media women i was not only convinced i was supportive when luellen and lanny came back lanny was complaining i never make copies of any faces weenie knows that i dont trust weenie luellen said back in the car she handed me four cards two texas drivers licenses and two credit cards one credit card matched each license will they stand up unless youre busted in which case theyll get your prints anyway she said theyre both real people and the accounts are real although we dont know the credit limits or the billing dates we could use them in an emergency but then theyd only be good until the guys next bill came in bobby could get us credit limits and billing dates i said might be worth doing on the way to lanes luellen launched a little philosophical discussion you know kidd you told me once that revenge doesnt make any sense because the dead guy wont know what youre doing and wont care because hes dead so what im wondering is what are we doing jack wont know and jack wont care were not really doing it for jack anymore i said we never were really were doing it for us they just pissed us off by killing jack not me especially i only met him that once nice guy but then im pissed about jack and youre coming along because of me and i dont have much choice im involved in this somehow and ive got to find out whats going on i dont want that crewcut asshole and his pal showing up at my house someday tidying up some loose end that i dont even know about so im involved only because youre involvedand because you say so thats right i said thats pretty smug what if i opted out you wont you couldnt stand not knowing what happened i said youd tell me no i wouldnt id never say a single word about it id deny all knowledge bullshit she snorted so youre in she let her eyes float to the tops of her eye sockets and then said for a while at lanes we ate lean cuisinesi had three of them an appealing mix of teriyaki stirfry swedish meatballs and mesquite beefand then luellen took lane and the revolver down to the basement i hate the goddamn things lane had said when luellen showed her the gun theyre the ubiquitous tools of modern life even if you dont like them it behooves you to know how to use one luellen said oh boy fifteen minutes after they went down the basement a single shot cracked through the house i jumped up peeked out the windows all around nothing moving i stuck my head down the basement door jesus luellen bang a second one and i nearly jumped out of my shoes all done luellen called the smell of burnt gunpowder coursed up the stairwell and a minute later luellen appeared at the bottom of the stairs had to squeeze off a round or two so shed have a sense of the recoil well knock it off for christs sakes its louder than hell up here i said aw once or twice no problem she said they were still down the basement when the phone rang i picked it up and a soft male voice said could i speak to mr kidd speaking this is lethridge green im a friend of a friend of a man named john i was told you have a body to guard yes in palo alto although there might be some travel i get two hundred fifty dollars a day plus any expenses green said thats fine how long would the body need to be guarded i dont know not just a couple of days thoughanything from a couple of weeks to a couple of months good dont ask dont tell exactly i said i can be there in two hours if youd like me to start tonight thatd be a relief i said were sort of afraid to leave the body alone then i will come directly then i will come directly not exactly what id expected from hired muscle but then with john you never knew exactly what you might get chapter a few minutes after talking to green i went out and checked my cache with bobby to see if hed gotten anything on the guy at the cemetery he had hed run the plate back to hertz dug through their computer and come up with the credit card and license information on the renter a lester benson of dallas using a corporate american express card issued to ammath the car had not been checked in yet lester benson hadnt seen that name before there was no hint of a second man in any of the hertz information but bobby was looking through airline reservation files to see if he could spot bensons seat from dallas to san francisco and then determine who might have been sitting next to him i left a note asking him to find everything he could on ammath and to dump all the information to my mailbox lethridge green was standing on lanes porch knocking on the door when i pulled up green looked like a big malcolm xtall too slender intent with round goldrimmed glasses short hair and a solemn searching intensity mr green i pushed through the door come on in youre mr kidd he said as he stepped inside his eyes took in the room and luellen and lane on the couch and the on the end table next to luellens hand i see a gun whats the situation here somebody killed my brother and somebody burglarized my house this afternoon lane started did you call the police yes they think it was burglars attracted by my brothers funeral you dont think so i know it wasnt we even know who it was but not exactly why green held up a finger before you tell me anything else maybe we should take the first security precaution what lane asked we all looked at him expectantly pull the drapes he said after wed pulled the drapes lane gave him the storynot all of it but most of it her brother being killed in dallas in suspicious circumstances the funeral the burglary at her home she told him about the fire but didnt mention that we were there she told him about our record search through hertz and the two names we had so far william hart mentioned by jack and lester benson from the hertz records were afraid they might come backthat they might think that jack passed information to me or computer files did he lane looked at me and i nodded yes he sent me some jaz disks a jaz disk is a highcapacity storage i know what a jaz disk is he said whats on it everything from memos to computer games to a lot of gobbledygook that we havent had time to figure out that we might not be able to figure out i said whatever it is we think jack might have been killed to keep it private the shootout might have been a setup the guard took a slug as part of a setup he asked skeptically the guard didnt see anything i said as far as he knows he might have been shot by the easter bunny he opens the door and boom hes down the other guy supposedly fires four times and jacks killed the guard didnt see a thing why didnt you just give them back the disks that might not help because we know about them and we cant erase that then theres this group called firewall i explained firewall as much as i knew about it youre starting to scare me green said if this is some kind of government thing the fbi or the cia or one of those other alphabet agencies i mean i dont want to be protecting a bunch of terrorists or spies or something do we look like terrorists im a college professor lane said a lot of terrorists start out as college professors he said well im not one of them she snapped im just scared were not asking you to crawl down a sewer pipe with a bomb in your mouth i said just keep her healthy thats it all i do is keep them off her thats it and if it gets heavy call the cops we already did that once and these guys ran for it which tells you where they are for how long he asked for a while two or three weeks anyway shes gonna have to make a trip to dallas in a couple of weeks these guys should have figured out that if she had anything theyd know about it one way or another he looked at me for a few seconds a steady gaze and finally nodded youre lying a little but if thats the basic idea of whats going on ill take the job green got a hardshell suitcase out of his car and i cleared out of the guest room ill get a room in luellens motel tonight i said itll have a clean phone line ill get with bobby about ammath and well start looking for firewall okay lane said she reached out and touched the on the table green asked you know how to use that i just shot a big stack of phone books down in the basement she said luellen told me if i need to just point it and keep pulling the trigger until i run out of bullets green sighed and said nuts i wasnt sure i liked leaving them alone in lanes house if they were targets they were just sitting there its easy to get lost in america for a few days or weeks anyway and if you try hard enough nobody can find you but sitting ducks there was a momentary awkwardness while i was checking into the motel luellen and i had spent quite a bit of time together and probably would again in the future and she wasnt involved with anybody and i wasnt that involved but the awkwardness went away and i checked into a separate room she came down ten minutes later with a couple of beers while i was talking to a guy named rufus carr in atlanta hows monger doing i asked rufus youre talking to a pentamillionaire he said i dont know what that is i got five million bucks in the bank m boy he said rufus was a fat redhaired man who affected a bad w c fields accent until i have to pay taxes anyway it works i asked of course it works i told you itd work i knew that i said yeah bullshit you were one of the naysayers you were one of the guys who said rufus was going to be eating frozen cheese pizza for the rest of his life well ill tell you what pal its nothing but orderout pepperoni and mushroom from now on and a private booth at taco bell ive got a favor to ask could you mong some stuff for me on what you know about firewall yeah the rumors are weird could you just pick up a few of the bigger sites where you see the rumors and mong them is there any money in it he asked fuck no but i wont burn your house down well thank you general sherman am i going to get in trouble i doubt it i said but this whole firewall thing is getting totally out of hand youre right its my patriotic duty besides im not doing anything else can i call you tomorrow sure ill put it on the trail right now and get it back tomorrow morning he said whats mong luellen asked when i hung up she was sitting on the bed with a beer bottle monger its a rumortracking program i said rufus built it for some securities companies they use it to bust day traders who try to spread rumors to move the stock market it works hell hes a pentamillionaire i said next i got back onto bobby he had some preliminary company stuff on ammath mostly public information pulled out of various open databases more interesting was his news on firewall got a new list supposedly with firewall they are exdeus fillyjonk fleece ladyfingers neoxellos omeomi pixystyx friends give me two hard ids near you fleece is jason b currier baja viejo santa cruz omeomi is clarence mason of lacoste road in petaluma wed gotten a map with the car i went out and got it and checked mason was maybe an hour or an hour and a half away up north of san francisco in marin county currier was practically across the street all part of the silicon valley culture thats grown up around san francisco like a bunch of magic mushrooms so were gonna find these guys luellen said first thing tomorrow im not an easy sleeper i kicked around the bed overnight getting a couple of hours here and another hour there with fifteen minutes of wideawake worrying in between i dont like big arrogant organizations that push people around or manipulate them or extort thembut i dont see it as my personal obligation to stop them i just go my own way i fish and paint and lie in the sunshine like a lizard i might steal something from one of them from time to time software or schematics or business plans but im very careful about it the whole ammath business was not my style i liked jack morrison he was a good guy as far as i knew but i really didnt know that much about him maybe that whole thing about k was bullshit maybe he made it up to pull me into whatever he was doing at ammath maybe he put the rumors out and lane herself was a computer freak maybe she was involved with firewall but if not k was cause for concern it was not a computer identity as such it was just an initial and there may be ten thousand people on the net who sign themselves with a k the same with bobby and stanfordthere are probably a thousand stanfords out on the net and i would imagine that there are quite a few people calling themselves fleece although omeomi is not quite as generic the troubling thing was the grouping i had heard most of those names at one time or another i even knew what a couple of them did although i didnt know who they were computer people a lot of them have the same attitude i do toward bigness toward bureaucracy toward being pounded into round holes they dont like it maybe there was a firewall and maybe some of these people were in it and because they were then iwas suspect paranoia is good for you if youre a crook but it doesnt make life any easier chapter st john corbeil corbeil was intent not angry not stunned not confused focused i dont know where she got them but she apparently knew they were important because she made copies hart was saying his voice was distant tinny with traffic in the background he was calling from a payphone in san jose a television was mounted on the wall opposite corbeils desk one of the talking heads on cnbc was chattering about the newest disaster on the nasdaq and the new york stock exchange muting was printed across his face in green letters like a tvchip editorial if she had access corbeil began speaking to hart we know she had access goddamnit nothing is clear hart said make it clear corbeil snapped whats the problem she had four jaz disks that probably came out of our supply room hart said they have that blue oem tint to the cases and we assume that her brother stole them to make his copies but on the other four disks the cases are clear plasticnot ours we looked in the wastebaskets and found a receipt from compusa which shows that she bought three threepacks of jaz disks nine disks we found one set of four disks in clear casesthe copiesand one blank disk in a clear case which means four are missing and thats the exact number youd need for another set of copies corbeil said picking up on it instantly goddamnit where are they thats the problem we dont know i can only think of one reason that she even made another set of copies for security reasons she ditched them somewhere yes thats what we think hart said we dont know exactly why shed go to the trouble though the thing is you cant load an oms file unless you have five hundred megs of memory not without making the computer go crazy her home computer had three hundred eightyfour megs and her laptop has one hundred twentyeight neither one had any of the files from the jaz drive on itnot even the small files so what are you saying that she never looked at them not at home hart said she could have taken them to her university office except that weve been cruising her place almost since she got here and as far as we know she hasnt been to the university so the question is if she doesnt even know whats on the disks whyd she make all those copies if she did could you take a look at her office doubtful its right off a college computer lab and there are always people around there day and night not right in her office but up and down the hall and around the lab weve got to get those disks before she does something with them we dont know what to do other than watch her we could snatch her and squeeze the disks out of her but man if she disappeared that might be one too many accidents even for the dallas police also theres been a guy hanging around with her maybe a boyfriend or something its like she doesnt want to be alone corbeil thought for a long time hart waiting through the pause as he thought with the cnbc mimes doing their silent chat opposite his desk it occurred to corbeil that hed like to fuck every single one of the reporting women but as for stock information he wouldnt trust any of them as far as he could spit a rat that was not a coincidence he thought that was marketing he wrenched himself back to the problem so keep an eye on her monitor her hart was disappointed corbeil could hear it in his voice he didnt say thats it but he wanted to instead he said we cant really hang around her neighborhood but if you want to cough up a couple of grand in cash i can put a bug on her car at least well know where she goes do it ill send the cash through american express ill find out where the local office is out there and youll have the money in a couple of hours how long will it take you to get the bug probably tomorrow ill have to call around good corbeil said one other thing i want you to start emailing reports to me ive set up a new account called um arclight arclight regular number tell me that youre monitoring them that youre watching them and ask for advice ill send one back that tells you to watch them for another week to see if they make any contacts that seem to reflect an association with firewall we can discuss the feasibility of going to the fbi dont be overly dramatic but mention something about national security we want to sound ethically challenged in the defense of the good old usa building a paper trail exactly give me a note or two every day reporting on the surveillance maybe even suggest that we might want to get an exfbi guy to do a blackbag job but ill turn you down on that all right ill get benson to chip in a report read it first hes not the brightest bulb in the chandelier when hart was off the line corbeil leaned back in his chair made a steeple with his fingers and thought about it harts memos would be useful in a couple of different ways if everything went smoothly and they either recovered the disks or discovered there was no second copy then the memos could stay in the files just as hart sent them if on the other hand the situation got out of control the memos could be altered to show an illegal operation running inside ammath the memos could be altered without changing the time stamp on them and a check of the phone records would show the matching calls coming and going since the arclight file had been opened from the computer in tom woodss office it would be at least credible that corbeil didnt know about it especially if woods wasnt around to testify thats all corbeil would need a level of credibility and the silence of contrary witnesses and a good lawyer of course chapter since i couldnt sleep anyway i kicked luellen out of bed at sixthirty and we went to look for clarence mason we stopped at a diner for cholesterol and caffeine got clogged in traffic heading into san francisco crossed the golden gate at eight oclock and after a bit of wandering luellen ran into a gas station and got a guess on the location of lacoste road masons place was a small darkgreen bungalow with an oldstyle twotrack drive nobody home why didnt i think of that i said back in the car most people work during the day we went out to a phone and i hooked up the laptop and got online with bobby mason he said had his own photography business in santa rosa we found him on the second floor of a downtown building above a flower store mason restorations the office door looked like it might open on a detective office from a noir movietextured glass with a goldleaf name inside it was all windows blond hardwood floors and hightech machinery the place had two roomsa big working space behind the counter at the entrance and a small glassedin office at the far end along the window wall the working space was occupied by a halfdozen topend macs a number of film and flatbed scanners and several large color printers three women were looking at a computer screen when we pushed through the door one of them straightened and walked over to the counter can i help you she asked were here to see mr mason do you have an appointment no but its fairly urgent a thirtyish blond man had looked up from a computer inside the glassedin office i was willing to bet he was mason could you tell him were friends of bobby we really need to talk to him luellen said from my shoulder with a smile just a minute please she walked back to the glassedin office stuck her head inside and said something i could see the blonds head bobbing she motioned to us and we pushed through the counter gate and down to the office the woman rejoined the other two who were looking at the yellowed image of an old woman apparently scanned from a paper photograph mason stood up looking unhappy im not sure if we know the same bobby if you go online and call him hell tell you were all right i said he swallowed and said im not online much anymore who are you you saw the list of the people in firewall im k he sat down and sat perfectly still for a moment except for his bobbing adams apple then said ive heard a couple of things about you if youre really k did you once have a contract with a wine company to help straighten out their distribution system yes then you know my friend clark he said miller i said he lives in st helena in a redwood house with a real redwood hot tub in back and his wifes name is tom exwife mason said she got the house he looked at luellen and said close the door luellen pushed the door shut and we sat down in a couple of wooden visitors chairs mason pushed both hands through his hair and said this firewalli dont know anything about it but my name is all over the place its driving me crazy whats going on i keep waiting for the fbi to show up i looked at luellen who shook her head to mason i said goddamnit you dont know anything he spread his handshonest to god i was sitting at my kitchen table reading the paper and eating shredded wheat and scanning this article on the lighter killing and all of a sudden i see this list with my name in itomeomi i almost choked to death i never heard of firewall before this thing now im supposed to be some sort of terrorist yeah me too and bobby were trying to figure out whats going on mason looked at luellen again are you on the list no im just a friend of ks and bobbys mason shook his head i dont know what to do ive thought about calling the fbi and identifying myself but i dont know i dont think thats a good idea i dont know your history i said i might wait a while before dragging in the law yeah so would i he wasnt a toughlooking guy but the way he said it suggested a need to stay away from the feds as a matter of privacy ethics and personality i didnt ask him what he did luellen wasnt so inhibited so whatd you do omeomi hold up banks she can be so perky when she wants that it works an odd magic on men especially technics who have residual fantasies about cheerleaders thats what i hear anyway mason showed a small grin and said no nothing like that i do specialty photography jeez when people say that i usually think porno luellen said its not porno he said you guys should talk sometime i said to luellen you could trade tips you do photography now he was a little more interested what kind specialty she said he actually chuckled leaned back and stretched thats the best kind isnt it we sat in silence for a couple of minutes and then i said well we better go what are you doing he asked just checking out whoever you can find from the list thats the idea between bobby and me on the original list of names we knew a few people none of us are involved with firewall then bobby tracked down you and one other guy through friends i guess we havent checked with the other guy but your story is like the rest of ours whatre you gonna do if you find them firewall i dont know bobby thinks we ought to turn them in if they did the lighter thing anyway do it he said find em and fuck em currier lived in an apartment in santa cruz again nobody home and bobby hadnt been able to find a job for him i checked with the manager telling her that i was an old friend in the area for a day hes gone to mexico on vacation she said when did he leave last week he said hed be gone for three weeks too bad you missed him now what luellen asked as we walked away back to rufus hes three hours ahead of uslets see if monger worked what do you think about currier he might be running hes on the list maybe hes got reason to run like you like all of us monger had worked a lot of the traffic was out of individual computers from about ten major sitesall colleges all easy to get into rufus said it looks like somebody went looking for online computers planted a rumor message in a virus that dumped it into aol message boards and other places like that in the days before the rumors started a lot of those ten sites had some extended traffic with a server in laurel maryland how much before the rumors started week or so thats about as far back as i can get before the universe gets too large for monger a week or so thats what it looks like does this help i have to think about it i said bobby came back with some info about ammath and the guy who ran it st john corbeil was a smart guy a guy who quit the marine corps as a major and moved to the national security agency he worked for the nsa for another five years doing nothing that bobby could find out about except getting an advanced degree in software design after a fiveyear hitch at nsa he quit moved to dallas and started his own hightech encryptionproducts firm hed taken a halfdozen nsa encryption math and software specialists with him the company had done well coming along with its product line just at the beginning of the internet boom corbeil was reasonably rich with his ten percent of ammath stock and his ceos spot i dont understand any of that encryption shit luellen said like this i said suppose you wanted to send me an internet note that said lets sneak into bill gates house and steal his dog if strong encryption is allowed you could run the message through a software packageyoud just push a buttonand it would be impossible for anybody to break anybody unless he had the key no matter how hotshit somebody elses computers were they couldnt break it but with the clipper chip thered be two keys id have one and the government would have one you could send the message and id get it okay but so would the government if they were watching wed get to bill gatess house and wed find a whole bunch of cops waiting and wed be standing there with our dicks in our hands or a can of alpo in my case she said jack had had a small house in santa cruz about a mile from curriers apartment after he was killed the fbi had gotten a warrant to go through the place and lane told them where to find the keys the day after the funeral shed called to see if she could get back in and the feds had no objection theyd turned the place over and had taken out everything that appeared to be computerrelated along with all his old phone bills personal correspondence and so on while luellen and i were looking up firewall names lane and green had gone over to the house to look around and to start cleaning up thats what lane had called it cleaning up what she meant was throwing away anything that couldnt be sold or given away all the small pieces of a lifeposters notes letters unidentifiable photos like that jack had never had children so there was nobody to get it except his sister nobody to wonder who this ancestor had been and to sit down in or and paw through the remains when they got back green said somebody was there before any of us somebody spread the lock on the back door gotta be the ammath guys i said maybe theyre happy since they got the disks from you whatd you find out about firewall lane asked nothing i said i ran it down for her this guy who went to mexico green said he could have gone for more than one reason youre assuming he went because he was scared because he was on the list like mason but what if hes running because he is with firewall i mentioned that luellen said kidd didnt buy it hes got a theory whats the theory there is no firewall i said its bullshit made up out of whole cloth then we launched into one of those circular arguments in which you almost feel as though you can grasp whats going on but theres always one critical piece missing from every possible logical construction lane started it exactly what would that do lane asked if somebody made up firewall why would they do it to cover some other reason for killing lighter i suggested they didnt have anything to cover the police thought it was a mugging they werent happy but ive never heard there was any other big investigation going on before the firewall thing came up clipper ii was dying is dying maybe they thought if one of the clipper ii people was killed by hackers thered be some kind of groundswell theres not going to be any groundswell lane said the feds might want clipper ii but its too late everybody knows its too late it doesnt have anything to do with preferences or laws trying to get rid of strong encryption and replace it with the clipper ii would be like trying to get rid of pi or the round earth theory its too fucking late then how did all of those names come up all of a sudden mine and bobbys and jacks and omeomi and the others i asked we are linked if you look at it from the right direction we are a conspiracy because a lot of us sure as shit have conspired with each other i dont know i dont know why firewall came up i dont know how it ties in but it seems to theres something out there and its not totally made up something is happening and jack is dead and lighter is dead but it might just be coincidence how could it possibly be she ticked it off on her fingers jack is connected with clipper ii and ammath and firewall firewall kills lighter who is connected with clipper ii and ammath but we cant find a single person who is really connected with firewall i said not a single one green asked did jack know lighter i shook my head not as far as we know might be something to check i turned to luellen whod kept her mouth shut during the argument what do you think three choices she said yeah look at ammath keeping digging at firewall get the fuck out lane wanted to go after ammath because of her brother green didnt much care his job was to take care of lane which he would do one way or the other luellen was edging toward the door you cant fight a bureaucracy she said you just become a goal they put the goal in memos its like trying to argue with the irs but i couldnt quit not yet the names were out there and once the cops started unraveling a few identities they would probably get them alland we could get hurt without ever knowing why or what was happening i have to find out more about firewall i said just for selfprotection if ammaths involved then ill look into ammath youre giving up on jack lane asked it sounds like youre giving up no but weve got to be careful from what it looks like ammath may be more than some meanass private company jack may have been messing with something seriousbigtime trouble of the kind we really dont want to know about what does that mean that means that the only way to get at them would be politics we find some paper we sic your senator on them they do an internal investigation and cough somebody up and disown him but if jack was killed by some kind of operation thats gonna be tough the best thing we could do i thought was to run down the monger information in maryland maybe with luck wed find some fourteenyearold computer hack at the bottom of the firewall conspiracy we could dump him in the lap of the local sheriff get a good laugh out of the press and go home fat chance luellen said it could happen i said its better than trying to crawl through ammaths basement window what about lane green asked call the dallas cops and tell them that youre coming out to pick up jacks computers and whatever other property they seized that they dont want anymore but that youve got to close down his home out here first and you guys will be in maryland doing what lane asked you know i said looking around we flew out of san francisco the same night before we left when we were at the motel packing i went back out to bobby and told him that wed be moving to washington he booked us businessclass seats on an evening flight into national and a car under one of the phony ids luellen had been using in new york that id was more solid than the two wed picked up in san francisco and the credit cards that went with them were definitely good bobby had also developed more stuff on corbeil and ammath corbeil was a smart guy but he was also nuts he spent way too much time thinking about godless socialists mindless bureaucrats confiscatory taxation black agitators the yellow peril the red menace the international jewish conspiracy and the new world order hed been known to allow in public that hitler had done a lot of good things ive never been much interested in politics but once wrote some doityourself polling that allowed lowrent politicians to do their own telephone polls i eventually sold off the business but before i did i got to know quite a few politicians they were a pretty lively bunch no more or less corrupt than schoolteachers newspaper reporters cops or doctors anyway it didnt take much exposure to politics for me to realize that there are as many nuts on the left as there are on the right and in the long run the lefties are probably more dangerous but in the short run if you find a guy on top of your hometown clock tower with a cheap chinese semiauto assaultweapon lookalike that guy will be one of corbeils buddies dreaming of black helicopters and socialist tanks massing on the canadian border preparing to pollute americas vital fluids smart and nuts corbeils description sounded a little like an advertisement for breakfast cereal but wasnt bobby had more about corbeils lifestyle as portrayed by the local city magazines corbeils salary was modest for a ceo running about a year but then he also owned a big chunk of ammath stock he liked fast cars and blond women he made a point of being seen with dallass flavoroftheday model one of them had been a playboy playmate of the month bobby included the centerfold picture why do they shave their pubic hair into those little stripes luellen asked we contemplated this mystery for a moment then i said maybe they dont wear oshkosh bgosh brand bathing suits like some people you think lots more stuff ill send it as soon as i weed through it havent picked out ammath computer lines yet will get back later anything on the jaz yes opened the big files got photos very high res all the same parking lot dont understand can you make jpeg leave in my box yes also copy out jaz disks overnight them to wash hotel ok on the flight we talked about what next we didnt know what ammath was doing in anything more than a general sense or why jack might have been killed if he wasnt killed exactly like the ammath people said he was i still suspected that firewall was a phantom gonna have to spend some more time with jacks jaz disks i said therere only four i looked at her four jaz disks at two gigabytes each i said you could put two thousand pretty fat novels on one of them were dealing with as much text as youd get say in eight thousand tom clancy novels whoa a bigger whoa than you think i closed my eyes and held up a finger to indicate that i was thinking a minute later i had it if you broke everything up into texts the size of clancy novels and looked in each one of them for one minute and worked forty hours a week at it itd take you better than three weeks to look in all of them for one minute each one minute i said youre a mathematical fucking marvel she said thats not the end of the problem i said the biggest part of it is we dont know whats bullshit and whats not we thought about that and she said i see a light at the end of the tunnel yeah yeah jack looked for less than a week and he apparently found something unless they just killed him for trying to take it an hour out of washington with nothing to do i got out the tarot deck and did a couple of spreads luellen watched with mixed skepticism and nervousness and finally said well just bullshit i said confusion let me cut the deck i gave the deck a light shuffle and let her cut it she cut out the devil card the devil represents a force of evil but not usually from the outside not a standard bad guy the devil is usually inside he sits on top of you controlling you without your even being aware of it thats bad she said i can tell by your face chapter in the course of my life id spent maybe six months in washington though it might not be fashionable to admit it i like the place usually portrayed as a mass of greedheads packed liked oiled sardines inside the beltway washington has nice places to walk and good art to look at people who like central italy the campagna would like the rural landscape out in virginia we got into national late and picked up the car and a map we wouldnt be right in washington according to rufus the server we were looking for was in laurel which is actually closer to baltimorenot far i noticed on the map from fort meade headquarters of the national security agency id had some dealings with the nsa when i was in the military and id always been impressed by two things their employees technical expertise and their arrogance i hadnt had anything to do with the agency for a couple of decades but because it was so heavily involved in computers there was always a lot of backandforth between nsa computer geeks and the outside computer world word got around and the word was that the nsa was rapidly becoming obsolete once upon a time agency operatives could tap any phone call or radio transmission in the world they could put mao tsetungs private words on the presidents desk an hour after the maximum leader spoke them into his office phone they could provide realtime intercepts to the special ops people in the military no more the world was rife with unbreakable codesany good university math department could whip one up in a matter of days just as bad the most critical diplomatic and military traffic had come out of the air and gone underground into fiberoptic cable even if a special forces team managed to get at a cable messages were routinely encoded with ultrastrong encryption routines the nsa was going deaf and the word was they didnt know what to do about it theyd become a bin full of aging bureaucrats worried about their jobs and spinning further and further out of the washington intelligence center luellen and i checked into a ramada inn off i near laurel maryland separate rooms under separate ids gave us some easy options if there were trouble in the burglary business you never know when you might need a bolthole the next morning after pancakes and coffee and the new york times for me and the wall street journal for luellen we went looking for the server the tl line it used was located in a suburban office complex called the carterbyrd center building we found it fifteen minutes from the motel two rows of four twostory yellowbrick buildings facing each other behind small parking lots on a deadend street the tenants were professional services companies accountants financial advisors a legal publishing firm a title company and several law firms most of them occupied an entire floor or building wing the company we were looking for bloch technology was one of the small companies grouped with other smaller companies in a suite of offices in the end building on the right luellen dressed in a dark blue business suit and navy low heels clipped her miniature panasonic movie camera into her briefcase gave me a hot little kiss on the lipsgoing into a job always turned her onand headed for to do the first reconnaissance i waited in the car the idea was she was looking for one of the other companies in carterbyrd but got the building wrong shed be inside we thought for two or three minutes fifteen minutes after shed disappeared through the double glass doors i was about ready to go in after her then she walked back outside with a guy in a shortsleeved white shirt who pointed up the hill toward the first building she nodded and they talked for a few more seconds she laughed patted his arm and started for the car i slumped a little lower in the passenger seat the guy watched her go he wasnt watching her shoulders as she came up to the car i slumped another six inches she climbed into the drivers seat fired it up backed out of the parking space and we headed up the hill hes back inside she said as we pulled away i pushed myself up that took a while i knocked on the doorits got a vermond combination pad not alarmedand asked where clayton accounting was and we got to chatting she said those computer people are amazing theyve got all these interesting machines really really hes got five of them they look like air conditioners all lined up in the back room two rooms three one is a standard office one has the computers one has a futon on the floor and a miniature refrigerator where he keeps his cokes is he in there alone therere two desks but one of them looks pretty unusedlike maybe a parttimer i got the phone number shed pissed me off a little by casually talking to the guy were gonna have to do a really light break if we screw anything up hell remember talking to you hell remember your face i thought it was worth the effort and you know what there is no security the rest rooms are on the second floor i went into the ladies room and theres a drop ceiling but its a mess above it if we went up and anybody came in to clean up theyd know so what do we do im thinking about it all right i looked at my watch lets go get some deodorant and then we can hang out for the day you can think we found a drugstore and i bought a travelsized can of a womans deodorant the kind that advertises actual freshening powder in its spray and a couple of cokes we drank the cokes on the way back to carterbyrd this time luellen slumped in the seat while i went inside carrying her briefcase so i looked like i had a reason to be there the building was essentially a long string of business offices opening off central hallways that ran the length of the building there was nobody in the hall when i walked inside and i made a left slipped the deodorant can out of my pocket and gave it a couple of shakes bloch technology was the third door on the left i spotted the keypad as i came up looked both ways and then gave it a thorough spraying with the deodorant i waved my hand in the air a couple of times to disperse the smell as best i could then headed back out total time in the building less than one minute total people encountered none so lets go hang out i said we hung out more or less i took her to a driving range where she hit golf balls and very well with a fiveiron older than she was and with a threewood that was not only wood but was no bigger than her fist i did some quick sketches of her swing later we caught a movie and in between i got back to bobby who had what he called a curiosity a sudden spate of rumors on the net that firewall was planning a major attack bobby knew about rufus and the monger i suggested that he call rufus and have him trace the latest round of rumors and i had a new question of my own that popped into my head just as we were signing off bobby said will trace rumors soonest ok call tonight yes new thought look at airlines see if jm flew in days before he was killed yes will also check gas card also jpeg in your box thanks i downloaded the jpeg which is a picture format and saved it to examine later after the movie which sucked luellen pointed me at a sporting goods store where she bought a spool of black monofilament fishing line called spider wire we went back to the motel looked at the movies shed made that morning at blochfive dell servers sitting on heavy plastic benches with a monitor and keyboard off to the sidethen had a slow dinner at a fast diner the nerves were getting on top of me like they always do after dinner we went back to the motel picked up her bag and at seven oclock when it was good and dark we were back at carterbyrd there were maybe forty offices in seven or eight still showed lightsamericans work all the time no getting around it bloch technology was not one of the lighted offices blochs futon was only a tiny cloud on the horizon we took the end space in the parking lot and luellen tied one end of the spider wire around the steering wheel led the line out through the window across the lawn to the door she checked to make sure that nobody was coming from inside she did a quick knot on the outside door handle cut the line at the spool and strolled back to the car when she was back and inside she pulled the line tight until it stretched absolutely invisible directly across the sidewalk to the door now if somebody wants to use the sidewalk theyll simply have to go around i said either that or garrote themselves if somebody comes we cut the string it flies halfway back across the yard and nobody sees it did you ever do this before no but i read about it we sat in the lot for twenty minutes before the door opened and the rest worked just like luellen thought it would the guy pushed through the door and walked away headed toward his car in the parking lot she put pressure on the door as it slid closed gotta hurry she grunted i dont know if the linell hold the doors heavier than i thought hang on hang on i didnt want the guy who was leaving to see me get out of the car when he was up the hill i hurried across the lawn shed stopped the door just as it touched the doorpost i pulled it open and snapped the line off the handle we were in luellen had programmed blochs phone number into her cell phone earlier in the evening and dialed the number as she got out of the car the hallway leading past bloch tech was empty i walked to the door luellen close behind and mimed a knock we could hear the phone ringing inside no answer as i mimed another knock luellen turned off her phone and pointed a little batteryoperated black light the kind teenagers used to buy in head shops at the keypad the powdery crystals in the deodorant fluoresced in the lightexcept for the three that had no powdery crystals foursixseven she said but there are four digits in a vermond lock in this model so they repeated one of them nobody in the hall i took a dime notebook out of my pocket and began scrawling number combinations as quickly as i could write calling them out as i jotted them down the thing about number pads is with ten digits there are possible combinations getting inside with a bruteforce attack is tough and a few locks but not this one were alarmed or would lock up after a certain number of incorrect combinations then they could only be opened with a key but if you know the four digits involved in the combination ah then there were only twentyfour possible combinations if one of the digits is repeated like it was here and you dont know which the number goes up to thirtysix but most people start their combination with the lowest number in this case a four we started with fourfoursixseven and went to fourfoursevensix and to foursixfourseven and so on we were lucky hit it on the eighth combination and pushed into the darkened office gloves luellen said we pulled on vinyl gloves and followed the hairthin beams of the flashlights into the server room the dell servers looked like five little dwarfs lined up for breakfast the room was windowless and windowless was good the futon was rolled into a corner of the third room with a fuzzy blue blanket tossed carelessly on top of it luellen using her flash found a roll of tape in the outer office and brought the blanket into the server room we taped the blanket to the wall so it covered the door and then luellen slipped under the blanket into the outer office and closed the door behind her i pulled the blanket so it covered the door completely and turned on the light lights on i said then i turned if off and luellen pushed back inside almost perfect she said there was a little tiny dot of light near the right corner we rearranged the blanket and i went to work on the machines servers are nothing but specialized computers optimized for communications and storage if youve got a relatively modern home computer you could use that as a small server with the right software in this raid we wouldnt be going after the content inside the servers we wanted access rather than content i spent twenty minutes pawing through blochs software and servicemaintenance manuals and then got into the servers themselves they were running on a standard offtheshelf unix server package i had root in five minutes with an outside maintenance account then i dumped in a little access program of my own ive done this before after checking it i shut down local access turned the light off again pulled down the blanket and cleaned up the tape while i was working on the machine luellen had been going through paper files in the outer office using her flash all bullshit she said tax forms bank statements advertisements one of the forms listed toby bloch as owner of percent of bloch technology stock is that the guy you talked to i asked i crumpled up the blanket and tossed it back on the futon more or less as it had been thats the guy toby all right nice little business he has here with everything back in place we listened at the door heard nothing and walked out out to the car and we were gone nothing to it but there was trouble back at the ranch i wouldnt go online with the server until after midnight when there was less chance that the real system operator was online instead i checked with bobby to see if he had anything more on jack morrison or firewall he did look at news programs firewall attacks irs with dos big trouble now attack maybe starts in switzerland style feels german will look anything on jm jm flies to baltimorewashington international on monday before shooting returns same night rented hertz miles no more detail also flies to bwi on thursday afternoon back friday morning no car no hotel on card thanks will look at news this is very dangerous later i thought about that until luellen said what jack morrison was in town the night lighter was killed i said thats not good no but lanes lecture about jack and guns thats still pretty straight i still cant see jack shooting anyone whats this about the irs i dont know i said bobby seems more worried about that than about jack jacks dead i said i checked the times and washington post online editions but they had nothing on the attack on the irs cnn had a story but like a lot of cnn stuff most of it seemed to have been garbled by a mentally challenged paranoiac i clicked over to the wall street journal which had a short item a denialofservice computer attack aimed at the internal revenue service has caused a major disruption in the handling of endofquarter business tax filings an irs spokesman confirmed this afternoon the attack which began this morning is continuing the attacking group has identified itself as firewall a denialofservice attack attempts to flood the target with huge numbers of legitimatelooking transactions eventually overwhelming the target computers ability to cope with the numbers while official department of justice sources said that the attack is limited one highlevel irs official who asked not to be identified said that there has been a major disruption of endofbusinessquarter tax filings he said that tens of thousands of business quarterly returns were involved and said that the attack seemed to be spreading an fbi spokesman said that many of the dos calls appear to be coming from smallcollege computer labs what apparently happened is that some individual or group planted small attack programs inside these open computers and designed them to go off at the same time we are getting in touch with these schools as we identify them asking that they go offline long enough to remove the programs from their computers most of them have no idea that their computers are participating in the attack fbi spokesman larry conners said conners said that the attack program is an unsophisticated one but the irs official said that it takes advantage of the fact that the irs computers must be open to the outside to receive legitimate tax returns the attack involves sending and resending hundreds of legitimatelooking but slightly flawed returns which the irs computers then attempt to return to the sender as the volume built the computers were no longer capable of handling the flow of traffic individually the attack filings wouldnt be a problem the problem is that they just keep coming over and over from so many different sources the irs source said the fbis conners said that the attack may have started in switzerland with the attack programs planted as long as a month ago if the attack isnt sophisticated its not sophisticated but a fire ant isnt sophisticated either i said but you get a few thousand of them swarming up your shorts and youve got a problem if the feds get really pissed and start hammering on that list of names who knows where itll end thereve been other attacks like this i read about one in newsweek yeah but theres a huge difference i said before they were messing with private businesses the politicians public attitude was well thats too bad but the real feeling was fuck a bunch of private businessesthose guys got too much money anyway but now these guys are messing with the politicians money ah yeah big ah the jpeg photo that bobby sent me was still on my hard drive i opened it and took a look a parking lot apparently taken from a fairly high angle three men in suits were walking across a parking lot full of pickup trucks all three of them were carrying briefcases and one had his face turned up toward the camera the resolution of the jpeg was not high enough to make out the faces all of the photos bobby had said were the same so who are they luellen asked i dont know if the pictures important it must be that the three shouldnt be together you know like a gangster and a cop or a chinese and an american i said look at this guy theres something about him that looks oriental shape of his face unless its a woman huh i dont know and i didnt late that night i went into bloch techs server theres so much stuff in a server even a small one that theres no realtime handson way to sort through itits not like flipping through a book its like flipping through a library like trying to make sense of jacks disks i did a search for references to firewall and found several hundred in saved email and in postings on web sites six accounts seemed to have a lot of traffic about firewall i went into the administrative files pulled the accounts and copied out names and addresses as i finished i noticed a peculiarity they were all new accounts theyd all signed up in the last two weeks and theyd all paid the upfront minimum of three months by check rather than opting for creditcard payments damn it ill bet the names are fakes i told luellen i saved the names i could ship them to bobby later and have him look them up since i had the administrative files up i checked for jack morrison and came up empty then on the offchance i checked terrence lighter and got a surprise lighter had an account on this server and better yet his email had dozens of letters a few were encrypted so i skipped over those most of the rest were letters to and from collectors and dealers in antique scientific instruments apparently a hobby of his and there was one letter that said unencrypted and in the clear the sunday before last mr morrison i will see you tomorrow at my office at please bring the files with you thank you tl lighter chapter at three in the morningmidnight pacific timei called lane green answered the phone and said we got somebody on us what do you mean somebody watching not close but theyre around its almost like being paranoid but ive seen one carits green and i think its a camrya few too many times and a face looking toward us always a couple of blocks away what do you think we need to get out of here if we can lose them id feel a lot easier here were pinned like butterflies okay weve got a couple more things to do here but well be in dallas the day after tomorrow or the day after that not later than you could surprise them somehow get out to the airport ditch the car get on a plane what if theyve got people in dallas fly to seattle first i suggested all right ill talk to lane about it how is she antsy but here you talk to her lane came on and i told her about jack and lighter that jack may have found something at ammath that needed lighters attention she didnt immediately pick up on the problem of the second trip i knew something was going on she said if jack was talking to this guy and this guy was killed then weve got to tell somebody this proves it that something was going on with ammath it doesnt prove anything in particular i said and the second tripthats a problem i dont see a problem the guy theyll say jack shot him i said that stopped her only for a few seconds but we know he didnt she argued he wouldnt do that theyve got a gun in texas that was stolen in san jose years ago theyve got witnesses who say he was the shooter and one of those witnesses took a bullet in the chest now if they ever get around to looking they can show that he flew into baltimore late in the afternoonafter working hoursand flew back the next morning his nsa contact was murdered right in the middle of that time period and he never said a word about it to anyone that stopped her for a little longer okay that sounds bad when you put it that way but maybe he didnt even know about it theres another problem if we pass information to the fbi where did we get it we could finesse that an anonymous call from dallas all right we could figure something out maybe well do it but later when the information doesnt look so incriminating or when theres something else to go with it how are the burns i asked the bad ones are peeling like a heavy tan the lighter ones are almost gone not much pain anymore everything itches like crazy have you talked to the dallas cops again yup the lead detective of the case called today and wanted me to fly out i told him itd be a couple of days yet and got on his case about ammath again howre you fixed for cash i asked im okay you need some no but get green to use his credit cards when you go to dallas and give him cash to pay him back they dont know who he is so they wont be able to track him using his credit cards take your cell phone of course wherere you guys going weve got some more research to do here and then well hook up with you in dallas stay with the phone i have never been a particularly good sleeper my sleep wake cycle is about twentyfive hours long so i tend to push the clock around until im sleeping all day and working all night then i just keep pushing in any case seven hours is about right anything shorter than that and i tend to get grumpy i got fairly grumpy when luellen ran her cold fingers up my spine at eight oclock in the morning i nearly bounced off the ceiling which she thought was moderately hilarious youre gonna give me a fuckin heart attack some day i snarled at her and there were some teeth behind the snarl i didnt like her sneaking up on me howd you get in the lock is shit she said wonderful thats just fuckin great you give me an aneurysm because you want somebody to talk to at breakfast no no i had some seriously bad news to share with you but youre being such a mean asshole that im not going to do it she said she crossed her arms what news say please give me the fuckin news or ill breathe on you the feds busted bobby she said what the news left me completely disoriented whered you get this who called its on tv they busted him last night and hell be arraigned today in federal court in new orleans they say hes involved in the attacks on the irs and that the attacks are continuing sonofabitch i fumbled the tv remote off the nightstand and punched up cnn at the same time i asked luellen did you bring the cold phone yeah cnn was doing an advertisement for itself when they got back to news they were doing the weather i hopped out of bed got my notebook and used the cold phone to punch up john smiths phone number in longstreet john answered on the first ring he was wideawake this is the guy from upriver i said is it true we dont know i dont think so but this guy whoever it is is gonna be in court in two hours so well know for sure then our guys offline though all his numbers are down they wouldnt be down unless he took them down i said if the feds grabbed him they would have left the lines up to see who called theres something else if they busted him at his place theyd most likely be taking him to court in jackson not in new orleans i dont know where his place is at but im glad to hear you say it i said we talked about it for another minute poking through clues from a tv broadcast neither of us had seen yet ill get back i said how much trouble are we in luellen asked depends on whether they really got him and if they did what they got and if hes willing to deal ive never met him facetoface but if he wanted to deal he could hurt a lot of us he knows all about anshiser he knows about longstreet he knows about modoc and redmond all jobs involving what we lightly call industrial espionage maybe you ought to back away from this thing luellen said get back home and maybe pack a suitcase something to think about i said though i wouldnt be good at running how does ten years in the federal penitentiary sound she asked thereve got to be other options gotta be we looked at each other and i realized how hooked up i really was id always thought of myself as something of a loner going my own way doing what i wanted when i wanted to do it but bobby knew about meknew where to find meand so did luellen and john smith and now lane ward knew a couple of things and so did twenty or thirty other people if the feds somehow managed to get them all in the same room they could hang me you can get stubborn she said but i still reserve the right to split you know that anytime i said thatd always been the deal and shed always been protective of her identity background and home nobody knew much about luellen not even me we watched television for a half hour and i got cleaned up we saw one item on bobby which said just that hed been caught and was believed to be a leading member of firewall and was coordinating the attack on the irs the attack was still going on and the government was considering an extension of filing dates for quarterly business returns congress was squealing like a herd of stuck pigs you were right about what gets them excited luellen said we went out to breakfast but neither of us said much i spent the time trying to figure out what to do next and one thing kept coming up call the cops the problem would be to get the cops to listen especially since they thought they knew what was going on and we were the bad guys not having bobby to do research is like i dont know like going blind i told luellen as we walked back to the hotel what more research do we need anything that would get the bureaucracy running in a different direction theyre tearing up the world looking for fifteen or twenty of us and we havent done anythingi mean nothing that they think we did somebody has to talk to them not me of course not youre not in jeopardy but i might try to find somebody icould talk to i could find somebody if i had bobby back at the hotel i changed to shorts and a tshirt and went for a run the cell phone clipped uncomfortably into the shorts luellen went shopping i did three miles fairly hard and the exercise felt good after all the time cooped up in cars and planes and small rooms when i got back i jumped in the shower again for a quick rinse and was just toweling off when john called its not him he said he sounded bubbly which was not usually the case the guy they busted is white they just had a picture of the cops walking him into federal court ah jesus i hope our guys okay so do i he cant runnot literally anyway he needs to stay at the business if he calls tell him i need him do that he said after hanging up i turned the television down and went out on the net trying to learn about the nsa and find some names i got nothing but bullshit but i have a few mailboxes scattered around under different names and ids and when it became obvious that i wasnt going to get anything useful off the net i checked the box at aol i found a message six digits beginning with bobby i said aloud he knew a couple of the boxes i tried the next one and found seven more digits the last box was empty i picked up my laptop got the acoustic earmuffs out of my travel bag and headed for the door i called from a driveup pay phone at a gas station two miles from the motel using the muffs earmuffs are a valuable item if you travel it makes no difference what the country what the phone system or what the line voltages areif you can get an audible signal from your home internet service provider you can get online i dialed using the old protocol and after getting the i typed in k that wasnt me no shit tell me what did the woman do after the amazing events on the mississippi i got a couple of seconds of silence as he thought about it i wanted some confirmation that i was actually talking to bobby and he was quick bobby was he came back with a womans name the right one marvel i need several names of nsa guys that i can talk to privately about firewall server in md has nsa clients firewall rumors may come from nsa fbi be better to talk to nsa may disappear server material would prefer to talk to inperson fbi has guns ok will check nsa names maybe get fbi names also i can do that will you be at this number no changing numbers with each contact limiting calls to min will leave new for you like this time will dump nsa information to sf box before i signed off i gave him the information that would give him system administrator status at the bloch technology server and suggested that he look at the client list will do that must go take care you too luellen was waiting when i got back i quickly filled her in on what had happened so what do we do now she asked wait until bobby gets us a contact and you want to talk to this guy personally yeah if we do it online or call as far as he might know it could be some teenaged crank if we look him up personally we can be a little more definite its a risk yeah and you know ive been thinking bobby thought maybe we should go to the fbi instead of the nsa because the nsa might just decide to dump whatevers on that server so if he gets us some fbi names maybe we should drop a note to them too lets think about it we went out and hit more golf balls and went to another movie which also suckedthereve been a whole line of movies starring old actionadventure stars paired with much much much younger women theyre kinda creepyand kept checking the mailbox at two oclock the sf box which has an ancient heritage going back to the original well popped up with three paragraphs of type the recommended nsa contact was an executive in the security section a woman named rosalind welsh she was high enough up that she could talk directly to the top levels of the bureaucracy far enough down that shed not have any minders and bobby said she was newly divorced with a son going to college her husband was also an nsa exec but he was showing a new address while rosalind welsh kept the glen burnie address and the old phone number all of that taken together meant that she was living alone we also got five names with the fbi including the personal home phone number of the director if we used it i thought we should get some attention and finally bobby said ran bloch server clients against nsa roster of three thousand clients appear to be nsa amazing nsa is firewall maybe get out of server i may talk to fbi yes if i was going to talk to rosalind welsh personally i needed to cover my face and hair luellen recommended a halloween mask since halloween was coming and they should be easy to find and because from any distance they dont look like masks we drove all the way to philadelphia to get it a fullface molded rubber mask of bill clinton it worked fine except that i couldnt talk very well through the mouth slit and we wound up snipping off the lips with sewing scissors we got a plastic water pistol from a toy store and a baseball hat to complete the outfit we went to philadelphia because it was only two hours away by car and luellen had contacts therea gun guy who id met once and now it turned out a phone guy we got another cold cell phone guaranteed for a week for we were back in baltimore a little after seven oclock glen burnie is south of the city and we were scouting welshs house at seventhirty lights shes home luellen said so we cruise it a couple of times and i hit the door youre gonna scare the life out of her and the other problem is what if theres somebody in there with her theres a garage window i said i can check the garage on my way upsee how many cars are in there not perfect she said nothing is we didnt need to do it anyway we were cruising the place for the third time picking out a place for luellen to wait with the car when rosalind welsh walked out the front door of her house did a few stretches in the driveway and jogged off down the street we rolled slowly past and i got a look at her she was probably fifty and ran with the earnest hunchedup stance of somebody who hadnt been running long but was determined to lose the armchair ass lets do it on the street i said stop ahead of her and let me out in front of a house without lights ill bend over the car like im saying goodbye and when she comes up ill stop her shell see the car maybe get the plates pull into a driveway so were sideways to her when i stop her ill turn her around and you pull out and go around the corner when im done ill get her jogging the other direction this worries me yeah well its better than the door if she screams luellen asked ill run this was the only part of what i do that bothers methe involvement of innocents in ways that might hurt them for the most part when im working ill take information from one place and deliver it to another in most cases i can make at least a thin argument that what i do benefits the population as a wholeencourages competition saves jobs etc but sometimes although i regret it i involve an innocent like this lady a bureaucrat a little too heavy earnestly chugging off the pounds on a quiet suburban street whatever else came out of it i was about to scare the hell out of her i wouldnt do it if not for the firewall thing i pulled the mask over my head put on the cap and got the plastic gun out luellen guided us past her again and pulled into a driveway a half block ahead i got out and bent over the open door luellen said a hundred feet seventyfive fifty forty shut the door and make your move i stood up slammed the door and turned to the sidewalk rosalind welsh was twenty feet away and smiled reflexively as i turned toward her i said feeling the rubber edges of the mask flapping against my lips mrs welsh stop where you are i have a gun pointed at you dont scream just stop and i wont hurt you as i said the words i moved to block her she tried to turn but i said sharply dont and when she saw my face she opened her mouth and shrank away and i said sharply dont scream i wont hurt you i just want to talk she looked all around and i stepped close directly between her and the car and said i have to ask you to turn around were going to back the car out of the driveway and we dont want you to see the license plates if you do well you dont want to see them just turn around and look straight ahead and when your back is to the car ill walk around and face you i tried to keep talking quietly in a nonfrightening way explaining what was happening giving her something to focus on when she was turned i edged around her and said dont look at the car luellen backed out of the driveway and turned at the corner im one of the people the nsa is putting out rumors aboutim supposedly a member of firewall along with several friends but we are not i told welsh we began researching the situation trying to figure out what was going on are you aware of the source of the firewall rumors sir we dont have much to do with trying to find firewall thats the fbi she was scared on the edge of bolting calling me sir the firewall rumors are coming from an isp called bloch technology in laurel i said its a private server whose clients are almost all nsa employees we believe that the nsa is firewall and will inform the fbi of our conclusions tonight the fear was receding i could see it in her eyes shed become interested in what i was saying you think the nsa is attacking the irs we think a group of european morons is attacking the irs and jumped on the firewall name because it was already notorious and it sounds neat she asked have you ever heard of a man called bobby i hesitated but in hesitating answered the question so you have yes the fbi and our security people are debriefing him now she said an implied threat showing a little guts again i hesitated but theyd find out soon enough what they had that would very much surprise me i said since hes the one who got me your name this afternoon her eyebrows went up youre joking im afraid not the guy you picked up may be named bobby but hes not bobby what about terrence lighter she asked now i had to make a decision again a tough one but what the hell have you heard the name jack morrison yes nothing more then you know he was supposedly shot to death by a guard at one of your contracting companiesammath in dallas he was definitely shot to death by a guard i held up a finger we dont think so we think he was killed by the same people who killed lighter look at lighters outgoing email hes on the bloch server then look at morrisons travel he came to see lighter twice last week the last time the night lighter was killed the lighter and morrison murders go together and they were coordinated through an isp thats basically a server used by your people she shook her head why should i believe you dont just investigate youre a security executive do your job i glanced back over my shoulder wed been talking for two or three minutes i thought but it felt like an eternity ive got to go i will call you to find out if youre moving on the case if you are we wont have to if you dont we will and we make no guarantees about who gets hurt we will call the fbi tonight about the bloch technology server i took a step back and she said would you have shot me if i screamed i looked down at the pistol in my hand shook my head and tossed it to her she picked it out of the air as i jogged away its not loaded i said as i went i didnt want it to leak on my pants she was still standing there when i turned the corner she called after me nice talking to you bill a little guts so are you going to call the fbp luellen asked as we rolled away absolutely if we get two bunches of bureaucrats fighting over the server itll be harder to keep it hushed up i made the call from a pay phone working down bobbys list of fbi agents names and home phone numbers the first two werent home the third guy was named don sobel and he answered the call on the first ring he sounded like he was talking through a mouthful of shredded wheat in the background i could hear the letterman show mr sobel i said im a member of the computer community im calling to tell you that this group firewall which is supposedly attacking the irs was invented by the national security agency who is this the way he asked i knew what he was thinking crank im calling several different people i said so if youre interested in keeping your job you should write down this name bloch technology bloch the company has an internet server in laurel maryland at the carterbyrd center just a minute just a minute let me get this down he said i spelled the name again and then said the server is the source of the firewall rumors if you check the client list you will find that most of the clients are nsa people you will also find that the first mentions of firewall all come from this computer several days before the name went public the rumors were planted by an nsa contract company called ammath of dallas texas ammath ammath is also involved in the murder of an nsa official named terrence lighter lighter are you getting this give me that name again lighter i spelled it again and then said nsa security people are on the way to bloch tech right now there may be nothing left to discover if the fbi isnt there to watch them you can call an nsa security official named rosalind welshi spelled her name and gave him her phone numberto ask about the server what about he began goodbye i said i hung up and we took off now i said somethings got to happen chapter what the european hacks were doing to the irs was simple enoughthe programming could be done by mean little childrenbut their organization showed some good old german generalstaff planning they must have worked for weeks getting into the computer systems of not only a lot of small colleges but as it turned out into the computers of several big retailers without studying the problem i would have thought that getting at the retail computers would be almost impossible without a physical breakin to get at security codes i was wrong it appears that several of the big online retailers spent all their security money on protecting creditcard and cash transactions and making sure that nobody could fool with their inventory and sales records but they had other computers that specialized in routine automatic consumer contactscomputers for example that would do nothing but send out standardized emails informing the customer that his order had been shipped for these computers no great security seemed necessary they were perfect for the hacks they were optimized for sending outgoing mail and once the hacks were inside them they could easily be set up to ship the phony irs returns at the peak of the attack the bigger online companies were sending out thousands of phony returns per hour that would have been bad enough but the hacks had taken it a step further they didnt have the returns sent directly from the retailer to the irs but rather bounced them off the customers when the retailer sent an acknowledgment of a purchase the irs file was automatically attached but would not show up on the customers computer screen what would show up was a legitimate receipt or other message plus a message from the hacks that said for auditing purposes and your shopping protection please acknowledge receipt of this message by clicking on the acknowledge button below thank you every customer who clicked on the acknowledge button was actually sending a message but not to the retailer the message was one of the phony returns and went to the irs when the irs tried to track the messages theyd find they came from thousands of individuals all over the country all of whom denied knowing anything about it the attack was continuing the following day when luellen and i loaded into the rental car and went for a noonrushhour drive on interstate we picked the interstate because if we were moving fast wed be switching phone cells every few minutes hate to waste a perfectly good phone luellen grumbled thats why we got it i said using one of the new cold phones i directdialed welsh at her nsa number nobody answered not there i said hanging up what does that mean i thought for a moment and then said i told her id call her but its sunday and maybe she thinks weve only got her home phone ill bet shes home sitting on the phone with a bunch of fbi agents yeah well i dialed her home phone and she picked up on the fifth ring on the fourth ring i said to luellen maybe they dont fuckin care i was about to hang up when i heard the phone shuffle and then her voice hello this is bill clinton i spoke to you last night did you go to laurel yes we did is this a cellphone call yes then we will have to be circumspect we looked at the account you were speaking about but there wasnt any traffic of the kind you described between the gentleman here and the gentleman from dallas there was last night we think that the file in question may have been altered did you place an administrative account named b d short on the laurel installation for your own uses no we didnt then someone unknown has been burning files i told you who it was we are looking into that she said we want you to stay in touch though and we also want to send you a file and have you look at two photographs can you take a quick transmission if i switch over just a minute i wasnt ready for that it seemed uncommonly cooperative i turned in the car seat reached over the back got out the laptop and turned it up im just bringing it up i said ill have to say to be honest that i didnt appreciate your approach last night you scared me i regret that i said i had the line that would go from the modem to the phone wrapped in a bundle and fumbled it as i tried to pull off the rubber band while still talking on the phone the bundle dropped between my legs and i had to lean forward to get it as i did with my head at a low angle i noticed a helicopter a mile or so ahead hovering above a line of buildings i picked up the bundle of wire undid the rubber band and clipped it into the laptop and the phone and called up my communications program a moment later i was ready switch over anytime i said its about a hundred k so itll take a minute or two she said if youre ready here it comes i got a tone and hit the enter button on the laptop a moment later the download began whats going on luellen asked theyre shipping a couple of pictures they want us to look at i said an unusual show of cooperation she said wryly echoing my own thoughts yeah i and as i started to say it i looked right out the passenger window there a half mile away and running parallel to us was another helicopter shit what shed picked up the tone in my voice as i plucked the wire out of the computer and shut down the phone we were set up theyre tracking the call and theyve maybe got us isolated see that chopper straight ahead weve got another off to the right aw man kidd what do we do dont do anything yet keep the speed steady i said in case they havent spotted us the front chopper is sliding this way sos the side guy i said an exit was coming up with signs for a shopping center i could see it to the north a big one with what looked like an enclosed parking garage take the exit take the exit she cut right and took the ramp what next take a left theres a shopping center over there with a covered ramp if theyve isolated us we wont be able to run from them as long as they can see us it was a cool day and i was wearing a light sweatshirt over a golf shirt and had a jacket in back i peeled off the sweatshirt and began wiping down every surface i thought we mightve touched and at the same time tried to look for the choppers the one that had been to the right was closing fast i think theyve spotted us i said get in the parking ramp luellen ran a stoplight took a hard right into the shopping center went the wrong way up a oneway drive and into the parking ramp under cover we were in the backseat she said we were in the back weve got prints we used the radio id spotted a parking space the inside end of it against the wall was slightly lower than the outer end right there but dont go in head first back into it why do it goddamnit i crawled over the seat into the back wiped down everything stuffed the laptop back into my briefcase and got out my old leatherman tool as luellen maneuvered the car when she killed the engine i said pop the trunk get out dont touch anything she did pulling her hands inside her jacket sleeves wiping frantically along the way i hopped out wiped the handles then ran around behind the car dropped to the ground between the barrier wall and the back of the car i got the leatherman out of my pocket and unfolded a long pointed blade with a serrated edge after a couple of timid attempts to do it by hand i pulled off a shoe stuck my hand in it and smashed the blade through the gas tank once i got a hole the rest was easier enlarging it to the size of a dime a steady stream of gasoline flowed out and began pooling under the car and i slid out from under and stood up as i did luellen said kidd i hear the chopperthe choppers coming in you still carry a lighter jesus youre gonna blow up the garage but she got it out of her shoulder bag a cheap blueplastic bic and handed it to me i stooped and fired it into a fingerwide trickle of gasoline the flame caught and we ran ran for fifty feet until we were away from the car then slowed to a walk there were people further down the structure but they were paying no attention to us i could hear the chopper somewhere the beating sound seeming to come from all around then the fire jumped up from behind the retaining wall and i heard somebody yelling and then we were inside a mall is a mall is a mall we either had to get out of this one in a hurry or hide i said so to luellen run or hide this way luellen said grabbing my arm where backside exit we walked across the width of the mall to the far exit look for somebody a woman getting out of her car spot the car spot the woman how many people have you seen getting out of cars in parking lots a million but try to see somebody getting out when you need to see them and they dont we could see that there was excitement on the other side of the mall a couple of people running but they were the best part of a block away i was looking toward them when luellen said there i looked where she was looking a woman was climbing out of a deepred dodge minivan she was wearing a hiplength tealcolored jacket and carrying a purse when she passed the back of the minivan she casually turned and pointed her hand at it and the taillights blinked then she dropped the keys in a side pocket of her jacket thats her luellen said thats her now do what i tell you you gotta do it exactly right what i did was i hurried halfway down the mall until i was standing in front of a victorias secret store the woman in the teal jacket came through the inner door a second later i started toward her carrying my briefcase open and across my chest digging in it with one hand luellen was behind her four or five feet back pacing her as we closed i suddenly crossed in front of her and stopped abruptly bowing over the briefcase and she almost ran into me she put her hands up to fend me off and i said oh jeez im sorry but she was already past when shed swerved to avoid me then ricocheted off my arm luellen had dipped her pocket for the keys as the woman went on down the hall luellen nodded at me turned and headed out i was a step behind we might not have long luellen said as we crossed the parking lot she was tight we could still hear a chopper but it mustve been on the other side of the building then there were sirens and for a moment i thought the cops would be blockading the place but the sirens were fire trucks coming in from off the mall we got in the van luellen driving and headed out from the corner stoplight we could see the parking ramp and a fireball in the near end two big choppers were down in a vacant area of the lot and a couple of hundred people were standing around looking at the fire if they get any prints out of that theyll have earned them i said you think there were any left i dont think so but why take a chance and the fire got people looking that way you think that woman saw your face yeah probably i said a slice of it not all of it we took the van to the airport trying not to touch anything at the airport we wiped it and left it in a reserved slot i put a sheet of notebook paper on the dashboard with a note this car was stolen a cab took us back to the motel at the motel luellen took advantage of me she tends to do that when theres trouble when things have gotten tight she went to her room did a couple lines of cocaine then her eyes all blue and pinpointed came down to mine you need some exercise she said pulling her shirt off luellens a goodlooking woman and an old friend it would have hardly been polite to say no the first round of sex all done with i was tracing some of her more interesting contours with my fingertips and she said tell me what they did they must want us fairly badly i said but then were right where theyve got all their equipment i think they probably put up several pairs of helicopters around baltimore and probably washington with radio directionfinding equipmentcell phones are radios i know that then with the access the nsa has to phone calltracing equipment they probably picked up the cell our phone was using spotted it vectored in the nearest helicopters and fed them our signal at the same time theyd get us pretty close just with the one cell and our speed would probably tell them that we were on the interstate then if we switched to another cell theyd have our direction and from the time of change a pretty good location from that point with their directionfinding equipment it was only a matter of time thats why they were downloading those pictures they were keeping our signal going back and forth and getting us to focus on what was happening smart she said yeah we fucked up sorry ifucked up i forgot who we were dealing with if id been using my brain we couldve taken the tram to new york which they would never in a million years have been covering and we could have called from midtown at lunch instead i spread my hands we have a major screwup hertz is gonna be pissed at nancy m hoff she giggled their car is a puddle of plastic we hope then she sighed and rolled over and said this was fun both the running and the fucking but weve got to be smarter i dont see anything more for us here i said welsh told me that theyd gone into the computer in laurel so maybe theyll take care of everything back home you want to go back home wherere you going i thought for a moment then said texas just to look around ive been to texas she said i sort of like it there i like the way they dress youre welcome to come along late in the afternoon we checked out of the motel took a cab to bwi and flew to new york we stayed overnight in manhattan sharing a room this time monday morning before we left for la guardia i called welsh at her office from a pay phone her secretary answered and when i asked for welsh said mrs welsh was in a meeting this is bill clinton if she wants to talk to me again right now you have ten seconds to get her on the phone after that im gone five seconds later welsh picked up this better not be a joke this is no joke this is a threat if you come after us again or threaten us well tear major new assholes in all those bright and shiny computers you keep buying out there your threats dont worry us too much bill were only about one step behind you now oh yeah get a lot of prints off that car listen lady im telling you if we feel threatened well take you down if you want a demonstration of what we can do well put your internal phone book on the internet with all the names and home addresses listed so people who dont like your brand of bullshit can call you up at any time of day or night would that convince you her resolve seemed to waver i dont think you could what phone do you think im talking to you on i asked jesus christ woman take a minute to think about it so dont do that look at those computers find out what happened with lighter and jack morrison and ammath and clipper and stay the fuck away from us i hung up we were headed toward the airport five minutes later when one of luellens cell phones rang the taxi driver was chanting to himself in arabic and apparently paying no attention luellen dug the phone out of her purse punched the talk button said hello listened for a moment then handed the phone to me green she said green was calling from a phone at a gas station in san francisco i couldnt figure out how they were tracking us when they were always so far away always two or three blocks he said so i drove over to my brothers placehes got a garageput the car up on a lift and guess what you had a bug still got it he said but i moved it inside the car and ducttaped a big alnico magnet to it when we get to the airport ill stick it on a car thats leaving that ought to confuse them for a while then well fly the seattletohouston route and drive up to dallas good were on our way now well be in dallas tonight well probably stay over in houston see you tomorrow we talked for another minute and then he was gone and we were gone seven hours later we were in dallas chapter st john corbeil corbeil was sweating in the cold airconditioning of his office he could feel the dampness under his shirt collar and despised himself for it not good clean sweat the kind you got lifting weights this was nervous sweat the kind you got when a hardnosed nsa security officer cornered you with unexpected questions while some fbi faggot sat in the back smiling and playing with his tennis bracelet strunkthe security officers name was karl strunkhad questions about the bloch tech isp about the emergence of firewall about the deaths of lighter and morrison corbeil managed to finesse the questions to play dumb he hated having to project even the appearance of ignorance but it had been necessary and it had been a closerun thing how had they gotten onto bloch tech and the connection between bloch tech and the firewall rumors that was the last thing he would have expected hart knocked once and pushed into the office what happened he asked trouble im not sure somethings going on they know about bloch tech and they suspect that lighter and morrison are connected but they dont seem to have any idea what the connection might be and i dont understand that how they could suspect a connection without having any idea what it might be he stopped pulled himself in hed almost been sputtering like some stripedtie civil service asshole whod lost a box of paper clips we took care of that with the morrison plane tickets hart said did they find the tickets i wasnt asking any questionsbut i assume they did i came down hard on the idea that we were monitoring everything that we were afraid that wed been penetrated by firewall i suggested that firewall had penetrated bloch tech recognizing that it was the biggest isp in glen burnie and figuring that there mustve been a lot of nsa people in it probably in there looking for anything they could get whatd he say the idea didnt surprise him i kept talking about his irs attack that has them confused too that has me confused corbeil smiled i think its absolutely wonderful theyre going to find some people who profess to be firewall and theyll have nothing to do with us if youve ever dealt with those little cocksuckers who infest the internet these days you know that theyll probably take credit for every bit of damage that gets done they think its glamorous itd still be nice to have an overview corbeil nodded ill go up to meade and tap the oldboy line see if i can find out whats happening i can make a couple of calls hart said ask a couple of guys to keep an eye outtell them that if theres trouble i want to get out while the getting is good that might produce something do it corbeil said and tell woods to keep an eye on the computers just in case the people at meade have a backdoor into it when hart was gone corbeil made a halfdozen calls and managed to wangle an invitation to visit nsa headquarters to talk about firewall and ammath once inside itd be usual enough to visit old pals an ordinary thing to pick up on the gossip hed made a lot of money on the outside and had jobs prospects to dangle somewhere somebody was working a vein of information and if he couldnt find out who he might get hurt he spent another halfhour online using an encrypted spreadsheet to move money between offshore accounts from the in account to eventually the invest account corbeil had a number that he had taken out of the wall street journal the head of a big arbitrage fund had set aside twentyfive million for his own use the journal said and with the rest of his fortune he simply played twentyfive million the man said was enough to take care of any realistic need corbeil made that his number twentyfive million when he reached that number he would shut down the old man of the sea find a way to seal himself away from woods and hart and benson then find something else to do in a softer climate ibiza would be a candidate he thought about ibiza for a while and then again about woods and hart and benson if something were to happen to hart and benson and if woods were to disappear with a large amount of cash then conclusions might be drawn then if clipper died as it appeared that it would he could liquidate and find that something else that would be a couple of years yet he was not yet halfway to his number hart came back talked to some guys theyll keep their ears open but right now nothing the only talk about us is most of them have heard that clipper is going down common knowledge corbeil said ive been thinking about this whole problem there is either a source of information about us or the ward woman knows something that we dont maybe she had more files than we know about maybe morrison made more than one entry maybe they were working together possible but if all that was true and if shes giving her stuff to the nsa why are they so confused why are they just sniffing around they dont really seem to know much maybe shes just jacking us up and is gonna come in with an offer doesnt feel like it if you two hadnt lost her listen when they made that switch that was professional hart said where does a college professor get off spotting a beacon the size of an ice cube im telling you corbeil waved him off weve been through all that and shes out of sight for the time being the police say shes coming here to look at the house and to pick up some of morrisons equipment and personal effects you found mastercard and american express receipts in her housemaybe you can pick her up through her cards hart nodded ill check corbeil leaned back in his chair somebody is working on us william possibly the nsa but it doesnt feel like them strunk knew a few things but there were holes in everything he knew questions didnt follow any reasonable logic he had bits and pieces only bits and pieces gotta find ward hart said find her and look at her chapter dallas was hot hot enough that the newspapers were whining about it unnaturally hot for the time of year when we got to the dfw carrental building which was a couple miles from the airport a chunky redheaded woman dragged a bulky black suitcase up to the hertz desk with a complaint about her bill i didnt hear the details of the complaint but noticed that her blouse was soaked with sweat from the fiftyyard walk across the parking lot we rented a thoroughly airconditioned car using one of luellens ids and got two rooms at the ramada inn when we were settled we drove to something called the west end historic district which turned out to be a fernbar shopping district injected into a bunch of aging warehouses the trenddirect building once a big old redbrick warehouse had been dressed up with modern black windows and new tuckpointing it stood alone on its own block part of the ground floor had been given over to an imposing lobby with a glass wall separating the street from an interior done in old brick and new marble with huge wooden beams crisscrossing overhead a guard and reception desk sat to one side a half circle of marble we could see two heads behind it but no details of the security except for the lobby the front part of the buildings first floor was all retaila couple of boutiques a mens formalwear store a sportscollectibles shop a coffee shop and a beerandsteaks restaurant on the corner trenddirect a direct mail advertising company occupied floors two through five plus the back part of the first floor six and seven were a single law firm eight was occupied by an ad agency nine and ten were ammath luellen had her game face on ten stories she said as we cruised the neighborhood ten stories exactly the front of the building was on a wide street but faced a grassy square and most of the traffic was local both side streets were narrow showing walls of black windows there were three window wells on each side the rear of the building was on a wider busier dirtier street smelling of truck coolant and exhaust a halfdozen truckparking bays backed up to a loading dock with steel overhead doors opposite each truck bay a windowless standard door of steel was at the center of the dock between two of the big overhead doors a smaller streetlevel garage door also steel and just big enough for a small truck was located at the end of the building a video camera monitored the dock what do you think i asked her she was looking straight up through the windshield id like to see the roof she said luellen im just the tiniest bit afraid of heights its gonna be a tough building she said that guard desk is a twentyfourhour operation and we know there are guards wandering around at night jack supposedly shot one who was making a routine round of the building we could probably crack one of the doors in back but then the question is could we get up we cant tell without going inside gotta be a way probably the fact that theres some kind of government topsecret connection makes me extra nervous if we came down from the top look the building across the street from the south side is an office building turn here ill show you the building across the street was just as she said another old warehouse renovated with glitzy neonsigned shops on the bottom floor and what mustve been offices on the floors above the thing is the securityll probably suck theres no lobby its a little shabby so its probably a lot of individual offices we could get access during the day hide out inside and get onto the roof at night its twelve floorstwo higher than trenddirect luellen said she looked back and forth between the two buildings narrow streets here i bet its not more than forty feet between the two cornices we heave a climbing line across slide down and the trenddirect roofs probably got no security at all itd be really unusual if it did why dont we get fake ids and fool the guards i said or keys for the back doors those are options or we could do a sneak sneak is private language it amounts to doing an easy reconnaissance like a phony delivery to look over a target luellen has done them twenty times i usually go on public toursmost big companies have them and they are very informative if you know what to look for thats another option she admitted but she liked the roof idea shed like the rush itd bring swinging out over the street at three oclock in the morning we spent another fifteen minutes looking at the building and luellen shot a couple of rolls of colorslide film she also got out of the car and looked into one of the window wells she came back shaking her head why would you put glass brick all the way up and down she complained people working in there have to breathe for christs sakes its inhuman luellen the voice of the working man i said but you know what it all looks very secure she said somebody went out of their way to be secure and something else i just thought of what how often are building guards armed like the old guy who got shot i thought about that and shook my head not often the place is tough she said id turn it down if i were working on my own unless i had a very tight inside connection huh we both thought about that as we rolled away leaving the building behind neither of us had ever spent serious time in dallas and it turned out that the west end historic district was historic not only because it was old but because that was where john kennedy was assassinated we went past the memorial not knowing exactly what it was until luellen spotted a dealy plaza sign do you remember kennedy she asked her face turned to the memorial as we passed by sometimes i think i do i said but i think i mostly remember my folks telling me about him ive only seen him in old tv shows luellen said he seemed like an okay guy for a president on the way back to the motel we found a phone and got online with bobby hed been doing research on ammath knowing that we might try to go in i said trenddirect looks tough any online options cannot find online option but did look at corbeil home he has t line excellent give address corbeil lived in a snazzy glassandbrick lowrise apartment budding on a north dallas golf course a gated community called lago verde the t line meant he was probably working from home on his downtown computer system this is the place to do a sneak she said as we rolled past the gate ill bet you dollars to doughnuts that all the security is out here on the fence with maybe some driveby guys in golf carts at night so lets go in i said lets call bobby again she said we need to nail down corbeils exact address and we need the name of a single woman who lives in there anywhere maybe he could check elevatorsdont elevators have to be inspected or something i think so bobby came back and said that corbeil according to the local phone and electric companies lived on the eighth and ninth floors of a ninestory building called poinsettia all of the apartments in the building were two storieson two and three four and five six and seven eight and nine he couldnt find out what was on one nor could he find anything about elevators there was a state elevator data bank but you had to know the serial number to find the right one the bank was not searchable by address he did get the name of a single woman an annebelle enager who lived in the primrose building thats a start luellen said were gonna do a sneak an easy one she said one thing the movies never tell you is that burglars spend about half their life shopping we bought a small paint brush and jars of red and black watersoluble poster paint at a kids store at an office supply place luellen picked up a bottle of rubber cement a roll of duct tape an xacto knife and one of those rollerreceipt boxes with a roll of receipt paper to go with it the receipt paper went on a spindlebar inside the top of the boxlike a toilet paper holder fed to the outside across a plate where a customer would sign and then back inside the box to a takeup spindle we rented a white van from hertz took the van to a mostly vacant parking lot outside a thirtysix screen theater and i used the poster paint to create a business on the side of the van roses roses that looks great luellen said when id finished you missed your calling you should have been a sign painter yet i think i would be unfulfilled i said id painted two intertwined red roses with black stems above the name in red you had to hope nobody looked at both sides of the truck because the roses were not exactly the same while i was painting luellen sat on the back bumper and used a screwdriver to rip the guts out of the rollerreceipt box and the xacto knife to cut a quartersized hole through the plastic side her jvc miniature camcorder fit snugly inside held in place with the duct tape she used the rubber cement to glue a receipt across the face of the box we ready she asked as i finished up the roses if you are lets go i didnt have to do anything truth be told luellen drove the truck up to the gate said something to the gatehouse guard who pointed and let her m i waited a block away in the car she was inside for exactly twentytwo minutes about ten more than i thought reasonable she waved at the guard as she left took a left and five minutes later we met in a weedy litterstrewn strip under a freeway when i got there shed already gotten out a gallon jug of spring water and a roll of paper towels and was wiping roses roses out of existence no problem she said cheerfully as i walked up i even got a date if we need it who with guy named ralph carnelli hes an office guy there some kind of lowlevel manager i think inside the compound shed driven around until she spotted the poinsettia building the first and basement floors were parking she said that was as much as she could see then she found the clubhouse which sat on the edge of the golf course the clubhouse included a receiving area the upstairs management offices and a lounge and exercise room for the residents i got lost she said i wandered all over the place an easy mistake to make in such a big building i said yeah i went up these stairs and eventually i found ralph and he took me back downstairs and showed me the reception desk i left the flowers for annebelle and we got to talking he came on to me a little and i gave him a little shine i wouldnt give him the phone number but i took his nice guy goodlooking fortytwo divorced big shoulders with that skirt and your ass the poor guy never had a chance exactly and she paused for dramatic effect what the clubhouse is open all night twentyfour hours the door that connects the clubhouse to the office suite can be slipped at the back of ralphs office is a big wooden flat file that has the names of different buildings on different drawers four names to a drawer architects drawings thats what i think couldnt see for sure but the office has something to do with maintenance tonight we cross the fence onto the golf course watch the building when its open we go in absolutely she said we got a call from green at eight they were in houston and he and lane would be heading for dallas as soon as it got light luellen and i replayed the movies shed made at lago verde until i knew my way around the place as well as she did we went into lago verde at ten oclock carrying nothing but a thick woolen army blanket we got at a salvage store a dinner knife i stole from a dennys and a penlight we parked on a residential street a block off the golf course after spotting a convenient tree along the edge of the course the course was bordered by an eightfoot chainlink fence but without any guard wire at the top we both wore jeans black gym shoes and crimson jackets dark red is as good as black for concealment as long as nobody throws a light on you if a light is thrown on you you look a lot more innocent in red than in black the tree at the edge of the golf course was halfway between two streetlights along a commercial strip across the street from the tree a paintandwallpaper place closed at eight oclock and the adjoining highend stereo place at nine at ten with a good space between cars we jogged across the street luellen tossed the blanket over the top of the fence and i lifted her up to it and she was over i did a quick climb pivoted on my belly on the blanket and dropped to the other side we both squatted behind the tree to look at the passing cars nobody slowed we waited out of sight for ten minutes and then headed across the golf course once we were away from the strip the golf course was dark as a coal sack id never had a mental image of dallas as a place with trees but it has about a billion of them from the air the city looks like a forest golf courses are even denser with them and most of them seem to have thorns we crossed a fairway moving slowly i stepped into a thorn bush backed out fell in behind luellen and we groped our way toward the apartment light three hundred yards away fifty yards out of the clubhouse we found a soft patch of grass between two trees spread the blanket and hunkered down we could see lights both at the front of the clubhouse and at the back the upstairs windows were dark the back of the clubhouse was framed by a wall of floortoceiling windows we could see a line of soda and snack machines along one wall and a bunch of soft leather chairs like the firstclass lounge in an airport there were a halfdozen people in the lounge two had apparently just come out of the exercise room they were putting on tennis shoes the other four were sitting in a group of chairs talking could be a while luellen said about three hours in fact the group in the lounge stayed for an hour and a half an animated conversation that seemed to go on forever when they finally left a couple of other people had settled in more came and went from the exercise room traffic slowed down after midnight but every time we thought to move somebody else would show up at onefifteen we hadnt seen anybody for fifteen minutes lets try luellen said we left the blanket and started through the dark to the clubhouse door twenty yards out at the edge of the golf course we came to a line of headhigh shrubs after we passed them wed be out in the open and committed we stopped looked around then luellen touched my arm and we moved slowly luellen on my arm we got to the clubhouse stepped inside no sound except a refrigerator gurgle from one of the soda machines we waited another second then luellen slipped the dinner knife out of her pocket walked to the door connecting with the executive suite slipped the lock with the knife blade and we were in and up ralphs office door had the same crappy lock we slipped it and luellen led the way inside i shut the door behind us and she turned on the penlight the flat files were not locked didnt have locks the architects drawings for poinsettia were right where they were supposed to be in the poinsettia drawer with drawings for wild rose blackeyed susan and hollyhock the drawings for poinsettia made up a pad a halfinch thick and probably three feet long by two and a half wide take the whole thing she asked might as well hope nobody goes looking for them theyre dusty we should be okay she said we put the room back together and walked out as we crossed the paved area toward the parking lot another couple was coming off the parking lot carrying a blanket but not ours we never got closer than fifty yards but they waved and luellen waved back and then said jesus christ kidd the golf course is the local lovers lane were lucky we didnt trip over somebody better cover for us i said we saw nobody on the course we crossed the fence strolled back to the car and were out of there chapter luellen tends to wrestle herself around pillows and wind up in odd positions when i woke up the next morning her bare bottom was sticking out of a tangle of sheets and a glorious sight it was like a new peach round and firm and slightly pink i will confess to an inordinate fondness for that portion of the female anatomy and after a few minutes i reached over and gave it a little pat a little stroke if you touch me ill rip your fuckin heart out she groaned but its so interesting shut up cant time to get up she propped herself on her elbows and looked at the bedside clock bullshit she said and dropped straight down be quiet i need another hour i went to the window and stuck my face into the crack between the curtains nice day out blue skies no clouds this is dallas you moron its supposed to be like that she said now go away not a morning person i got cleaned up humming to myself thought about luellens assall right im not just fond of it i actually contemplate itand remembered clancy clancys the woman back in st paul who was building a computer with me very nice woman smart interesting sexy too young for meim eight years older than she isand the difference troubled me though it didnt seem to bother her much and we werent finished with each other there was more to say clancy in st paul luellen in dallas hmm when we were done in dallas luellen would most likely take off again she had a tendency to winter in warm places like mexico venezuela or the islands and to hang with the indolent rich i on the other hand would be back in st paul in snow drifts six feet deep with wolves and would need the comfort of a woman like clancy i would probably try to hide this moment with luellen given my past track record id probably succeed the thing was luellen wasnt just sex she was a friend our time in bed was an expression of friendship i worked over that line of thought as i shaved this whole sex thing with luellen would take some seriously hypocritical rationalization i thought if i wanted to keep my feet warm over the winter luellen was still in bed when i finished cleaning up so i went downstairs to the restaurant had eggs bacon and toast read the paperfirewall was still on the attack the irs had no idea of how to screen them out without losing billions and billions in germany the cops raided the apartment of a kid who had an internet handle that translated as cheese but cheese had been in the bathroom at the time and that apparently gave him some kind of immunity from prosecution he wasnt actually hacking when they came through the door in any case usa today said that cheese was the rat in the dos attack when i got back upstairs luellen was dressed green called he and lane are checking into a radisson hotel up in denton which is like twenty miles from here why there because green plays golf and its a golf resort silly goddamn game i said you dont know the first thing about it she said chasing a white ball around a cow pasture look at a list of people who play it and tell me theyre chasing a ball around a cow pasture if you gotta brain in your head you gotta suspect that theres something else going on even if you dont play yourself my eyebrows went up she actually sounded a little passionate on the subject not like luellen eternal cynic mmm i said fuck you luellen drove i sat in the passenger seat looking through the architects drawings and trying not to get carsick eventually i gave up but id found one interesting thing theres a silent alarm wired into corbeils apartment the console is in a closet can you trace the out lines nope the lines go into an indicated junction box along with lines from some other rooms and then they all go down to the first floor either to a security service or over to the reception area in the clubhouse or both clubhouse would get a quicker response i said yeah but if you wanted a little more weight some pros with guns it might go out the radisson sat on a hill on the west side of the highway it took a while to find the driveway in but we got it sorted out eventually and went up to lanes room green answered the door he was wearing a golf shirt and loose pleated tan slacks and had his hand in his pocket he took it out when he saw us there you are lane was lying on a bed watching a movie on hbo luellen whod come in behind me looked past me and said emma i didnt know that was on she went over and dropped on the bed next to lane i think were gonna go into this corbeil guys apartment i said to green and lane weve got some shhh lane said theyre gonna kiss this only takes a minute emma and her friend were standing under a spreading oak lane and luellen were totally focused i think we gotta shut up shut up just one minute luellen held a finger up i went over to look christ that womans got a long neck they all did back then lane said this wasnt made back then this was made shut the fuck up luellen said i looked at green who shrugged and we went over to a corner of the room sat down and shut up after emma and her friend were married and the movie ran down what happened to everyone else lane sighed and turned off the tv god i love that movie so do i luellen said but you know what i dont think they did a very good job with frank they needed to make him more attractive in the beginning and worse in the end and show why emma was attracted to yum i didnt think he was very attractive at all lane said i dont see how he could possibly compete with could we talk about what were doing i asked i think that would be good green said since were in these guys hometown we brought them up to date on what wed done without providing any details that might be used against us in a court we would have to trust them at some point though and i said were seriously considering going into corbeils apartment he has a t phone line and we think he probably uses it for rapid access into the company computers theres a good chance that i can tap into his computer line and thatll give us a door into their mainframe lane said weve been looking at the photo you sent us and i cant see anything in it if we knew who the people were its a blank wall i said jack must have gotten something out of the computers that went with the photographs thats what we need to find i really mmm i had some problems back home and if i got caught going into a place i could be looking at a long time green said he sounded apologetic you couldnt go in anyway i said its not an area where a black guy can wander around we could use a couple of eyes though we could do that green said do we know anything about the place we came up with these i said touching the drawings ive seen a couple of things in them everybody ought to take a look and see if we can spot anything else we did that spreading the drawings around on the beds like pages from the new york times on a sunday afternoon luellen said eventually look at this she was pointing at a blank box its a blank box green said its a safe yeah bet your ass it is she said let me look at the drawings for that wall and for the opposite wall where are the materials specs anyway after a while lane and luellen went out for cokes and green and i continued to look at the blueprints youre pretty good at this green said after a while it sounded like a statement but there was a question inside of it ive done it for a whilenot exactly this but related stuff i know a little bit about longstreet he said i looked up at him longstreet was supposed to fade away into the pasta political seizure of a small town in the mississippi delta engineered with several tastefully chosen burglaries and a few bad moments at the dog pound to say nothing of the weeks of hospitalization and physical rehab that followed i wish people would forget about all of that i said finally most of them are forgetting but not everybody green said what im saying is my friends tell me that i should go all the way with you that its important im not sure how important it is outside our little group i said i wouldnt want you to be misled not too worried about that he said he stood up stretched looked out the sliding glass doors toward the golf course what im worried about is im getting bored hard to stay sharp when youre bored stuck in hotel rooms do you play golf does a chicken have lips why dont you take luellen out for a round shes getting antsy herself ill read though these drawings for a while longer keep an eye on lane okay he chewed on a lip for a minute then said think lane has a little thing for you yeah a little thing he said i thought maybe you guys have been hanging around for a week or so he shook his head im not from the right socialeducational strata shes a bigot no no never that shes got a phd and i never quite went back for my ged if you know what i mean shes got this thing about diplomas degrees huh dont know what to tell you i said and i didnt we spent some more time looking at the architects drawings and when luellen got back i said we go in through the garage i can get us up to corbeils floor but after that ive got no guarantees if we want to make it a quiet entry i dont know youd need some lock picks or something i dont think we could use an autopick there are three other apartments up there how are you going to get us up if we dont know how long were gonna be up i dont think itd be a good idea to take the elevator apart i explained it and she said that means we need more scouting trips and some more gear i was thinking wed go in saturday night i said that article that bobby found said he was a big social guy saturday night in dallas about ten oclock if its possible at all i said i wish i could get a look at his door she said for each of the next three days green and luellen played thirtysix holes of golf on the radisson course while lane and i hung out sometimes together sometimes separately i got a lot of drawing done and she was online with her business in palo alto luellen it turned out was a nearscratch golfer im damn good green said one night but shes better i think if she was a little younger and worked on it she could probably go on the womens tour cant putt luellen said you could if you had a little patience he said you never look and theyd go off on a long twisted argument about puttingor chipping or pitching or whateverthat would leave lane and me nodding off the nights were more interesting luellen and i scouted corbeils apartment from the golf course with green and lane circling the course listening to a police scanner looking for cops wed bought motorola walkietalkies apparently used by huntersthey were in camouflage colorsso they could call us instantly if anything came up wed found a better place to enter the golf course where two uneven pieces of fence came together at a corner next to a sidewalk from one direction you couldnt see us at all from another it looked like wed turned the corner from the third and fourth you could see us plainly but traffic was light enough that we could wait for holes on wednesday night we took a look at the garage the garage entry was on the end of the building and nicely landscaped which was a break for us coming in from the golf course we could get close without being seen the garage was enclosed with a steel door and a key card was used for entry if i could get fifteen seconds with a key card i could duplicate the signal easily enoughyou can buy the parts at radio shackbut getting fifteen seconds with a key card might be a problem not an insuperable one but there appeared to be an easier way when the doors opened they stayed open for as long the car was in the garage entranceway and then for a few seconds longer the doors operated on a simple infrared cell the key card opened the door and then if a car was blocking either of two cells the doors stayed up all we had to do was block the cell when a car came out the door would stay up until we unblocked the cell once inside we would head for the freight elevator on thursday we got a bunch of photos of corbeil from bobby memorized the face and wiped them out of the computer that same night luellen found a tree she could climb where she could look through the floortoceiling windows of an apartment on the second floor if his door is the same its a standard solidwood door set in a steel frame she told me when she came down i couldnt see the locks but theyre probably pretty good on friday night we were lying out in the grass outside his apartment listening to a couple make love on a blanket twenty yards away they continued for longer than seemed probable then had an intense conversation about two people named rhonda and dave who seemed to have been their respective spouses then they started again must be younger than us i whispered to luellen younger than you she whispered back unless maybe youre entertaining lane during the day when im playing golf how could you possibly be that full of shit i asked what the fuck do you mean like that at nine oclock a white limo pulled up outside the apartment house and a young woman got out a very nicelooking young blond woman with a long neck like the woman in emma she didnt dress like emma though she dressed like a supermodel her short black frock probably cost as much as the average condo and if thered been any less of it she couldnt have crossed a state line without committing a felony eight minutes later a few lights went off in corbeils apartment and two minutes after that as the improbable couple to our left grunted and squeaked toward orgasm she reappeared two steps in front of st john corbeil corbeil moved in that stiff upright militaryacademy way as though he were holding a golf ball in his crotch as he walked not an especially tall guy but one of those smallheaded wideshouldered types who probably wrestled in high school luellen who had the binoculars focused on them with that kind of silent intensity that an attractive women gets when she feels she might have become a satellite rather than the planet thats what i thought at the time anyway when corbeil and his date had gone we lapsed back into the waiting mode until the adulterers decided theyd had enough they split up after a last hasty kiss and grope and as soon as they were gone we headed across the golf course ourselves halfway across in the dark luellen said im gonna have to go away for a while we signed off with green and lane and back at the hotel luellen started making phone calls to numbers shed memorized she was looking for some specific gear and she needed a nearby supplier she got the right guy just before midnight talked to him for five minutes and dropped the phone back on the hook find it i asked yeah we have a slight change of plans were not going in quietly were gonna go in superhard were gonna go after his safe hed probably suspect something maybe but maybe not she told me about it as she changed clothes into black jeans and a black jacket i gotta have that pieceofshit car wherere you going out of town she said one of my friends whenll you be back really late or early tomorrow morning she said actually theres no reason for you not to know im driving to shreveport i could take you nah better if i go alone this guy is okay most of the time but hes nervous most of the time you know as long as hes on his meds chapter that night i stayed in luellens room and spent twentyseven bucks on pay tv waiting unable to sleep before luellen returned she knows lots of people who do bad business and not all of them are her friends and not all of the places she goes to are good places for women to be after dark thats not sexism its the simple reality of the redneck ghettos where she buys her tools when i wasnt watching movies i worked over the architects drawings following every wire and line though the building and everything that went outside two of the lines were particularly troublesome one may have beenprobably wasa camera that scanned the inside of the parking garage no way to tell where it pointed or whether it was live video only or if it spooled onto a continuous tape another line ended in several vertically stacked switches in the serviceelevator shaft and i thought they almost surely were floor indicators going out to the elevator if they were something else like infrared motion detectors we would have an even bigger problem luellen had night glasses in her scouting bag along with her cameras and once we were inside the elevator shaft could use the glasses to check for security devices and we would be in the shaft going up the cables with climbing gear its easier than it sounds with good gear the only alternative with a keyed elevator was to steal a key or wreck the elevator getting to the wiring behind the key that would take time make noise and tip anyone who decided to use the elevator after we did climbing was easy and out of sight luellen was gone for a bit over seven hours i was at the door when she came in she was carrying a hand duffel the same kind i packed for an extended fishing trip she dumped it on the floor and it clanked sounds like construction equipment i said deconstruction equipment she said there better be something in that safe this stuff isnt cheap she was very sharp each word clearly defined coming out rapid fire she was eager hot readytogo brighteyed and ah man you got your nose in it didnt you just a little bit and a little bit for tomorrow today goddamn it i turned away hey all right i let it go like i always did luellen did a little cocaine from time to timeand from time to time more than a little i hated the shit i might smoke some weed after a long day on the water i might even do a tab of amphetamine if there were enough reason but cocaine heroin crystal meth that crap will kill you and if the dope doesnt the dealers will we stayed in bed well past noon luellen had been bouncing around all night the residuals from the cocaine later in the day shed be sleepy at two in the afternoon i was up feeling groggy looked out the window another great bluesky day i cleaned up and as i got out of the shower luellen was finally crawling out of bed you okay i asked no still coming down go stand in the shower yeah when she got out still a little groggy i put her in the car along with the equipment and we went out for food she began to revive and we drove to corbeils place and sat across the street watching the reception area the reception area as shown on luellens movies had a single guard monitor look at this she said you see where the guy is standing we were two hundred yards away but i could see him through the glass of the reception center yeah the monitor is just to his left now watch she took a cell phone from her pocket and dialed a number the guard straightened took a couple of steps to his right picked up the phone luellen said into the phone do you have prince albert in a can and clicked off the guy behind the glass shook his head put the phone down and went back to where hed been standing before he mightve been reading something so so when hes answering the phone he cant see the monitor she said if the monitor is rotating between sites theres a good chance that we wouldnt be on it anyway take us ten seconds to walk inside and get to the freight elevator i said mmm but we wont know whether theyve seen us or not thats the fun part she said the waiting when we left corbeils we drove up to the radisson and luellen and green spent time hitting golf balls on the driving range while i went over the drawings again lane looking over my shoulder chewing on a raw carrot suggested that one particular group of rooms in the corbeil apartment could be for a livein maid it was labeled guest suite but it could have been either we debated it for a while and i finally pulled up the wiring diagrams we decided that the questionable area had no wiring for a stove or for an electric clothes dryer so it was probably a guest room well have to call i said every fifteen minutes we started calling right after dark the phone would ring four times and wed get corbeils answering service i was getting cranked on adrenaline and luellen took a walk around the closeddown driving range and did a little cocaine at ten oclock we left luellen and me in one car green and lane in the other i dropped luellen on the corner where we crossed the fence and she was gone in an instant i took the car around the block parked and crossed the fence myself five minutes later luellen was waiting wed wrapped all of her tools in towels and we were decently quiet as we moved slowly through the trees toward corbeils apartment halfway there we stopped for a radio check with green got us gotcha we started moving again theres a technique to the movementhunters call it still hunting and it takes some discipline luellen and i learned it separately as a method of staying out of jail you take three slow steps and stop and listen then five more and stop you cover ground more quickly than youd think and quietly and almost always hear other people before they hear you we took fifteen minutes crossing to corbeils and it was all worth it for our own selfconfidence if we were caught with luellens black bag thered be no point in explanations at the edge of the golf course we stopped under cover of a low twisted pine and listened in twenty minutes we heard nothing nor did we see anything move corbeils apartment was dark except for the ir glow through the night glasses gonna do it i said got the reel she had an old penn levelwind reel filled with fishing line wed attached a piece of a black inch computer floppy disk to the end of the line as though we were going to cast it what i was going to do was easy enough but i would be out in the open a risk after checking around one last time i stepped out of the landscape planting and walked up to the garage door towing the line behind me six inches from the garage door a small electric eye looked across at its illuminator on the other side of the driveway i taped the floppy to the edge of the metal case around the illuminator so it was hinged and could fall up or down then i walked along the side of the building into the back as though i were heading for the golf course a minute later i sprawled out next to luellen normally a driver would pull up to the door inside the garage and tap his radiooperated garagedoor opener to send the door up electric eyes both inside and outside the door would make sure that the door would not come down on top of the car should it stop for some reason as long as the electric eyes illuminator was blocked the door would stay up the normal upanddown cycle would not give us enough time to get inside without taking the risk of being seen by driver of the departing car with the electriceye blocked however the door would simply stay up until we cleared it we couldnt just cover the eye though because if a car came from the outside and the eye was blocked the door wouldnt come back downand whoever had just driven into the garage would probably notice that so we needed the hinged cover all of that was easy enough wed both done something like it in the past but the wait was a killer during the week when we were scouting the place a car might come out or go in every fifteen minutes or so the longest wed had to wait was a half hour this time we had to wait for fortyfive minutes but we lucked out when the door finally went up the car was inside the garage heading out i put the radio to my mouth and said up yours green came back sounds good to me i pulled the straps for luellens black bag over my back and got to my knees the brown town car cleared the garage and started around the approach drive the door still up as it began to exit luellen pushed the speeddial button on her cell phone when the car disappeared luellen whispered go we went as we crossed the drive she said into the phone george is this george then dont tell me this is a wrong number buster the guard at the reception center on the other end eventually hung up but by that time wed walked thirty feet across the garage and were sheltered behind a concrete pillar at the freight elevator the elevator doors were shut but opened when we pushed the call button a roof light came on and i reached up and covered it with the black bag until luellen got the doors closed hatch she whispered i made a hand stirrup as i had for lane back in jacks house and luellen stood up in it and pushed the elevator hatch askew luellen peered up the elevator shaft with the night glasses looking for an infrared motion detector or anything else that might trip us up were clear she whispered and pushed the hatch up out of the way i boosted her through handed her the bag and followed behind using the light of two needleflashes we put our jumar climbers on the cable replaced the hatch and started up in the dark a fiveminute climb eight floors hanging off the elevator door at corbeils floor luellen first took the stethoscope out of her pocket and listened nothing then she dialed the next number on her speed dialcorbeils apartment again no answer she patted me on the shoulder i had her mechanical dooropeners ready i forced the jaws between the doors and we pried the doors open luellen did a quick peek with a mirror then clambered into the hallway i was five seconds behind her with the bag the hallway was arranged like many rich peoples hallwaysso that the rich people would encounter each other as seldom as possible a vestibule at the main elevator branched into two hallways one for corbeils apartment one for the other apartment that shared this entry floor both hallways made a sharp turn just off the vestibule when we crawled out of the service elevator shaft we were already on corbeils side of the floor but too far down the hall past his door we went back to his door and luellen took the jaws from me and forced them between the door and the steel doorjamb then she attached a steel wheel like a small steering wheel to a square screwend at the top of the jaws and moved behind me so i could turn it the mechanical advantage was huge the big wheel must have spun five or six times for every quarterinch that the jaws opened but nothing could stand against them slowly slowly the door moved then suddenly popped luellen had moved around so that she was below me facing the door a heavy utility knife in her hand when the door popped she shot inside making for the closet where we thought the alarm console was fixed as she did that i began uncoiling feet of climbers rope from the black bag as i did it i was counting to myself some of the alarm systems give you as much as two minutes to punch your code into the key pad some of them give you less as soon as shed gone into the apartment the keypad began a slow beeping then she was into the closet i stepped in behind her and pushed the door shut twenty seconds i could hear a scuffling sound a ripping sound then quiet except for the beepbeepbeepbeep and then beeeeeeeeeeeeee thirty seconds the pad was dialing out damnit the shortest possible delay luellen appeared in the doorway blackongray were good she said in an almost normal voice ill rig the line i said i was drenched with sweat i did industrial espionage and went places where i wasnt wanted but the bigtime apartment breakin wasnt my style look at the rug she said i looked down in the light of her flashwe were leaving greasy tracks behind us uhoh i stepped to the door and looked out in the hall the tracks came all the way down the hall from the elevator though they were harder to see in the subdued hall lighting lets get the line rigged well just have to take a chance that nobodyll see them another unforeseen risk we did a quick run through the apartment to make sure it was empty on the way i stopped for a few seconds to admire luellens work with the alarm shed used the knife to cut a hole through the drywall to expose the alarm consolecouldnt just pull the wires out because if you cut a wire the security service would be automatically alerted shed then stripped the wire clipped in bypasses and then cut the wire between the two bypasses the top bypass silenced the keypad the bottom one would keep the circuit alive so the cutwire callout would never be made shed done it in about twentyfive seconds the suite that had worried us the possible maids suite was just a guest room the computer was in a small purposebuilt office dont stop i said just walk on by the balcony ran the width of the apartment we took a moment surveying an adjoining balcony with the nightvision glasses then carefully opened the door and listened i could hear what sounded like a radio or cd but it was inside contained above us i thought we looped the climbing rope around one of the support posts on the balcony and coiled the rope so that a quick kick would launch it down the side of the building if somebody came through the door we could be on the ground in less than a minute pulling the rope after us that done we headed for the safe which was nicely concealed behind a piece of wooden paneling luellen said ill do this you get going i walked back and forth and around the room leaving traces of the black grease while luellen started pulling out her equipment after leaving the tracks i went back to the door took off my pants jacket shoes and the dirty kitchen gloves and walked back to corbeils office in my shorts and socks luellen made a lot less noise than id feared she was good at this and what she was doing was more a cover than any serious attempt at the safe as long as corbeil concentrated on the safe and not the computer wed be cool in his office i shut the door and turned on the light what i was doing was simple i was loading a program that would spool anything he typed on the computer to a file on his hard drive another programone of my own designwould send the file to one of my online mailboxes and then erase its tracks the only question was had corbeil boobytrapped his computer with hardware of some kind or software to detect intrusion i spent twenty minutes trying to figure that out and in the end didnt i didnt think so but you cant be sure not in twenty minutes as soon as my software was in i checked the rest of the desk found a couple of zip disks and copied them to my own zip disks i was just finishing when luellen scratched on the door i turned out the light and opened it almost done i said i need your help hurry and get dressed in the study luellen had done two things she had taken her heavy bar which had an edge like a razor and had cut through the wall around the cylindrical safe the safe was set in concrete inside a steel frame that was probably bolted to the building beams around the cylinder flange shed fitted a fivesided onesizefitsall steel collar with adjustable bolts with that in place shed gone to the far wall and cut another hole exposing one of the ibeams that held up the building the beams had been covered with drywall so exposing them was no problem shed slipped a steel strap around the beam then hooked the strap to the collar on the safe using what amounted to a large comealong the comealong was essentially a highratio pulley with a fourfootlong handle and a threefoot pipe as an extension the connection was a steel cable shed pumped the cable tight so tight that i could have walked on it without bending it at all the thing is the safe is starting to move she said the concrete is cracking up i can hear it but ive got so much pressure on it that when it breaks free its liable to come flying out of the hole jesus it wont fly farbut itll hit like a ton of bricks theyd hear it all over the building i gotta stand right next to it while you pump so i pumped the handle of the comealong and she stood next to the safe watching the concrete deform starting to crumble crumbling crumbling stop i stopped and she peered at the safe give it a little punch i gave it a little punch and suddenly the safe came free all right all right working as hard and quietly as we could it still took ten minutes to work it the rest of the way free when it finally came out i staggered backward with it and dropped it on a couch no way i can get that down the elevator i said the goddamn things gotta weigh two hundred pounds itd pull me right off the cable we cant just let it sit here weve almost got it she said urgently luellen the goddamn thing is like a twohundredpound car batteryi can haul it but its got too much weight in too small a package well goddamnit kidd she walked around it for a minute then said wait and walked out of the room turning toward the back of the apartment a minute later she was back carrying a black satin sheet lets get the safe ill help whatre we gonna do just help we wrapped the safe in the sheet so we could pick it up by the ends luellen is strong as a horse and she tied a loop in one end of the sheet so she could get it over her shoulder and then led me back through the apartment and out a door onto the balcony whatre we doing i whispered this way oh no yeah we can do it from right exactly here itll go right straight down into soft dirt aw man i was scanning the dark golf course somebodys gonna see us small chance she was grinning at me this was what she lived for and what might send her to jail someday cmon kidd be a good sport ah fuck before i became a sport i called green anything not a peep drive by and see what you can see one minute he said we waited one minute and he came back man reading a magazine get out of here i said tenfour he wasnt quite laughing i picked up the safe groaning leaned over the railing got centered and let it go a couple of seconds later it hit the ground eight stories below with a dull thud like a small car hitting a wood phone pole we stood absolutely still listening an intake of breath a cry surprise nothing but a car accelerating in the distance no problem luellen said we would have been safer probably going down the elevator shaft again luellen convinced me to go over the side of the building theres nobody on the balconies were good she whispered jesus ten seconds from now were gone not ten seconds exactly i insisted on a last look around i apartment staying away from the computer but tracking more grease around we packed up the black bag and went over the edge on the climbing rope on the ground she gathered in the climbing rope and took the bag while i tried to take the safe i managed to carry it a hundred yards or so before i had to stop then we wrapped it in one of the sheets made a couple of handles out of the knots and in ten minutes got it to the corner i sent luellen to get the car with the sheets she spread them on the backseat and when she pulled up next to the fence i threw the safe over crawled over after it then picked it up and humped it over to the car no problem chapter luellen always gets cranked when shes been inside a place shes not supposed to have been dealing with her was like handling a hyperactive child you try to keep her under control slow her down tonight she wanted the car the safe and the tools wherere you going back to shreveport she said if i give him the tools back hell cut the safe for free we dont want it blown up or anything she rolled her eyes jesus kidd nobodys blown a safe since bonnie and clyde hell cut it open with a lathe she dropped me at the hotel and took off as i got out i said cruise control absolutely when youre running you always want to run on cruise control get out on the interstate set your speed two miles an hour above the speed limit and no cop on earth will look at you if youre not on cruise control your adrenaline will eventually get to you and youll go flying past some cop at a hundred and ten and itll feel like fortyfive with luellen gone i walked six blocks to a drivein phone on the edge of a gas station parking ramp checked in with lane and afterward got online with my dump box lane was almost as cranked as luellen whatd you get how come youre not up here we dont know what we got its in a safe and weve got to cut it open luellens taking care of that tonight but she wont be back until morning how about the computer we should be online with him im going to check in a few minutes damn it kidd it freaked me out even though we were outside freaked me out something for the memoirs better fuckin not i said this is not even for your memories the dump box was a mailbox id set up especially to take everything corbeil typed on his computer terminal there was nothing in the box i hadnt expected anything corbeil the social butterfly the modeldater wouldnt be back until late if at all unless somebody found the broken door finally i went out to bobby he had nothing more to offer on jacks jaz disks but was certain that the attack on the irs was coming from europe got some numbers in germany and idd zombie computers here in states that are feeding attack will pass along to nsa contact and try to steer her from old names shes no wizard you may be putting too much hope in stupid people must push them off they still thrash after old names take care and you i got to bed a couple of hours before dawn still worrying about luellen i got three hours of sleep and still groggy but unable to keep my eyes closed got out of bed and nearly fell on my face id felt a little creaky the night before but now every muscle in my body was screaming at me that goddamned safe i know what musclepulls feel like and i had what some docs called micropulls the kind you get shoveling snow off a sidewalk no major muscles but hundreds of tiny pulls i hobbled into the bathroom took six ibuprofen out of my dope kit swallowed them shaved and then spent fifteen minutes in a scalding shower youre supposed to use ice rather than heat but this was ridiculous id have to bury myself in a snow drift to chill everything id pulled the heat made it feel better anyway i was toweling off slowly when i got the sudden feelinga premonition without the negative vibethat luellen had just gotten back i walked over to a window opened a slit in the curtain and looked down at the hotel parking lot yet another wonderful day sunny but with that earlymorning dryness that we dont see in minnesota luellen was not in sight so much for premonitions as i finished toweling off i had another one id just seen something important but i didnt know what what was it i wandered around looked out the window again looked at myself m the mirror looked at the towel what the hell was it i couldnt figure it out gave up and got dressed slowly my back and underarms hurt the worst and the inner thighs werent good my hair didnt hurt at all but that was the only bright spot i was leaving the room going for breakfast i had a third premonition this one about luellen again i went back to the window looked out and saw the black pontiac grandam rolling into a parking spot an accurate premonitionif you have enough of them and look often enough youll always have a good one i watched her walk into the hotel and five minutes later opened the door as she came down the hallway saw you in the parking lot i said howd it go you got a big industrial lathe cutting a safe is like cutting cheese she said she pushed the door shut if you can mount it and turn it you can cut it then she stepped up to give me a big kiss and i winced whats wrong that fuckin safe i pulled every muscle in my body the penis is a muscle its pulled i said then you seem pleased maybe even chipper she dug in her pocket and took out something glittery held out her fist and i cupped my hand underneath it she dripped a platinumanddiamond necklace into it remember that model chick we saw going into his place she wasnt wearing it going in she kept touching it coming out looked too nice to be an outright gift i thought it might be in there how much lots i called my guy in georgia and he said he could probably get me a hundred and a half theyre all small onecarat but theyre top quality like the necklace was made to sell a bank account that was it the necklace nope she grinned he had forty thousand in cash all in hundreds computer disks printouts she shook her head nothing like that some personal papersa mortgage birth certificate his passport i brought it all back but i dont think theres anything for you there was enough to make it worthwhile for somebody like me to hit him so maybe hell be less likely to look at the computer maybe ill tell you kidd youve gotten me in some shit over the years but weve always made money huh every time just lucky i guess she tagged along for breakfast and then said she needed a nap having her sleepy made me sleepy and we went back to her room put out the do not disturb sign and slept into the afternoon green called at three oclock and asked what the hell we were doing we ate dinner together green took a look at corbeils passport as we were waiting for the meal and said travels a lot extra pages he folded the extra pages out like an accordion travels in the middle east and india one of those beenevery where doneeverything guys luellen said the food arrived and green started looking at the mortgage which he said wasnt a mortgage at all but a contractfordeed which i said was the same thing and luellen said not quite finally during the dessert green folded up the mortgage paper tossed it on the table and said hes got something strange going with a ranch a ranch yeah a private sale looks like a contractfordeed he paid seven hundred and fifty thousand up front and then a thousand a year for ten years and he can pay the last ten thousand anytime that sounds weird i said he paid threequarters of a million up front but couldnt come up with the last ten grand makes no sense green said sure it does said luellen she had a glob of ice cream on a spoon and was licking it like an advertisement for fellatio well tell us miss sucking on a spoon lane said if you get a contractfordeed the final ownership doesnt pass to you until you make the last payment so so that means the ranch is still in the sellers name whats his name green picked up the contractfordeed and looked at it fred lord see fred lord sells it to corbeil and corbeil still has to pay a few bucks to totally own the land but he gets the full use of it but only lords name appears on tax records land records and so on its a dodge he doesnt want people to know hes got a ranch i asked we ought to look at it where is it mclennan county wherever that is green said twelve hundred and eighty acres two square miles corbeilland lane wanted to go take a look right away what else are we going to do monitor my drop box i said we need that computer more than we need a ranch how do we know that lane demanded i feel like were getting bogged down its been three weeks since jack was killed i dont think anybody cares anymore except us and the people chasing after firewall i said ah firewall she said she batted the thought away like a gnat theyll find these kids and thatll be it i wish it was true i said but i dont think it is we talked about firewall for a couple of minutes about the technique of the attack on the irs and the use of the zombie computers we also talked for a few minutes about her talks with the cops which were set for monday morning sixteen hours away shed try to pressure them on ammath the more pressure that we could apply the more curious the cops and the fbi and the nsa got about ammath the better chance there was that something would break loose if we could get it into the media make it a political problem we had a chance of generating a legitimate investigation i dont see the logic of it lane said there is no logic we just keep bringing ammath up hooking them to firewall to jacks killing to the house burning down to the burglary at your place we dont have to explain it we just have to keep hooking them up we agreed to meet the next afternoon after lanes talk with the cops when we left i was still getting a bad vibration from lanefor her jack was the main question and it obviously wasnt the same for luellen and me shes starting to worry me a little luellen said what happens if she decides that the only thing to do is to talk about us about firewall about the nsa about everything to get the cops to look at jack she doesnt know that much i said she knows were the ones who hit corbeil thats a lot right there yeah we drove along in silence for a moment then i sighed and said its not out of control yet i think we could talk to her about the damage shed do if she dumped on all of us shed listen i hope luellen said but weve got to keep our options open she thought a moment then added too bad she knows where you live corbeil went online that night there was no way to tell when they found that the apartment had been cracked but i checked the clump box all day every hour and at ten oclock it was spooling stuff from an online session between corbeils apartment and the ammath computer the software i was using was simple enoughyou can buy copies of the heart of it for over the counter essentially it records keystrokes everything that corbeil typed on his keyboard was recorded picked up and sent to my dump box sometimes it can be a little hard to follow if the guy youre recording is a bad typist but ive had enough practice that i can read it like a letter what do you got luellen asked looking over my shoulder to begin with weve got the phone number the signon protocols and corbeils password to get into the ammath computer i said after that not much corbeil sent company mail to one of his security people telling him about the breakin where are you cant find you my apartment was hit by burglars they pulled the safe out of the wall must have used industrial equipment because they wrecked the place they got money and jewelry we need a full alert downtown and somebodys got to keep an eye on the ranch we need some overnight temps at the office i tried to call nasmith security but cant get hooked up we need people downtown tonight i had to call cops about the burglary because the apartment management discovered it no way around it cops on way now maybe it was the money jewelry marian wore it friday everybody saw it theres no way to be sure we have to assume otherwise we better get low for another week or two ill call the paks this afternoon and put them off wipe this when you get it call me he also pulled a file we couldnt see what it was because the program only recorded keystrokes but we got the name oms all he did was read and then the connection shut down and he was offline lets go i said hes off and hes going to be occupied for a while we went out to a red roof innchecked in with the fake id i got in san francisco but paid cashand got online the dump box was still offline which meant that corbeils computer was shut down i went out to the ammath number punched in his password and we were in the oms file was short and sweet a few corporate memos and a list of names and phone numbers i then checked for an oms got nothing went to oms got nothing and then simply oms and again got nothingwhich was odd because the files wed inherited from jack were labeled oms they could have been in another sector of the computer or a different computer entirely someplace where i didnt have access i did find a find a large administrative file called clpr which turned out to be internal memos about the clipper ii program i dumped it to our jaz disk which took a while too long actually when we had it i closed down the connection wed taken care not to touch any hard surfaces inside the room that we didnt have to and when we were done we wiped those wed had to touch told the motel clerk that something had come up at home and that wed have to check outyou could see the yeah right in his eyes as he looked at luellenand headed back to our hotel we should have spent a little time fooling around i said for verisimilitudeyou dont really have that nice pink postorgasmic look that you get afterwards we could still go for it she offered too late to impress the clerk i said the oms file was mostly interesting for the namesmilitary people from around the world but mostly from the band of islamic states that stretched from syria to indonesia only egypt in africa and turkey was missing why is that odd luellen asked when i commented on it just the selection of names if youre doing the clipper these people might all be customers but the main customers would be the bigger statesengland france germany russia japan china india like that instead we have syria iraq iran kuwait pakistan indonesia kazakhstanmissing afghanistan missing saudi arabia missing turkey its only one file if its oms that implies other numbers even if we couldnt get them maybe theyre someplace else or they erased them yeah thats true the clpr file included a couple of thousand memos on routine technical personnel and financial matters we spent four hours reading through themscanning them reallywithout finding a single useful fact you know what luellen said if i had to be an administrative guy id cut my wrists i cant imagine even writing this shit much less worrying about it not a single goddamn thing i said discouraged maybe there is one thing she said not a fact and im not sure but lets look at the dates on these things we looked at the dates and luellen pointed out that two years earlier there were ten or twenty clipper memos being filed every week a year ago there were ten at the most for the past six or eight months there were four or five being filed weekly like the project is running down she said maybe its running out of time or money maybe theyve been stealing from it and thats what theyre trying to cover i suggested so why would they kill for a picture of three guys in a parking lot if they did wed know if we could figure out who the guys were i said how do we do that figure it out i dont think we do were not the fuckin fbi were just some guys chapter st john corbeil corbeil was in a rage the necklace was gone and the palm of his hand itched for it his space had been violated he had been so angry about the necklace that he hadnt seen that it was a diversion and theyd done it so beautifully theyd absolutely suckered him those greasy footprints all over the living room with only one track leading past the computer he could still see the footprints in his minds eye could still feel the way hed relaxed when he realized that the computer hadnt been touched hed been angry about the necklace but that had only been thieves lord knows hed paraded the stones around enough hanging them off the necks of half the models in dallas but theyd used him theyd known how hed think then that same night theyd looted the computer they would not have been found out if woods hadnt been watching hadnt seen the next morning the odd gropingabout in the files hed come in to ask about it and corbeil knew instantly what had happened suckered lane ward he said she wouldnt have the resources hart protested whoever went into your apartment was a pro that safe wasnt ripped out of the wall by hackers that took special gear they goddamned near destroyed your apartment and nobody in the building heard a thing then who is it the fbi doing a blackbag job not anymore its not the cia theyre the most gunshy intelligence agency in the west the nsa they have fewer resources in the dark than we do so who somehow its ward or if its not ward she can tell us who it is look at what they did with the bug in san francisco shes got help he turned and looked at hart find her take her well talk to her out at the ranch mr corbeil if she disappears the shits going to hit the fan im already tied to the morrison killing look we can make her out to be a member of firewall weve already started the groundwork on that ill have woods do an entry from the outside using the stuff from my apartment just like they did itbut theyll go into clipper files and well call the nsa and the fbi in well lead them back to her somehow what she drops her drivers license on the motel floor hart asked skeptically and shes got somebody with her yeah and thats another guy we want to talk to ill bet its some little stanford computer genius who happens to know how to hack into anything one of those goddamned pencilnecked hundredandsixtyiq smartasses who might even be able to pull a safe out of a wall hart shook his head and then corbeil said fingerprints maybe what a computer attacks launched from a motel room when the fbi investigates it finds her fingerprints all over the place howre we going to get her to do that well talk to her first in a motel room rent a room talk to her there make sure there are plenty of prints around then take her out to the ranch as soon as shes gone we have woods make an intrusion call from the motel room the agency can still trace that kind of crap sounds too complicated if she broke away if she started screaming so if its too complicated take her right out to the ranch corbeil snarled then we cant well have her hands corbeil said she wont need them not when were done talking to her jesus hart said no hes not here corbeil answered i just think im starting to feel what this is out of control william youre right youre absolutely right weve got to get it back under control or were dead meat you did a year in the softest prison in texas howd you like a real hard place the kind of place they reserve for traitors thats what theyd call us traitors william we would spend the rest of our lives up to our necks in shit but if we just do nothing weve been trying that william its not working we need to know whats happening if worse comes to worst we at least need the time to run run hart clasped his head in his hands ah jesus running so you get lane ward and the geek whos driving her around whoever it is in the meantime ill sit here behind this desk he pointed to the cherrywood desk in the cornerand try to think of a way to pin the whole thing on firewall pin it hard enough that we wont go down for it anyway we should shut down the old man of the sea corbeil shrugged if you insist but theres really no point theyre not close to it they have no hint of it i would just feel easier about it hart said ill talk to woods corbeil said chapter we slept late the next morning luellen later than i at ten oclock i rolled out stretched cleaned up when i came back into the main room luellen was still half asleep shed thrown the blanket off and from one angle near the bathroom door her face was nicely framed by one outflung arm and was just risingfrom that perspectiveover a thigh with her foot in the foreground feet are always nice to draw especially when you get to see them from the bottom i tiptoed around to my briefcase got out my drawing book eased a chair over to the bathroom door sat down and drew for an hour finally growing aware of the total silence she pushed herself halfway up and looked around kidd right here drawing my butt again she pushed herself all the way up stretched and yawned its in the picture but its not the focus its sorta half cut off she came to look as i worked some shading in around her toes my feet arent that big she said from this perspective theyre not that big theyre fives from this angle bullshit not that big and my toe isnt that bent youre right im sorry i apologize no you dont she said she stretched again you dont care whose fragile ego you crush all artists are like that somebody once said that a portrait is a painting where theres something not quite right about the mouth i said it might have been sargent anyway nobodys ever said that about the foot im the first go take a shower i said she went to take a shower and i struggled with the foreshortening of her leg and foot and with her face in the back rising over her thigh and the pillow behind that when i was done i took the drawing out ripped it up and tossed it in the wastebasket something not quite right about the foot with all that in my head waiting for luellen to get out of the bathroom i looked out the window down at the parking lot and understood what i hadnt understood before why i had looked down at the parking lot and thought id missed an important thought understood the ammath photographsor something about them anyway it all came out of the perspective of luellens foot the shower was running and i could hear her humming to herself in the bathroom as i brought the laptop up and one of the photos jesus i was right i sat staring at it then brought up another one ripped a piece of paper out of my drawing book got a pen and began making comparative measurements on the computer screen i was still doing it when luellen came hobbling out of the bathroom with a towel around her head i glanced at her and looked back at the computer thanks she said im here with my nice pink shut up i gotta get online with bobby get dressed what look at this photograph she looked over my shoulder what she asked again look how this shadow comes down from this light pole the shadow from the sun yeah look how it comes down from this light pole i said all right and this one i see all the shadows and all the light poles kidd so what all the shadows are in exactly the same perspective exactly as close as i can measure doesnt it look weird to you no and so what its impossible thats all well not impossible if the camera was far enough back we were thinking it might be a surveillance camera up on a roof itd have to be to get that high angle still not high enough i said i gotta get with bobby he could make some better measurements and do the numbers if thats not high enough what you think it was made by a plane not high enough i said i think thats a satellite photograph she still wasnt much impressed i had to work to get that think what a face would look like if you took it from three blocks away with your nikon and then blew it up to this size itd look like a thumbprint i said look at those faces you cant quite recognize them but you almost can if that cameras in orbit it has one unbelievable capability now she was hunched over me and spotted something we should have seen before you know those cars there were only a halfdozen of them in the parking lot not a single one of them is americanmade look at this one she tapped the screen with a fingernail i dont think ive ever seen that kind it looks like a combination of a pickup truck and a sedan you see those in the middle east i said lots of them she straightened so its a satellite photo so what i dont know yet but it seems unlikely that a satellite would take a picture of three guys and the three guys were important i said how could you time something like that radios maybe i shook my head i bet its not the guys that are important i bet its the photograph not the content just the photograph that they have it theyre supposed to be working on the clipper chip and they have this this has got to be some kind of ungodly highlevel secret capability you could not only see stuff like ammo dumps you could see whats in them if they can do something with computers to punch up the resolutionjust a probability enginethey might be able to figure out who gets into which car might be able to track cars through traffic all kinds of stuff theyre nsa right isnt that what they do no no thats another group the nro the national reconnaissance office they do all the satellite stuff so lets get online with bobby and see what he says we got online from a mall bobby thought he could figure out the height of the camera by picking out small parts of the original fullstrength photos and making some precise measurements on the shadows freaky if its a satellite photo never seen anything like this maybe what theyre hiding but what does it have to do with firewall there was the other side of lanes question lane was interested in what happened to jack bobby was interested in how his name got attached to firewall somehow ammath was involved in both of those things but how and why were they related or were they related we talked about it as we were leaving the mall and decided they had to be linked jack went to maryland where the computer that started the firewall rumors was located the guy he saw who was later killed was a client of that same server it was all tied we just couldnt see the knot lane it turned out had been worrying about the same questions all night we all had breakfast together and she leaned across the diner table picked up my glass of coke and rapped it on the table she had a theory she said say the photographs are wildly important for some reason we dont know why but lets say thats a given jack steals them they know he stole them but they dont know why or who he might have given them to so they come up with a scheme they invent this firewall group using names that they harvest from the internet legendary hackers theres all kinds of talk on the net anybody could get a list like that they make jack a part of the group so when the names finally come out the copsll say ahah he was a member of the radical firewall group thats why he broke into ammath and it was only bad luck that he got caught why use the server in maryland i asked the same one that lighter just happened to be on you said it was mostly nsa people she said maybe it was one server they all knew that they all had access to sounds weak luellen said but the rest of it sounds pretty good green said it ties things together what about the irs attack that was set up weeks ago but the firewall name wasnt around weeks ago i said that could have been made up at the last minute these hacks are ready to attack the irs and just at that moment somebody invents a group with a neatsounding name so they say all right were firewall too goddamnit luellen said its still too hard to think about ill tell you what though lane said when we go back into ammaths computer i think we ought to be looking for stuff on firewall and satellites this clipper stuff is a dead end whatevers going on doesnt have anything to do with clipper when we go back in i asked darn right i know my way around mainframes as well as anyone i want to be there tonight when we go back in she said gotta find a new motel i said theres a place called eightyeight right across the street from where were at green said so well set up there tonight i said well use one of luellens ids and call you when were settled in lane didnt have much to say about her talk with the cops they say they dont believe that ammath had anything to do with anythingbut i think they believe theres some kind of government deal going on and they dont want to know about it they think were the bad guysjack and me you told them about the burglary at your house of course lane said we gave them every single detail we told them we thought jacks house had been broken into too theyre dead in the water green said i used to work with a program in oakland that investigated shootings by cops most of the shootings were openandshut but every once in a while wed get a shooting and thered be something wrong about it no proof no evidence just something wrong wed try to get the cops to look a little deeper to ask a few more questions and theyd say they would but you could see it in their eyes theyd signed off they either believed they knew what happened or they didnt want to know any more thats whats happened with this case i could see it theyve signed off theyre all done they dont want to know any more damnit nobodyll move i said we thought about that then lane said by the way i looked up mclennan county where corbeil has that ranch its about a hundred miles south near waco we made arrangements to meet them that night in denton and then luellen and i took the rest of the day off wed been cooped up too long hanging out in hotel rooms and restaurants we were the kind of people who liked to move around i got my laptop and sketchbook and my watercolor tin and a plastic squeeze bottle of water and we went out to a driving range and luellen hit balls for an hour while i drew the shelter over the driving line the whole thing with the satellite photosif thats what they werehad gotten me thinking about perspective the driving line was sheltered by a fiftyyardlong metal roof mounted on steel poles and from the corners made a fairly interesting challenge in threepoint perspective when luellen got tired of hitting balls we went back to the hotel talked to a desk clerk who got a map out and drew a sixmile jogging circuit that he ran himself every morning and we drove out to his starting point and did the six miles in fortyfive minutes just cruising along suburban streets looking at all the pickups not bad she said when we got back to the car lets go buy some boots she bought two pair of cowboy boots and paid six hundred dollars for them ive never actually seen her on a horse but she does like horses and she liked the boots they put an inch or two on her height and she liked that too at nine oclock luellen checked us into the eightyeight motel in denton we got online and took a look in the dump box corbeil had been online in the morning before wed even gotten upno rest for the wickedbut hadnt used the computer since then maybe theyre fixing up his apartment and hes staying someplace else while they do it luellen suggested i hope not id like to be sure that hes in his apartment and done for the day before i sign on with his codes i said if we were on and he tried to get on he might see the conflict luellen called lane on the cell phone and told her where we were we didnt want any calls on the room phone going out to a number that could be connected with any of us and figured to throw the cell phone away in the next day or two lane and green showed up ten minutes later having walked over from the radisson i told them about the dump box and how we were using it as a cutout and why i didnt want to go online immediately makes sense lane said id like to look at those files you got she spent the next two hours flipping through the administrative files stopping every fifteen minutes or so to look at the dump box green luellen and i chatted for a while then luellen ordered a paytv movie a hyperviolent sciencefiction flick that had all the depth of a comic book the production values on the other hand were great ten minutes after the movie ended lane went online to check the dump box and found that corbeil was working the signon protocols and codes were the same as the night before he sent a couple of short memos one of them berating a guy named john mcneal about a production problem on cds carrying what apparently were commercial code products then he signed off we waited another halfhour lane with increasing impatience to make sure he wouldnt sign on again then went out to the ammath computer we looked for anything that involved satellites photographs middle eastern nations the nsa the cia the national reconnaissance office tried all of those things as keywords in a variety of searches and even threw in oddball stufforbit surveillance resolution after half an hour i suggested that we shut down we need to do more research into what were looking for i said maybe just go to the library and get business stuff about ammath trying to flog our way through the computer is like trying to find a twoinch article in ten years worth of newspapers lane wanted to continue fifteen more minutes she said twenty minutes were in who knows whether theyll change all the protocols or something luellen wasnt doing anything and bored said im going down the street to that randys place and get coffee and a doughnut anybody want anything ill walk along i said to lane fifteen minutes yeah yeah randys was a combination greasy spoon and greasy bakery we bought doughnuts and coffee and a diet coke and talked about not much at all two people carrying a couple of white bakery sacks along the highway we were a hundred yards from the motel when we saw the flashes luellen said did you see that i was already trotting toward the motel nighttime gun flashes are hard to mistake and even with the background noise of the highway we could now hear the rapid poppoppop of gunfire we got closer and saw two men break away from the motel from the end where our room was another couple young kids college kids maybe both carrying book bags stopped to look at them as they crossed the parking lot to a waiting car the shorter of the two men was hobbling one of the kids broke away from the other running toward the motel then the other one followed and i ditched the white bags behind a car and the car with the two guys screeched out of the parking lot fishtailed once in the street and disappeared into traffic we turned the corner of the motel and saw an older guy whitehaired in a burgundy windbreaker walking toward our room the college kids just coming up i was ten steps back now luellen a few steps further behind and the college kid a boy went inside and then popped back out and started screaming call an ambulance call an ambulance i pushed past his white face to the door and saw lane on the bed she was dead her face gone couldnt see green the bathroom door was mostly closed and shot to pieces i stepped over to the door and knuckled it open green was in the bathtub looking up at me a gun in one hand got an ambulance coming i said are you hurt bad hit twice he groaned what about lane gone get out of here he said i went back out into the main room the college girl was inside with luellen and i shouted at her go out to the street wave the ambulance in what i dunno i dunno i shouted at her she stepped back frightened of me and turned and ran toward the street flag the ambulance i shouted after her to the old guy in the burgundy windbreaker i yelled two people shot run down to the office and make sure that kids called an ambulance he turned and ran the minute he was gone i stepped past the bed not looking at lane ripped the phone wire out of the telephone bundled up the laptop which had fallen on the floor and stuck it in the back of my waistband under my jacket luellen had stopped to take a close look at lanelane had been hit at least twice in the side of the head and laid sprawled faceup eyes open just a crack on the yellow bedspread luellen shook her head lanes purse was lying on the floor luellen rolled it with her foot took the pistol out and slid it into her jacket pocket without another word we were out of the room two motel people were running toward us and i waved at them in here in here hurry hurry get an ambulance more people came running and luellen and i eased to the outside of the group and then turned and then were around the corner and in the car we went out the back of the parking lot slowly onto a service road down a block and were out of sight when the first cop car arrived she had no chance luellen said grimly executed greens alive but he was hit a couple of times i said he was in the tub he was still thinking he said to get out so hell cover us fingerprints not from me i said the only hard surface i touched was the tv remote and green was using it after i did so i should be okay you used the bathroom i was careful you used the telephone just plugged into the side never picked up the receiver i dont think i touched anything with my fingertips guys from ammath she said gotta be what is it with them i dont know but they must have spotted me coming online last night and set up to backtrace our entry tonight took them an hour to do it and get here christ lane and green probably thought that was us at the door coming back with coffee chapter luellen and i had been in jams before i dont know whether it was simply experience or some essential defect in our personalities that allowed us to carry on as efficiently as we did to get the laptop to get out to do it without talking about it or hesitating if ive ever been seriously attached to any one person in my adult life it was luellen but if shed been in that motel room and if id walked back to find her dead on the yellow bedspread then god help me i believe i would have reacted the same way and if id been dead and shed looked in it would have been the same no rage no horror or fear or even sorrow efficiency get the laptop get the gun get out assess the damage the rage and sorrow comes later but it comes on the way out in the car luellen kept coming back at me about fingerprints thats where we could hang up if id left my prints behind they could put a face with themid been thoroughly and repeatedly printed in the armyand the other witnesses at the motel would confirm it but i didnt think id left any luellen and i had done all this before operating out of remote sites and you go in thinking about not leaving prints if you get sloppy about it then youll always leave a few the only hard thing id touched was the phone and the room keycard which i still had in my shirt pocket still we both ran the whole night through our heads picking out each move wed made after a while i let out a breath and said im good so am i except that the clerk saw me when i checked in yeah but lane looked sort of latino and half the people around there looked latino i bet the clerk identifies her as the woman who checked in because she looked like a lot of other women who checked in and her face is shot up good thing i didnt check us in with green being black then theyd know maybe green wont cover for us he couldnt give them too much he doesnt know who we are really he could find out or give the cops enough information that they could i dont know i think texas is a felonymurder state if he says he doesnt know what was going on that he was simply a hired bodyguard for lane who was doing something with her computer if he says that hell kick clear if he lets them know that he knew what lane was doing then she would have been killed in the course of committing a crime and that might make a case against him for felony murder so he cant talk he wouldntif he knows all this so lets call bobby maybe he can get the word back we called bobby from a pay phone when he came up on the laptop i wrote call me now voice line emergency he called back five seconds after i was off id only talked to him on a voice line a couple of times the only thing i knew about him was that he was a black guy who i thought lived someplace in the mississippi river south he had one of those soft delta accents and was tied into a lot of interesting black people who in the sixties would have been called activists or maybe in that part of the world agitators what happened he asked without preamble i gave it to him as succinctly as i could then said somebodys got to get with green a lawyer who can tell him to stick with the ignorant bodyguard story if he lets on that he knew lane was committing a crime then they might felony murder bobby said bad for you bad for me yeah somebodys got to get in touch i can handle that bobby said softly how are you were good but were clearing out we dont think anybody will be looking for us too hard but just in case were gonna run down to ah austin check in from there talk to you i said and hung up austin luellen asked its a big city with lots of people coming and going i said other than dallas its about the closest big city to waco corbeils ranch she was quiet for a while then said so now youre on a revenge trip forget jack youre going to get them because they killed lane no if i could id go home right now but i need to get loose i cant get loose the feds have a list of names theyve got murder and evidence of a conspiracy and the irs attack and maybe what looks like an attack on a major encryption company theyll eventually start peeling back the names ive got to figure out whats going on and get them running that way or im fucked she didnt say anything so eventually i said im not sure you really need to stay around from here on out its gonna be mostly computer stuff oh shit kidd you know im not going anyplace she said irritably maybe if you shut up so i shut up i wanted her around we stayed the night in dallas given the time the shooting took place it was too late to make the regular television news if the papers bothered with it they wouldnt get more than a few basic facts from the cops we decided to stay over and to leave at the peak checkout time in the morning thats what we did thered been nothing on the latenight news and nothing in the morning papers at eight oclock we were headed down to austin hope bobby got somebody to green luellen said partway down neither of us was talking much the images from the motel were too clear the kind of images that push you back into your own head he said he would and hes got good contacts i said i hope austin used to be a smalltown pretty place take away the heat and its more like minnesota than the rest of texas twenty years ago i could have imagined living there except that the landscape colors werent mine now therere too many people and the city has gone from a great place to a pain in the ass somebody elses problem we checked into a holiday inn and started making phone calls what happened attorney talked to green this morning greens in intensive care wounded legs thighs will be okay green knows felony law tells cops he didnt know what was going on except client had been attacked several times had been burglarized brother shot he was hired to do bodyguard work green says he was in bathroom when door knock came she said theyre back and he said stay away but she opened door and shooting started he says he hit one cops find blood trail he did good must play dumb he does that cops push him hard but all he has is hiring on recommendation of friendfriend will cover tells cops he doesnt know lw doesnt know computers saw no trouble until shooting started ok you still working yes irs attack continues continues but closing down now rumors feds hunting firewall names make some busts nothing in papers wash post fbi nsa in conflict over firewall rumors german called copernix does it ok you monitor we will call daily yes one more thing the five data strings with the pictures include various byte files followed by distinct byte bit files followed by various byte files bit files are likely ultrastrong keys but dont know lock possible photos encrypted decrypted with keys will look good bye what luellen wanted to know those goddamned files as soon as we got them we should have gone to mexico or someplace and hid out and figured them out if theyre killing for them theres got to be a reason they must think we can figure them out why dont you just mail them to the nsa and let them figure them out not until i know what they are if theyre important enough to kill for then they might be important enough that the nsa or the cia or somebody else would just keep coming after them anyway ive got a new theory lane had a theory but i have another one the theory is that ammath screwed something up so badly that they figured they had to cover it and the whole thing got out of control when jack was killed now theyre killing to cover up the killing sounds like a bad movie thats what i got i said that afternoon we got something else after looking gloomily through the filesi saw how bobby isolated the bit file and there wasnt any question that it was distinct from the garbage before and after and it did look like a keyi noticed the oms tab again the old man and the sea no that wasnt right everyplace id seen the whole name it was old man of the sea either a mistake or not hemingway lets go i said where down to the university library see if i can get somebody to tell me about this old man of the sea kidd this is the university of texas and a damn fine university it is i said really yup it is but then if it turns out to be something important whoever you talk to will probably remember you i think its a chance weve got to take couldnt you just look it up on the internet or something well i scratched my head i could try of course but id become so accustomed to thinking of the net as a large sewer clogged with crap that it hadnt occurred to me we can try i plugged old man of the sea into the alta vista search engine and got back web pages most of it was junk but it became pretty clear that the original old man of the sea was a character from the voyages of sinbad the sailor according to the story sinbad was stranded on an islandhe never learnedwhere he came across an old man who he believed to be crippled the old man asked to be carried to a pool of water but when sinbad got him there the old man wouldnt get off sinbads back in fact he grew something like spurs and claws and dug into sinbads neck for days sinbad was forced to carry him around the island and feed him sinbad himself in an excess of pain hollowed out a gourd that he found and filled it with grapes in a few days the grape juice had become strong wine which he drank to kill the pain the old man noticed him doing this and demanded some of the wine sinbad gave it to him the old man became drunk and sinbad was able to throw him off his shoulders not being a major moralist sinbad then beat the old man to death when he managed to get a ship off the island he was told that the old man was a famous devil who would beg to be carried but then would ride his victim to death eventually eating the body nice story luellen said i should have remembered it i said i read all the sinbad stories but a long time ago so what does it mean there are some very heavy social and psychological implications to it you have no fuckin idea what it means she said why do you think weve been cutting the devil card out of my tarot deck she opened her mouth to crack wise and then shut it and kept it shut actually going out on the net suggested something else to me i did a quick search found a site and plugged in wwwdallasnewscom the dallas morning news had one of the better newspaper sites and on page one it earned a teaser one killed one wounded in denton shooting i punched it up and after a minute a brief story trickled down the laptops screen a california woman was killed and a man who told police that he was her bodyguard was wounded in a shooting at the eightyeight motel in denton late saturday night denton police say the shooting may be drug related lane ward an assistant professor of computer science at stanford university in palo alto california was pronounced dead at the scene while her bodyguard identified by police as lethridge green of oakland california was in fair condition at mount of olives hospital police said that both ward and green had prior drugrelated arrests ward in in san francisco for possession of marijuana green in in oakland for possession of cocaine witnesses said the gunmen were two white males one of whom was wounded in the shooting neither gunman has been found police said green was being held for questioning at the hospital ooo little lane was smoking dope luellen said in i said she was a college kid but it sounds bad doesnt it not unless the cops dropped some dope in the room and the paper doesnt mention any dope being found i said of course theres the other possibility yeah that its all bullshit from start to finish that the fbi or somebody is mixing in with the cops and dont want reporters asking any more questions i mean right now its another doperelated shooting nobodyll give it another look good for green probably i said so we didnt go to the library we didnt go to waco either not that day or the next if there was anything going on at the ranch they might be looking out for conspicuously nonrancher cars for at least a couple of days so we spent sunday and monday wandering around austin bought a basketball at a walmart and played a little oneonone at a local playground hit some more golf balls did some drawing checked the dallas morning news web site a couple more times but the story was dead talked to bobby the fbi had interviewed green pretty much cutting out the local cops hed convinced them that he was hired muscle he had all the background plus the attitude they left with a few threats but both green and his lawyer thought it was all over i also spent some time calling around austin and found a place i could rent a pickupi need to help my daughter move some furniture from one house to another i told the guy at access car rental who didnt care one way or the otherand picked up the truck on monday night we watched movies on pay tv the next morning at eight oclock we left for waco or whacko as luellen pronounced it chapter when we were killing time in austin we hardly talked about lane ward we were working at pushing her away the image of her dead on the motel bed instead of talking about that we were technical how did they find us so quickly when did they detect the intrusion etc on the way up to waco luellen who had hardly spoken at all that morning asked whos going to take care of her what whos going to take care of lane whos going to take care of the funeral and her stuff at her house whats going to happen with all that does somebody just haul it to the dump dont start i said i cant help it i woke up thinking about it i mean she was about my age and she doesnt have any kids and her parents are dead just like me then all of a sudden shes killedand who takes care of her the state i mean do they just cremate her and throw her ashes in a dump somewhere do they take all of her books out and throw them away or have a garage sale or what if shes got a will i mean that should take care of it thats just legal luellen said i wonder if theres anybody who really cares she worried about it all the way to waco and didnt really stop then i dont think she just stopped talking about it waco has a county courthouse that looks like a state capitol i went in looking for a map and they sent me across the street i got one chatted with the map guy for a few minutes and he showed me a plat book it took a while but i eventually spotted corbeils ranch just outside a little town called crawford which was northwest of waco proper we stopped at a barnes noble bookstore luellen ran in and bought a couple of crumpets and some kind of health juice and we headed for corbeils theres a big lake at waco and a couple of rivers which didnt fit with my mental picture of the place but there they were the november countryside was low and rolling and as we got closer to crawford cut by gullies and a few creeks there was some corn farming and lots of hay around but in general the country was more ranch than farm we crawled through crawford inadvertently ran a fourway stop that i thought was twoway and almost got tboned by a chevy pickup luellen was peering out the window and said eventually took me sixteen years to get out of a place like this really a place like this up in minnesota she said id never known she was a smalltown girl though if id thought about it i mightve guessed and i waited no smalltown kid has ever been through another small town without some kind of comment about the other towns inferiority she said but the place i grew up at least we had a dairy queen yup corbeils place was set on a ridge above texas highway the place was a sprawling yellow logcabinstyle house not new but not antique either the kind of log place that city people buy we couldnt see it all from the road but a halfdozen outbuildings of one kind or another were scattered about the place a steel pole barn stuffed with hay what was probably a machine shed a sixcar garage what might possibly have been a bunkhouse or an office buildingtwo doors and a row of windows with decorative shutters next to each windowa long low stable with a training ring off one side and what might have been a pump shed one pasture surrounded with barbed wire and with a circular growth pattern in the grass that suggested a centerpivot watering system contained a halfdozen brahman cattle the rest of the place was that kind of shaggy graygreen ready for winter a couple of hundred whitefaced cows were clumped around what we could see of the rest of his pasture land which continued to rise in a series of steps behind the ranch house according to the plat book corbeil owned acrestwo square miles a mile wide and two miles deep there were roads on two sides highway which ran eastwest along the front of the house and beulah drive which ran northsouth along the west side of the ranch a mile north of highway as we drove up beulah on the west side of corbeils property an old ramshackle farmhouse squatted well back from the road in a clump of trees with weeds growing up in the twotiretrack driveway the place looked dead but there was a newer pizzadishsized satellite tv antenna on the roof and another oldstyle dish on the lawn out back so we figured somebody probably lived there we continued on the county road to what we figured was the end of corbeils property and then went two miles on where we found the remnants of what must have been another old farm a grove of trees set back from the road with traces of a track going back into the trees i turned around on the track and in the silence and emptiness of the place got out and trotted back to the trees and found an old crumbling chimney and a parking spot littered with corroding beer cans maybe the local lovers lane on the way back out as we approached the north end of corbeils land again i pointed to the fence line that marked the edge of corbeils property up aheadsee those trees i want to hop out with the glasses you take the truck back up the road about five or six miles then come get me give me fifteen minutes i said wherere you going im going to walk along that fence row see what i can see on the other side of that hill probably a rancher who doesnt like trespassers ill tell him im an artist i said ill take my bag with me at the trees i hopped out with the bag and the binoculars and as luellen rolled away i cut through a copse of junky roadside trees crossed a fence where it joined another fence line and headed up the hill as i said the countryside was empty roads and fences and fields and not a lot of people i was walking through some kind of ground cover springy underfootit looked grassy and it looked as though it were regularly mowed but it wasnt anything like the alfalfa or clover i was familiar with i followed the fence line four hundred yards up the hill and finally reached a broad crest where i could look down on corbeils ranch lots more cows and a big stock tank with a watering station what interested me more though was the satellite dish that sat next to the pump station it was one of the big ones the oldfashioned dishes but it looked wellkept and there was nobody there to look at a tv still it was moving as i watched i couldnt actually see the movement but when i looked away and then looked back it seemed that the dish had moved i squatted next to the fence lined up a barb on the barbedwire with one edge of the dish and yes it was moving it moved for the best part of five or six minutes and then stopped as best i could judge from the direction of the road down the hill the dish was pointing northeast when it stopped i could see the backside of the old abandonedlooking farmhouse a mile south and with the binoculars could make out the satellite dish behind it that dish was also pointing northeast huh were the dishes coordinated were they talking to satellites and if they were so what there are uplinks all over the place even sports bars had them but bars didnt have coordinated dishes scattered over a couple of square miles if the dishes were linked they would have in effect a huge baseline which would be the same as having a much bigger and more sensitive dish and with those photos we were onto something a secret operation of some kind but who were they hiding it from if they were working with the feds theyd just go ahead and stick the dishes up anywhere they wouldnt be hidden away on a ranch in waco i was waiting in the trees when luellen came back anything yeah i think were getting a handle on something did you see a satellite dish at corbeils one of those big babies i didnt notice i dont think so we cruised the place again running down highway but no dish was visible from the highway could be down out of sight she said or maybe there are only two or maybe there are more tucked away like that stock tank what are you thinking she asked a little fantasy i said they were willing to kill for those pictures and we have what might be code we got that list of names for all those middle eastern countries i wonder if somehow they arent hijacking photos from the recon satellites and selling them for what sell surveillance of pakistan to india and surveillance of india to pakistan sell surveillance of iraq to iran and iran and syria to iraq of israel to syria of taiwan to china and china to taiwan theyd get caught i could tell you ten ways to do it that theyd never get caught that the buyers would never see the sellers thats what the internet is for any buyer whos getting this stuff itd be the biggest secret they had okay so what next lets go back to austin i need to do some shopping i said always shopping well come back tonight a scout a scout in austin we went to an outdoorsports store and bought a good compass a gps receiver with a map function topographic maps of the east waco area including corbeils ranch and a cheap black daypack at a buildingsupply place picked up a builders protractor a bubble level and some duct tape and in a sewing store a card with five yards of elastic banding i spent an hour in the parking lot with the gps receiver figuring out how to work it especially interesting were the time and distance functions and the backtrack function then there was the matter of the gun we need a better one luellen said look what they did to lane and what they did to jack those were executions so they just dont give a fuck if we go on a scout and they catch us and theyve got gunsthis is texas kiddtheyre going to shoot us down like dogs anytime you buy a gun ought to be easy in texas she said let me call weenie it was easy in texas all we had to do was drive to houston which was a little better than two hours away meet a guy in a parking lot near george bush intercontinental airport and give him for a cheap chinesemade ak with two magazines fifty rounds of x and a nylon sling thats about a twohundred dollar gun in a store i told luellen as we left the parking lot that wasnt a store she said hope it works i said looks like it was made by a high school kid in a shop class at five oclock we were back in austin in the motel room i pumped some shells through the ak bruised the tip of my middle finger with the firing pin and eventually decided that the thing might work we ate and by seven oclock we were on the road again the land around waco is fairly lush waco is just about south of dallas and the really dry sere landserious pricklypear countrystarts an hour or two to the west but the land just west of waco like lots of backcountry in this day of interstate highways was lonely all the land was used in one way or another but when wed gone out in the morning wed seen only one person along the road a woman walking out to her mailbox in that kind of country without the light pollution of the city it gets dark wed picked a good night for it windless starlit quiet the moon was already slanting down in the sky when we drove past corbeils there were lights in the house in the building that might have been an office or bunkhouse and in the yard a couple of cars were parked outside the garage but we didnt see anyone moving around we made the turn on beulah avenue west of the ranch and headed north until we found the track that headed back to the abandoned homesite that wed discovered in the morning once there we shut down the truck spent a couple of minutes looking around and mostly listening we heard nothing but insects and the gravel underfoot ten minutes after we arrived luellen broke out the taped flashlights and we started back down the road toward corbeils place the walk took forty minutes moving slowly and stopping to listen and scan ahead with the night glasses during that time we neither heard nor saw another vehicle at the corner of corbeils property where id followed the fence line in that morning we stepped into the trees and with the flashlights established our position on the gps ready go she said we were both dressed from head to foot in black in the city wed worn dark red jackets they were nearly as invisible as black when you were out of the light and looked a lot more innocent to cops out here if we were caught in the middle of corbeils pasture with the ak thered be no point in arguing that we were there by mistake we crossed the fence with me in the lead luellen following behind the stars and fragmentary moon were just bright enough that we could see each other as shadows and hear our feet swishing through the grass when wed walked a good distance up the hill i moved over to the fence line illuminating it with a spiderweb of light from one of the flashlights with the night glasses i could clearly make out the dish next to the water tank nobody around though down the hill i could see cattle lying down grouped together like pea pods on a table anything the word was a breath next to my ear no lets cross use the light and watch the barbs we crossed the fence and headed down the hill the dish was two hundred yards away and we took it easy stopping often to listen when we got close we could hear trickling water and then even closer a tiny electronic hum the equipment wasnt moving but was turned on i handed the ak and the night glasses to luellen by agreement she moved on down the hill about thirty yards as a listening post i took off the backpack and got the equipment out marked our spot with the gps switched the gps receiver to the time function then started making measurements the dish was in what appeared to be its rest position with the compass i measured to within a degree or to the direction it was aimed inabout degrees or a little north of west and not at all the direction it had been aimed earlier in the day when i was sure i had it right i got out the duct tape taped one end of the elastic band to the top rim of the dish stretched it across the face of the dish so i had a tight straight line with no sag and taped it to the bottom using the level to establish my earthline i measured the angle of the elastic which essentially gave me the current azimuth of the dish i wrote it down and then sat down to wait wed agreed earlier that wed wait for up to three hours for the dish to move if it hadnt moved by then wed bail wed be getting tired and our edge would be gone with the elastic stretched out i laid back on the ground and got comfortable watched the moon going down the stars popping out the lights from waco to the east were bright enough that you didnt get the full clout of the milky way as you do up in the north woods but then that might be northern jingoism the stars were pretty good id been there for twentyfive minutes when the dish motor burpedan electronic burp a change in the hum and i sat up listening to be sure then quickly checked the gps and jotted down the time with the level and protractor in hand i moved around to the front of the dish and quickly checked the azimuth it hadnt changed but something was happening the deeper note from the motor was unmistakable i was worrying about that when i felt a vibration in the disk and slowly surely it began to move tilting back i looked at where it was pointing at the horizon line but could see nothing but stars sometimes on dark nights you could see them the satellites like tiny sparks scratching themselves on heaven i checked the azimuth wrote down the gps time signal checked the azimuth wrote down the time checked it again and again then hurried around behind it got the compass checked to make sure the direction hadnt changed it hadnt i went back to the dish and checked the azimuth as many times as i could until the dish was pointing at the local horizon up the hill and suddenly stopped after taking the last azimuth i ran around and checked direction again still the same when i give the numbers to bobby i should have a straight line running through the sky from just north of west to just south of east and even with the crude measurements of the protractor should be able to give him a reasonable close approximation of times and azimuths at the top of its arc the dish stopped moving for thirty seconds then slowly began turning more to the north this time as the dish began to come down in its arc at the end of the movement sequence it was pointing at the horizon at about degrees or about degrees further north than before i noted that packed up my stuff took the elastic off the dish and walked south about fifteen feet and whispered luellen a moment later she was next to me get it yeah i heard you clunking around not too much i hope not too bad are we good unless youd like to take a little walk youre the boss moving slowly stopping often to use the night glasses and staying as far away from the groups of cows as we could we walked toward corbeils farmhouse we sat on one hillside for fifteen minutes taking the whole country in then crossed a wash and climbed the other side and from there we could see corbeils clearly no dish i muttered to luellen so lets go weve been here too long lets head over that way for a couple of hundred yards first and then head back i said that way was east toward the eastern edge of corbeils land we first crossed back to the hill behind us to get a little more distance between us and the house and followed the backside of the ridge for four or five hundred yards when the gps put us threefourths of the way across we turned back up the hill when we got to the crest we looked down and there in a little hollow was another dish thats three i whispered we crossed down to it and i marked it on the gps and did a quick measurement just like the last one waiting i considered waiting until it started to move but we were running down lets go we took better than an hour to get back to the truck we approached it slowly listening loaded up as quietly as we could backed out and headed south toward the highway once on the road luellen said nice night for a picnic im a little kicked i said she was driving and i added when we get down to that old farmhouse off on the side if there arent any lights stop at the end of the driveway just for a second there were no lights and she stopped i stuck the gps out the window got a quick read noted it and said lets go home we took the county road south then highway east past corbeils ranch as we passed the ranch we saw two men walking out to a car in the driveway one of them glanced at us as we went by that guy luellen said the one on the right yeah hes limping we continued down the highway and looking back i saw the car pull out of the driveway following a few miles on we stopped at an intersection before turning south toward waco the car followed again still behind us yeah but they would be theres no place else to go they didnt seem to be coming after us with any urgency slow down a little bring it down to about fiftyeven or fiftyeight i told her she lightened up on the gas and the car a buick slowly crept up on us when they were off our back bumper they hung there for a while then at a flat spot kicked out around us and accelerated away i had the glasses ready and picked out the tag number on the buick guy didnt look at me luellen said why should he were just another truck on the open highway even paranoia has its limits for amateurs luellen said not for me we wipe this truck and take it back first thing tomorrow morning before the dmv opens in case he can check the plate of course i said chapter we went back to bobby that night and i summarized everything wed figured out from the gps receiver id worked out precise locations of the three satellite dishes wed seen and the distances between them and also gave him the directions azimuths and times id taken from the dish unauthorized satellite contacts possible customers could get highres photos via the net with payments sent to front accounts names in jacks file were all west and south asia islamic and indian must be some kind of accounting on tasks how could they task the satellite without nro knowing dont know i will show dish data to two friends if ok with you must be good friends both excellent friends both know some things about satellites good any news on green yes attorney sez cops probably done with green is room monitored will check also check license plate i gave him the plate number and he said hed get back the next morning we returned the truck carefully wiped of fingerprints the gun and other equipment we stowed in the back of the rental car id hate to have a cop look at that collection night glasses compasses gps the rifle hed figure we were assassins luellen said as i put it all in the trunk maybe we are i said as the words came out of my mouth i tried at the last minute to make them into a joke but luellen looked at me with curious eyes i had to be careful now around her more waiting we spent the day stooging around checking with bobby every couple of hours luellen was tired of hitting golf balls with bad equipment why dont you learn how to play golf were always waiting on these things were always trying to figure out what to do and you always want to draw or some shit why dont you learn something social golf is for morons i said how would you know youve never played if you dont shut up im going to have to turn you over my knee ooo that could soak up a couple of hours she said the only thing we got from bobby in the morning was the id on the car driven by the two men from corbeils ranch a william hart with an address back at the beginning of all this i got a letter from jack that mentioned this guy he said to be careful around him because hes an evil fuck or something to that effect so lets be careful around him luellen said late in the day bobby had something can you go little rock yes when why tomorrow pick up equipment need to bug dish ok excellent talked attorney green room probably not formally monitored man in next room named morris kendall heavy drugs from cancer probably die in a day or two if you need to ask for patient thanks we checked out of the austin motel and headed back to dallas found another room in another anonymous motel called the hospital for visiting hours and were told we could visit until nine oclock tell me again what we can get from green luellen said we can point out the benefits of stonewalling i said im sure hes figured those out she said putting her hands on her hips youve got something else working through your dirty little mind i nodded reluctantly yeah i do but im not going to tell you about it yet because itd probably piss you off and then youd piss me off and i dont have the energy for all that anyway tonight im going into the hospital alone ill want you on the street ready to roll in case theres trouble kidd if you think theres gonna be trouble i dont think there will be but im more paranoid than our two friends at corbeils okay now shut up for a while im trying to think something else was working through my dirty little mind and i didnt want luellen to know about it not yet anyway id figured out how to drag ammath and corbeil and his goons right into the shit but i didnt want luellen around when i did it texas was a bad state for all this i went into mount of olives hospital at eightthirty that night with luellen waiting in a parking spot on a street behind the doctors parking lot if i had to run for it i probably wouldnt get out of the building but if i did and i could make it across the doctors parking lot we could be lost in traffic in fifteen seconds a gift shop was open just inside the hospitals front doors and i bought a bouquet of bright yellow flowers that looked something like daisies but with a plastic sheen and a harsh odor they came in a green glass vase the whole thing looked cheap but somehow right i asked at the information desk for morris kendalls room got the number and went up the door to greens room was open and a grim heavyset woman was sitting in a chair looking into a bed at the far end of the room there were two beds in the room i could see only the end of the bed closest to the door where i presumed green must be nobody told me that his room was only semiprivate goddamnit i went on to and found morris kendall in what appeared to be a coma dying all by himself a drip running into an arm that was pockmarked with needle sticks i put the flowers on a sidetable and tried not to look at him after a couple of minutes i went back out to the hallway and paced for a while the woman was still sitting there unspeaking clutching a purse on her lap she looked like she disapproved of this whole hospital thing i went and sat with morris for a couple of more minutes and in those two minutes decided that when i got old id lay in a lethal supply of sleeping pills just in case i didnt want to end like this people were coming and going in the hall and i kept looking for the heavyset woman fifteen minutes after i got there i was rewarded she went by the door walking with purpose clutching her purse with both hands i checked the hallwaya little cluster of a man and two kids all from their looks from the same family were gathered by a doorway fifty feet downand stepped around the corner into greens room green was in the first bed separated from the other by a pull curtain a television was bolted into the far corner of the room tuned to the romance channel green rolled his head toward me when i walked in i turned my hands palmup in a question and raised my eyebrows he shrugged but put a finger to his lips i stepped over next to his bed and put my head close to his he whispered what are you doing here needed to talk are you okay i will be gonna be in physical therapy for a few weeks sorry not as sorry as i am i was supposed to cover lane shes dead he looked ineffably sad when he said it i need to know about the two guys were they both shooting yeah big time didnt bother with silencers or any of that shit i think it might have been a pickup but when they saw me it was just boomboomboom you got the computer yes i need to know what the guys looked like you hit one of them not bad i dont think maybe even ricocheted him the short guy knocked me down first thing through the door right on my ass into the bathtub not a goddamned thing i could do but keep pulling the trigger good thing for you that the tub was there you got that right i dont think but he thought anyway for a second for probably the tenthousandth timei dont think i could have saved her not a chance i said these guys whatd they look like they were two mean white boys nylons over their heads so you couldnt see them very well but in good shape thin and hard i think real short hair i couldnt tell for sure but that was the impression i got one was maybe sixtwo or three the other was maybe three inches shorter than that but a little thicker youd notice if you saw them together i shot the short one all right are you headed back to oakland i guess id be happy to stay but i dont know what good id do you no no what we need the most is for you to go back to oakland and do absolutely what youd do if everything was just like you said it was youre a bodyguard who doesnt know anything about anything go back do therapy go for walks get laid if the feds are still interested you gotta bore them he nodded thats what ill do from the other side of the curtain a mans voice croaked hey leth you mind if i switch this over to cinemax i think they got one of them carwash movies on go ahead said green i could use a carwash movie i stuck a hand out shook greens and went out the door down the elevators across the doctors parking lot and into the car howd it go luellen asked fine greens cool and were good why do you look so bummed out she swung the car in a uturn and we headed back toward the interstate i told her about morris kendall next door to green there wasnt a single personal belonging in the room that i could see hes up there dying with nothing to keep him company but a cheap bouquet of yellow flowers from a stranger country song she said that was the easy part of the day we checked with bobby to see if he had anything new he had a time and a place in little rock threethirty the next day at a restaurant by little rock national airport with that all fixed i jumped luellen nothing slow and playful the way her taste runs in sex but straight ahead pinning her on the bed taking her down when we were done she said all right kidd what was that all about im shipping your ass out i said i figured youd be pissed for a while and i wanted some sex to remember you by she sat up you fucker luellen youre always reserving the right to take off when life gets too cranky right well its going to get crankier and theres no reason for you to be around id just have to think about taking care of you and i dont want to do that im gonna have enough to do taking care of myself youve never had to take care of me she said she said it in her dangerous voice i dont mean take care of you like a baby i mean watch out for you too whatre you going to do i have an idea i dont want to tell you about it because it wouldnt be good for you to know yet maybe later but what youve got to do is get somewhere public you have your passport right kidd what the fuck youve got your passport yeah ive got tomorrow morning early i put your ass on a plane to somewherenew york would be good with the san francisco id then you shuttle back to minneapolis with the first id you hadthats still goodand then fly out to the british virgins or the bahamas under your own name its a lot of flying but i want you checked through customs somewhere and i want you in public for the next few days where people will remember you now she was curious still pissed but curious what are you going to blow up im not going to blow up anything but this is all coming to a head and you can never tell what these alphabet security agencies are capable of if they put us together you could be in trouble and bobby says theyre peeling back the names ill never get all the flights i booked you this morning i said youre all confirmed this morning she said she turned that over for a second then said asshole this morning you we argued about it off and on for the rest of the evening tried to get some sleep she was throwing clothes around the next morning but at eight oclock her little round butt was in line at dfw for the new york flight shes absolutely capable of turning her back on me and walking away i think but this time she didnt after several hours of chill she gave me a serious kiss goodbye whispered take care and got on the plane i was on my own and on my way to little rock chapter the drive to little rock took six hours with time out for a cheeseburger and a couple of bathroom breaks i was in the part of the country where instead of getting french fries you get home fries home fries are actually pure grease soaked into grasslike strips of potato so you can get it to your mouth a waitress in a uniform the exact color of twodayold pumpkin pie dropped off the burger and fries did a searching scan of my tabletop and said my goodness somebody forgot to put out your catsup she was back in a minute with a bottle of heinz and said home fries just aint right without catsup she was and is correct they just aint right id only been to little rock once before in my life if you live in st paul little rock isnt on the way to anywhere except itself i didnt get to see much of the place either the guy i was meeting was waiting at a shoneys i picked him out as soon as i walked in how are you john i asked sliding into the booth he reached across the tabletop and we shook hands not too bad i heard about green and that lady youre in some shit he looked at me sideways his dark wraparound sunglasses glittering in the fluorescent light im sorry about green i said im sorry about your friend he said john smith was a black man originally from memphis but now going back and forth between memphis and a small town in the delta where his wife lived he was both hard and intelligent a political operator a friend of bobbys and an artist a sculptor i just got in he said im having the openface turkey sandwich home fries coconut cream pie and diet coke then you check in somewhere for a heart scan i said i got a coke and a salad when the waitress came to take our orders i said dont forget the catsup for his home fries how could i do that she asked a look of puzzlement crossing her face john said the package was in his car and we could get it on the way out bobby says that you should get some duct tape and tape the box onto the receiver at the focus of the dish that should be good enough then there are some tapes coiled around the box those are pickups like antenna you should wrap those around the support lines on the receiver that gives the receiver a little extra sensitivity okay he was drawing a hasty diagram on a napkin and it was all clear enough as soon as the dish begins to move turn our receiver on he said theres only one switch a toggle on the side while the dish is moving make the same kinds of notations you did the other nightdirection times and azimuths the receiver will pick up both incoming and outgoing and record them and bobby built in a timer function but he didnt have time to do a level or compass function all right luellen with you i sent her away i said you guys ought to have a couple of babies he said youre gonna wind up old with nobody to care for you thanks for the thought i said and flashed to morris kendall dying in room has bobby heard any more about firewall im not all together on this this is not my line john said bobby says firewall is definitely phonyhe says you think so too im leaning that way but he says the feds the nsa are blowing it up into a major danger to justify their budget he says that they dont have anything to dotheyre completely obsoleteand this whole firewall thing has been like a gift from heaven a reprieve what about the irs attack bobby says ten kids in germany and switzerland hes sent four names specific names to the feds but theyre not paying much attention bobby says they dont want to catch firewall not yet the salad came along with johns food and we spent twenty minutes talking about his wife marvel and kids and the political situation in longstreet where marvel lived with the kids he hadnt quite finished eating when he finished with the political situation and i looked at my watch and said theres a phone booth out in the lobby im gonna get online with bobby see if anythings happening be my guest he said the phone had little business and i got right on and dialed i never got to dial the ten digits after the number because after seven the phone rang once and a woman picked up and said montana genetics can i help you uh im sorry i think i have the wrong number well have a good day then she said cheerfully and hung up i dialed again montana and hung up got a problem i told john when i got back to the booth bobbys not online he looked at me a wrinkle between his eyes bobby was always online his life was online hes not when i dial the number i get something called montana genetics he sat back hands on the table ah shit hes pulled the plug i need him man i said so do we john said i never did know who we were although id known for years that there was a we he looked at his watch and added i gotta get back ive got to be near a telephone the waitress came over carrying the check she looked at john and asked are you mr smith what are you mr smith yes youve uh got a phone call normally we dont allow customers but the gentleman said it was an emergency john was out of the booth trailing her she took him into the back two minutes later he was back out gotta go bobby yeah he knew we were gonna be here he tossed five dollars at the tabletop and headed for the cashier outside in the open he said he says to tell you that ladyfingers was busted and she gave them the number and that the feds the nsa traced him all the way to the banana stand he said there were only three more links between him and the feds before he was toast hes shut down everything he says you should recover the number just like you did beforehe didnt tell me what it was hes crazy paranoidand said you will cut directly into him its the only link hes going to take coming in until he reworks all his numbers bad time for this i said bad time at the car john handed me a gym bag with the receiver in it as soon as youve recorded a full movement mail it back to me express mail at the house in memphis all right good luck he said keep your ass down at texarkana i found a gas station phone booth and hooked up with the laptop i went out to my two mailboxes and found just as bobby had promised two pieces of a phone number i called keyed a k and bobby came up very close never closer scared the s out of me im closed for business except for you did you get package yes can you mount tonight yes what else can we do i told him and got back a long silence then take care take care take care the interstate crosses some sparsely inhabited landscape between texarkana and dallas after checking the map i got off at one of the larger white spots and picked out a long piece of quiet road i parked on one side got out my sketchbook checked around then paced off yards down the road and stood a plastic coke bottle on the shoulder i was willing to bet i wasnt more than a yard or two offone of the things you learn in the burglary business is how to estimate distances my normal stride was thirtyfour inches long and id learned how to swing a leg just a splitsecond longer than i usually did to come down right on thirtysix inches back at the car i looked around again then got the ak out of the trunk loaded it rolled down the passengerside window when i was sure nothing was coming from either direction i ripped up a couple of pieces of newspaper made them into spitwads put them in my ears and aimed the gun out the window at the coke bottle the scope was decent i leaned back against the driversside door my left hand cradling the foreend and braced against the inside of my knee held on the bottle squeezed the rifle jumped and i lost sight of the bottle and when i got back on itwhere it would have beenit was gone i got the car straightened out repacked the rifle found the ejected shell and threw it into the roadside weeds rolled slowly down the road until i spotted the bottle there was a neat caliber hole an inch off center to the right maybe two inches below the shoulders of the bottle good enough more than good enough at dallas i stopped at the motel to clean up change clothes look at the packagea plastic box with a toggle switch and a couple of pieces of tape antenna sticking out of the top the whole thing the size of a vhs videotape cassette but heavierand get the rest of the gear moving right along it was still well past nine oclock before i made it through waco and headed out to corbeils the ranch house showed only one light and i saw no cars in the yard i continued up to the ruins of the old home place took the car back into the trees then got out and sat down on the incoming track and listened listening will always tell you more than your eyes if youre in the dark and somebody might be hunting you people get tense try to see dont know how to move breathe too hard and they stumble if youre relaxed breathing as quietly as you can eyes closed you can hear everything but owls you hear birds moving at night but never the owls theyre like ghosts after a halfhour i was satisfied that i was alone i stood up and scanned the area with the night glasses then picked up the equipment including the ak and headed down the road halfway down a truck came banging up the gravel i stepped well off the road to let it pass and watched until it had passed the cars hiding place when it was out of sight i listened again then moved on moving this slowly it was nearly midnight before i crossed the fence line and started down toward the dish when i was directly above it i scanned it with the glasses for ten minutes then moved down i could hear the electric hum and waited again but only a minute or two this time before taping up the package and extending the little antennas then i taped up the plastic bands so id be able to measure the azimuth that done i moved ten yards off into the pasture laid down and alternately listened and scanned the fields an hour passed and then another halfway into the third hour the electric hum changed pitch at first i thought i might be hallucinating the change because id been waiting so long i scrambled over listened again no doubt about it i put my hand on the dish and at the first vibration flipped the switch on our package the dish was moving and i began taking measurements a halfhour later i was crossing the fence with the package in my pack what bobby could do with it i wasnt sure bobby would take care of that id put it in the mail as soon as i got back to dallasthere must be an allnight post office out by dfw i thoughtand then id make my own run the killing of lane ward had put the idea in my mind the anger and frustration growing as these people hit at us for reasons we didnt know about andaside from jacks deathbarely cared about the cynicism of the people who were supposed to helpthe fbi and other agencieswas nearly as bad that night on the way back to dallas i saw a walmart and stopped to buy a box i finally found one large enough it contained the side boards and shelves for a doityourself book case i bought it and threw it in the car at the same time i called and got directions to the allnight post office and mailed the package to john in memphis that done i cruised the north dallas house belonging to william hart there was the faintest glow of light behind a window as though he had a night light but never a sign of life it was not a street where you could loiter i made a few passes checking out the neighborhood and called it a night but i was back the next morning at sixthirty eyes grainy after only four hours of sleep there were only a couple of logical quick routes from harts house to the downtown offices i couldnt hang out on his street but i could sit in a mcdonalds parking lot eat an eggandsausage mcmuffin and watch the street hed probably come out of i sat for a little more than an hour and saw the buick turn out of his street i fell in but kept six or seven cars between us he headed for an interstate ramp and i followed him up and toward town halfway down he got off the highway and began threading through local streets i stayed with him pulled off once then got in behind before he disappeared he stopped in front of an apartment house waited a moment later a man hobbled out short hair six feet barrelchested benson i thought the one wed idd in san jose he got in the car carefully i waited until they were gone and started scouting the neighborhood this neighborhood was different than harts lots of apartments lots of older houses commercial lots elbowing in on the residences corner stores and hairdressing salons videorental places like that after half an hour of careful scouting i found a spot there were drawbacks too many windows looking down on it but id have to risk it if it turned out to be the best i could do after scouting it i headed down to the historic district hoping to find a better setup ammath was a block from the end of the historic district the district ended with a parking lot and beyond that a jumble of freeway ramps i intended to cruise the district for a while hoping to spot their car i cruised for about two minutes and spotted it in a slot on the side of the building if the guy with the limp was hurt badly theyd probably kept looking for a space until they got one close to the building entrance all right i had the car when i rolled past it i could see straight ahead a truck in the parking lot the cars were actually parked in diagonals from the perspective of the ammath building anyway i drove down to the parking lot got a ticket and went to the end of the parking area next to the truck from there i could see the buicks passenger side and most of the drivers side and some of the sidewalk beyond it i settled down to wait in the movies when the detective settles down to wait the bad guys show in a reasonable time these bad guys didnt do that i waited for two hours couldnt stand it any longer and got out and walked around got a sandwich at a bar that gave me a view of the front of the ammath building plenty of people came and went but not hart i was back in the car the rifle just behind the seat at elevenforty theyd be going out for lunch i thought lunchtime came and went with no sign of them i got out and walked around some more always where i could see either the car or the building door got out the sketchpad and drew for a while but i wasnt in the mood and i dont like to draw concrete several times during the day i decided id had enough but i never quite left i was sure that if i left theyd head for the car one minute later so i stuck around watched texans come and go big hair on the women cowboy boots on the men not universally so but enough that you noticed at five oclock i knew the wait had to be short at fivethirty it was nearly over i figured and wondered if i should move the gun to the front seat didnt do it and at fivefortyfive hart walked out to the car got in and drove away the wrong guy i went after him and got close just in time to see benson limp around the back end of the car and get in i followed them out to the interstate and up the ramp they were headed for bensons apartment i thought all i had to do was get him out of the car for a minute i passed them on the highway drove way too fast through bensons neighborhood and left the car in the parking lot of a dry cleaners that was closed for the night the rifle was in the bookcase box the box id acquired at walmart the night before id wanted a big box one that would carry the rifle but not shout possible gun something that looked awkward the bookcase box did it the bookcase itself was in a dumpster behind my hotel i got the box out of the back and walked around the corner of the dry cleaners and set up between a garage and a hedge of a house down the street from bensons apartment i could see the door the parking lot and just the edge of the street some two hundred yards away i waited in the growing darkness hoping i could see well enough under the streetlights to get a good look at him they arrived five or six minutes after i had as the car pulled up i slipped the rifle out of the box braced myself against a corner of the garage and looked at the car through the scope still enough light benson got out of the car wobbled on his bad leg then leaned back into the car to say something for a moment he was unmoving i took the moment and shot him luellen always claims that you can get away with one or two loud noises one or two shots one large mechanical clunk whatever the first loud noise will cause people to wonder what it is if its not repeated theyll stop wondering thats the theory i didnt look down toward benson after i fired i simply eased back down slipped the gun in the bookcase box and backed away from the shooting scene keeping the garage between myself and whatever was happening in front of bensons apartment at the dry cleaners i put the box in the trunk backed out of the parking lot and drove away as i passed the end of bensons street i looked down toward his house and saw two people on his lawn looking down at what was apparently bensons body and a third person a woman running across the street with a big yellow dog in front of her on a leash i thought i kept going out to the interstate back to the motel i carried the box inside got the gun out wiped it down put it back in the box carried it back out to the car as long as i had the gun i could be in trouble i drove slowly carefully out of dallas north until i was well into the countryside stopping only once to buy a cheap shovel a halfhour north of the city i turned off on a country road drove until i found a nice patch of trees got out of the car and buried the ak a couple of feet down kicking some dead leaves over the raw soil back on the highway two or three miles from the guns grave i wiped the shovel and tossed it out the window into the roadside ditch shooting somebody from ambush is not exactly the ailamerican way of doing things but i was more intent on survival than etiquette when i got back toward dallas i called the denton police department nonemergency line a woman answereddenton police can i help youand i said hi this is jack hersh from the morning news can you tell me whos handling that shooting a couple of days ago at the eightyeight motel i uh think thats sergeant frederick hes out right now ill check back i said whats sergeant fredericks first name hal thank you got back to bobby still trouble yes busted curtis meany say he will chain to many more hackers never heard of him you no have they busted anybody we know not since ladyfingers need home phone number for sergeant hal frederick of denton police department wait one a moment later he was back with the unlisted number bobby is very deep in the telephone system what happens working any more on satellites yes but may miss necessary info possibly can reconstruct do you have access to ammath docs no will try to crack computers from here take care theyre watching and you take care i stopped once more before heading back to the motel from an outside phone i called hal fredericks number he answered on the fourth ring sounding cranky yeah sergeant frederick i have a tip for you who is this even crankier a benefactor youre investigating the shooting at the eightyeight motel about two hours ago there was a shooting in dallas a man named lester benson hes been taken to the hospital with a wound in the thigh if you check you will find that he has another recent bullet wound in one leg he was the man who was shot running out of the eightyeight after the murder if you check his blood dna against the blood you found in the parking lot you will find a match who is this remember the name lester benson he was admitted to the hospital a couple of hours ago the dallas police should have the details i said and dropped the phone back on the hook if that didnt create some serious heat id just pack up and head home i had no more ideas chapter st john corbeil corbeil smeared his face and his hands pulled the black hat on his head and shuffled across the parking lot to the emergency room at health north inside a nurse behind the reception station glanced at him an old man maybe blackcertainly black with the x baseball hat on his headas he looked uncertainly around and then shuffled down toward the patient rooms excuse me she asked are you looking for somebody bafroom corbeil said mens room do you have a family member here my wife upstairs kicked m ass out fore i could pee corbeil had to keep it short he didnt sound that much like an old black man the nurse bought it all right then just straight down the hall on your right she went back to her paperwork and corbeil shuffled down the hall took the elevator up four floors turned out in the hallway and walked down to the right room the door was shut but not locked he stepped inside hart had said there was only one bed one bed with a man sleeping in the ambient light from the window he could see benson lying on his back one leg suspended in a trapeze a saline drip hooked into his arm corbeil reached into his pocket took out the cigar tube slipped out the needle inside jabbed it into the saline bag and emptied it enough sedative to kill an elephant well he thought looking down at benson he was supposed to be sleeping he couldnt hang around he had a long way to go this night down the elevator out through the emergency room entrance driving back home scrubbing his face with cleanup packs from a barbecue joint in case he met somebody in his apartment stairwell but he met no one he glanced at his watch a long way to go in the bathroom he washed his face and hands scrubbed away the last of the cover mark after drying his hands he got the pistol from the dresserdetoured around the living room on the way out unwilling to look at the wrecked walland headed for harts place hart was expecting him had to talk about the next move hart was worried i dont know if itll hold he said i dont know if benson will hold take it easy corbeil said they were in harts study a converted family room in some ways it aped corbeils study a leather chair but not quite as sleek books but not as many and with a narrow range karate guns camping travel corbeil found it irritating if hes caught he knows that were his only chance giving us away wont help him hell wind up with a public defender instead of the best defense money can buy im not sure hes that smart hart said he dropped into the leather chair brooding corbeil paced in a lazy circle as he passed hart he took the pistol out of his pocket paused and moving unhurriedly so the motion wouldnt catch harts eye put the muzzle next to the other mans temple and pulled the trigger crack hart slumped corbeil waited a moment listeningrealized that if there were anything to hear he probably wouldnt being deafened by the shotthen reached for harts throat pressed his fingers just under his jawbone no pulse he hadnt expected any william hart was thoroughly dead all right now one more shot with harts finger in the trigger the websters should do as a backstop he fired again into the heavy hardback dictionary the little slug penetrated to page and stopped corbeil picked up one of the two ejected shells carefully added one loaded shell to the top of the guns magazine pressed the shell against harts thumb replaced the magazine and dropped the gun on the floor next to the chair he looked at his watch still a long way to go he picked up the dictionary and left he drove through the night to waco his mind crowded with possibilities stay and fight run and hide the simple fact was this if nobody knew about the satellite intercepts none of the killing made sense even if somebody knew it could be blamed on tom woods and then he would kick free the conspiracy never required his involvement he thought woods could have set it up with the other two he had the technical backgroundbackground that corbeil didnt have as of now the danger to himself had narrowed to a single point a car was parked in the driveway at the ranch and there were lights in the main house corbeil parked got out felt the second gun nestled next to his leg took a moment to stand in the driveway to look up at the stars woods came out on the porch hey john whats going on hey tom need to talk about next week ive got an order from azerbaijan jeez those guys corbeil was looking up look at the stars you can really see the stars out here woods walked down the three steps of the porch and stood beside his friend to look at the sky glorious he said then he said something that prolonged his life for a few seconds by the way im not sure about this but there might be something going on out here what do you mean somebody may be messing with the dish controls i dont know where it happenedinside the house or outbut we got an odd signal the other night i just noticed it odd attenuated as if the signal were being blocked somehow not interfered with but physically blocked what would do that tom somebody standing in front of the dish something placed near the amplifier loops that would do it could be nothing could have been a bird building a nest or if it was inside it could have been somebody messing with the gain controls although theyre all right now did you look at the dishes corbeil asked yeah everything looks all right might have been nothing at all probably were all a little jumpy with this firewall thing that shooting that fuckin hart the guys a killer john he probably enjoyed it look at the stars corbeil said glorious woods said again the muzzle of corbeils gun was an inch from the back of his head chapter i spent the next day intermittently monitoring the net watching news programs and checking the newspapers online editions looking for somethinganythingthat would tell me what was going on with ammath firewall or with benson or hart when i wasnt doing that i was playing with the tarot or drawing the landscape north of dallas is interesting in its own southern plains way though not as interesting as the area around tulsa some parts of kansas or the dakota grasslands still interesting the relative flatness of the landscape only sparsely inflected by humans and weather phenomena gives the land and atmosphere a natural abstraction that you dont see in landscape paintings but that you often see in nonobjective art by working with the land and sky without adding human inflection you wind up with something that looks like abstraction but has a kind of organic quality that pulls the eye in under the best conditions the viewer falls into the picture rather than colliding with the painted surface of the abstraction either that or im completely full of shit in any case the first real break came that evening and left me astonished id been clicking around the cable channels with the remote and heard corbeils name mentioned channel the newsreader had more hair than the average werewolf and teeth just as shiny he liked this stuff and this story benson had been found dead in his hospital bed a victim of what police said was a deliberate barbituate overdose hed been murdered benson had been with a man named william hart when he was shot and had given harts name as an alibi for the time that lane ward had been shot after benson had been found dead police went to talk with hart they found him dead in an easy chair a pistol on the floor beside him an apparent suicide the newsreader added that police had interviewed corbeil in the case but that he had not been charged with anything nor was he being held corbeil says that his company ammath a hightech concern that creates topsecret coding software for the federal government has been under attack for several days by the hacker group that calls itself firewall apparently because ammath is one of the lead contractors on the clipper ii chip the clipper ii if you recall is the chip that the government would like to see incorporated as a standard in communications hardware including that used on the internet firewall is the group that has taken credit for the continuing denialofservice attack on the irs corbeil said that he did not understand bensons involvement with lane ward or her brother jack morrison who was slain last month after an alleged breakin at ammaths secure computer facility he said that he had asked hart to monitor bensons activities after the morrison shooting but hadnt known of wards presence m dallas or his security officers shootout with them the newsreader intoned his eyebrows signaling a moderate level of skepticism benson and hart were dead whod done that corbeil himself or were there more security goons in the background somewhere corbeils story was actually pretty good from a legal standpointhe took no position he was confused if it all got mixed in with national security and codes and spies and firewall and if the guy held out he might walk i spent fifteen minutes pacing around the motel then went out found a phone and dropped a message with bobby he batted it away he was no longer interested in ammath or revenge for jack or lane he thought he might have found a way out for those of us still alive need more recordings of ranch transmissions sending man to you with package arrives tonight need transmissions most quickly ok problem we need satellite protocols cant get into ammath computers sealed off can you come memphis wednesday yes good will send address later the idea of going back to corbeils ranch was not appealing especially since id dumped the rifle i still had the pistol that luellen had picked up in lanes room but i had little faith in pistols with the very best of them like a colt acp i could probably ding a guy up at twentyfive yards if neither of us were moving otherwise i might as well be throwing apples still bobby had a plan crack the satellites he said then talk to the government demonstrate that we were not a danger build a case for ourselves maybe at eightthirty that night a guy with one of those uneven southern faces the kind that looked like they got a little crunched in a vise or a wine press or something knocked on my door and when i opened it handed me a box from bobby he said he did not look like the kind of guy whod be hanging with bobby if you were going to cast a movie and needed a guy with hair like straw and pink lips and big freckles to stand with his foot on a pickup trucks running board and talk about the imperial wizards of the ku klux klan this guy would be a candidate how is he bobby i asked same as ever he raised a hand in what used to be a blackpower salute off the pigs he said then he laughed and i laughed with him feeling ridiculous and he headed down the hall in his beatup cowboy boots ragged steppedon back cuffs and jean jacket gone so was i five minutes later headed south in the night third times the charm thats what i kept thinking all the way back to the dish in the gully i took it slow like still hunting for deer i started down the road at eleven oclock deep in the darkness watching listening i didnt make it to the fencecrossing until midnight twelve cars passed along the road as i moved parallel to it hunkered down in the weeds as they passed at midnight i crossed the fence into the eastern pasture and began moving parallel to corbeils fence line at twelvethirty having taken a halfhour to move four hundred yards i crossed corbeils fence and began working my way toward the nearest dish as i got close i spent some time watching the ranch house the yard lights illuminated the area around the house and showed a single pickup truck parked in front of the garage the house itself was absolutely dark the bunkhouse if thats what it was had one lit window a shadow fell on the window once and then went away whoever it was was up late nervous but satisfied that nothing much was happening at the house i crossed carefully into the gully using the needlebeam flashlight now and hooked the detection package into the dish then i climbed the far side of the gully and lay down looking down at the farmhouse while i waited for the dish to start moving at one oclock or a few minutes later the light in the bunkhouse went out and a man stepped into the lighted driveway walked over to the house unlocked the door went inside a light flashed on then twenty seconds later went out the man stepped outside closed the door behind himself rattled itlockedand walked over to the pickup truck he got in and bumped slowly down the driveway to the highway paused turned left and drove away huh for the next three hours i perched on top of the ridge waiting for the dish to move eventually i realized that it wasnt going to lying in the dark with nothing much to do i began to work out my own version of corbeils caper hed built a company that once must have been on the cutting edge of cyberintelligence creating code products that could be used by anyone who needed absolutely secure communication other companies could do the same thing but the ammath people had an advantage their product would be the software component of the clipper ii and they would essentially have a governmentsponsored monopoly on encoded transmissions then just as corbeil stepped on the road to billionairedom the catch jumped up and bit him on the ass outside the intelligence community nobody wanted the clipper the clipper was an obsolete idea when it was floated the first time by the time clipper ii came along even the congress recognized its stupidity so they said the hell with it and instead of the road to billions corbeil found himself in the alley to chapter eleven corbeil had to find something else to sellthis was all part of my fantasyand found it circling the earth every few hours perhaps ammath had developed the code that the national reconnaissance office used for its satellite transmissions however they did it ammath was pulling down the recon stuff and retailing it jack morrison had been killed for knowing about it and his sister was murdered because they thought she might know about it and firewall had been invented to cover it up or at least to confuse any trail that might lead to it could it be some sort of official dark operation i doubted it there are plenty of people working around the us intelligence community who would be willing to kill if ordered toid known some of thembut the fact is nobody will give the order american intelligence in my experience doesnt kill people so corbeil was almost certainly out in the dark by himself and if he was then it was impossible that many people knew about it not more than three or four id bet the danger of what they were doing and the penalties were just too great to let too many people in on the secret at four oclock in the morning the dish hadnt moved bobby wouldnt have sent me back unless he really needed the information from the transmissions and down below the house that probably acted as the control center for the dish array was sitting dark and apparently empty luellen would have given me a ton of shit for even thinking about it but a few minutes after four oclock in the morning i began scouting the house first i stripped the recording package off the dish and stuffed it in the backpack then using the needlebeam i changed batteries in the nightvision glasses and checked to make sure they were still working i followed the gully as far to the north as i could duckwalking the last fifty yards staying below the horizon so i wouldnt be seen from the house i listened and for a while worried and then working from the northeast corner of the house i began closing in watched the windows for movement for light for anything stopped often and long to listen but heard nothing but my heart and the occasional passing car at five oclock i was fifty yards from the house and facing the decision go in or stay put we needed any docs that might be inside we needed anything we could find nothing moved nothing even breathed i crossed the last fifty yards quickly now i was so close with enough ambient light from the yard lights that if anyone were looking right at me theyd see me even without nightvision glasses the base of the house was landscaped with a variety of broadleafed cactusspanish bayonet i thought so named for good reasonand i pushed through them with care overhead a balcony too far overhead but the house was a log cabin and i could put one foot on a window frame then step up two feet or more on a log and then doing a quick stepup catch the edge of the balcony and it went like that i made the step i did the pull up and boosted myself over the edge of the balcony there were four rustic chairs on the balcony and a sliding glass door that led into the house i waited listened tried to feel vibration but felt nothing got the flash out of the backpack and looked at the door as far as i could see it wasnt alarmed but i would have to assume that the house was so inside five minutes max if the call went out instantly it would be purely bad luck to have security arrive in five minutes unless there was another man in the bunkhouse i sat thinking about it i looked through the window with the needlebeam again took a deep breath used the butt of the flashlight to crush the glass near the door handle flipped the lock and went in there was no time i turned on the needle flash and followed it through the top floor bedroom bathroom bedroom bathroom bedroom moving as quickly and quietly as i could i suspected an intrusion alarm was already dialing out with three bedrooms and two bathrooms already down i almost didnt push the fourth door but i did and behind the fourth door i found the control room such as it was a computer what looked like a ham radio setupis there still such a thing as ham radioand a couple of notebooks all stuffed into a windowless cubicle that was more like a closet than a room i turned the computer on looked at my watch almost a minute gone since i entered i would be out in five the computer was a standard ibmcompatible running the last generation windows but it was probably running nothing more complicated than a timeofday and switch program which would orient the receivers and turn them on and off so windows was a logical program what drove me crazy was the time it took to load as i shifted from foot to foot waiting i pulled the notebooks off the shelf and flipped them open they were empty well not emptythey were filled with blank paper oh shit id been suckered pulled into a small room with exactly one exit forget the computer move i stuck the flashlight in my jacket pocket and pulled the revolver the hallway was still dark and i went into it hard and low on my knees and elbows the pistol in one hand already pointed down the hall i saw movement and then the overwhelming boneshaking blast and brilliant muzzle flash of a fully automatic weapon a long burst burned past two feet overhead i was in an ocean of noise and light without being much aware of it aware only that i wasnt yet dead i fired once lurched forward to the bedroom door and rolled through it a halfsecond later another burst chewed up the carpet where id just been i did a quick peek then stuck my head around the corner and fired again bedroom i looked around panicked i didnt have a chance against the automatic weapon if it came to a straight shootout the bedroom had a glass door and a short balcony but if i went over the side id have to run across fifty yards of lighted baldasapooltable lawn before there was any cover id be cut in half before i made ten of them what to do who was that out there had to be corbeil corbeil why are you killing us who the fuck are you were just some guys trying to stay away from the feds i shouted back why are you killing us he said nothing for a moment then because i like it im gonna cut you to pieces dickhead no way for a ceo to talk but he was right about one thing if i moved hed cut me to pieces i did an inventory i had the flashlight the revolver the night glasses luellens usual breakin kit ten seconds later i had the quilt off the bed behind me a fat one a nice traditional quilt filled with cotton batting i balled it up watching the door snapped luellens lighter under the blanket and got it burning when the fire was going hard i threw it over across the hallway and over the railing onto the main floor what the fuck are you doing corbeil screamed what are you doing you burned jacks house down i shouted back i pulled the pack back on you burned it down so suck on this another row of gunfire and the edge of the door splintered i risked a quick peek the instant it stopped and sawfeltanother movement on the stairs going down had to risk it crossed to the railing in the near dark saw the blanket burning on a couch below and in the glow of the small fire movement i took a quick unsteady shot and missed corbeil turned and fired a burst along the railing but by that time i was further up the hall crawling toward the bedroom where i came in at the stairs i paused corbeil was screaming something unintelligible and then a cloud exploded across the room below hed gotten a fire extinguisher from somewhere co and i fired another shot at what seemed to be the source of the cloud he screamed again and the cloud suddenly went sideways had i hit him i moved fast and low as i could scrambling and nearly lost the gun he opened fire again this time shooting at the railing further along the balcony but not as far as i had gotten the light was growing the couch was now fully on fire run or wait i could run fifty yards in maybe six or seven seconds dressed as i was and carrying the pack but now caught in the breakin without a chance to clean up behind myself i really wouldnt mind seeing more of a fire so i waited corbeil whether he was hit or not was soon back with another extinguisher this one firing some kind of spray but the couch was burning too hard the fire now running along what looked like a big oriental carpet under a grand piano he began shouting again but i was concentrating on the gun i had no wish to lose any shells but i couldnt for the life of me remember how many times id pulled the trigger four five was it empty i flipped the cylinder out pulled the flashlight out of my jacket looked at the primers four of them had firingpin dents two shots left i clicked the cylinder back into place so a shell would come under the hammer with the next trigger pull move or wait the fire was growing and corbeil had shouted something unintelligible again i shouted back satellites one loud word one word to get him thinking about what i was saying get him looking up at the balcony i was out the window over the edge and running waiting for the impact at my back across the lighted lawn running running thirty more steps twenty five and down on the ground laying still then up and moving again fast running hard for fifty yards dropping to the ground again listening i could hear corbeil still in the house screaming and i could see firelight in all the windows now a minute later corbeil ran out into the yard running as i had but at an opposite angle he dropped to the ground and i realized that from his angle he could see most of the lighted yard around the housethat the only part that he couldnt see was the driveway he must have thought that i was still inside but if the fire was building he knew id have to run for it and i probably wouldnt run down the driveway he waited patiently as the fire spread through his log palace and began eating it alive moving as slowly as i could i shrugged off the pack and got out the night glasses the yard lights were still burning and the fire glowed from the windows of the house i turned down the gain on the glasses and looked toward the last place id seen corbeil he was still there looking toward the house then away then back toward the house i studied him for another minute then flattened into the ground cover he had night glasses just like mine and was scanning the fields around him i didnt dare move except snakelike pushing backward on my belly watching him every time his face turned toward me i flattened frozen in place i would wait fifteen seconds then look each time i expected a quick slap on the forehead and the final darkness i made progress at the beginning we were fifty yards apart ten minutes later i had another fifty i was there a hundred yards out studying corbeils position with the glasses when a car swerved off the highway drove up the driveway and a man got out and ran up to the front door of the house and began pounding on it shouting then he ran back to his car took what must have been a cell phone from the front seat and staring up at the house made a call two or three minutes later i heard the sirens and far down the road the flashing lights of the first fire trucks the man who called them was running around the house looking in the windows i could see corbeil watching him with the glasses and i backed further away when i was two hundred yards out i stopped to watch the fire the house was now fully involved flames leaping from the rooftop one of the fire trucks sprayed foam on the bunkhouse and garage they didnt bother with the house they had no good water source and the house was burning so hard it probably wouldnt have helped if they did have water the best they could hope for was to keep the flames from spreading to the outbuildings i switched back to corbeil he was standing now just outside the circle of light cast by the flames he was turning his hands to his face scanning the fields and i thought how odd hed been questioned about a murder he mustve worried that the copsor the fbi if wed made any impression with the nsawere going to break down his door at any moment anything in his apartment would be up for grabs it stood to reason that hed move anything incriminating out of his apartment out of his office out of any place that the police or the feds could get at by looking at records like safe deposit boxes he couldnt actually destroy it the docs and software used for controlling a satellite system would not be something you commit to memory my eyes drifted back to the burning house id gone in because the last guy who left took the only vehicle there were no other cars visible it seemed unlikely that corbeil would take the chance of being stranded on foot so he probably had a car somewhere like in the garage i looked back at him still scanning i was due east of the garage if i moved out and around to the south i could come up behind it as long as i could see him i started moving chapter fifteen minutes later id crawled and pulled myself through the ground cover to a spot fifty feet behind the garage in the deep shadow cast by the fire for the moment i was safe but you win a little and you lose a little halfway through the crawl i lost corbeil hed been looking up the hill toward the satellite dish in the gully when id last checked i checked again from the shadow and he was gone had he seen me but if hed seen me crawling why couldnt i see him stalking me he couldnt have seen me using the night glasses so he wouldnt have known that he needed concealment if he were walking anywhere up to four or five hundred yards or so i should have been able to see him unless hed moved opposite of the fire when i turned so that my line of sight crossed too close to the fire the glasses whited out but if he were on the opposite side of the house i was good for a few minutes anyway staying in the shadow cast by the fire i edged closer to the garage fifteen feet out i had to commit i took one last look around stood up and trotted to a back window and looked in a car squatted inside i punched the glass out with the butt of the pistol unlocked the window lifted it and crawled through into the utter darkness inside waited listened corbeil couldnt be inside i thought id have seen him coming if i moved quickly id be okay went to the car mercedesbenz s looked in the front seat with the needlebeam flash saw nothing and in the backseat behind the passenger seat a briefcase the car doors were looked i looked around the garage which also served to hold yard gear and found an axe i was going to make some noise here a car this expensive had an alarm for sure i put the flashlight back in the pack put the gun in my pants pocket where i could feel it if it began to slip outid seen one too many of those tv shows where the good guy loses his gun at a critical momenttook a breath and swung the ax it went through the window like a spoon through whipped cream the alarm went and i used the ax handle to smash the rest of the glass out grabbed the briefcase and went out the window nothing subtle about this i ran as hard as i could fifty yards a hundred out of the deepest shadow out into the dark and then flat on the ground listening the garage was suddenly full of firelight somebody on the fire side had gone into the garage and pushed the door up i took the moment to run another fifty yards and dropped a human head appeared in the garage window silhouetted by the firelight another head appeared in a moment then a third looking out the window toward me dressed as i was i was almost certainly invisible but the car alarm was going and corbeil wherever he was would be hunting me in the dark i scanned the hillside saw nothing thought about it for a moment corbeil was between me and my car i might be able to slip around himthat would certainly be the most direct routebut if i headed south instead crossed the highway and stayed to the roadside ditch or on the other side of the fence on the far side of the highway i could make a circle away from him and get back to the car if i could only see him but sooner or later it would occur to the cops who were with the firemen that anyone who broke into the garage would have to be somewhere in these surrounding fields if they started crawling through the fields in their squads with searchlights id be cooked i started crawling toward the highway moving slowly stopping to scan then moving on at the fence line along the highway i paused scanning and saw him coming he was jogging straight down toward me carrying a gun across his chest he stopped and scanned for me he was too far away for a quick shot so i crawled to a fence post tossed the briefcase over stood up put my hand on the post and vaulted over into the ditch in the ditch i recovered the briefcase after a moment of panicit wasnt exactly where i thought id thrown itpivoted turned looked up the hill he was coming running as hard as he could i went left running hard for five seconds paused scanned saw him still coming put a hand on another fence post and vaulted back over and got the glasses out again scanning he ran to the fence stopped scanned waited he knew i was on the other side when he hadnt seen me in fifteen seconds he stood up and clambered over the fence knelt and scanned up and down the ditch then he went left as i had passed me not fifteen feet away he was moving slowly but not as slowly as he should have and a hundred feet down the highway suddenly crossed the twolane strip of blacktop into the opposite ditch i started moving away crawling again dragging the briefcase trying to keep track of him when he got far enough down the highway and i got far enough up the hill i was covered by a line of brush i turned and started jogging up the hill breathing hard running through the tall clinging pasturage whatever it was was tough i reached the ridge without knowing it really and dropped i mustve been silhouetted against the sky for anyone using glasses but now i was so far ahead of him i stopped and looked back the house fire had passed its peak but the house was still burning fiercely there were now forty or fifty people gathered around the place firemen cops and probably neighbors i sat catching my breath for a moment or two then started back toward the car taking it slow now stopping to listen and scan i crossed his eastern fence line into his neighbors pasture then moved slowly down the fence to the north road once on the gravel i could jog back to the car in a hurry at the fence i threw the briefcase over then stepped to the left and knelt scanning back up the hill caught a spark of light straight up the hill maybe a hundred yards away and then the fence post faltered and a split second later the sound of a shot banged down the hill i rolled left and kept rolling into a little depression and froze he was out there and hed seen me but he didnt have an exact fix he probably couldnt fire accurately and scan at the same time he couldnt afford a whole burst of gunfire i thought one or two shots probably wouldnt be a problem but a burst of fullauto would be a definite cop magnet if they knew where the gunfire was coming from there were a couple of hills between us and the house with all the racket of the fire and the fire equipment the sound of gunfire might not be all that easy to pick out not a single shot anyway when the first shot was not repeated i slowly a quarterinch at a time lifted my head with the glasses to my eyes corbeil was fifty yards away standing in the dark looking through his glasses then he took them away from his face and groped forward and i eased further left when he stopped again to scan i ducked but still watched him he scanned for a moment then moved forward again in what to him must have seemed like absolute silence when he was twenty yards out he stopped looked through his glasses i reached back got a good grip on the fence and when he was looking to my right about where the fence post should have been i gave it a hard tug he dropped the glasses and the gun came up and then he said speaking softly if you give yourself up ill just take you in theres no point in dying like brer rabbit i said nothing but just laid low i can see in the dark he said ive got starlights and theres plenty of light im looking right at you like brer rabbit he moved forward still scanning i was pressed against the fence with no way to make a major move he had the glasses in one hand and the rifle in the other the rifle had a pistol grip like an ak the barrel tracked along the fence then back then my way had he seen me the muzzle tracked past me then swung back i flinched i can see you he said confidently lift up your hands if you dont im gonna have to shoot you i cant get any closer without giving you a chance with that pistol of yours cmon man i dont want to hurt you then he did see me i dont know what it wasmaybe i rolled my foot or he caught a starlight reflection off the glasses whatever he dropped his glasses and the muzzle snapped round and was aimed right at my head i hadnt wanted to shoot him he was twenty feet away and i was rolling the muzzle of my pistol aimed more or less at the extradark piece of sky that was corbeil and his rifle popped and in the muzzle flash i saw him pointed the pistol and click the click was inaudible but i knew nothing had happened i could now see corbeil only as a blinding afterimage that moved when my eyes moved i pointed the gun at where i thought he might be and pulled the trigger again this time it bucked in my hand i heard a grunt saw him in the muzzle flash the barrel of his rifle pointed more or less at my head fired again and rolled and that was it i had no more shells i didnt need any the next sound from corbeil was a rapid thrashing followed by a low everlasting moan as the breath flowed out of his now dead body chapter memphis is a crappy place to spend november the sky gets cloudy and stays that way and the days get cold but instead of really cold the kind of cold you can enjoy the kind of cold that spreads snow over the landscape memphis gets that english bonechilling wet cold instead of snow theres icy drizzle you go around with your shoulders hunched and your hands in your pockets feeling like youre being pissed on six of us were living in three different motels around town wed sleep half the day and work most of the night rotating any necessary meetings among the three motels bobby attended by conference line and in the last three weeks of november with a break for thanksgiving when two of the guys had to go home we got the software package together we also hacked out the implications of what we were doing that in most ways was the hardest part three of the guys wanted to write the software and turn it over to the nsa as an example of what could be done the rest of us wanted to go ahead and do it bobby and i were the hardest of the hardliners wed had experience with these government assholes if we dont break it off in them theyre gonna break it off in us bobby said in fact theyre doing it right now and they were there was something of a reign of terror running through the hack community with the bullyboys from the fbi kicking down doors and seizing equipment evidence of wrongdoing no longer seemed to matter if you were an independent computer hack operating above a certain level you were a target the general line seemed to be the same one that the government used against gun owners with whom i began to sympathize for the first time the argument ran like this nobody needs these big powerful computers unless he or she intends to do something wrong sure stockbrokers accountants and suits from microsoft and sun might have some reason to own them but a kid from wyoming that kid has no reason to own anything more powerful than a gameboy powerful computers are primafacie evidence that theyre doing something wrong and unamerican it was only a matter of time before we had mothers against computer hackers marching in washington to make sure we wouldnt be rolling any software while were not drinking smoking eating cheeseburgers getting high shooting guns or having unprotected sex of the five other guys in memphis i knew two dick enroy from lansing michigan and larry cole from raleigh north carolina and had vaguely heard of the other three bobby said they were all good guys and enroy and cole were so i took his word for it on the others nobody asked exactly what anybody else was doing in their computer lives but everybody wrote good code a guy named chick from columbus ohio wrote a piece of switching code that was so tight and cool and elegant that i was almost embarrassed for the stuff i was writing as it happened corbeils briefcase contained mostly financial papers he had money stashed all over the place one nonfinancial item was a simple m megabyte floppy that he carried around in a fluorescent blue zipdisk case the disk explained the whole oms code thing oms did stand for old man of the sea the sinbad story the oms code was a piece of code that sat on top of a highly intricate encryption engine inside the computers running each of the national reconnaissance offices array of keyhole satellites the oms code sat on the satellite controls just like the old man of the sea sat on sinbads back whenever they needed to corbeils group could go into a satellite order a photo scan get it transmitted to their ground station and then erase any sign of what had been done even the satellites internal photoshot counter had been reset the problem from our point of view was that if the nro found out about the oms code they could block it the nro still controlled the satellites and could send up software patches and workarounds that would effectively take the oms out of it the code we were writing would prevent that the code that we were writing would give us the control of the satellites in the arguments about whether we should write the code and give it to the nsa as a demonstration or actually take control of the satellites one of the guys i didnt know who said his name was loomis said that we were about to become the old man of the sea from the way sinbad looked at it he couldnt get the old man of the sea off his back from the old man of the seas point of view he couldnt get off sinbads back or sinbad would kill him if we get on the nros back or the nsas we can never let go or they will hunt us down like rats if they just say fuck it and put up a new keyhole system and were locked out of it were cooked but theres a time element bobby said his voice rattling down the phone connection and then out a couple of cheap computer speakers if we can keep the government off for three four five years itll be too late to really do anything about us the control of the world is slipping away from those people in five years itll be gone still theres another thing well let it be known that this whole thing was pulled off by bobby the phamous phone phreak ive got maybe five years left on earth ill be on a voice synthesizer by this time next year if im their target and they catch me two or three years from now they aint gonna catch much goddamn i said thats harsh life sucks and then you die bobby said we took control on december third bobby transmitted the changes over a fourhour period from a dish normally used for satellite telephone communications the way it worked essentially was this we took the nros spot giving us control of the system the nro got the oms controls plus some enhancements we addedthis would not be a secret for very long so we didnt have to go to all of ammaths trouble to hide what wed done if we hadnt told them about it the nro might have taken a while to discover what wed done they still talked to the satellites with the same encrypted commands they could still take pictures and maneuver the satellites in fact before we told them about it the only change that would have given us away was a difference in the number of computer bytes in the satellites memory but that changes often enough that we expected that they wouldnt notice not right away on december third and fourth we ran checks and tried to find ways to break our control we made a couple of small patches and the other five guys headed home i went to washington rosalind welsh the nsa security executive left her home at sixthirty in the morning driving a metallic blue toyota camry i noted the license plate bobbyd gotten the number the day before from the dmv but he we wanted to make sure i couldnt follow her all the way to the nsa building but wed done a time projection and i called bobby on a cell phone and said shes crossing the line now four or five minutes to the parking lot did you get the plate yeah your numbers were right are you nervous yeah so youve still got your sanity he chuckled one way or another this is gonna be interesting the next day i was in eastern ohio on my way home i pulled into a truck stop on i got out the cell phone and called rosalind welsh at her desk her secretary answered and i said this is bill clinton youve got fifteen seconds to put welsh on the phone this may be the most important call shell get this year so id suggest you find her welsh came on five seconds later what i need a phone number where i can dump a computer file why should dont argue with me youll want to see these photos give me a number or im gone she gave me the number i called bobby from a truckstop phone gave him the number and headed back east i didnt doubt that the nsa could spot the cell that my call had gone through and would be able to spot the next one from that they would be able to tell that i was headed east i called again twenty minutes later this is bill clinton i told the secretary just a minute welsh picked up but the phone sounded funny what are you doing with the phone i asked weve got some people here who want to listen in she said youre on a conference call did you look at the pictures yes do you know what they are well we have an idea they look like our parking lot they are if you check the arrangement of carsthats your car up in the northeast and thats you getting out of ityoull find out that the pictures were taken yesterday with a keyhole satellite thats what ammath was doing theyd written a code sequencewhich you approved by the waythat sat on top of the satellite encryption engine and allowed them to use the satellites theyve been retailing satellite recon photos all over the middle east and south asia since the keyholes went up from what weve figured out they were supplying recon for both india and pakistan who have you told about this a mans voice deep harsh angry nobody i said but weve got a pr package ready to go to a dozen congressmen and senators as well at the new york times the washington post the la times the dallas morning news the chicago tribune and a few other places you wouldnt want to see it i mean maybe were going to do that maybe if you dont get off our backs you fuckin fascists are running innocent people all over the place this socalled firewall crackdown ammath invented firewall and the irs attack was just a bunch of punks from europe you know it we know it and most of the press knows it but theyre riding along with you for the amusement value we want you to knock it off or well ship our pr package and the nsa becomes a greasy spot on the road a few of you i wouldnt doubt will be looking at the inside of leavenworth we know who you are were tracking you right now were breaking down the walls the male voice said bullshit youve only found a couple of serious people so far and you only got them because they got careless i said the rest of us are going to fuck you up if you dont back off youre talking to the us government here asshole no im not im talking to a scared bureaucrat but not as scared as you will be when we start sending recon photos to the press youre gone you no longer have any access to the keyholes sorry pal it doesnt work that way i said we own keyhole the only access you have is entirely walled off by our software we built a firewall around your access port go ask your guys who are trying to get inside go ask them they can take picturesif we let them they can even retask the satellites if we let them but if we get pissed well eliminate your access and then were gonna start taking pictures of nude beaches and the royal families and the presidents vacation and start flogging them off to the star and people and whoever else wants them with a nice little keyhole credit line on them there was a long silence then rosalind welsh said dont do that its up to you i said youll be able to tell when were pissed because well cut off your keyhole access i mean you could go ask congress for another twenty billion to put up another keyhole system but i suspect that theyll be pretty pissed when they find out you lost the one you had the male voice you fucker you fuckin traitor this is bill clinton youre talking to i said we dont want to overthrow anything we just want you off our backs we cant promise anything in detail welsh said tentatively look were not bargaining with you i said dont get that idea this is a straightforward extortion if you get off our backs you can run keyhole like you always have nobodyll ever hear about how ammath was selling american recon photos to pakistan or how ammath invented firewall to cover up a couple of murders and that you knew about it or about how keyhole now belongs to a bunch of hackers all you have to do is stop if you dont well you better grab on to something solid and bend over because something ugly is about to happen i hung up got off at the next exit wiped the cell phone and threw it into a ditch and headed back to st paul and they quit the irs announced that interpol in coordination with us authorities had issued warrants for the arrest of a halfdozen european hackers for their attack on the taxreturn site and said that the irs site was now fully protected the fbi declared victory over firewall said that we were seeing the fine results of eternal vigilance other hacker organizations the fbi spokesman said had better take warning and not mess with the bulldog of federal law enforcement i was lying on the couch reading the st paul paper the cat sitting next to my head when somebody knocked at the door i opened it and luellen was standing there she was wearing jeans and cowboy boots under a waistlength coat that looked suspiciously like mink we cool she asked we cool i said come in she came in and we had a cup of coffee sitting at my kitchen window looking out over the mississippi the river was locked in ice and down on the streets we could see people in heavy parkas puffing up and down the hill twelve below zero the weather service said a splendid day to stay inside and paint we had a lot to talk about about the relative quality of our safety about jack and lane about whether the government might come creeping around about the collapse of ammath and the disappearance of corbeil the governments out of it i said at least for a good long while i told her how the net would occasionally be saturated with the cryptic message bobby call your uncle does he i dont know i leave that to him i said you think hes going to die thats what he says but not for a while we were silent for a moment then she said the devil cardit was like the tarot said in hindsight i suppose dont be skeptical with me kidd youre getting messages from somewhere and i think maybe you oughta stop it right messages i said she was so serious about it i had to laugh superstitious claptrap the texas newspapers reported that a man carrying corbeils passport had crossed into mexico shortly after his waco ranch house burned downa ranch purchased under a phony name the papers said and which was now cordoned off by the fbi corbeil hadnt been found yet but there were hints that he might be in southeast asia luellen was worried that he might somehow come back on us not to worry i said she didnt ask luellen stayed over clancy the computer lady who had been designing the americas cup boat had found somebody else to design it with and my feet had in fact been cold all winter so luellen was welcome but as i lay beside her that night awake listening to her easy breathing i felt the finger of darkness pressing on me again it had come any number of times in the past two months usually just before sleep the ghost of st john corbeil i was the only one whod ever know but the passport that crossed into mexico was the same one that green lane luellen and i had passed around a diner table after the raid on corbeils apartment the man whod carried it was a friend of bobbys reliable and who for a price was willing to check the passport through mexican passport control without asking why hed burned it in a bathroom of the california royal motel in matamoros and that is the last i hope that wed hear of st john corbeil corbeil himself was buried under a foot of sandy texas soil in a hastily scratchedout grave a few miles northwest of waco texas at night lying in bed i sometimes felt his loneliness out there maybe i thought as i turned over and touched the womans back luellen could make him go away maybe
