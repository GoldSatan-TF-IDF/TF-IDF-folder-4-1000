chapter one death came in dreams she was a child who was not a child facing a ghost who no matter how often his blood bathed her hands would not die the room was cold as a grave hazed by the red light that blinked on and off on and off against the dirty window glass the light spilled over the floor over the blood over his body over her as she huddled in the corner with the knife covered with gore to the hilt still in her hand pain was everywhere radiating through her in stupefying waves that had no beginning or end but circled endlessly circled into every cell the bone in her arm hed snapped the cheek where hed backhanded her so carelessly the center of her that had torn again during the rape she was smothered by the pain coated with shock and washed with his blood she was eight she could see her own breath as she panted little ghosts that told her she was alive she could taste the blood inside her mouth a bright and terrible flavor and smell just under the ripeness of fresh death the stink of whiskey she was alive and he was not she was alive and he was not again and again she chanted those words in her head and her mind tried to make sense of them she was alive he was not and his eyes open and staring fixed on her smiled you cant get rid of me so easy little girl her breath came faster in hitching gasps that wanted to gather into a scream that wanted to burst out of her throat but all that came was a whimper made a mess of things havent you just cant do what youre told his voice was so pleasant bright with that grinning humor she knew was the most dangerous of all while he laughed blood poured out of the holes shed hacked into him whats the matter little girl cat got your tongue im alive and youre not im alive and youre not think so he wiggled his fingers a kind of teasing wave that made her moan in terror as wet red drops flicked from the tips im sorry i didnt mean it dont hurt me again you hurt me why do you have to hurt me because youre stupid because you dont listen because and heres the real secret i can i can do what i want with you and nobody gives a stinking rats ass youre nothing youre nobody and dont you forget it you little bitch she began to cry now thin cold tears that tracked through the mask of blood over her face go away just go away and leave me alone im not going to do that im never going to do that to her horror he pushed himself to his knees crouched there like some nightmarish toad bloody and grinning watching her i got a lot invested in you time and money who putsa fucking roof over your head who puts food in your belly who takes you traveling all over this great country of ours most kids your age havent seen shit but you have but do you learn no you dont do you pull your weight no you dont but youre gonna you remember what i told you youre gonna start earning your keep he got to his feet a big man with his hands slowly balling into fists at his side but now daddy has to punish you he took a shambling step toward her youve been a bad girl and another a very bad girl her own screams woke her she was drenched in sweat shuddering with cold she fought for breath wildly struggled to tear away the ropes of sheets that had wrapped around her as shed thrashed through the nightmare sometimes hed tied her up remembering that she made small animal sounds in her throat as she tore at the sheets freed she rolled off the bed crouched beside it in the dark like a woman prepared to flee or fight lights on full god oh god they flashed on chasing even a hint of shadow out of the huge beautiful room still she scanned it every corner looking for ghosts as the nasty edge of the dream jabbed through her gut she forced back the tears they were useless and they were weak just as it was useless it was weak to let herself be frightened by dreams by ghosts but she continued to shake as she crawled up to sit on the edge of the big bed an empty bed because roarke was in ireland and her experiment of trying to sleep in it without him without dreams had been a crashing failure did that make her pitiful she wondered stupid or just married when the fat cat galahad bumped his big head against her arm she gathered him up she sat lieutenant eve dallas eleven years a cop and comforted herself with the cat as a child might a teddy bear nausea coated her stomach and she continued to rock to pray she wouldnt be sick and add one more misery to the night time display she ordered and the dial of the bedside clock blinked on onefifteen she noted perfect shed barely made it an hour before shed screamed herself awake she set the cat aside got to her feet as carefully as an old woman she stepped down from the platform crossed the room and walked into the bathroom she ran the water cold as cold as she could stand then sluiced it onto her face while galahad wound himself like a plump ribbon between her legs while he purred into the silence she lifted her head examined her face in the mirror it was nearly as colorless as the water that dripped from it her eyes were dark looked bruised looked exhausted her hair was a matted brown cap and her facial bones seemed too sharp too close to the surface her mouth was too big her nose ordinary what the hell did roarke see when he looked at her she wondered she could call him now it was after six in the morning in ireland and he was an early riser even if he were still asleep it wouldnt matter she could pick up the link and call and his face would slide onscreen and hed see the nightmare in her eyes what good would that do either of them when a man owned the majority of the known universe he had to be able to travel on business without being hounded by his wife in this case it was more than business that kept him away he was attending a memorial to a dead friend and didnt need more stress and worry heaped on him from her end she knew though theyd never really discussed it that hed cut his overnight trips down to the bone the nightmares rarely came so violently when he was in bed beside her shed never had one like this one where her father had spoken to her after shed killed him said things to her she thought was nearly sure hed said to her when hed been alive eve imagined dr mira nypsds star psychologist and profiler would have a field day with the meanings and symbolism and christall that wouldnt do any good either she decided so shed just keep this little gem to herself shed take a shower grab the cat and go upstairs to her office she and galahad would stretch out in her sleep chair and conk out for the rest of the night the dream would have faded away by morning you remember what i told you she couldnt eve thought as she stepped into the shower and ordered all jets on full at a hundred and one degrees she couldnt remember and she didnt want to she was steadier when she stepped out of the shower and however pathetic it was dragged on one of roarkes shirts for comfort shed just scooped up the cat when the bedside link beeped roarke she thought and her spirits lifted considerably she rubbed her cheek against galahads head as she answered dallas dispatch dallas lieutenant eve o o death didnt only come in dreams eve stood over it now in the balmy early morning air of a tuesday in june the new york city sidewalk was cordoned off the sensors and blocks squaring around the pavement and the cheerful tubs of petunias used to spruce up the buildings entrance she had a particular fondness for petunias but she didnt think they were going to do the job this time and not for some time to come the woman was facedown on the sidewalk from the angle of the body the splatter and pools of blood there wasnt going to be a lot of that face left eve looked up at the dignified gray tower with its semicircle balconies its silver ribbon of people glides until they identified the body theyd have a hard time pinning down the area from which shed fallen or jumped or been pushed the one thing eve was sure of it had been a very long drop get her prints and run them she ordered she glanced down at her aide as peabody squatted opened a field kit peabodys uniform cap sat squarely on her rulerstraight dark hair she had steady hands eve thought and a good eye why dont you do time of death me peabody asked in surprise get me an id establish time of death log in description of scene and body now despite the grisly circumstance it was excitement that moved over peabodys face yes sir sir first officer onscene has a potential witness a witness from up there or down here down here ill take it but eve stayed where she was a moment longer watching peabody scan the dead womans fingerprints though peabodys hands and feet were sealed she made no contact with the body and did the scan quickly delicately after one nod of approval eve strode away to question the uniforms flanking the perimeter it might have been nearly three in the morning but there were bystanders gapers and they had to be encouraged along blocked out news hawks were already in evidence calling out questions trying to snag a few minutes of recording to pump into the airwaves before the first morning commute an ambitious glidecart operator had jumped on the opportunity and was putting in some overtime selling to the crowd his grill pumped out smoke that spewed the scents of soy dogs and rehydrated onions into die air he appeared to be doing brisk business in the gorgeous spring of death continued to draw an audience from the living and those who knew how to make a quick buck out of the deal a cab winged by didnt bother to so much as tap the brakes from somewhere farther downtown a siren screamed eve blocked it out turned to the uniform rumor is weve got eyes yes sir officer youngs got her in the squad car keeping her away from the ghouls good eve scanned the faces behind the barrier in them she saw horror excitement curiosity and a kind of relief im alive and youre not shaking it off she hunted down young and the witness given the neighborhood for in spite of the dignity and the petunias the apartment building was right on the border of midtown bustle and downtown sleaze eve was expecting a licensed companion maybe a jonesing chemihead or a dealer on the way to a mark she certainly hadnt expected the tiny snappily dressed blonde with the pretty and familiar face dr dimatto lieutenant dallas louise dimatto angled her head and the ruby clusters at her ears gleamed like glassy blood do you come in or do i come out eve jerked a thumb held the car door wider come on out theyd met the previous winter at the canal street clinic where louise fought against the tide to heal the homeless and the hopeless she came from money and her bloodline was blue but eve had good reason to know louise didnt quibble about getting her hands dirty shed nearly died helping eve fight an ugly war during that bitter winter eve skimmed a look over louises stoplightred dress making house calls a date some of us try to maintain a healthy social life howd it go i took a cab home so you be the judge she skimmed back her short honeycomb hair with her fingers why are so many men so boring you know thats a question that haunts me day and night when louise laughed eve smiled in response its good to see you all things considered i thought you might drop by the clinic come see the improvements your donation helped implement i think its called blackmail in most circles donation blackmail lets not split hairs youve helped save a few lives dallas thats got to be nearly as satisfying to you as catching those who take them lost one tonight she turned looked back toward the body what do you know about her nothing really i think she lives in the building but shes not looking her best at the moment so i cant be sure after a long breath louise rubbed the back of her neck sorry this is more in your line than mine its my first experience nearly having a body fall in my arms ive seen people die and its not always gentle but this was okay you want to sit back down want some coffee no no let me just tell it she steadied herself a subtle squaring of the shoulders stiffening of the spine i ditched the date from tedium grabbed a cab wed gone to dinner and a club uptown i got here about onethirty i suppose you live in this building thats right tenth floor apartment i paid the cab got out on the curb its a pretty night i was thinking its a beautiful night and i just wasted it on that jerkoff so i stood there for a couple minutes on the sidewalk wondering if i should go in and call it a night or take a walk i decided id go up fix a nightcap and sit out on my balcony i turned took another step toward the doors i dont know why i looked up i didnt hear anything but i just looked up and she was falling with her hair spread out like wings it couldnt have been more than two or three seconds id barely had time to register what i was seeing and she hit you didnt see where she fell from no she was coming down and fast jesus dallas louise had to pause a moment rub the image from her eyes she hit so hard and with a really nasty sound im going to be hearing in my sleep for a long time it couldnt have been more than five or six feet from where i was standing she drew another breath made herself look over at the body now there was pity over the horror people think theyve reached the end of their ropes that theres nothing left for them but theyre wrong theres always more rope theres always something left you think she jumped louise looked back at eve yes i assumed i said i didnt hear anything she didnt make a sound no scream no cry nothing but the flutter of her hair in the wind i guess thats why i looked up she thought now i did hear something after all that flutter like wings what did you do after she hit i checked her pulse kneejerk louise said with a shrug i knew she was dead but i checked anyway then i took out my pocketlink and called nineoneone you think she was pushed thats why youre here i dont think anything yet eve turned back toward the building some lights had been on when shed arrived and there were more now so that it looked like a vertical chessboard in silver and black homicide gets tagged on leapers like this its standard do yourself a favor go in take a pill zone out dont talk to the press if they wheedle your name good advice will you let me know when when you know what happened to her yeah i can do that want a uniform to take you up no thanks she took one last look at the body as bad as my night was it was better than some i hear you best to roarke louise added then walked toward the doors peabody was already standing her palmlink in hand got an id dallas bryna bankhead age twentythree mixed race single residence apartment in the building behind us she worked at saks fifth avenue lingerie i established time of death at ohonefifteen onefifteen eve repeated and thought of the readout on her bedside clock yes sir i ran the measurements twice eve frowned down at the gauges the field kit the bloody pool under the body witness said she fell about onethirty when was the nineeleven logged uneasy now peabody checked her link for the record call came in at ohonethirtysix she heaved out a breath that fluttered her thick straight bangs i mustve screwed up the measurements she began im sorry dont apologize until i tell you youve screwed up eve crouched opened her own field kit took out her own gauges and ran the test a third time personally you established time of death accurately for the record she continued victim identified as bankhead bryna cause of death undetermined time of death ohonefifteen tod verified by peabody officer delia and primary investigator dallas lieutenant eve lets roll her peabody peabody swallowed the questions on her tongue and the quick rise of her own gorge for the moment she blanked her mind but later she would think it had been like rolling over a sack full of broken sticks swimming in thick liquid impact has severely damaged victims face boy peabody breathed through her teeth ill say limbs and torso also suffered severe damage rendering it impossible to determine any possible premortem injury from visual exam the body is nude shes wearing earrings eve took out a small magnifier peered through it at the lobes multicolored stones in gold settings matching ring on right middle finger she eased closer until her lips were nearly on the victims throat and peabodys gorge tried a second rising sir perfume shes wearing perfume you walk around your apartment at one in the morning peabody wearing fancy earrings and fancy perfume if im awake in my apartment at one in the morning im usually in my bunny slippers unless yeah eve straightened unless youve got company eve turned to the crime scene tech bag her i want her tagged for priority with the me i want her checked for recent sexual activity and any injuries that are premortem lets have a look at her apartment peabody shes not a leaper evidence is pointing to the contrary she strode into the lobby it was small and quiet and security cameras swept the area i want the discs from security she told peabody lobby level and twelfth floor to start there was a long pause as they stepped into the elevator and eve called for the twelfth floor then peabody shifted her weight trying for casual so are you going to bring in edd eve stuck her hands in her pockets scowled at the blank brushed metal doors of the elevator peabodys romantic liaison with ian mcnab electronics detective division had recently detonated which if anyone had listened to me eve thought bitterly wouldnt be in many ugly pieces because it never would have existed in the first place suck it in peabody its a reasonable question on procedure and has nothing whatsoever to do with anything else peabodys tone was stiff enough to communicate insult hurt feelings and annoyance she was eve thought good at it if during the course of this investigation i as primary investigator deem edd is needed for consult i will so order you could also request someone other than he who shall not be named peabody muttered feeney runs edd i dont tell feeney which of his people to assign and damn it peabody this case or another youre going to end up working with mcnab which is why you should never have let him bang you in the first place i can work with him it doesnt bother me a bit so saying she stomped off the elevator onto the twelfth floor im a professional unlike some others who are always cracking wise and coming to work in weird getups and showing off at the door of bankheads apartment eve lifted her eyebrows you calling me unprofessional officer no sir i was her stiff shoulders loosened and humor slid back into her eyes id never call your getups weird dallas even though im pretty sure youre wearing a guys shirt if youre finished with your snit well go back on record using master to gain entrance to victims apartment eve continued and coded through the locks she opened the door examined it interior chain and snap bolt were not in use living area lights are on dim what do you smell peabody ah candles maybe perfume what do you see living area nicely decorated and organized the mood screens on looks like a spring meadow pattern there are two wineglasses and an open bottle of red wine on the sofa table indicating the victim had company at some point in the evening okay though shed hoped peabody would take it a little further eve nodded what do you hear music audio systems playing violins and piano i dont recognize the tune not the tune the tone eve said romance take another look around everythings in place neat tidy and as noted organized but she left a bottle of wine sitting open and used glasses sitting out why she didnt have a chance to put them away or turn off the lights the audio the mood screen she stepped through glanced into the adjoining kitchen the counters were clean and empty but for the corkscrew the wine cork who opened the wine peabody the most likely conclusion would be her date if shed opened it she would have giving the indication of the apartment put the corkscrew away dumped the cork in her recycler mmm living area balcony doors closed and secured from inside if this was selftermination or an accidental fall it wasnt from this point lets check the bedroom you dont think it was selftermination or an accident i dont think anything yet what i know is the victim was a single woman who kept a very neat apartment and that evidence indicates she spent at least a portion of this evening at home with company eve turned into the bedroom the audio played here as well dreamy fluid notes that seemed to drift on the breeze fluttering through the open balcony doors the bed was unmade and the disordered sheets were strewn with pink rose petals a black dress black undergarments and black evening shoes were piled beside the bed candles guttering fragrantly in their own wax were set around the room read the scene eve ordered it appears as if the victim engaged in or was about to engage in sexual intercourse prior to her death there are no signs of struggle here or in the living area which indicates the sex or plans for the sex were consensual this wasnt sex peabody this was seduction were going to need to find out who seduced who record the scene then get me those security discs with a sealed finger eve eased open the drawer of the bedside table goodie drawer sir sex drawer peabody single girl provisions which in this case includes condoms victim liked men couple bottles of tasty body oils a vibrator for when selfservicing is necessary or desired and some vaginal lubricant fairly standard even conservative and straight goodies no toys or aids here to indicate victim leaned toward samesex relationships so her date was a man or a woman hoping to broaden bankheads horizons well nail that down with the discs and maybe we get lucky with the mes report and find some little soldiers in her she stepped into the adjoining bath it was sparkling clean the ribbontrimmed hand towels perfectly aligned there were fancy soaps in a fancy dish perfumed creams in glassandsilver jars my guess is her bed partner didnt hang around and wash up get the sweepers up here she ordered lets see if our romeo left anything behind she opened the mirror on the medicine cabinet studied the contents normal overthecounter meds nothing heavy a sixmonth supply of twentyeight day contraceptive pills the drawer beside the sink was packed and meticulously organized with cosmetic enhancers lip dyes lash lengtheners face and body paints bryna had spent a lot of time in front of this mirror eve mused if the little black dress the wine the candlelight were anything to go by shed spent considerable time in front of it tonight preparing herself for a man moving to the bedroom link eve played back the last call and stood listening to bryna bankhead pretty in her little black dress talk of her big plans for the evening with a brunette she called ceecee im a little nervous but mostly im just excited were finally going to meet how do i look you look fabulous bry you just remember reallife datings different from cyberdating take it slow and keep it public tonight right absolutely but i really do feel like i know him ceecee weve got so much in common and weve been emailing for weeks besides it was my idea to meet and his to make it drinks in a public place so id feel more at ease hes so considerate so romantic god im going to be late i hate being late gotta go dont forget i want all the deets ill tell you all about it tomorrow wish me luck ceecee i really think he could be the one yeah eve murmured as she shut off the link so do i chapter two in her office at cop central eve reviewed the security discs of the apartment building on the day of the murder people came people went residents visitors she pegged slinky twin blondes who strolled across the lobby in tandem as licensed companions double your pleasure she thought as she watched one setting up the next job on her pocketlink while the other noted down the split in her daybook bryna bankhead rushed in at sixfortyfive a couple of shopping bags in tow and a pretty flush on her cheeks happy eve thought excited she wants to get upstairs take out her new stuff and play with it groom herself primp change her mind about her outfit a few times maybe fix a quick bite to eat so her stomach wont be too nervous just a typical single woman anticipating a date who doesnt know shell be a statistic before its over she watched louise come in just before seventhirty she moved quickly too but then she always did there was no light of adventure or anticipation on her face eve mused she looked distracted a little tired no shopping bags for dr dimatto eve noted just her medical kit and a handbag as big as idaho a notsotypical single woman eve thought who looks as if shes already decided she isnt going to enjoy the evening ahead of her and who doesnt know shell end it with a body broken at her feet louise was quicker than bryna she was striding out of the elevator slicked into her killer red dress at eightforty polished she didnt look like the dedicated overworked and steely minded crusader she looked sharp sexy female the guy coming in as she was going out obviously agreed he took a good long look at her ass as louise zipped out she either didnt notice or didnt give a damn as she didnt so much as glance back at him a kid of about eighteen swaggered out of the elevator he was dressed in solid black leather tip to toe and carted an air scooter under his arm he swung it down as he shoved open the doors leaped on with an agility and flash eve had to admire and winged off into the night she sipped coffee as she watched bryna exit the building just before nine pm nearly running eve thought risking a turned ankle in her date shoes because she didnt want to be late her hair was styled in a glossy updo like an ebony tower her face a delicate caramel color was flushed with anticipation and nerves she carried a small evening bag and wore the pretty flashing earrings check cab pick ups within a block radius of the building peabody shes in a hurry so unless shes meeting the guy close by shed spring for a cab she frowned as she zipped through time slowing whenever someone came in or out of the building she was a goodlooking woman eve commented seemed reasonably smart had her own place decent job why does someone like that go fishing in the cyberpool for a date easy for you to say peabody muttered and earned a narrowed stare well jeez dallas youre married for the rest of us its a jungle out there full of apes and snakes and baboons you ever do the cyberthing peabody shuffled her feet maybe and i dont want to talk about it amused eve started the scan again i was single a hell of a lot longer than ive been married i never stooped to cyberworld big deal when youre tall and thin with junglecat eyes and have a sexy little dent in your chin you coming onto me peabody my love for you is a fearsome thing dallas but ive given up dating cops good policy ah here they come freeze screen the time read twentythree thirtyeight in two hours plus bryna had obviously gotten very cozy with her cyber date they came in with their arms snugged around each others waists and laughing he looks great peabody decided as she leaned closer to the monitor answer to a maidens prayer kind of thing tall dark and handsome eve grunted she judged the man to be about six one running to about oneninety his dark hair was swept back in a tightly curled mane that spilled over his shoulders his skin was poetically pale and set off by glinting emerald studs at the corner of his mouth and the high point of his right cheekbone his eyes were the same vivid green a thin line of beard ran vertically from just below center of his bottom lip to his chin he wore a dark suit with a shirt in that same jewel green open at the collar he carried a black leather bag from a strap on his shoulder nicelooking couple peabody added she looks like shes knocked back a few alcoholic beverages more than cocktails eve corrected then ordered the computer to zoom in on brynas face shes got a chemical gleam in her eye him she zoomed onto the mans face hes stone sober contact the morgue i want a priority put on her tox screen computer working yeah yeah lets try a little multitasking since at long last she had a new unit she had hope run current image of male onscreen through identification banks i want a name opening identification banks request for citywide state national global eve patted the side of the machine now thats what i like to hear begin with new york city continue disc run normal view working the computer hummed quietly and the image onscreen began to move again outside the elevator the man lifted brynas hand pressed his lips to the palm end run begin run on elevator two twentythree forty the image flashed off the next flashed on eve watched the mating process continue on the ride to the twelfth floor the man nibbled on her fingers leaned in to whisper something in her ear it was bryna who made the advances pulling him against her aggressively pressing her body her lips to his it was her hand that moved between their bodies groping when the doors opened they circled out still locked together once again eve ordered a disc change and studied the couple as they walked to her apartment door bryna fumbled a bit as she uncoded her locks she lost her balance slightly swayed against him when she stepped inside he stood at the threshold the perfect gentleman eve mused he had a warm smile on his face a question in his eyes are you going to ask me in she watched brynas arm shoot out watched her hand fist in the mans jacket she pulled him inside and the door shut behind them she was making the moves peabody frowned at the empty hallway now onscreen yeah she was making the moves i dont mean she deserved to die i just mean he wasnt pushing even when she got aggressive in the elevator he didnt push a lot of guys hell most guys wouldve had a hand under her skirt at that point most guys dont sprinkle rose petals over the sheets she fastforwarded ordered fullstop when brynas apartment door opened note time unidentified male exits victims apartment ohone thirtysix same time the nineelevens logged louise said she checked for a pulse give her a few seconds for shock a few seconds to run to the body then check the pulse then get her pocketlink out and make the call and thats all the time it took him to walk away from the balcony move through the apartment and out the door computer continue run hes shaking peabody murmured yeah and hes sweating but he didnt run eve noted his eyes darted right left right as he hurried down the hall to the elevator but he didnt run she watched him ride down his back pressed to the wall the leather bag clutched against his chest but he was thinking she mused thinking carefully enough to take the elevator to the basement instead of the lobby to exit the building by the delivery port instead of the front doors there was no sign of struggle in the apartment and between time of death and the time she hit no time for him to put it back to rights if there had been a fight but she was dead before she went over before he threw her over eve added shed been using illegals but there were no illegals in her apartment lets put a bug in the labs ear on the contents of the wine bottle and glasses then go home catch some sleep youre going to call feeney you need edd to walk through her computer and find the emails she and the suspect exchanged trace the account thats right eve rose and though she knew it was a mistake ordered one more cup of coffee from her autochef put the personal garbage in the recycler and do the job id appreciate it if youd give mcnab that same order sir eve turned back he hassling you yes not exactly she huffed out a breath no which is it he just makes sure i know about all the hot women hes sleeping with and how hes practically doing handsprings since i cut him loose and he doesnt even have the decency to do it to my face he just makes sure i hear about it it sounds like hes moved on you did cut him loose peabody and youre hanging with charles its not like that with charles peabody insisted speaking of the sexy licensed companion whod become her friend and had never been her lover i told you but you didnt tell mcnab your business eve said quickly when peabody started to speak and i dont want any part of it mcnab wants to screw every female in the five boroughs and it doesnt interfere with the job its none of my business and none of yours leave the priority requests for the morgue and the lab then go home report in at eight hundred hours alone eve sat back at her desk computer status on identification search search eightyeightpointtwo percent complete no matches expand search statewide affirmative working eve sat back with her coffee and hoped for a name hoped for quick justice for bryna bankhead o o despite the caffeine eve managed a more restful sleep on her office floor than she had in the big empty bed at home when she woke she widened the thus far negative identity search taking yet another cup of coffee with her into the locker room she washed up fingercombed her hair and rolled up the sleeves of roarkes shirt it was just after eight when she walked into captain feeneys office in edd he was standing at his own autochef with his back to her like eve he was in his shirtsleeves with his weapon harness in place his wiry gingercolored hair had probably seen a comb that morning but looked no tidier than hers she stepped in sniffed the air whats that smell he whirled around his long basset hound face covered with surprise and she thought guilt nothing whats up she sniffed again doughnuts you got doughnuts in here shut up shut up he stalked by her to shut the door you want the whole squad pouring in here knowing a closed door wouldnt be enough he locked it what do you want i want a doughnut look dallas the wifes gone on some health kick you cant get a decent bite to eat in my house these days with all the tofu this and rehydrated vegetable that a mans gotta have some fat and sugar once in awhile or his system suffers for it im with you sos the crowd gimme a doughnut goddamn it he strode over to the autochef popped it open inside were a half dozen doughnuts fragrant in the low heat holy shit fresh doughnuts bakery down the block does a few dozen reals every morning you know what they charge for one of these bastards quick as a whiplash eve reached in snagged one bit in worth it she said around a mouthful of fat and cream just keep it down you start making yummy noises theyll beat the door in he took a doughnut and blissfully chewed the first bite nobody wants to live forever right i tell the wife hey im a cop cops face death every day damn straight you got jelly too before she could reach in he closed the autochef smartly so being a cop facing death all that who gives a horses ass about pumping a little fat into the arteries really superior fat too she licked sugar off her fingers she couldve blackmailed him into a second doughnut but figured shed just get sick off it got a sidewalk splat last night leaper nope already dead when she went off im waiting for the me and some lab reports but it looks like sexual homicide she had a date with a cyberguy email lovers i got a visual of him going in and out of her place but the id search hasnt hit a match i need you to track him through her computer you got the unit yeah im holding it in evidence victims bankhead bryna casefile hb ill get somebody on it appreciate it she paused at the door feeney if you bring mcnab in maybe you could ask him to i dont know tone it down around peabody the glow the doughnut brought to his face faded into painful embarrassment aw jeez dallas i know i know but if i have to deal with her youve got to deal with him we could lock them in a room together let them hash it out well keep that as an option let me know as soon as you find something on the victims unit o o the search wasnt getting anywhere without much hope eve bumped it up to global she wrote and filed her preliminary report for her commander then shot it off through the interoffice system after ordering peabody to keep pushing on the lab and morgue she headed to the courthouse to give her testimony in a case on trial two and a half hours later she stormed out damning all lawyers she flipped on her communicator and tagged peabody status test results still pending sir fuck that rough day in court dallas defense council seems to think the nypsd splattered the victims blood all over his innocent clients hotel room clothes person just to give psychopathic tourists who stab their wives a couple dozen times during a marital spat a bad name well it is tough on the chamber of commerce haha we have identified the woman bankhead spoke with on the link the night she died ceecee plunkett she worked with the victim in the lingerie department at saks grab transpo meet me there yes sir and may i suggest their lovely sixthfloor cafe for lunch you need protein i had a doughnut with an evil smile eve broke transmission on peabodys shocked and envious gasp being caught in the hell of lunchshift traffic did little to improve her mood cars bumped and churned in place for so long she considered the possibility of just leaving her vehicle where it was and hoofing it across town until she studied the jammed sidewalks even the sky was packed ad blimps airbuses tourist trams vying for air space the noise was ridiculous but for some reason the sheer weight of sound smoothed out the rough edges so much so that when she was trapped at a light at the corner of madison and thirtyninth she leaned out the window and spoke pleasantly to the glidecart operator give me a tube of pepsi small medium or large fair lady her eyebrows lifted disappeared under her fringe of bangs an operator that friendly was either a droid or new make it large she dug in her pocket for loose change when he leaned down to make the exchange she saw he was neither droid nor new she pegged him at a welltended ninety and his smile showed an appreciation of dental hygiene far superior to most glidecarters beautiful day isnt it she looked at the traffic at the knots of vehicles that were all but blocking out the sky in this sector you gotta be kidding he only smiled again every day youre alives a beauty miss she thought of bryna bankhead guess youre right she popped the tube sucked on it contemplatively as she inched her way up madison at fiftyfirst she cut over double parked and engaged her on duty sign and girding her loins strode into saks and the gauntlet of cosmetic shills highfashion droids glided by the doors in a pattern designed to dazzle the eye and make it impossible to break through unscathed backing them up were human consultants who manned booths counters or patrolled the aisle looking in eves opinion for escapees the air was choked with scent a female droid with a starburst of magenta hair slithered across the floor to block eves forward progress good afternoon and welcome to saks today our premiere fragrance one drop goes on me just one and ill ram that spritzer down your throat she warned as the droid moved in for the kill indeed madam it only takes a drop of orgasma to entice the lover of your dreams eve flipped her jacket aside tapped her fingers on her weapon it only takes one blast of this to put you in the recycle bin red now back off the droid backed off with satisfying speed eve heard the call go up for security as she plowed through the wall of customers and consultants she flipped out her badge as a pair of uniformed droids rushed toward her nypsd official business keep those damn smell pushers off me yes lieutenant may we be of some assistance yeah she tucked her badge in her pocket wheres the lingerie department at least eve thought as she got off on the proper floor nobody up here rushed you waving underwear still selling sex seemed to be the order of the day as model droids roamed the department in foundation garments or nightwear human clerks at least wore real clothes she spotted ceecee plunkett immediately and waited until the woman completed bagging up a sale ms plunkett yes may i help you eve took out her badge again is there a place we can speak privately she had rosy cheeks and they went white she had pretty blue eyes and they went wide oh god oh god its bry somethings happened to bryna she didnt come into work she doesnt answer her link shes been hurt is there somewhere we can talk i yes pressing a hand to her temple ceecee looked around the the dressing area but im not supposed to leave my station i hey eve snagged a droid in a sheer black bra and panties take over here which way she asked ceecee and came around the counter to take her arm back here is she in the hospital which hospital ill go see her inside one of the small changing cubes eve closed the door there was a tiny padded stool in the corner and she guided ceecee to it sit down its bad she gripped eves arm its very bad yes im sorry there would never be an easy way there was only the fast way a quick stab to the heart rather than slicing inch by inch bryna bankhead was killed early this morning ceecee shook her head kept shaking it slowly as the first tear trickled down her cheek she had an accident were trying to determine what happened i talked to her i talked to her yesterday last night she was going out on a date please tell me what happened to bry the media had already reported the death and the circumstances so far as they were known if they hadnt ferreted out the name by now eve thought it wouldnt take them much longer she fell from her balcony fell ceecee started to surge to her feet but only sank back down again that cant be that just cant be theres a safety wall were investigating ms plunkett youd help a great deal if youd answer some questions for me on record she wouldnt have fallen there was anger now and insult pricking through the shock she wasnt stupid or clumsy she wouldnt have fallen eve took out her recorder im going to find out what happened my name is dallas lieutenant eve dallas she said for ceecee and the record im primary investigator in the matter of the death of bryna bankhead im interviewing you ceecee plunkett at this time because you were a friend of the deceased you had a conversation with her via link last night a few minutes before nine oclock just before she left her apartment yes yes she called me she was so nervous so excited her voice went thick oh bry why was she nervous and excited she had a date her first date with dante whats his full name i dont know she dug in her jacket pocket for a tissue then tore it to pieces rather than mopping her face they met online they didnt know each others last names thats part of the deal its for safety how long had she been in contact with him maybe three weeks now how did they meet a poetry chat room there was this discussion of great romantic poetry through the centuries and oh god she leaned forward buried her face in her hands she was my best friend how could this happen to her would she confide in you we told each other everything you know how it is with girlfriends more or less eve thought this was to your knowledge her first date with dante yes thats why she was so excited she bought a new dress and shoes and these great earrings and would it be usual for her to bring a first date back to her apartment for sex absolutely not ceecee gave a watery laugh brys got too many oldfashioned hangups about sex and relationships and stages a guy had to pass what she called the thirty day test before shed go to bed with him i used to tell her nothing stays fresh for a month but she ceecee trailed off what are you saying im only trying to get a picture did she do illegals though tears were still glistening in them ceecees eyes went hard i dont like your questions lieutenant they have to be asked look at me look at me eve repeated i dont want to hurt her or you i have to know who she was to do right by her no she didnt do illegals ceecee snapped she took good care of herself inside and out thats the way she was she was smart and she was fun and she was decent and she did not get crazy on illegals and fall off her goddamn balcony she didnt jump either so dont even think about trying to pass this off as suicide if she went off that balcony its because somebody pushed her off its because as her own words sank in ceecees anger flared someone killed her someone killed bry that that dante he he followed her home after their date and he got into her apartment somehow and he killed her he killed her she repeated and dug her fingers into eves wrist you find him ill find him eve promised ceecee i dont know all the facts yet but i will tell me what you can about this man she knew as dante everything you remember bryna told you i cant take it in im sorry i just cant she rose walked slowly to the pitcher of ice water on the dressing room table when the pitcher shook and sloshed eve went over poured the glass thanks take a minute sit down drink your water and take a minute im okay ill be okay but she had to hold the glass with both hands to drink he was supposed to own his own business he was rich she said he didnt brag about it but she could tell from the little things he said places hed been like paris and moscow the olympus resort bimini i dont know what kind of business they didnt get into specifics about that just like he wasnt supposed to know she worked here but he did eves gaze sharpened how do you know that because he sent her pink roses here last week pink roses eve thought pink rose petals what else he spoke italian and um french and spanish romance languages she added smearing tears and mascara with the backs of her hands bry was all caught up in the romance of it she said he had the most romantic soul and id say well great but what about his face shed just laugh and say that appearances didnt matter when hearts spoke to each other but it wouldnt hurt her feelings any if he looked as good as he sounded steadier she turned the glass in her hands lieutenant did he rape her i dont know eve drew out a picture shed printed off disc do you recognize this man ceecee studied dantes face no she said wearily now ive never seen him before this is him isnt it well well i guess he looked as good as he sounded the son of a bitch the vicious son of a bitch she began shredding the photo and eve did nothing to stop her where were they meeting for drinks last night the goddamn rainbow room bry picked it out because she thought it was romantic when eve came out of the dressing area she found peabody staring a bit wistfully at a display of lacy bodysuits those wouldnt be comfortable for more than five minutes eve pointed out if it works you wouldnt have it on over five minutes droid said you were back in the dressing area with plunkett yeah dude goes by the name of dante heavy on the poetry and pink rosebuds ill fill you in where are we going the morgue by way of the rainbow room that sounds so weird it was if you compared the chrome and marble temple of one with the dingy white box of the other but the best eve could get from the landmark lounge was the names and addresses of the waitstaff on duty the night before she had more immediate luck at the dead house ah my favorite cop come to scold me morris chief medical examiner switched off his laser scalpel and beamed he wore his long dark hair in a half dozen braids covered now with a clear surgical cap a natty plumcolored shirt and slacks were protected from distressing splashes of body fluids by a transparent lab coat thats not my case youre slicing up there morris no mores the pity he glanced down at the body of a young black man this unfortunate fellow appears to have backed into numerous times a sharp longbladed instrument youd think hed have stopped after the first but no he just continued to ram himself back into the knife until he keeled over dead slow learner she pursed her lips as she studied the corpses very impressive hardon from the looks of that boner hes carrying id make an educated guess that hed popped some exotica laced with zeus the combo can make a guys tool stay in use long after hes gone flat otherwise i tend to agree particularly since your associate detective baxter reports that our recently deceased was employing that tool enthusiastically on his brothers wife oh yeah and i guess he just decided to stop fucking and dance into a knife as a change of pace according to his brother and the wife who is still among the living and recovering from a nasty fall that broke her jaw takes all kinds if baxters got the brother in custody and youve got cause of death why arent you working on my case come with me morris crooked a finger and walked through a set of swinging doors into another autopsy room what was left of bryna bankhead was the single occupant she was laid on a stainless steel slab with a thin green sheet covering her to the neck that would have been morriss touch eve thought he could be very respectful with the dead i imagine she was an attractive young woman once eve stared down at the ruined face she thought of the bathroom mirror the ruthlessly organized drawer of enhancements yeah tell me how she died morris i think you know your time of death measurement was accurate she was spared the fear of falling the insult of the pavement even the knowledge that she was dying he touched sealed fingertips very gently to her hair shed ingested over a period of two and a half to three hours more than two ounces of the synthetic hormonibitalsix an expensive and very difficult to acquire controlled substance street name whore an inhibition blocker eve murmured commonly used in date rape once upon a time not commonly morris corrected its derivatives are more common and much less potent and effective what she had in her was pure two ounces dallas would have a street value of more than a quarter million if you could find it on the street which you cant i havent come across traces of it in a body for more than fifteen years i heard about it when i was in school mostly urban legend shit and most of it was urban legend shit did it kill her an od not by itself the combination with alcohol was dangerous but not fatal but our hero went overboard half the amount he slipped her wouldve been enough to ensure her full cooperation what she had in her would most likely have kept her under for eight maybe ten hours and shed wake up with the mother of all hangovers headache vomiting the shakes blackouts lost time it would take up to seventytwo hours to purge her system it made eve sick to think it she was spared that too how he gave her too much it would make her lethargic im assuming he wanted a more active fuck because he doctored the last glass of wine with a little cocktail of aneminiphinecolaxb wild rabbit covered his bases didnt he she said quietly it bombards the nervous and respiratory systems and hers was already compromised the combination overtaxed her heart it gave out on her within twenty minutes of ingestion shed have been too doped by the earlier doses of whore to know what was happening could she have taken it willingly at that point gently morris lifted the sheet over brynas face after the first ounce of inhibition blocker nothing this girl did was willing he drugged her he raped her and the combination killed her eve said then he tossed her out the window like a used doll in an attempt to cover up what happened in my esteemed and renowned medical opinion thats the scenario now make my day morris and tell me he left sperm in her tell me you got his dna morriss face went bright as a boys oh yeah i got it you bring him in dallas and ill help you lock the cage chapter three sick bastard creep ought to have his balls scooped off with a rusty spoon eve settled back in her car dont hold back peabody tell me how you really feel goddamn it dallas it got to me in there looking at her on that slab remembering how pretty she was how excited when she called her pal about going out to meet this fuckhead thinking she was meeting someone romantic and damn it nice someone nice and the whole time hes planning to fuck her to death i dont know that he planned that going in but thats how it worked out could be we get him on murder one using the illegals as the murder weapon more likely its going to second degree and dont blow your cortex peabody we wrap him on that add in the sexual assault and his attempt to dispose of the evidence hes not going to see daylight again its not enough she shifted in her seat appalling them both because there were tears in her eyes sometimes it doesnt seem to be enough eve stared through the windshield to give them both time for peabody to pull herself together a pack of kids sprung from school were cruising over the crosswalk on airboards wreaking havoc on the bipeds they wove through there was something painfully innocent painfully alive about the flash and color of them a half a block away from a house of dead its enough eve said because its what we can do our job is to stand for bryna bankhead and bring in the man who killed her after that she remembered her session in court the defense attorneys slippery twist on the law after that we trust the system to give her justice and we put it away you dont put it away they pile up the dead pile up she added when peabody stared at her until you cant see past them and you cant do the job do you put it away can you it was a question eve tried not to ask herself and asked herself too often a lot of murder cops theyve only got so many years in them so many dead then it starts eating at them until theyre used up i cant do anything else but this so its not going to use me up she let out a long breath but in a perfect world wed have the rusty spoon option when i started working with you i thought homicide was the most important thing i could do its been about a year now i still think that okay she jammed her way into traffic like a battering ram i need to make a stop down at the canal street clinic lets see if the boys in edd have made any progress she used the indash link to contact feeneys office and felt peabody stiffen when mcnabs pretty face appeared onscreen hey lieutenant eve watched his gaze shift over saw his lips stretch into a smile every bit as stiff as peabodys shoulders peabody i need your captain eve told him he just stepped out tell him to tag me as soon as he comes back hold it hold it hold it his face filled the screen as he leaned in dont eject till you hear the tune the captain put me on your electronic account search eve punched her vehicle through a narrow opening switched lanes and gained half a block pretty basic ework for a hotshot isnt it yeah well it got bumped up to hotshot level when the tech ran into some snags your cybercasanova put in some blocks and walls i scaled them being a hotshot and came up with an address are you going to stop bragging long enough to give it to me i would lieutenant but youd be wasting your time address is in the carpathian mountains where the hell is that mountain range eastern europe i know mcnab said with a frisky toss of his long blond ponytail because i looked it up and before you ask me what the hell our perps doing on a mountain in eastern europe hes not its a dummy address is bogus as my cousin sheilas tits it doesnt sound like you scaled a wall to me mcnab dallas i scaled a fucking mountain here i got a bounce from the fake address and im following the echo should have it nailed in another hour then dont talk to me until you set down the hammer and mcnab any guy who knows anything about his cousins tits is a perv she broke transmission on his hoot of laughter he may be irritating eve said to peabody but hes good hell nail it and if its taking him this long that tells me our suspect is an aboveaverage hacker he protected himself going in which in court will be to overuse an image another nail in his coffin she glanced at peabodys profile dont sulk im not sulking hissing eve flipped down the passenger visor so the mirror dropped down look at your face you want him to know you get bent when you have to deal with him snag a little pride peabody studying herself peabody saw sulk move into pout mode at eves words she flipped the visor back up i was just thinking thats all eve made the swing onto canal pitching through its bazaarlike sector where the offerings were plentiful and cheap and the black market did the lions share of business tourists were routinely scammed then they filed complaints against shops that changed venues more often and with greater efficiency than a tent circus then again eve figured if you were stupid enough to believe you could buy a rolex for the same price as a large pizza you deserved the skinning within a few blocks the carnival gave way to the dumping ground for the homeless and the disenfranchised sidewalk sleepers erected their boxes and tents in pitiful little communities of despair those with beggars licenses and many without them wandered across town to shill enough credit tokens to buy a bottle of home brew to get them through another night those who didnt make it through the night would be transported to the morgue by the nypsd unit notsoaffectionately known as the sidewalk scoopers no matter how many were loaded up cremated at city expense more came to replace them it was a cycle no one particularly the city fathers seemed to be able to break and it was here in the midst of the filth and despair that louise dimatto ran the canal street clinic she didnt break the cycle either eve thought but she made the spin on it a little less painful for some in an area where the shoes on your feet were considered fair game it was a risky business to park a car unless you then surrounded it by droids wearing body armor and hefting rocket lasers patrol cars were manned by exactly that the good news was parking places were plentiful eve pulled to the curb behind what might have been a sedan at one time but since all that was left of it was part of a chassis and a broken windshield she couldnt be sure she stepped out and in the hot stinking steam that gushed up from a subway vent engaged all locks activated all alarms then she stood on the sidewalk scanned the street in all directions there were a few loiterers hulking in doorways and one pitifully skinny street lc trying to drum up customers im lieutenant dallas nypsd she didnt shout it but raised her voice enough to cause faces to shift in her direction this piece of shit is my official city vehicle if said piece of shit is not in this exact spot in this exact condition when i come back ill bring a squad of doorbangers down here to roust every living soul in a fiveblock radius along with illegalssniffer dogs who will find and confiscate all the goodies youve got stashed i guarantee it will be a very unpleasant experience bitch cop tracking the direction of the comment eve lifted her gaze to a thirdfloor window in a building across the street officer peabody will you verify the assholes opinion yes sir lieutenant the asshole is correct you are the supreme bitch cop and what will happen if anyone lays hands on my vehicle you will make their life a living hell you will make their friends lives a living hell their familys lives a living hell and sir you will make peoples lives who are complete strangers to them a living hell yes eve said with a cold and satisfied smile yes i will she turned away and walked to the door of the clinic and youll enjoy it okay peabody point made she pulled open the door stepped inside for an instant she thought shed walked into the wrong door from her visits over the past winter she remembered the jammed waiting room the dingy walls the tattered inadequate furniture here instead was a wide space partitioned by a low wall where glossy green plants thrived in simple clay pots chairs and sofas were ranged on either side and though nearly every seat was taken there was a sense of order the walls were a pale pretty green decorated with framed pictures obviously drawn by children there was the hacking wheezing the soft whimpering of the ill and the injured but there was not as there had been the previous winter an underlying sense of anger and hopelessness even as she scanned the room a woman in a jumpsuit the same color as the walls came through a doorway mrs lasio the doctor will see you now at the shift in patients eve crossed over to the reception window through it she could see updated equipment and the same sense of ordered efficiency that permeated the waiting areas there was a young man at the station with a face as cheerful and harmless as a daisy he couldnt have been more than twenty eve thought as he beamed up at her good afternoon how can we help you today i need to see doctor dimatto yes maam im afraid doctor dimatto is fully booked for the rest of this afternoon if this is a medical emergency its personal business eve laid her badge on the counter official business if shes tied up have her contact me when shes free lieutenant dallas cop central oh lieutenant dallas doctor dimatto said you might come by shes with a patient but if you dont mind waiting just a few minutes you can wait in her office and ill tell her youre here fine he buzzed her through the door she saw what she assumed were examining rooms on either side of a hallway and the hallway opened into a wide passthrough where lab equipment stood on counters from somewhere nearby she heard a child laughing you guys expanded yes dr dimatto was able to purchase the building that adjoined the original clinic still beaming smiles he led them across the passthrough into another hallway she expanded and updated the clinic and its services and added pediatrics we have six doctors now two fulltime and four on rotation and a fully equipped lab he opened a door doctor dimatto is the angel of canal street please help yourself to the autochef shell be with you as soon as she can louises office hadnt changed much eve noted it was still small still cramped still crowded and reminded eve very much of her own space at central jeez shes really done something here peabody commented it had to run her a couple million i guess and since eve had only donated okay bribed louise with a half a million for the clinic she figured the angel of canal street had done some very intense very successful fundraising in a very short amount of time this place is better equipped and i bet better run than my local health center peabody pursed her lips i might switch yeah well to eves mind one health facility was the same as another they were all voids of hell you got an ememo on you well just leave the doctor a message i want to get back to central maybe somewhere and as peabody dug into her pockets louise rushed in got five need coffee she made a beeline for the autochef fill me in while i refuel did you know bryna bankhead no picture peabody eve took the id photo peabody took from her file bag held it out recognize her louise drank coffee with one hand dragged her other through her hair as she frowned at the image a stethoscope and a red lollipop peeked out of her lab coat pocket yes id ridden in the elevator with her now and again seen her in the local markets where i shop i suppose i might have spoken to her the way you do with neighbors you dont have time to know was she murdered yeah eve held out a copy of the suspects image recognize him no louise set down her coffee took the photo for a closer look no ive never seen him before he killed her why eve handed the photos back to peabody you ever treat anybody for sexinducement drugs whore rabbit yes in my er rotation wed have somebody coming down off rabbit a few times a month mostly rabbit clones or exotica zeus combo because the reals so pricey i never dealt with whore dont know anybody who has you study it and its derivatives in illegals training but its on the inactive list not anymore is that what he did to her doped her with whore whore and rabbit jesus christ she rubbed her hands over her face mixed with alcohol i take it why didnt he just blast her brains out with a laser maybe you could poke around ask some of your doctor friends if theyve seen any reemergence of whore i can do that you know a man had to come up with the street name for that crap you know how it started no how as an experimental treatment for phobias and conditions like social anxiety disorder it was a little too good at it meaning it also had an affect on the hormones it was discovered that it worked more effectively as an aid in sexual disorders in diluted and carefully monitored doses it could and did enhance sexual desire and function from there it went into use as an aide for training licensed companions though nonaddictive it was soon found to be dangerously unstable which naturally meant it became desirable on the street particularly among your more wellheeled college boys and junior execs who would slip a dose into their dream girls drink to loosen her up she washed the rising rage back down her throat with coffee thats how it got its name she continued as mixed with alcohol it tends to loosen the system up enough so the ingestor would be amenable to being fucked naked on the ice rink at rockefeller center the ingestor wouldnt necessarily have the motor coordination left to actively participate and would unlikely remember doing so but shed be damn amenable to suggestion add rabbit oh shed participate with the entire us marine corps until she passed out cold until her heart rate went off the charts and her brainwave pattern flattened a doctor would know that eve prompted a chemist pharmacist nurse med tech anyone with a working knowledge of pharmaceuticals would know the combination was fatal yeah anyone should unless he or she is a moron or just didnt give a shit as long as it was fun while it lasted okay ask around if anything strikes you get in touch you can bank on it you did a nice job around here eve added we like to think so louise finished off the coffee twopointed the cup in the recycle bin your three million went a long way three million i was ready to dive into the half million we agreed on didnt expect the bonus when eve ran her tongue around her teeth when did i give you the bonus louise opened her mouth closed it again smiled now why do i think you dont have a clue refresh me louise when did i give you three million dollars never but your rep did late february and my rep would be some slick suit named treacle of montblanc cissler and treacle issued in two installments the half mil as agreed and another two point five if i contracted to donate my services to dachas a newly established abuse center for women and children on the lower east side dachas she said still smiling is im told gaelic for hope is that so yeah youve got a hell of a man there dallas you ever get tired of him ill take him off your hands ill keep that in mind o o you gave her the money for all that peabody demanded as she hustled out after eve no i didnt give her the money because its not my money is it its roarkes money im a cop goddamn it a cop doesnt have space stations full of money to make grand gestures with yeah but still does that piss you off eve stopped on the sidewalk took a long breath i dont know if it pisses me off but she kicked the base of a street lamp just in case she was he could tell me about this stuff couldnt he he could keep me in the loop so i wouldnt go into this sort of situation and come out feeling like an idiot peabody looked back at the clinic her soft heart going to goo stage i think it was a beautiful gesture dont contradict me peabody do you forget i am the supreme bitch cop no sir and as your vehicle is in the same spot and the same condition as you left it the neighborhood didnt forget that either too bad a bit wistful she looked around idve enjoyed busting some ass o o back at central eve snagged a candy bar in lieu of lunch brooded called up data on the chemicals pertinent to the bankhead homicide brooded some more then called to harass mcnab i want an address would you settle for twentythree of them what the hell does that mean look im going to snag a conference room your office is a box your level he said working a keyboard to his left manually as he spoke ah room im using your name to finesse it mcnab easier quicker to explain this facetoface give me five he broke transmission on her snarl which gave her no choice but to finish her snarl at peabody conference room now she ordered she stormed out of her office through the detectives bullpen where the kill lights in her eyes discouraged any of her associates from speaking to her by the time she shoved into the conference room shed worked up a fine head of steam and only required a handy target to spew it on to his misfortune feeney strolled in first what the hell kind of division are you running up there she demanded mcnabs giving me orders now hanging up on me booking rooms in my name on his own initiative and and refusing to give me data when ordered hold on now dallas im an innocent bystander too bad cause theyre the ones who usually end up bloody with a little shrug feeney rattled the bag of nuts weighing down his pocket all i know is the kid tagged me asked me to swing by here so he could fill us both in at once im primary on this case edd was requested to assist and consult i have not yet formed a task force in this matter nor have i been authorized by the commander to do so until i say different mcnabs a drone and nothing more feeney stopped rattling the bag angled his head that go for me too lieutenant your rank doesnt mean dick when im primary if you cant teach your subordinates proper pecking order and procedure then maybe your rank doesnt mean dick in your own division he stepped in until the tips of his shoes bumped her boots leaned in until the tip of his nose bumped hers dont you tell me how to run my division i trained your ass and i can still kick it so dont you start thinking you can tear a strip off mine back off fuck that fuck that dallas you got a problem with my command style you spit it out chapter and verse something in her head wanted to explode why hadnt she felt it something in her heart was screaming but she hadnt heard it so it was she who backed off one cautious step he drugged her with whore and rabbit he covered the bed with rose petals and fucked her on them until she died then he tossed her out the window so she lay broken and naked on the sidewalk oh jesus pity edged his voice i guess its been stuck in my throat since morris told me im sorry i slapped at you forget it sometimes you catch one that hits you harder than others you gotta slap at somebody ive got his face ive got his dna ive got his transmissions i know the table in the club where he fed her the first of the whore in drinks that she paid for with her own debit card but i dont have him you will he turned as peabody strode in a step in front of mcnab both of them had flushed faces detective did you request permission from the primary to convene in this room mcnab blinked i needed to answer the question not exactly captain he didnt need to see peabody smirk to know she did i apologize for overstepping lieutenant dallas i believe the information i have to ah impart is important to the investigation and is better served in person than interoffice transmissions the dull flush burning up his throat was enough to satisfy her then impart it mcnab yes sir it was difficult to look stiff and cold while wearing cherry red trousers and a skintight sweater the color of daffodils but he nearly managed it in tracing the suspects account from the fraudulent source location i was able to ascertain the name used to register the account it purports to be a business called la belle dame purports to be eve said yes sir there is no firm or organization by that name doing business in the state of new york the address given for the company is in fact grand central station and im to be excited about this because well i kept separating layers and hit on sources for the actual transmissions the locations they were sent out from so far ive hit twentythree spots all public cybercafes and clubs in manhattan queens and brooklyn so far he repeated he moves around sends and receives from ports in public venues the only email sent or received from that screen address was to and from bryna bankhead he created it for her eve murmured the umbrella account could have other screen names mcnab went on i havent been able to break through the blocks yet whoever created the account knows his cybershit i mean hes good and hes careful her best friend didnt recognize him so far none of the doortodoors on the building have turned up any neighbors who recognized him eve paced if bankhead didnt know him if he wasnt seen in or around her building before the night of the murder then we have to assume he targeted her from the chat room he knew where she worked peabody put in but she didnt make him and neither did her friend who works the same department so hes maybe a casual customer if he was a regular or an employee who spent any time in their department theyd have noticed you still notice guys who hang out where they sell womens underwear but well run his picture through their human resources division so he uses public venues he either likes to socialize or hes hiding in plain sight maybe both we circulate his picture at the cyberspots lieutenant mcnab wagged his fingers do you know how many cybervenues there are in new york no and i dont want to know but you can start counting them off as you visit them she looked at feeney you in if whitney authorizes id say were already in generate a list she told mcnab well split it up work in pairs for now she gave a soft sigh mcnab and feeney are the experts in this area im only going to ask this once in this room does anyone here have a problem working with anyone else on this team mcnab stared at the ceiling as if fascinated by the dull white tone of the paint peabody simply frowned at her shoes i take that as a no peabody youre with mcnab feeney youre with me start on the west side well take the east well do as many venues as possible until she checked her wrist unit calculated twentyone hundred well meet at my home office tomorrow oh eight hundred for a full briefing feeney lets pitch this to whitney feeney strolled out after her whistling you couldve split us up another way yeah she glanced back down the corridor and hoped she wasnt making a mistake but im thinking this way maybe the two of them will duke it out and we can all get back to normal he considered that as they hopped on a glide i got twenty on peabody shit she jammed her hands in her pockets okay but if ive got to lay down on mcnabs bony ass i want odds three to five done back in the conference room peabody and mcnab sat just as they were ive got no problem working with you mcnab said why should you i havent got one working with you either good good they stared ceiling and shoes for another twenty seconds mcnab broke first youre the one whos been avoiding me anyway i have not why should i we are so over who said anything different and it burned him that she could say it just that coolly when he thought about her all the time and you wouldnt think id been avoiding you if you hadnt been trying to get my attention shit for what im a busy boy shebody too busy to worry about some stiffnecked uniform who spends her offtime playing with lcs you leave charles out of this she leaped to her feet rage boiling in her blood and a new little tear in her heart me i dont have to hunt up pros i got all the amateurs i can handle he kicked out his legs worked up a sneer but thats neither here nor there right we got the job and thats it if you can handle it i can handle anything you can more fine ill put the list together and well get started chapter four you dont have his face eve scowled at dickie berenski the chief lab tech he might have had a smarmy smile an attitude that had earned him the notsoaffectionate nickname of dickhead and a personality defect that deluded him into thinking of himself as a ladies man but he was a genius in his little world of fibers fluids and follicles you called me out of the field to tell me i dont have his face figured youd want to know dickie pushed himself away from the station sent his chair spinning toward another monitor his spidery fingers danced over a keyboard see that there eve studied the colorwashed image on monitor its a hair give the lady a prize but what kinda hair you might ask and im here to tell you this didnt come out of your perps head it didnt come out of your victims head or any other area of their bodies came out of a wig expensive human hair wig can you track it down working on it he scooted his chair to yet another post know what this is there

makeup dallas base cream number traces of it found on the bed linens and it dont match what was on the dead girl got more he switched the image we got here traces of face putty stuff people use to

before were finished got his fingerprints on the wineglasses on the bottle on the body balcony doors and rail and here and there you find him well box him up real pretty send me what youve got track down those brand names i want that data by morning hey he shouted as she strode out you could say thanks yeah thanks goddamn it o o she let it play through her head all the way home trying to see what kind of man lived inside her killer she was afraid she did see he was smart smart enough to change his appearance so the security cameras and bryna bankhead wouldnt identify him but he hadnt taken her out or gone back to her apartment with the idea of killing her eve was sure of it hed gone to seduce her but things had gotten out of hand she mused and hed found himself with a dead woman on his rose petals hed reacted panicked or angry and had tossed her panicked rang with her it hadnt been temper on his face when hed come out of the apartment he had money or access to it after more than a year with roarke she knew the signs shed recognized the exclusive cut of the killers suit even the pricey gleam of his shoes but hed let bryna pay for the drinks a two for one eve thought no paper trail and a boost to his ego by having the woman pay for him he had solid tech skills and a knowledge of chemistry or again access to that knowledge and skill he was sexually twisted perhaps inadequate even impotent under normal circumstances hed be single she decided as she approached the gates of home unlikely to have had any longterm or healthy relationships in his past nor had he been looking for one hed wanted complete control the romantic trappings had been for his benefit not hers an illusion she decided his fantasy so that he could envision himself as lover now that hed achieved that control he would do one of two things hed hole up in fear and guilt over what hed done or hed start hunting again predators in eves experience rarely stopped at one the house loomed into view with all its fanciful and elegant angles softened by twilight lights glowed richly against too many windows to count ornamental trees and shrubs she couldnt name were in wild bloom perfuming the air so delicately so completely you could almost forget you were in the city then again sometimes she thought of this strange and perfect space behind stone walls and iron gates as its own country she just happened to live in it shed come to love the house even a year before she wouldnt have believed that possible shed admired it certainly been both intimidated and fascinated by its sheer beauty its amazing warren of rooms and treasures but the love had caught her and held her just as love for the man who owned it had caught her had held her knowing he wasnt inside tempted her to turn around and drive away again she could spend the night at central because the idea depressed her because it reminded her of what she might have done before her life had opened to roarke she pulled to a stop in front of the house she climbed the old stone steps pulled open the grand front door and stepped out of the dusk into the glamorous light of the entrance foyer and summerset a skinny crow in his habitual black stood waiting his stony face matched his stony voice lieutenant you left the premises in the middle of the night and failed to inform me of your schedule or your expected return gee dad am i grounded because it would irritate him and irritating roarkes majordomo was one of lifes guaranteed pleasures she stripped off her jacket and tossed it on the polished newel of the main staircase because it would irritate her and irritating roarkes cop was one of summersets pleasures he lifted the scarred leather jacket with two thin fingers informing me of your comings and goings is a basic courtesy which naturally youre incapable of understanding ice we understand each other anyway i was out partying all night you know while the cats away she wanted to ask and couldnt bring herself to ask if he knew when roarke was expected back hed know she thought as she started upstairs he knew every fucking thing she could call roarke herself but that would make her feel nearly as stupid hadnt she talked to him twentyfour hours ago hadnt he said he hoped to wrap things up and be home in another couple of days she walked into the bedroom thought about a shower thought about a meal and decided she wasnt in the mood for either better to go up to her office run some probabilities read through her case notes she removed her weapon harness rolled her shoulders and realized work wasnt the answer either what she needed was some thinking time it was a rare thing for her to go up to the roof garden she didnt like heights but despite the sprawling space of the house being inside made her feel closed in and maybe the air would clear her head she opened the dome so starlight sprinkled down on the dwarf trees the lush blooms that speared and spilled out of pots a fountain gurgled into a pool where exotic fish flashed like wet jewels she took her time walking to the wall carved with winged fairies that circled this section of the roof theyd entertained up here a few times she remembered for a man in roarkes position entertaining was a job though for reasons that escaped her it was something he actually enjoyed she couldnt recall ever coming up here alone before or for that matter ever coming up with just roarke and she wondered who the hell tended the masses of flowers and plants fed the fish kept the tiles gleaming made certain the seats and tables and statuary were clean it was rare to see any sort of servant human or droid in the house other than summerset but then shed learned that people who held great wealth great power could easily command silent and nearly invisible armies to handle the pesky details of life despite that wealth and that power roarke had gone personally to handle the final details of a friends death and she spent her days handling the details of the deaths of strangers she let her mind clear then filled it with bryna bankhead young eager romantic organized shed surrounded herself with attractive things displayed in an attractive manner her closet had been full of stylish clothes with everything hung neatly both the dress and the shoes shed worn on her fatal date had been new with the debits efficiently listed in her log book shed gotten a manicure and had a facial as well had put on pretty earrings purchased the afternoon of her date a very female woman eve mused one who read and enjoyed poetry which meant the killer had hunted the young the romantic the particularly female she had two bottles of wine in her kitchen one white one red and neither approaching the label or price range of the bottle on the table had he brought it with him in his black leather bag along with the illegals the rose petals the candles shed kept condoms in her goodie drawer but the killer hadnt used one bryna had been too high on illegals to insist on such defenses which meant the killer hadnt been concerned about protection or leaving dna evidence because had she lived she wouldnt have been able to identify him by description more eve thought she wouldnt have been sure what had happened theyd had drinks in public where according to the server eve had interviewed that evening she had been very cozy with her date handholding kisses quiet laughter long soulful looks the server according to his statement had assumed they were lovers the security cameras would not only follow that theme but add to it shed not only let him into her apartment shed pulled him inside that had been clever of him eve thought now waiting letting her make the move for the record if shed lived hed have gotten away clean she wondered now if hed done it before no no she began to pace along the wall if he had why would he make the mistake of overdosing her it seemed like a first time but shed run a probability on that if there were another it was another channel to explore another route to tracking him to stopping him pulling out her memo book she plugged in key words chat rooms poetry rare expensive illegals wig cosmetic enhancements pink roses pinot noir sexual deviant tech skills chemistry knowledge after scanning her own words she tucked the book back in her pocket maybe shed have that shower that meal and work after all and turning she saw roarke it didnt matter that theyd been together more than a year it occurred to her that she would very likely have this leap of heart this dazzling rush every time she saw him for the rest of her life eventually it might stop embarrassing her he looked like something fashioned from fantasy the long rangy body clad in black would have looked just as natural in a billowing cape or tarnished armor his face framed by that silky sweep of black hair would have suited either poet or warrior with its chiseled bones and full sensuous mouth his eyes that wild and wonderful blue still had the power to weaken her knees no she realized it would never stop embarrassing her it would never stop thrilling her youre back early a bit hello lieutenant at the sound of his voice that subtle and rich lilt of ireland everything inside her tumbled then he smiled just the faintest curve of his lips and she took a step toward him by the second she was running he caught her halfway lifted her right off her feet even as his mouth found hers there was heat one quick flash and warmth beneath it a spreading settled warmth that reached down to the marrow home he thought as the taste of her coated over the grief and fatigue of the last days home at last you failed to inform me of your schedule she said in a reasonably accurate mimic of summerset now i guess i have to cancel the hot date i lined up with the lapdancing twins ah lars and sven ive heard theyre very inventive he rested his cheek against hers as he set her on her feet again what are you doing up here i dont know exactly couldnt settle wanted air she eased back to study his face you okay yes but she angled her head took his face in her hands are you okay she repeated it was difficult more than i expected it to be i thought id put it away he was your friend whatever else he was your friend one who died so i didnt ive resolved that he laid his brow on hers or thought i had this wake brian wanted the gathering of so many from my past then seeing where mick had been put in the ground it was difficult i should have gone with you he smiled a little some of the mourners might have been a little uneasy with a cop in the midst even my cop still ive a message from brian for you as he stood behind his bar at the penny pig he asked that i tell you when youve come to your senses and shed yourself of the likes of me hell be waiting for you its always good to have backup you have dinner not yet no why dont we try a little role reversal ill make you eat sneak a soother in your food then tuck you into bed youve shadows under your eyes so it seems to me youre the one in need of food and bed summerset said you were out all night summerset is a big fat tattletale i caught a case last night he feathered his long fingers through her hair letting all those shades of brown and blonde spill through want to tell me about it she could have said no and hed have wheedled it out of her later she eased back into his arms held on i missed you eve missed holding you like this missed the smell of you the taste you could make up for it she turned her head so that her lips skimmed over his jaw i intend to intentions are easy now she used her teeth i prefer action right here right now he let her back him toward a long padded chaise what about lars and sven ill take care of them later he grinned spun her around so she hit the chaise first i think youre going to be much too tired for a lap dance i dont know im feeling pretty energetic she shifted to cradle him between her thighs and her eyebrows winged up hey you too i seem to have caught my second wind he opened the first button on her shirt paused isnt this my shirt she winced before she could stop herself so so touched amused he dispatched the rest of the buttons im afraid ill have to have it back yeah like you dont already have about five hundred she trailed off when his fingers traced over her breasts okay if you want to be that way about it i do he touched his lips to hers he sank into her layer by layer the taste of her mouth her skin and the texture of both aroused soothed seduced the shape of her the long legs the narrow torso the small firm breasts were an unending delight she tugged at the shirts the one he wore the one shed borrowed and flesh met flesh she arched he burrowed the night air cooled around them but blood heated she sighed as their mouths met again as lips parted as tongues slicked in a long wet kiss that slipped from gentle to urgent and her sigh was a moan as his mouth began to move restlessly down her body more all everything he thought then stopped thinking her throat her shoulders the lines and curves of them he fed on them then hungrily on her breasts until it seemed he fed on her heart as well shuddering she bowed to him offering more while her hands streaked over him to take he made her want more than shed known there was to have it was always the same and when his mouth his hands stroked down her she gripped the side of the chaise and rode the ferocious storm of pleasure she saw the stars wheeling in the sky overhead felt others explode inside her body she went limp she went liquid and moved against him now in a slow sinuous rhythm urgency mellowed toward tenderness a caress a whisper a gentle shift body to body her fingers stroked through his hair her lips found the curve of his throat nuzzling against the pulse that beat for her when he slipped inside her she opened her eyes to find him watching her no one she thought as the breath trembled through her lips no one had ever looked at her as he did in a way that told her she was the center she rose to him fell away rose again in a dance that was both patient and pure the rhythm stayed slow silky and slow as their lips met again she heard felt him say her name eve she wrapped her arms around him held him close as they slipped home together o o he unearthed robes from somewhere eve sometimes wondered if he had some factory of silkworms buried in the house as he never seemed to run out of silk robes these were black and just weighty enough to keep a body comfortable on a warm spring night while dining alfresco she decided it was hard to beat eating rare steak from actual cows drinking a fullbodied red wine at a candlelit table on the roof garden and all this after stupendous sex its a pretty good deal she said between bites what is having you back no fun having a fancy dinner by yourself theres always summerset now youre going to spoil my appetite he watched her plow through the steak i think not havent you eaten today i had a doughnut and dont start whats pinot noir fortynine run what label he retorted just as casually as she had asked ahh shit she closed her eyes until she had the image of the bottle in her head maison de lac excellent choice about five hundred a bottle id have to check to be certain but thats close one of yours yes why its one of the murder weapons do you own the apartment building on tenth street which apartment building on tenth street she hissed rifled through her mental files and gave him the address i dont believe i do he smiled easily now how did i miss that one very funny well its nice to know i can catch a murder someplace in the city you dont own how is a fivehundreddollar bottle of very nice wine used as a murder weapon poison in a way she debated about five seconds then told him he courts her through email roarke said romances her with poetry then slips two of the most despicable illegals ever devised into her drink drinks eve corrected he was plying her through the evening and sets the stage romance seduction and uses her uses her up he said softly all the while telling himself id think that she was enjoying it that it wasnt rape but again seduction romance nonviolent erotic and mutually satisfying eve set down her fork why do you say that you said he was disguised once he was in her apartment and she was already under the influence he could have done what he wanted with her if hed wanted to hurt her if violence was part of his turnon he could have done so but he added candlelight music flowers and gave her a drug designed to make her aggressive and needy sexually the illusion that she was not only willing but passionate did he need that for his ego to be able to perform physically or both thats good thats good she said again with a nod i havent been thinking enough like a guy the disguise is part of the seduction too the expensive clothes the hair and makeup he wanted to look like she stopped stared at the exceptional specimen across from her oh shit he wanted to look like you excuse me not you you he went for really long curly hair and green eyes but you as a type the perfect fantasy darling youll embarrass me fat chance what im saying is the look was part of his fantasy too he wants to be the great lover the irresistible image how he looks and what he is or pretends to be rich traveled wellread sophisticated yet hopelessly romantic at the core theres a certain type of woman whos prime target for that kind but not you lieutenant he said with a smile i just married you for the sex she picked up her fork again and the regular servings of red meat which brings me to a little sidebar here louise dimatto lives in the same apartment building does she and she was standing on the sidewalk when bankhead hit the pavement he topped off their glasses im sorry to hear that i swung by the clinic today to bring her up to date lot of changes around there hmm yeah hmmm why didnt you tell me youd given the clinic three million dollars he lifted his glass sipped i make quite a number of charitable donations i dont tell you about he offered a smile would you like to be copied on the data in the future dont get smart with me ace id like to know why you went around me and gave her five times the amount agreed on id like to know why you didnt tell me about this shelter you asked her to give time to i liked the work she was doing roarke she laid her hand over his firmly you started this shelter for me did you think id be upset or pissed off or what if you told me about it i implemented plans for the shelter several months ago for you he said and turned his hand over hers so that their fingers linked for myself we had nowhere to go did we eve and if i had i wouldnt have gone too tough too angry even bleeding from the ears from the last beating id not have gone but others will he lifted their joined hands studying the way they fit the way they held still im next to certain i wouldnt have thought to do this thing if it hadnt been for you but you didnt tell me the shelters not altogether finished he began its open and theyve taken in what theyre calling guests but there are still details to be completed some programs that are yet to be fully implemented it should be he broke off no i didnt tell you i dont know whether i intended to or not because i couldnt be sure if it would please you or distress you the name pleases me good and what distresses me though thats a wimpy word is that you didnt tell me about something youre doing that makes me really proud of you i wouldnt have gone to one of those places either she continued when he only looked at her because he had me so scared of them because he made them sound like big dark pits and i was as afraid of the dark as i was of him so i wouldnt have gone but others will he lifted her hand to his lips yes now look at you dublins bad boy pillar of the community philanthropist a leading social conscience of the city dont you start tough guy with a big gooey heart dont make me hurt you eve hear that she cocked her head thats the sound of my knees knocking she sat back satisfied the sadness shed seen lingering on his face when hed first come home was gone she was really starting to nail this wife thing okay now that ive let you fuck me and feed me thereby satisfying all immediate appetites ive got work i beg your pardon but i seem to recall someone promising to tuck me into bed thatll have to wait ace i want to run some probabilities and see if i can get a line on the umbrella account this guy uses french deal la belle dame keats whats that not what you plebeian who john keats classic poet nineteenth century the poem is la belle dame sans merci the beautiful woman without mercy how come you know all this stuff amazing isnt it he laughed as he pulled her to her feet ill get you the poem then we can get to work i dont need he shut her up with a quick hard kiss how about this lets pretend you argued about not needing or wanting civilian help or interference then i pointed out all the very sane and reasonable advantages of same we wrangled about it for twenty minutes then admitting that i can find data more quickly than you and two heads are better than one and so on and so forth we got to work thatll save some time she hissed out a breath okay but if i catch you looking smug im kicking your ass darling that goes without saying chapter five they didnt have his face whenever fear tried to creep under his skin like hot ants he repeated that single and most essential fact they did not have his face so they could not find him he could walk the streets ride in a cab eat in a restaurant cruise the clubs no one would question him or point fingers or run to find a cop he had killed and he was safe in its most basic sense his life hadnt changed and still he was afraid it had been an accident of course nothing more than an unfortunate miscalculation caused by a perfectly understandable excess of enthusiasm actually if one looked at the overall picture it had been as much the womans fault as his more really when he said as much again while gnawing viciously on his thumbnail his companion sighed kevin if you must pace and repeat yourself do it elsewhere its very annoying kevin morano a tall trim young man of twentytwo threw himself down drummed his wellmanicured fingers on the buttery leather arm of a wingback chair his face was unlined his eyes a quiet unremarkable blue his hair a medium brown of medium length his looks were pleasant if ordinary marred only by his tendency to sulk at the slightest hint of criticism he did so now as he watched his friend his oldest and most constant companion from that quarter at least he felt he deserved some sympathy and support i think i have some cause to be concerned there was petulance in his voice a whine for sympathy it all went to hell lucias nonsense the word was more command than comment lucias dunwood was used to commanding kevin it was in his opinion the only way they got anything done he continued to work on his calculations and measurements in the expansive laboratory hed designed and equipped to suit both his needs and his wants as always he worked with confidence as a child hed been considered a prodigy a pretty boy with red curls and sparkling eyes with a stunning talent for math and science hed been pampered spoiled educated and praised the monster inside the child had been very sly and very patient like kevin hed been raised in wealth and in privilege theyd grown up almost like brothers in a very real sense as theyd been created in much the same way for much the same purpose they considered themselves even more than brothers from the beginning even as infants they had recognized each other had recognized what hid beneath those small soft bodies theyd attended the same schools had competed academically socially throughout their lives they fed each other and found in each other the only one who understood that they were beyond the common and ordinary rules that governed society kevins mother had birthed him then turned him over to paid tenders so that she could pursue her own ambitions luciass mother had kept him close and found in him her only ambition and both had been smothered with excesses indulged in every whim directed to excel and taught to expect nothing less than everything now they were men lucias was fond of saying and could do as they pleased neither worked for a living nor needed to they found the idea of contributing to a society they disdained laughable in the town house theyd bought together theyd created their own world their own rules the primary rule was never never to be bored lucias turned to a monitor scanning the various components and equations that rushed over the screen yes he thought yes that was correct that was perfect and satisfied he strolled over to the bar a gleaming antique from the s and mixed a drink whiskey and soda he said thatll set you right up kevin only waved a hand sighed heavily dont be tedious kev oh pardon me im just a bit out of sorts because i killed someone chuckling lucias carried the highball glasses across the room it doesnt matter if it did id be very angry with you after all i was very clear on the dosage and the choice you werent to mix the two solutions kevin i know it irritable kevin took the glass frowned into it i got carried away with the whole thing ive never had a woman so completely under my spell i didnt know it could be that way that was the point of the game wasnt it smiling lucias lifted his glass in toast drank women have never been what we wanted them to be for us christ look at our mothers mines spineless and yours is bloodless at least yours shows an interest in you you dont know how lucky you are lucias gestured with his glass the bitch would hang around my neck like a pendant if i didnt keep away from her small wonder dear old dad spends the majority of his time out of town lucias stretched out his legs in any case back to the point women if they were interested in either of us they were usually dull intellectuals or brainless moneygrubbers we deserve better kevin we deserve exactly the women we want as many as we want and in precisely the way we want them we do of course we do but god lucias when i realized she was dead yes yes lucias sat in the matching chair leaned forward eagerly tell me again she was so sexy beautiful exotic confident the kind of woman ive always wanted and she couldnt keep her hands off me i couldve had her in the cab in the elevator i scored a hell of a lot of points even before we were in her apartment well tally them up shortly lucias gave an impatient wave go on i had to keep slowing her down i didnt want it to be over too quickly i wanted the romance of it for both of us the slow steps of seduction and of course the first hints of amusement crossed his face to continue to rack up as many points as possible during the allotted time period naturally lucias agreed and toasted it was working she let me do whatever i wanted she enjoyed it yes yes then i told her to wait so i could set the scene in the bedroom just as id planned it was perfect it was all perfect the lighting the music the scent of the air and she surrendered to you yes kevin sighed letting it come flooding back i carried her into the bedroom i undressed her so slowly while she trembled for me she whimpered for me but then she became lethargic lucias rattled the ice in his glass youd given her too much i know it but i wanted more damn it his mouth turned down his voice was edged with temper it wasnt enough for her to lie there like a droid i wanted her hot out of control i deserved that after all id done of course you did so you gave her the rabbit i should have diluted it i know but i was careful just a few drops on her tongue lucias he wet his lips she went wild hot and screaming begging me to take her she begged me lucias we coupled like animals romance to seduction to the primitive ive never felt like that when i came it was like being born he shuddered sipped when it was over i lay there spent drifting with her under me i kissed her caressed her so shed know shed pleased me then i looked down at her she stared up at me just stared and stared i didnt understand at first but then i knew she was dead you were born lucias said and she died the ultimate in experiences he sipped and considered think of it kevin she died much the same way as we were conceived from a frantic coupling induced by chemicals one an experiment with superior results if we do say so ourselves and we do kevin agreed with a laugh the other a game a game well played for the first round now its my turn what are you talking about kevin leaped to his feet as lucias rose you cant be serious you cant go through with it of course i can why should you have all the fun lucias for gods sake it was stupid of you to throw her out the window if youd just left her there walked out it would have taken more time for them to find her deduction in points for poor strategy i wont make that mistake what do you mean kevin gripped his arm what are you going to do kev were in this together planning and execution when we started we considered this a bit of recreation a kind of interlude where wed expand our sexual experiences and at a dollar a point a kind of casual competition to keep us entertained no one was supposed to be hurt and youre not lucias pointed out who else matters its our game yes it was unarguable logic and calmed him again thats true and now think of it lucias spun away threw out his arms in a way its the most fascinating circle birth to death dont you see the irony the beauty of it the very drugs that were used to help us come into existence are the ones you used to end someone elses existence yes kevin could feel himself being pulled into the thrill of it yes but the stakes are higher and so much more interesting lucias turned back and gave kevins arm a manly and congratulatory squeeze kevin youre a murderer he paled but the gleam of respect in luciass eyes made him want to preen it was an accident youre a murderer how can i be less you mean to excitement began to ball in his belly deliberately look at me tell me and you know you cant lie not to me if her death at your hands wasnt part of the thrill wasnt in fact the biggest part of it i kevin grabbed his drink gulped whiskey yes god yes would you deny me the same experience he draped an arm around kevins shoulders led him to the elevator after all kev theyre only women o o her name was grace such a sweet oldfashioned name she worked as a page in the new york city library delivering discs and precious books to patrons who settled into the reading rooms to study or research or simply pass the time with literature she loved poetry she was twentythree a pretty delicate blonde with a shy nature and a generous heart and she was already in love with the man who called himself dorian and wooed her in the safe world of cyberspace shed told no one about him it made it more special more romantic that no one knew for their first date she bought a new dress with a long flowing skirt in blending pastels that made her think of rainbows when she left her little apartment to ride the subway uptown she felt very daring very adult imagine having drinks at the starview lounge with the man she was convinced she would marry she was certain hed be handsome he just had to be she knew he was rich and articulate and a great traveler a man who loved books and poetry as she did they were soul mates she was too happy to be nervous too sure of the outcome of the evening to have a single doubt she would be dead before midnight o o her name had been grace and she had been his first not just his first kill but his first woman even kevin didnt know that he had never been able to complete the sexual act until tonight he had been a god in that narrow bed in the pathetic little apartment a god who had made the woman beneath him cry out and weep and beg for more she had babbled her love for him had agreed to every demand and her glassy drugged eyes had clung adoringly to his face no matter what hed done to her hed been so surprised shed been a virgin hed come too quickly the first time but shed said it had been wonderful she said shed been waiting for him all her life she had saved herself for him and his very disgust with her aroused him when he took the last vial out of his bag he showed it to her so that the glass and liquid glinted in the candlelight when he told her to open her mouth she did so like a little bird waiting for a worm pounding himself into her he felt her heart gallop he felt it burst and he knew kevin had been right it was like being born he studied her after she was used up when her body grew colder on the tangled sheets and rose petals and knew one thing more this had been his right she was every girl who had ever ignored his needs or turned away when he was unable to perform everyone whod ever refused him denied him smirked at him she was in essence nothing he dressed brushed at the sleeves of his suit jacket shot his cuffs leaving the candles burning he strolled out he couldnt wait to get home and tell kevin o o eve felt fabulous sex and sleep she decided it was hard to beat the combo then when you started the day with a quick swim a monster cup of real coffee strong enough to break bricks you were in fat city the way she was feeling she figured the bad guys had best take a day off you look rested lieutenant roarke leaned on the jamb of the doorway between their home offices ready to rock she said watching him over the rim of her coffee cup i guess youve got a lot of catching up to do i made a pretty good start on that she snorted yeah not bad but i was thinking of work ah ive made a start on that as well he crossed over caged her in between his body and the desk leaning over he stroked the cat whod draped himself over the link like a rag youre crowding me pal and im on the clock here not for five minutes yet she angled her head to look at her wrist unit youre right five minutes she slid her arms around his waist we ought to be able to just as she caught his bottom lip between her teeth she heard the approaching footsteps the unmistakable clomp of cop shoes peabodys early lets pretend we didnt hear her roarke nibbled at her mouth that we cant see her traced it with his tongue that we dont even know her name thats a good plan except when he put sincere effort into the kiss she was pretty sure she could feel her heart melting down boy she murmured just as peabody strode into the room oh um ahem roarke turned picked up galahad to scratch his ears hello peabody hi welcome home maybe ill just go in the kitchen there and get some coffee and stuff but when she started by roarke reached out lifted her chin with a finger and studied her face it was pale the eyes heavy and chased by shadows you look tired guess i didnt sleep very well she muttered need that coffee then she hurried away eve dont she held up a finger at roarkes quiet tone i dont want to talk about that now i dont ever want to talk about it but i especially dont want to talk about it now and if anybody had listened to me when i said she and mcnab getting tangled was going to screw things up we wouldnt have to talk about it would we correct me if im wrong but i think youre talking about it oh shut up all i know is shes going to suck it in and do the job and so is he she gave the desk one badtempered little kick before walking around behind it now go away youre worried about her damn it you think i cant see shes hurt that it doesnt get to me i know you can and i know it does she opened her mouth then heard more footsteps in the hallway let it go she muttered peabody she lifted her voice feeneys here coffee light and sweet howd you know it was me feeney demanded as he came inside you shuffle hell i do hell you dont you shuffle peabody clomps mcnab prances if i wore some of the shoes he does id prance too hey roarke didnt know you were back just ill be working at home for another hour or so he told eve then ill be in the midtown offices the book stays here he added youre welcome to take it on disc if you need it what book feeney asked poetry seems our guy took his umbrella name from a poem some guy named keats wrote a couple hundred years ago bet it doesnt even rhyme you take springsteen mccartney lennon those boys knew how to rhyme classic shit not only doesnt it rhyme but its weird and depressing and mostly stupid with that canny analysis ill leave you to work carrying the cat roarke started toward his office i believe i hear mcnabs prance he might have been wearing candyapple red airboots but he didnt look any perkier than peabody doing her best to ignore it eve sat on the edge of her desk and updated them that explains why we didnt have any luck at the cyberjoints either mcnab put in it didnt make sense that nobodyd seen this dude we can do some morphing probabilities feeney mused most possible face structures colorings combos but basically well be working without a visual id i ran some probabilities myself its most likely were looking for a single male between twentyfive and forty upper income bracket advanced education with some sort of sexual dysfunction or perversion its most probable he lives in the city feeney whered he get the highpriced illegals dealers with rabbit cater to a small exclusive clientele arent that many of them only one in the city i know of but i can check with illegals to see if theres more nobody deals in whore that i know of just isnt cost effective but at one time it was used in sex therapy and for lc training yeah but the price tag was too high and the substance too unpredictable okay but it gave her more threads to pull well back off the cyberjoints for now mcnab start on the morphings feeney see what you can find out from illegals once i hammer dickhead into identifying brands of the putty and enhancers the wig well have that trail to follow i got a tag on the wine my source tells me there were three thousand and fifty bottles of that label and vintage sold in this borough peabody and i will run that down and well see if we can nail down the pink roses the guy spends money wine flowers enhancements illegals then hes left a trail were going to find it peabody youre with me o o when they were in the car eve took a long breath if youre having trouble sleeping take a pill thats some advice coming from you then consider it an order yes sir this is really pissing me off eve punched it roared up the drive peabodys chin jutted out so far eve was surprised it didnt spear through the windshield i apologize if my personal difficulties are an annoyance to you lieutenant if you cant do better sarcasm than that give it up she swung through the gates then slammed on the brakes do you want time off no sir dont sir me peabody in that tone or ill kick your ass right here and now i dont know whats wrong with me her voice went watery i dont even like mcnab hes annoying and hes a jerk and hes stupid so what if the sex was great and maybe we had some laughs big deal its not like we were serious or anything its not like it gives him the right to give me ultimatums or make insulting comments and draw asshole conclusions have you slept with charles yet what peabody actually blushed no maybe you should maybe i cant believe im having this conversation maybe if you relieved some stress in that area youd get your head settled right or something were charles and i are friends yeah youre friends with a very highpriced sexual professional seems to me hed be willing to help you out its not the same as loaning me twenty till payday then she sighed but maybe i should think about it think fast were going to see him peabody came straight up out of the seat what now officially eve said and started the car again hes an expert on sex right lets see what the expert knows about sexual illegals o o the sexual expert had the morning off he answered the door wearing blue silk pajama bottoms as mancandy went he was a caloric binge eve thought it was easy to see why he had so many clients paying for a nibble lieutenant delia what an attractive sight to wake up to sorry to roust you eve told him got a minute for you lieutenant sugar i have hours he stepped back to let them in why dont we have breakfast ive got crepes stocked in the autochef rain check eve said before peabody could even nod you alone or do you have a client sleeping you off all alone the sleepiness began to clear is this official were on a case and i think you may be helpful in certain aspects of it was it anyone i knew bankhead bryna downtown address the woman who jumped out of her window wasnt that suicide homicide eve corrected the media will have that this morning why dont you sit down ill make coffee peabody why dont you make it eve chose a seat in the wellappointed living area sex when it was done right paid well the questions i ask you any portion of this investigation i may discuss with you is confidential understood he sat across from her i take it im not a suspect this time im considering you an expert civilian consultant she took out her recorder officially then i assume sex reared its ugly head consult with monroe charles licensed companion eve announced initiated by dallas lieutenant eve and on her authority as primary of casefile hb also attending peabody officer delia mr monroe are you willing to consult in this matter he managed to keep his face nearly sober whatever i can do to help as a concerned citizen what do you know about the illegal substance known on the street as whore instantly his expression changed did someone use whore on that poor woman the question charles christ he got to his feet was pacing as peabody came back with a coffee tray thanks honey he took a cup drank slowly it was already illegal by the time i started training he continued but i heard plenty about it i took a seminar in my early days sexual deviants dos and donts that kind of thing illegals of any kind were a big dont you can get your license pulled of course that doesnt mean that certain aids arent employed by some lcs or clients but not this one why first since it was once used to make trainees more malleable well say it has a very bad rep in my business the sexslave gambit is fine as a roleplaying game but not in reality were professional sexual companions dallas were not whores or puppets youve never known anyone who used it some of the older pros you hear stories and most of them involve abuse of one kind or another experimentation dose the lc trainee with it then bang away like we were goddamn guinea pigs he said in disgust still its an elitist substance any connoisseurs you know of no but i can check around carefully eve warned what about rabbit he lifted one shoulder rather elegantly only amateurs and perverts use rabbit on themselves or a partner in my circle its considered both tacky and insulting dangerous if youre stupid or careless certainly you dont mix it with alcohol or any other stimulant and you dont want to overdose ods are extremely rare because the shit costs more than liquid gold you know dealers who handle it clients who use it he stared then looked pained jesus dallas i wont use your name he shook his head then walked to the window lifted the privacy shade light washed in charles its really important peabody stepped up to him touched his arm we wouldnt ask if it wasnt i dont do illegals delia you know that i know its not up to me to judge clients who do im no ones moral center eve leaned over switched off the recorder off the record charles and my word no charges will be brought against your client for illegals use im not giving you her name he turned back im not violating that trust but i will talk to her myself ill get the name of her dealer and that ill give you i appreciate it her communicator beeped im going to take this in the kitchen charles peabody rubbed his arm when eve left the room thanks i know we put you in a sensitive position sensitive positions are my specialty he grinned you look tired delia yeah ive been hearing that why dont i fix you dinner one night this week a nice quiet evening ill check my book thatd be great when he leaned down to brush his lips over hers she closed her eyes waited for the thrill and wanted to scream when it didnt come it was she thought like kissing her brother if any of her brothers happened to be gorgeous as sin whats troubling you sweetheart bunch of stuff she grumbled bunch of stupid stuff im working it out if you want to talk about it you know im here yeah i know eve came out of the kitchen and headed straight for the door lets move peabody get me a name charles soon as you can dallas with a quick apologetic glance at charles peabody ran to catch up what is it weve got another one chapter six hed left her on the bed her legs obscenely spread her eyes gaping some of the pink petals stuck to her skin candlewax had spilled and hardened into cold pools over the holders onto the table the little dresser the floor and the cheap colorful rug it was a tiny efficiency apartment that the young woman named grace lutz had tried to make cheerful and cozy with frilled curtains and inexpensive prints in inexpensive frames now it stank of death stale sex and scented candles there was a wine bottle this time a cabernet and this time nearly empty the music came from a cheap audio unit beside the convertible sofa that served as a bed there was no mood screen no video screen and only a single link but there were books carefully tended and set proudly on the painted shelf along one wall there were photographs of grace with a man and woman eve took to be her parents there was a small glass vase filled with spring daisies that were shedding their petals on the dresser top the kitchen was no more than a corner with a twoburner stove a stingy sink and a minifridge inside the fridge were a carton of egg substitute a quart of milk and a small jar of strawberry jam there were no bottles of wine but the one that had killed her grace hadnt spent money on things eve mused nor on fashion if the contents of her closet were any indication but though shed worked in a library shed spent it on books and on what looked to be a new dress now carelessly heaped on the floor he knew what he was doing this time theres no panic here what there is is deliberation physically theyre very different types peabody pointed out this girls white bread sort of tiny nails are short and neat and unpolished nothing slick or flashy about her yeah economically theyre from different brackets socially too this one was a stayathome she looked at the dried blood on the sheets the smears of it on the victims inner thighs the mes going to confirm she was a virgin she bent down shes got bruising thighs hips breasts he was rough with this one check the security peabody see what weve got to work with yes sir why did he hurt you eve wondered as she studied the body why did he want to crouched there beside the dead she saw herself huddled in the corner broken bruised bloody because i can she shoved the image away as she got to her feet pain could be sexual it could be a kind of seduction but it wasnt romantic yet hed still set the stage with rose petals and candlelight with wine and music why did this stage seem to be a mockery of romance rather than a cliched attempt at it too much wine had been drunk and some of it spilled on the table and rug the candles had been allowed to spread into messy drips and pools the sleeve of her new dress had been torn there was a violence here an underlying meanness that had been absent from the first murder was he losing control had he found the killing more exciting than the sex peabody came back in security at the front entrance only ive got the disc from last night no cams in corridors or elevators okay lets talk to the neighbor o o notifying next of kin never got easier it never became routine eve stood with peabody on the small square stoop outside the small square duplex there were red and white geraniums arranged in a cheerful chorus line on either side of the entrance and a frill of white curtains framing the front window behind them the neighborhood was quiet as a church with its greenleafed trees and little gardens and narrow tidy streets she didnt understand the suburbs with their regimental order and boxy yards and useless fences nor did she understand why so many considered a house in the burbs as a kind of mecca they would someday reach in her mind everyone would someday reach a coffin too she rang the bell and heard the three chimes that echoed inside when the door opened and she said what needed to be said nothing would ever be the same in this house again the woman who answered was pretty and blonde it was the woman from the dresser photograph must be the mother eve saw the resemblance immediately mrs lutz yes though she smiled it was a quick reflex action and her eyes were both puzzled and distracted may i help you im lieutenant dallas eve offered her badge nypsd this is my aide officer peabody may we come in whats this about the woman lifted a hand to brush at her hair and the first sign of nerves showed in the faint tremor its about your daughter mrs lutz its about grace may we come in grace shes not in any trouble is she the smile tried to spread but only fell away from her face my gracies never in trouble so it had to be done in the doorway with the bright flowers a soldiers guard mrs lutz im sorry to tell you grace is dead her eyes went blank she is not there was a crack of irritation in her voice of course shes not what a terrible thing to say i want you to go away right now i want you to go away from here eve braced a hand on the door before it closed in her face mrs lutz grace was killed last night im the primary investigator and im very sorry for your loss you need to let us in now my grace my baby eve said nothing now but slid an arm around the womans waist the door opened into the living area with a plump blue sofa and two sturdy chairs eve led her to the sofa sat beside her is there someone we can call for you mrs lutz your husband george george is at school he teaches at the high school grace she looked around blindly as though her daughter might walk into the room peabody make the call youve made a mistake havent you mrs lutz gripped eves hand with frozen fingers thats all youve just made a mistake grace works in the city at the library on fifth avenue ill just call her and well all feel much better mrs lutz theres no mistake there has to be george and i went into the city only sunday and took her to dinner she was fine the anger and shock were breaking down so tears flooded through them she was fine i know im sorry what happened to my baby was there an accident there wasnt an accident grace was murdered its just not possible her head shook as if gently tugged sidetoside with invisible strings its just not possible eve let her weep she knew that first roll of grief flattened everything else hes on his way peabody murmured good get her some water or something she sat beside the sobbing woman scanning the living area there were books here displayed like treasures on shelves there was a quiet order to everything and the sturdiness of solid middleclass living a framed hologram of grace stood on a table what happened to my baby eve shifted looked into mrs lutzs shattered face last night grace met a man shed been corresponding with by email and in chat rooms we believe this man doctored her drink or drinks during the evening with a substance known to be used in date rapes oh god mrs lutz wrapped her arms around her belly and began to rock oh my god evidence indicates that he returned with her to her apartment continued to give her illegals until she overdosed she would never take illegals we dont believe she was aware mrs lutz he gave them to her because he wanted to she pressed her lips together in a tight white line then breathed out one long ragged sound he raped her we suspect thats true i how far did you go eve wondered how much could you help mrs lutz if its any comfort to you grace wouldnt have been afraid she wouldnt have been in pain why would anyone hurt her what kind of person does that to an innocent young girl i cant tell you but i can tell you ill find him i need you to help me mrs lutz laid her head back what can i do if shes gone did she have any boyfriends robbie robbie dwyer they dated in high school and a bit in the first few semesters of college hes a nice boy his mother and i belong to the same book club her voice wavered i suppose wed hoped more would come of it but it was more friendship than romance grace wanted to move to the city and robbie got a job teaching here they drifted apart how long ago did they drift if youre thinking robbie would do this anything like this youre wrong ive known him since he was a baby anyway hes seeing a very nice girl now did she ever talk about anyone she was interested in or who was interested in her in the city no not really she worked very hard and she was studying as well shes shy my gracies shy its hard for her to meet new people thats why i encouraged her to move to she broke down again george wanted her to stay here to teach and stay in the nest i pushed her out just little nudges because i wanted her to fly now ive lost her will you take me to her when george gets here will you take us to our baby yes ill take you to her o o commander whitney was on the link when he motioned eve into his office he didnt gesture to a chair nor did she make any move to sit his wide face was creased with lines a map that showed the routes of stress battles and authority his suit was a rich coffee color nearly the same tone as his skin in it he looked both beefy and tough a combination eve had always thought that made him appear as natural behind a desk as he did in the field a fluted bowl sat on the right corner of his desk it was filled with cerulean water with smooth colored stones shimmering in the base while she puzzled over it she caught the quick flash of scarlet my wife whitney said when he ended the call she thinks it cheers up the office supposed to relax me what the hell am i supposed to do with a damn fish i couldnt say sir for a moment both of them studied the red streak that circled the bowl knowing the commanders wife was keen on fashion and decor eve searched for a polite comment its fast crazy thing spins around like that most of the day i get tired just looking at it at that rate itll probably wear itself out and die within a couple weeks your mouth to gods ear wheres your aide lieutenant ive got her running crosschecks on the two victims weve found no evidence to support a relationship between them they both liked books poetry in particular both spent time in cyberrooms at this point we cant place them in the same chat or club at the same time he sat back what have you got the acrossthehall neighbor of lutzs angela nicko found the body this morning they had a regular morning coffee date and when lutz didnt show didnt answer her door ms nicko was concerned enough to open the door with her spare key nicko is a retired librarian well into her nineties and had cried eve thought wearily cried silent tears while shed given her statement at this point she appears to be the only resident of the apartment building the victim had regular contact with lutz is described as a quiet polite young woman who rarely varied her routine she went to work she came home twice a week she stopped in the neighborhood market for supplies other than nicko she had no close friends no lovers she was doing a parttime inhome course to get her degree in library science the security cams one at entrance as trace evidence at the first scene confirmed the suspect wears a disguise were assuming he was doing so again im waiting for lab reports his appearance was markedly different in the second murder short straight blonde hair lanternjaw wide brow dark brown eyes pale gold complexion eve stared at the fish it was making her dizzy but she couldnt look away there was a different attitude as well a deliberation and a pleasure in the violence that wasnt apparent in the first killing were working to trace the first wig the enhancements were also pursuing the cyberangle and continue to look for another connection between the victims ive requested a consult with dr mira and am copying her all files and reports to date the media hasnt yet sniffed out the connection but we wont keep it that way for long in this case sir the media might be an advantage if women are made aware of the potential dangers the suspects pool gets shallow id like to leak some of the data to nadine furst at channel seventyfive he pursed his lips make sure the leak doesnt become a flood before were ready for it yes sir i have some more sources on the illegals angle and ive asked feeney to use his contacts within the department in that area neither drug is common when i find the supplier i may need room to deal well work that out when you find the supplier but i can tell you there wont be much room politically these illegals are a hot button we go soft on a supplier well have feminists organizations social balance and moral watchdog groups taking numbers to kick us in the teeth and if dealing with the supplier saves lives for a lot of these people that wont matter they deal in principles not individuals work the angles lieutenant do the checklist and get this bastard before we have more dead and a public relations nightmare eve didnt give a rats skinny ass about public relations since this wasnt a wellkept secret it was no surprise that nadine expressed some suspicion at being offered inside data what kind of happy bullshit is this dallas eve had waited deliberately until she was home rather than at central to contact nadine it seemed to her that made the exchange friendly rather than official im doing you a favor nadine already polished for an onair segment lifted one perfectly arched brow let her coralslicked mouth curve you lieutenant locked lips are going to of your own free will and out of a sense of camaraderie give me data on an ongoing investigation thats right just a minute nadines face disappeared from the link screen for ten seconds just wanted to check with the meteorologist it appears despite indications to the contrary hell has not frozen over pardon me while i fall into an uncontrollable fit of giggles you want the data or not yeah i want it a top police source confirms that the investigations of the bryna bankhead and the grace lutz cases are linked hold on everything about nadine sharpened as she leaped into full reporter mode theres been no confirmation to this point as to whether the bankhead death was accidental selftermination or homicide its homicide confirmed my information is that the lutz murder was sexual homicide nadines voice was brisk now all business is that the case in the bankhead homicide did the victims know each other and are we dealing with one suspect dont interview me nadine this isnt a oneonone both victims were young single women who on the night of their deaths met with an individual they had corresponded with via email and online chat rooms what kind of chat rooms where did they meet shut up nadine evidence indicates that both victims were given an illegal substance possibly without their knowledge during the evening a date rape drug youre quick your source neither denies nor confirms that information take the freebie nadine and run with it thats all you get for now i can get out of here in ninety minutes ill meet you wherever you want not tonight ill let you know where or when wait if it had been possible nadine would have burst through the link screen give me something on the suspect do you have a description a name all avenues of investigation are being vigorously pursued blah blah blah eve broke transmission on nadines curse satisfied she walked into the kitchen ordered coffee then just stood by the window looking out at the gathering dark he was out there now somewhere did he already have another date was he even now making himself into some hopeful womans fantasy tomorrow the next day would there be other friends more family she would have to shatter the lutzes would never fully recover theyd go on with their lives and after a while they wouldnt think of it every minute of every day theyd laugh again work shop breathe in and out but there would always be a hole just a little hollow inside their lives theyd been a family a unit shed sensed that unification in the house in the comfort and clutter of it in the flowers outside the door and the easy give of the sofa now rather than parents they were survivors those who survived lived forever with that echo of what was gone sounding inside their heads theyd kept her room eve thought now while her coffee sat in the autochef going cold when shed gone through it looking for something anything to add to the sum of grace lutz shed seen the stages of a life from child to young girl to young woman dolls carefully arranged on a shelf decoration now rather than toys but still treasured books photographs holograms trinket boxes in the shapes of hearts or flowers the bed had had a canopy the color of sunbeams and the walls had been virgin white eve couldnt imagine growing up there in all that sweet girlish fuss ruffled curtains at the windows the inexpensive minicomputer on the desk that had been decorated with daisies to match the shade on the bedside lamp the girl whos slept in that bed read by that lamplight had been happy secure and loved eve had never had a doll nor curtains at the windows thered been no precious little pieces of girlhood to tuck away in heartshaped boxes the childhood rooms she remembered were cramped anonymous boxes in cheap hotels where the walls were thin and often too often things skittered in dark corners the air smelled stale and there was no place to hide no place to run if he came back and wasnt drunk enough to forget you were there the girl who had slept in those beds trembled in those shadows had been terrified desperate and lost she jolted as a hand touched her shoulder and instinctively reached for her weapon as she spun around steady lieutenant roarke ran his hand down her arm rested it lightly on her weapon hand as he studied her face where were you trying to make a circle she eased away from him opened the autochef for her coffee i didnt know you were home i havent been for long he laid his hands on her shoulders now rubbed at the tension did you have a memory flash she shook her head sipped the cold coffee continued to stare out the window into the dark but she knew if she didnt rid herself of it it could fester when you were gone she began i had a dream a bad one he wasnt dead he was covered with blood but he wasnt dead he talked to me he said id never kill him never get away she saw roarkes reflection in the glass saw her own merging with it he had to punish me he got up blood was pouring out of him but he stood up and he came for me he is dead eve roarke took the cup out of her hand set it aside then turned her to face him he cant hurt you except in dreams he said to remember what hed told me but i cant i dont know what he meant but i asked him why he hurt me he said because i was nothing and no one but most of all he hurt me because he could i cant seem to take that power away from him even now i cant you diminish him every time you stand for a victim maybe the further away you get from him in reality the harder it is to pull back in dreams i dont know he skimmed his fingers through her hair will you talk to mira i dont know no she corrected she cant tell me anything i dont know are ready to know roarke thought and let it be anyway i need her for a consult on the murders another yeah so ive got to put more hours in was it the same man she didnt answer but wandered back into her office she didnt want the coffee after all instead she kept moving let it all play through her head as she gave him the basic details of the second murder if theres a local source for the illegals used i could track it for you she looked at him elegant in his dark business suit it didnt pay to forget there was a dangerous man inside it one who had once trafficked with other dangerous men roarke industries might have been the most powerful conglomerate in the world but it had been born like its owner in the dark alleys and grim streets of dublins slums i dont want you to do that she told him not yet if charles and feeney both crap out i may tag you but id as soon you didnt make a connection with that particular area my connection would be no different than yours only quicker yeah its different im the one with a badge you know a lot of women lieutenant that portion of my past is a closed book yeah right what im saying is in my experience most guys generally go for a type maybe they like brainy women or subservient women or jocks whatever he moved in on her what type do you suppose i go for you just scooped them up as they fell at your feet so you went for the variety pack i definitely dont recall you falling at my feet and dont hold your breath on that one you dont count so much because youd never have to go fishing in the cyberpool for a date or sex or anything youre not making that sound complimentary but what im saying is people generally have expectations or fantasy types date number one savvy sophisticated urban female with a romantic bent slick dresser sharp looker snappy apartment sexually active when she can get it outgoing friendly she likes fashion poetry and music spends her money on clothes good restaurants salons may or may not be looking for mr right but would really enjoy a mr right now and roarke put in is adventurous enough to audition a candidate over drinks exactly date number two solid middleclass suburban background shy quiet intellectual hoards what money she has to buy books pay the rent on an efficiency apartment rarely eats out and spends fifteen or twenty minutes every morning with a female neighbor old enough to be her grandmother she has no other close friends in the city shes very young and still a virgin shes looking for a soul mate the one man shes saved herself for and is naive enough to believe shes found him without ever having met him one is introverted the other extroverted physically they are nothing alike in the first case the murder appeared to have been unplanned and the killer panicked there were no signs of violence on the body that were inflicted premortem sexual activity was vaginal only she picked up a disc from her file slid it into her computer in the second case the murder appeared to have been premeditated and the killer was deliberate in the execution there were signs of violence bruises small bites the victim was repeatedly and roughly raped and sodomized it could be theorized that he became encouraged aroused intrigued by the first murder and decided to have the experience again purposefully more aggressively this time as the act excited him with a nod roarke walked over to stand with her it could be image on wall screen eve ordered ive done a split screen with the security cam feed from the entrance of each victims building thats bankhead on the right we know the killer is wearing a wig face putty and makeup with this look he goes by the name dante on the left is lutz and there he goes by dorian the face jobs are good body type height more or less the same each can be altered easily enough lifts padding in the shoulders shed already studied the images over and over she knew what she was seeing now note how dante holds her hand kisses her fingers holds the door open for her the perfect dream date dorians got his arm around her waist shes looking up at him starryeyed as they approach the door hes not looking at her no eye contact it doesnt matter to him who she is shes already dead she switched images here dantes coming out you can see the panic the sweat christ hes thinking how did this happen how will i get out of it but you see here the exit from graces place the way he strolls out almost a swagger the way he looks back and smirks hes thinking that was fun when can i do it again the first theory would hold roarke commented hes building confidence and need and pleasure a second would be he has different personalities for different looks for different women but youve a third theory roarke looked away from the screen looked at eve you think youre after two men maybe its too simple maybe its what he wants me to think she sat stared at the split screen again i cant get inside him i ran a probability on two killers it came in just over fortythree percent computers dont have instincts he came over to sit on the edge of the desk what do you see different body language different styles different types but it could be roleplaying maybe hes an actor drinks at an expensive romantic location then the return to the victims apartment he doesnt dirty his own nest candles wine music roses so he uses the same staging i havent got the results back on dna but the sweepers didnt find any fingerprints but the victims and her neighbors in grace lutzs apartment not on the wine bottle or the glasses and not on her body he sealed this time why is that when he knew wed have prints from the first murder if there are two in reality or by personality split they know each other intimately brothers of a sort roarke said when eve looked over partners and this is a game and theyd keep score one each theyd need a tiebreaker im going to set up here to monitor some of the chat rooms where one of the screen names popped before do it from my office my equipments faster and theres more of it plus he added knowing she was trying to think of a reason to refuse i can give you the list of the wine purchases can you crossreference that with purchases of castillo di vechio cabernet fortythree i can he agreed pulling her to her feet if somebody keeps me company and has a glass of wine with me one glass she said and moved over into his office with him i may be at this for a while just plug in the locations you want to monitor on this unit she skirted the long black console stood for a moment in front of one of his several sleek units i have to get them from the file computer access unit six eve he perused the wine bottles in the rack behind his office bar just enter the file name you want he told eve and request copy is there any point in saying that i keep official nypsd data on my home unit and you have no authorization to access that data none whatsoever something light i think ah this he drew out a bottle turned chuckled at her scowling face why dont we have a bite to eat while were at it remind me to rag on you later he opened the bottle ill make a note of it chapter seven she sipped wine nibbled on caviar and tried not to think how ridiculous it was if anyone from central caught wind of it shed never live it down roarke did the same and prepared to enjoy it key in the screen names you want to watch for dantenyc she said doriannyc feeneys running names ending with nyc but yes we can run another search youll end up with millions i imagine but we might get lucky what about the account name he may cruise with other screen names or ditch the old ones when hes done here nudge over he scooted her chair a few inches to the left then sat beside her computer run continuous search for all activity under account name la belle dame beginning search feeney said you had to go through the privacy blocks and account protocol in order to she trailed off lifted her glass when roarke merely quirked his eyebrows in her direction never mind computer notify if and when activity under said account takes place and locate source of activity search in process notification will be given working it cant be that simple not usually no he leaned over and kissed her arent you lucky to have me a rhetorical question darling he said and stuffed caviar into her mouth just let me put that consumer list onscreen he did so manually with a few deft taps on a keyboard eve watched them scroll on blew out a breath it could be worse she decided it could have been cheap wine then wed have oh a hundred times as many names more than that i imagine we can break these down into individual sales and restaurant orders now well see what we can find on the cabernet is that your label too no a competitors but there are ways this will take a few minutes because she thought it slightly tacky for a member of the nypsd to sit and watch a civilian severely bend the law she rose and wandered closer to the wall screen computer display single male consumers on screen four that whittled it down some more she noted she couldnt and wouldnt discount the restaurant the female and the joint accounts but shed start with the two hundred recorded sales to single men computer display screen five multiple purchases of product by single men better she mumbled as the number went down by another eightysix you got that data yet patience lieutenant he glanced up then just looked at her in a way that made her skin tingle and her thigh muscles go loose what youre such a study standing there all cop cooleyed and grim with your weapon strapped on it makes my mouth water with a half laugh he went back to work baffles me here you are split on screen three do you say that sort of thing to get me stirred up no but its a pleasant side benefit youre also quite a study when youre stirred up my red edged out the competitions red by a few hundred sales in the area over the past twelve months big surprise she said sourly and turned around to repeat the same breakdown computer cross and match all consumer purchases of both brands in given time period less than thirty she pursed her lips i figured more label loyalty well start with these standard run eliminate males over fifty for a start our guy or guys are younger then i have to refactor could be daddy who buys the wine or uncle or big brother or she added glancing back at the screen with joint accounts mom and dad but i dont think so she began to pace i need miras profile but i just dont think so seems to me its not romantic its not sexual if your parent or parents buy the wine then youre a child again and youre by christ a man and you can prove it you can pluck a woman right out of the pack she continued pick of the litter and your choice women are merciless from the poem theyll crush you if you give them the chance so you wont youre in charge this time she stared at the names moved away from them then back again women bitches whores goddesses you desire them sexually but more than that you want power absolute power over them so you plan hunt select youve seen her but she hasnt seen you you have to see her have to make absolutely certain she is attractive enough that she hasnt created the fantasy of herself the same way youve created yourself she has to be real she has to be worthy you wouldnt waste your time on anyone or anything thats less than you deserve fascinated roarke sat back what does he do he selects he arranges he seduces with words with images then he prepares the wine one that suits his taste his mood no one elses candles scented to please his senses the illegals so that he has control he wont be refused more hell be desired desperately desired is it about sex she shook her head still studying names desire thats different to be desired by his choice thats as vital as his control over her she must want him he goes to too much trouble to make himself an object of desire for it to be only about control and power he has a need to be the focus the center because its his moment his game his victory his pleasure roarke added yes his pleasure but he needs her to think its hers as well he stands at the mirror and makes himself into what hed like to be and what he believes a woman wants dashing sexy stunningly handsome but elegant the kind of man who quotes poetry and woos with roses the kind who makes that woman believe shes the only woman maybe he believes it or did with the first one maybe he deluded himself into believing it was romance but under its calculation hes a predator men are she glanced back thats right humans are but sexually men are more basic sex is more easily viewed as a function where women in general prefer an emotional rush along with it these women did and he was aware of it he took the time to know them first to discover their weaknesses and their fantasies so he could play on both then he controlled them like a droid only they were flesh and blood they were real so the thrill was real when it was over they were spoiled hed made them whores again so they stopped being worthy hell need to find the next you were wrong when you said you couldnt get inside him i wonder how you can be so much what you are and still look so clearly so coldly through the eyes of the mad and the vicious because i wont lose i cant lose or they all win right back to my father i know it he rose walked to her wrapped his arms tight around her ive never been sure if you did notification of activity account la belle dame eve jerked her body free whirled screen name of user and location of activity user name oberonnyc location cyber perks fifth avenue at fiftyeighth she was running for the door when roarke pulled it open ill drive he told her she didnt bother to argue any one of his vehicles would be faster than hers she grabbed her communicator on the race down the steps dispatch this is dallas lieutenant eve detailing orders she snagged her jacket and headed out the front door it took them six minutes and twentyeight seconds from the notification to roarkes swing to the curb in front of cyber perks she timed it and she was leaping out of the car before the brakes stopped squealing at a run she spotted the blackandwhite and the uniforms shed ordered no one leaves she snapped flipping out her badge then sliding it shield out into the waistband of her trousers the noise blasted her the instant she walked through the doors cyberpunk rolled like a tidal wave swamping the voices of patrons and beating violently against eardrums it was a world shed yet to explore and it was jammed elbow to groin with a motley throng who sat at counters tables cubes or airskated between stations but even in the stupendous confusion she saw the order freaks with their painted hair and tongue rings were strewn across a section of colorcoded table space the geeks earnest faces and sloppy shirts were huddled in cubes giggly teenage girls skated in herds and pretended not to notice the packs of teenage boys they sought to allure there were students most of whom were gathered in the cafe area trying to look sophisticated and world weary pocketed with them were a smatter of the standard urban revolutionaries uniformed in sleek black which students worshiped scattered throughout were the tourists the travelers the casual clientele who sought the atmosphere the experience or were simply scoping out the place as a possible fresh hangout where would her man fit tracking the room she strode to the glass kiosk marked data center three drones in red uniforms sat on swivel chairs in the center of the tower and worked consoles they kept up what appeared to be a running conversation through headphones eve zoned in on one tapped on the glass the boy with a smattering of fresh pimples on his chin looked up he shook his head attempted to look stern and authoritative and gestured to the headphones on eves side of the glass she shoved them on dont touch the tower he ordered in a voice that was just waiting to crack stay behind the green line at all times there are open units in the cafe if you prefer there is currently one cube available if you wish to reserve a unit for kill the music what his eyes darted like nervous birds stay behind the green line or ill call security kill the music eve repeated then slapped her badge on the glass now but but i cant im not allowed whatzamatter charlie he whipped around in his chair and all hell broke loose the roar that burst out of the crowd outdid even the computergenerated ferocity of the music people leaped off stools out of cubes screaming shouting cursing a wave of them charged the data kiosk like peasants storming the kings palace full of fear and fury and blood lust even as she reached for her weapon she took a wayward elbow on the chin that rapped her head back against the kiosk and exploded a fountain of white sizzling stars in front of her eyes and that seriously pissed her off she kneed a greenhaired freak in the groin stomped hard on the instep of a wailing geek then fired three blasts at the ceiling it served to stop most of the momentum though several bodies tumbled or were simply flung in the general direction of the kiosk nypsd she shouted it holding up badge and weapon kill that fucking music now everybody back off go back to your seats or stations immediately or youll be charged with rioting assault and creating a public hazard not all of it got through and some of her orders were lost in the swarm of voices and threats but the more civic minded or cowardly slunk back one of the teenage girls lay sprawled at eves feet airskates tangled she was bleeding from the nose and weeping in jerky hiccoughs youre okay eve nudged her as gently as she could with her foot sit up now the shouts from various sections were gaining strength again civic duty and cowardice wouldnt hold on for long against mob passion nothing will be resolved until i have order until i have quiet this is a guaranteed virusfree zone someone shouted i want to know what happened i want to know whos responsible so apparently did a number of other people roarke cleaved his way through the crowd like eve thought as she watched him a sleek blade slicing through a jumble of rock a virus was uploaded into the system he said softly corrupted the units all of them and from all appearances simultaneously youve got a couple hundred very angry people on your hands yeah i got that part get out of here call for backup im not leaving you in here and dont waste your breath let me talk to them while you call in the troops before she could argue he began to speak he didnt raise his voice it was a good technique eve thought as she slipped out her communicator a lot of people stopped yelling to try to hear what he was saying she could hear him fine but she didnt understand half the cyberspeak he was rattling off lieutenant dallas i have a situation at cyber perks fifth avenue and require immediate assistance as she detailed the circumstances she watched another portion of the mob quiet slip back to tables by her head count they were down to about fifty hard cases spearheaded by the revolutionaries who were blathering about conspiracies and cyberwars and communication terrorists it was time she decided to change tactics again she zeroed in on one man black shirt black jeans black boots with a shock of gilded deliberately disordered hair eve stepped up in his face maybe you didnt hear me tell you to go back to your table or station this is a public place its my civil right to stand and speak and its within my authority to deny you that right when you use it to incite a riot when you or anyone claiming that right is responsible for bodily harm or property damage she gestured to the young girl who sat up still weeping quietly as a friend mopped at the blood on her face they look like terrorists to you or him she jerked a thumb back to where the boy shed spoken to had his terrified white face pressed against the kiosk glass pawns are used and discarded yeah and kids get hurt because people like you want to masturbate your ego in public the nypsd is nothing but a soiled tool used by the hands of the rightwing bureaucrats and demigods to crush the will and freedom of the common man come on stay on target is it communication terrorists and cyberwar or is it bureaucratic demigods you cant cover all the bases at one time tell you what you go sit down and ill have somebody come over to listen to all your fascinating theories but right now there are some people in here who require medical assistance youre hampering that and my investigation of what transpired here tonight he smirked at her always a mistake why dont you finish violating my civil rights and arrest me okay shed already planned her move and had him cuffed before he could think to resist next she asked very pleasantly even as backup streamed in the door he was shouting again as she passed him to a uniform not bad roarke commented for the soiled tool of rightwing demigods thanks i need time to reestablish some order she scanned the faces hes not here anymore no roarke agreed hes not here id say he was out before your uniforms arrived why dont i talk to the data crunchers see what i can find out for you appreciate it she interviewed and released the injured first then sprang the undertwenty and overfifty crowd outoftowners came next then the remaining women even as she took data formed impressions listed names she was certain her bird had flown left with staff she set them in the cafe and joined roarke at a private cube the monitor of the unit was like every other shed seen swimming with chaotic colors and strange symbols beside it was a tall mug of some fancy coffee mixture is this the source she asked him it is yes ill need to dont touch anything she grabbed his wrist dont touch anything she repeated then signalled a uniform i need a cs kit weve only got minis in the patrols thatll do then officer rinksy she added scanning his nameplate you can inform the guy in charge around here that this joint is closed by order of the nypsd until further notice wont that be fun with surprising cheer rinksy walked off to get the kit i wasnt roarke said when she turned back to him going to touch anything this is hardly my first day on the job lieutenant dont get pissy and its my job not yours how do you know this is the source he circled his fingers examined his manicure im sorry he smiled absently did you say something im just biding time waiting to take my lovely wife home when she finishes work jeez okay okay sorry i jumped on you im a little tense would you tell me since youre so brave and strong and smart how you know this is the source that wouldve sounded better if you hadnt had your lip curled but itll do i know this is the source because by tracking through the central system i traced the virus to its starting point this unit was the first infected and the virus was programmed to selfclone and i suspect slither into central spread to all interfaced units then erupt in a nearly simultaneous burst its very clever great rinksy stepped up beside her again your kit lieutenant thanks she took the kit opened it she coated her hands with sealit first then passed the can to roarke dont touch anything yet she took out a wand shined its pencilthin beam and washed cool blue light over the coffee mug gotta good thumbprint yeah partial index finger you got your palm unit on you always can you access the casefile i need to compare these latents while he did as she asked eve shined the light over the table surface too many prints she mused most of them smeared lieutenant roarke held out a small printout of the casefile prints she grunted then held the printed copy against the latent on the mug thats our boy hold on using the wand she picked up the mug balanced it with a sealed finger on the base then poured the coffee mixture into an evidence bag why do people screw up perfectly good coffee with all that froth and flavors she sealed the bag then tipped the cup into a second sealed that question ask it how did he know we were coming he had to know thats why he uploaded the virus we were here minutes after notification but he tagged us dumped the germ and danced how i have a theory but id prefer exploring it a bit first she shifted her weight exploring how i need to open this unit she debated strict procedure meant she could and likely should roust either feeney or mcnab and haul them over to check out the unit on site or she could call in another edd tech but roarke was here if hed been a cop hed have been commanding edd by this time consider yourself field drafted as an expert consultant civilian ive always liked the ring of that he slid a small case out of his inside pocket then wiggled his sealed fingers im touching things now he used a microdrill and had the casing removed in seconds then he let out a little hmmm and began to probe there are three system levels in this club he said conversationally this is the highest level and costs from one to ten dollars a minute depending on the number of functions utilized her stomach sank is this your club it is yes he continued to work hooking his ppc to the unit with a hairthin cable but thats neither here nor there unless you consider that youll have no bitching and moaning from the owner about tonights little adventure or the impounding of this unit as evidence he glanced up once just a sweep of her face with those amused blue eyes less paperwork for you you know how those rightwing bureaucratic demigods are they feed on paperwork youve a bruise gathering on your jaw yeah she rubbed her thumb over the ache shit hurt i bit my tongue that hurts more you nothing major this system is corrupted and very thoroughly clever boy he reflected clever clever boy youll need to run a full diagnostic but it appears you have a toplevel tech on your hands and one who believes in being prepared it isnt a simple matter to rig a public unit to notify a user of a search on his account he had a portable scanner highly sensitive id say interfaced it very cautious very smart can you get around it eventually the units in this club are designed quite well to shut down and lock at any attempt at contamination theres an internal detector and filtering system as backup despite that he managed to upload a virus that wiped this unit and every other in here and it did it in minutes after detecting a shield notification she leaned back you sound impressed oh i am considerably impressed your man has a brilliant talent a pity really that hes as corrupt and worthless as this unit yeah breaks my heart she stood up im going to spring the staff have the unit impounded and sent to edd once were cleared out i want a look at security lets see what he looked like tonight o o he looked eve decided smug she caught it in the way his eyes drifted over the crowd dismissing smirking even while he kept a pleasant inoffensive smile on his face he walked through the crowd kept himself removed from them no contact no casual greetings and moved directly to the cube that put his back to the wall and kept his view of the room unobstructed hes been here before eve noted none of the staff had been able to confirm that then again the manager had been so flustered not by the police intervention not even by the nearriot but she remembered by the realization that roarke was in the club that hed had a hard time sputtering out his own name the unit and cube had been reserved under the name r w emerson an alias she had no doubt and the name shed learned after a quick run of a longdead poet his hair was a smooth warm brown mane tonight and he wore squareframed glasses of tinted amber she supposed his attire was casual trendy with the dark pegged pants the ankle boots the long hipswishing shirt in the same amber hue as his lenses there was a gold cuff bracelet on his right wrist and a curve of winking studs along the shell of his ear he ordered the coffee first made a call on his pocket link then he drank a little while he continued to watch the room hes making sure the environments stable eve said and hes hunting tracking the women considering them you can message to any other unit in the club right isnt that one of the deals why people go instead of just staying home and scoping the net in peace another way of socializing roarke confirmed excitingly anonymous even voyeuristic you message a unit across the room can watch their reaction decide if you want to take it to the next step and make personal contact units are equipped with a standard privacy shield for those who dont want to be disturbed or hit on she watched her suspect log on and choose manual instead of voice mode there roarke touched her arm then ordered the screen to zoom in to enlarge a sector the scanner she saw what looked like a small slim silver business card case he drew a thin retractable cable out of the corner plugged it into the side port of the unit oh he is very very good ive never seen one that compact roarke told her odds are he made it himself i wonder think about your researchanddevelopment potential later she ordered bang hes made us his body went rigid his face slack he didnt look so smug and superior in that instant he looked shocked and he looked scared the eyes behind the fashionable lenses were jittery as they darted around the room he pulled the scanner out then curled over the keyboard with the earnest devotion and intensity of the classic compugeek coding in the virus roarke said quietly hes sweating but he knows what hes doing uploading it he was shaking he rubbed the back of his hand repeatedly over his lips but he sat where he was his gaze glued to the monitor then he was up leaving his barely touched coffee and hurrying for the door recklessly enough to run into tables bump into people he was nearly running by the time he made the door eve saw him swing his body to the right before he disappeared and the door closed behind him out out and gone in what under two minutes bolted a good minute before the uniforms responded and arrived on scene ninetyeight seconds by the clock roarke concurred hes fast hes very fast yeah hes fast but hes shook he was heading uptown and he was running scared for home chapter eight it took him nearly an hour to stop shaking an hour two whiskeys and the calmer lucias added to the second drink it shouldnt have happened it shouldnt have been possible pull yourself together kevin lucias took out a cigarette hed laced with just a whiff of zoner he lighted it crossed his ankles and think how did it happen they managed to dig under to the account name the shielded account name irritably lucias pulled in smoke you told me that would take them weeks i underestimated them obviously annoyance shimmered over nerves it cant be traced back to us in any case but even having the account name how could they trace me to that location and so quickly the police dont have the facilities the manpower the equipment to surveil every cyberclub in the city and every unit in them then there are the matters of the privacy blocks the standard one and the ones i implemented lucias drew in smoke then expelled it in a lazy stream what are the odds they just got lucky nil kevin said between his teeth they used both superior equipment and a superior tech he shook his head why in gods name would anybody with those skills settle for a cops salary in the private sector he or she could name any price it takes all kinds doesnt it well this is exciting exciting i might have been caught arrested charged with murder the zoner as always was doing the job but you werent willing to placate lucias leaned over patted kevins knee however smart and skilled they are were more so youd anticipated this sort of possibility and prepared for it you infected an entire club very sweet youll be headlined in the media again he sighed more points for you theyll have me on security cam kevin inhaled slowly exhaled slowly in many ways lucias was his drug of choice and his approval smoothed over the worst of the nerves i might not have altered my look if i hadnt been using a club so close by fate lucias began to laugh and drew an answering grin from his friend its really just fate isnt it and all on our side really kev it just gets better and better youll take care of the account generate another yes yes thats no problem kevin shrugged that off there was nothing he couldnt do with electronics theyve made a great many details public lucias the chat rooms the setup we may want to stop for a time just when its getting interesting i dont think so the higher the risk the greater the thrill now at least we know weve pitted ourselves against an adversary or adversaries that are worthy of our efforts it adds such a flavor savory i could keep the account open kevin mused send out some decoys ah lucias slapped a hand on the arm of his chair now youre in the game just think of it think of when you have your rendezvous tomorrow night why you and the lovely lady can discuss this recent horror over drinks she shivers delicately over the fate of her doomed sisters never knowing shes fated to join them god its delicious yes the whiskey and the drug cruised inside him turned the air he breathed into soft liquid it does add to the thrill one thing for certain were not bored amused now kevin reached over to take a hit from the laced cigarette and unlikely to be for some time i know just what ill wear tomorrow just how ill look shes so sexy moniqua even her name reeks of sex he hesitated hating to disappoint i dont know if i can go through to the end of it lucias i dont know if i can kill her you can you will one doesnt drop back a level of achievement he smiled when he spoke think of it kevin youll know the whole time youre touching her naked body while you bury yourself in her that youll be the last one to do so that your dick pumping inside her is the last thing shell ever know kevin went hard thinking of it i suppose theres something to be said for the fact shell die happy luciass laughter bounced cold around the room o o since she was always trying to lose weight peabody got off the subway six blocks down from the stop nearest eves home she was feeling pretty peppy about meeting at the home office site again where the autochef was a treasure trove of wonders another reason she admitted for the hike sort of penance before the sin it was a solution that appealed to her freeagers sensibilities of course in the tenants of freeagism there was no sin and penance but imbalance and balance but that was really just semantics shed grown up in a big unwieldy family whod believed in selfexpression had a reverence for the earth and the arts and a responsibility to be true to oneself she had known it seemed shed almost always known that to be true to herself she needed to be an urban cop who tried to maintain well balance she supposed she was sort of missing her family right now though the bursts of love and surprise and hell the simplicity of it all maybe she needed to take a few days and go sit in her mothers kitchen eat sugar cookies and soak up some uncomplicated affection because she didnt know what in gods name was wrong with her why she felt so sad and unsettled and dissatisfied she had the one thing shed wanted most in life she was a cop a damn good cop under the direct command of a woman she considered the ultimate in examples shed learned so much in the past year not just about technique not just about procedure but about what made the difference between that good cop and a brilliant one about what separated the ones who wanted to close a case from the ones who took it a level deeper and cared about the victim who remembered them she knew she was getting better at the job every day and she could take pride in that she loved living in new york seeing its face change and shift as you moved from block to block the city was so full she thought of people of energy of action while she could go back and sit in that homey kitchen shed never be content living there again she needed new york she was happy in her little apartment where the space was all her own she had steady comrades good friends a worthy and satisfying career she was dating well sort of dating one of the most incredibly handsome considerate sophisticated men shed ever known he took her to galleries to the opera to amazing restaurants through charles shed been exposed to not just another side of the city but of life and she lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling and wondering why she felt so lonely she needed to pull out of it depression did not run in her family and she wasnt going to be the first to spiral down into it maybe she needed a hobby like glass painting or container gardening holographic photography macrame fuck it it was just that thought in her head when mcnab popped out of the subway glide and all but collided with her hey he took a jerky step back even as she did stuck his hands in his pockets hey could her timing have been worse she wondered she couldnt have walked a little faster a little slower left home five minutes earlier two minutes later they frowned at each other for a moment then had to move or be mowed down by the commuters flooding off the glide and onto the sidewalk so he pulled his hands out of his pockets to adjust the fit of the tiny round sunshades with aqua blue lenses dallas called for the home office deal i got the update sounds like she got some action last night he continued struggling to keep it all mild and easy too bad that creep didnt drop into cyber perk the other night when we were there we mightve made him unlikely try a little optimism shebody try a little reality jerkface wake up on the wrong side of slickboys bed she heard her own teeth grind there is no wrong side of charless bed she said sweetly its a big soft round playpen oh yeah half the circuits in his brains fried at the image of peabody romping naked in some plush sexy bed with someone else thats just the sort of quick repartee ive come to expect from you you must be sharpening your wits on all those bimbos youre bouncing on these days the last bimbo had a doctorate from mit the body of a goddess and the face of an angel we didnt spend much time on witsharpening pig bitch he grabbed her arm as she swung toward roarkes gate im getting fed up with the way you slap at me every time i get within striking distance peabody youre the one who put the brakes on not soon enough she tugged but his grip stayed firm she always underestimated those skinny arms of his it was mortifying to realize the strength in them had her stomach doing cartwheels and as usual youre wrong and youre stupid youre the one who ended things because you couldnt have everything your way right excuse me for objecting to the fact youd roll out of my bed and roll into the whores she rammed a fist into his chest dont call him that you dont know anything about it and if you had one tenth of charless class his charm his consideration youd crawl up to subhuman but since you dont i should thank you for putting the skids on what was a ridiculous embarrassing and revolting mistake on my part by ever letting you lay a hand on me so thanks youre welcome they were panting wildeyed and nose to nose then they were moaning and mouth to mouth they jerked apart still wildeyed that didnt mean anything she managed between gasps right it didnt mean anything so lets do it again he yanked her back sank his teeth greedily into her bottom lip it was she thought dizzying like being shot out of a cannon her ears were ringing her breath and balance gone and all she wanted was to run her hands all over his long bony body she settled for his butt digging her fingers in as if she could twist off a nice little chunk to keep in her pocket he spun her around struggling to get his hands under the stiff starched jacket of her uniform under it he knew her body was a wonder of curves and soft yielding flesh desperate for it he shoved her back through the gate sensors and rapped her smartly against the iron bars ow sorry let me god he buried his mouth against her neck and wondered if he could just slurp her up like ice cream i beg your pardon the voice came from nowhere from everywhere and had them both goggling at each other did you say something she asked no did you officer detective still in midgrope they both slid their eyes to the right and stared at the security panel on the stone pillar summerset his face expressionless stared back out from the view screen i believe the lieutenant is expecting you he said coolly polite if you take a step back from the gate youre less likely to fall through them when theyre opened peabody felt her own face flame like a scorched tomato oh man oh shit she shoved mcnab stepped clear then began to tug her uniform back into place that was just stupid felt good though somehow his kneecaps had become detached so that the first steps he took through the open gate were wobbly and disjointed what the hell peabody just because weve got this chemical reaction doesnt mean we have to act on it it just screws things up he danced in front of her walking backward his long sleek ponytail bobbed from side to side his thin jacket billowed to his knees and was the color of field poppies despite all her good intentions her lips twitched into a smile youre so damn goofy why dont we get a pizza tonight see where it goes we know where it went she reminded him we dont have time to do this now mcnab we dont have time to think about it i think about you all the time that stopped her dead in her tracks it was tough to walk when your heart had bounced to your shoes youre messing me up thats the plan a pizza shebody i know how you are for pizza im on a diet what for the fact that he could ask sincerely had always charmed and baffled her because my ass is approaching the same mass as pluto he circled around her as they hiked up the long curve of the drive come on youve got a great ass its there a guy doesnt have to spend half his time looking for it he gave it an affectionate squeeze earned a narrowed warning look and grinned he knew when he was making headway well just eat and talk no sex maybe ill think about it he remembered what roarke had advised him about romance in a quick dash he loped around the lawn snapped a blossom from an ornamental pear he caught up with peabody at the steps and slid the flower through the top buttonhole of her jacket jeez she muttered but she strode into the house without taking the flower out she was very careful to avoid direct eye contact with summerset and very aware of the heat creeping up her neck as he invited them to go straight up to eves office o o eve stood in the center of the room rocking lightly on her heels as she watched the security tape again the man was smug she thought and aloof he enjoyed casting that amused glance over the crowd in the cybercafe thinking everyone in there was less than he knowing he had a secret but he also dressed to draw attention admiration and envy so those who saw him understood he was more he thought ahead was so cocksure nothing and no one could touch him but when things had gone wrong there was fear and panic she watched the sweat dew on his face as he stared at the monitor in his cube and she could see him easily see him heaving the lifeless body of bryna bankhead off the balcony get rid of the problem she mused the inconvenience the threat then run away she couldnt see him following through the very next night with another woman with deliberate intent and cold blood she turned as peabody and mcnab came in run this guys image front back and sideways she ordered concentrate on the facial structure the eyes shape not color and body type forget the hair odds are its not his you have a bruise on your jaw sir yeah and you have a flower in your buttonhole so we both look stupid dickhead came through on the wigs and enhancements ive got the brand names you chase down outlets on them peabody get me a consumer list crossreference it with the one ive got on the wine roarkes getting me a list of the top shops for men in the city roarke has got it for you he stepped into the office held out a disc good morning class thanks she passed it off to peabody our guy likes the good stuff designer shoes tailored wardrobe what do you call it bespoke roarke supplied while he may purchase directly from london or milan the first suit was definitely british cut he added the second certainly italian hed be likely to patronize some of the highend shops here in new york taking our fashion advisor at his word eve said dryly we run it through see if anything pops unless hes got his own greenhouse hes buying those pink roses from somewhere probabilitys high its in his own neighborhood and im betting that neighborhood is either upper west side or upper east side so we look there first she glanced over momentarily surprised when roarke gave her a mug of fresh hot coffee ive got a consult with mira here in an hour feeneys at central directing the exam of the unit we impounded from cyber perks i want answers i want a trail and i want it today because hes going to move again tonight he has to she turned back to the screen where the killers face sneered out at the crowd hes already got his next target she walked over to a board where shed pinned photographs of both victims the computer images of the killer as hed looked before and after each murder shell be young eve said early to midtwenties shell live alone shell be attractive and intelligent with an affection for poetry shell be romantic and not currently in any serious relationship she lives in the city works in the city hes already seen her studied her on the street or at her job she may have spoken to him and not known he was the man whos been seducing her shes probably thinking about tonight about this date she has with a man whos exactly what shes waited for in a few hours she thinks ill meet him and maybe just maybe she turned away from the board lets keep her alive i dont want to see another face on this board a moment of your time lieutenant roarke gestured to his office stepped out himself before she could put him off look im on the clock here then why waste time he shut the door behind her i can get you those consumer lists have them crossreferenced and complete in a fraction of the time it would take peabody havent you got work considerable yes it would still take me less time he skimmed a fingertip over the bruise on her jaw then lightly along the shallow dent in her chin i find i prefer having my mind fully occupied just now and he added id rather not see another face on your murder board either i intend to do it anyway but i thought you might feel less annoyed if i made the pretense of asking she scowled at him folded her arms pretense yes darling he kissed the bruise and this way as you know what im up to it frees you to have peabody along with you in the field wherever that might be his inhouse communication panel beeped yes a dr dimatto is here to see lieutenant dallas send her up eve ordered do what youre going to do she told roarke but for right now im going with the pretense that i dont know about it whatever works for you im just going to take a minute to set some things up then id like to say hello to louise suit yourself she opened the door glanced back you generally do thats what makes me such a contented man she gave a rude snort and crossed into her office to greet louise she came in fast but eve had rarely seen her move another way she took one look at the coffee in eves hand and smiled yes id love some thanks peabody coffee for dr dimatto anything else we can get you louise stared at the danish mcnab was currently trying to swallow whole is that an apple danish with his mouth stuffed he made some sound a mixture of affirmation pleasure and guilt love one too thanks again eve swept a glance over louises snappy red suit you dont look dressed for seeing patients doc i have a meeting fundraiser diamonds twinkled at her ears when she tilted her head you tend to squeeze out more money when you look like you dont need it go figure in any case thank you peabody mind if i sit she did crossing her legs balancing the plate with the danish expertly on her knee as she took her first sip of coffee she heaved a long sigh before she sipped again where do you get this stuff it has to be illegal roarke naturally she broke off a tidy corner of the danish have you got a reason for dropping by louise other than a little coffee break were a little busy here im sure you are she nodded toward the board i asked about bryna bankhead in my building she knew everyone on her floor and several others she was very well liked shed lived there three years she dated fairly regularly but no one serious i know all that thinking of giving up medicine for police work she lived there for three years louise repeated and the humor had died from her voice ive lived there for two she fell on the sidewalk at my feet id never had a conversation with her feeling guilty over that wont change what happened to her no louise broke off another bite but it made me think and it made me more inclined to work harder to get any information for you that might help your investigation there was a research project at j forrester thats a private fairly exclusive clinic that specializes in sexual dysfunctions relations fertility issues nearly twentyfive years ago j forrester formed a partnership with allegany pharmaceuticals to research study and develop various chemical products that could alleviate dysfunction and enhance performance sexually speaking many top chemists and r and d people were involved or associated with the project testing with elements found in the controlled substances known as whore and wild rabbit those others combinations they did in fact develop the drug trademarked as matigol which has helped extend sexual performance ability in men well past the century mark and the fertility drug compax which allows women to safely conceive and give birth into their fifties should they desire it she nibbled on the danish both these drugs have a very high success rate but are extremely expensive and therefore largely inaccessible to your average consumer but for those who can afford it theyre a miracle do you have the names of the players im not finished she turned her head shot out a sunny smile as roarke walked in good morning louise he went to her lifted her hand to his lips you look lovely as always yeah yeah blah blah what eve demanded what else your wife is rude and impatient thats why i love her by the way lieutenant charles monroe is on his way upstairs what is this a convention but as she spoke she aimed one hard warning look at mcnab his eyes glittered back at her and he managed to hold the look for a good five seconds before he dropped his gaze sulkily you get me some data on j forrester and allegany pharmaceuticals she clenched her jaw which sent it throbbing as she caught the interest flicker over roarkes face damn it i bought out allegany eight no i believe it was ten months ago whats the connection i dont know precisely because the doc heres being coy im never coy louise corrected then her eyes blurred almost as they had when shed taken her first sip of coffee oh well she said as charles walked in my my i guess you want coffee too eve said he nodded i wouldnt say no ill get it flustered flushing floundering peabody escaped into the kitchen roarke mcnab with the second greeting charless practiced smile dimmed slightly then it polished right up again when he aimed it at louise i dont believe weve met louise louise dimatto she offered a hand dont tell me youre a cop doctor you if he heard mcnabs muttered opinion charles ignored it professional companion how interesting can we save the social hour for later well have a damn party everybodys invited eve snapped ill get to you she said to charles finish it out louise where was i oh yes despite the success in development the project and the partnership were dissolved some twenty years ago lack of funds lack of interest and a number of unfortunate side effects from other experimental drugs during that period it was decided that further research using forms of those particular chemicals was both costprohibitive and potentially financially risky due to threats of legal action the decision was largely influenced by dr theodore mcnamara who in essence headed the project and is credited for the discovery of both compax and matigol there were unsubstantiated rumors of abuse and pilfering during the project talk of experimentation not only in the lab but out of it gossip is that some of the suits filed were internal female staff who claimed to have been given drugs without their knowledge or consent and were sexually molested perhaps impregnated while under the influence if its true louise concluded nobody in the know is naming names good work ill follow it up if youve got a meeting ive got a little time ill just finish my coffee if its all the same to you in fact ill just help myself to another half cup she breezed into the kitchen okay charles youre up he nodded at eve grinned intimately at peabody when she brought him his coffee my client believes i wanted this information for another client id like to keep it that way i protect my sources charles and i believe in protecting my clients he returned i need your word that no action will be taken against her if what i tell you ends up exposing her she doesnt interest me and if all shes doing is making herself horny ill make sure she doesnt interest illegals fair enough sex isnt easy for everyone dallas if people didnt want to get off mcnab shot out youd be out of work charles smirked at mcnab true enough if people didnt want to steal cheat maim and kill so would you be detective arent we all lucky human nature keeps us in business eve stepped between the chair where charles sat and the desk where mcnab worked effectively blocking their view of each other give me the dealer charles nobody wants to bust your client carlo they dont use last names she met him in a chat room one on sexual experimentation eve eased onto the corner of the desk is that so about a year ago she said hes changed her life how do the buys work initially shed email him place an order shed pay with an electronic transfer of funds into his account then pick up the delivery at a mail drop at grand central no personal contact none now shes on what she calls a subscription service and receives a regular monthly supply the payment with the subscription discount is automatically transferred from her account to his five thousand a month for a quarter ounce i need to talk to her dallas and heres why i need his account data and anything else she can tell me she does regular business with him so shed have a feel more than that she needs to be put on guard she could be a target shes not he rose as eve came off the desk those are your victims he gestured to the board what are they twenty twentyfive this woman is over fifty shes attractive she takes care of herself but she doesnt have that bloom media reports said they were single lived alone shes married her association with me is a perk like a day at the salon she lives with her husband and her teenage son and being questioned by you on this will embarrass and humiliate her and her family it may also damage her sexual ego louise put in she stood across the room sipping her second cup of coffee the use of the drug and a professional companion have most likely shown some dysfunction in this area exposing her need for them to an authority who could deny and punish her for the first and smirk at her for the second isnt advisable from a medical or psychological standpoint protecting her from that exposure runs the risk of slapping another dead woman on that board let me talk to her again charles asked ill get the information you need better ill open an account with him at my own expense hes only got to do a standard background to verify my license an lcs a reasonable client for sexual illegals get me the data by three oclock eve decided dont do anything else i dont want him to have your name you dont have to worry about me lieutenant sugar just the data charles now go away i need to get along myself thanks for the coffee louise set the cup down glanced at charles want to share a cab perfect he trailed a fingertip over the flower in peabodys buttonhole as he turned for the door ill see you later delia keep it zipped mcnab eve warned peabody roarke is generating some data youll assist in his office which should she hoped keep the peace for a while she glanced at her wrist unit thought of mira ive got a meeting chapter nine she set up in the library because it was quiet and in another section of the house mostly unless it related to a case she liked to remain as oblivious as possible to emotional vibrations but thered been so many of them winging around in her office shed been tempted to duck and cover here the air was smooth and placid she settled down at one of the desks input the fresh data into the file computer factoring new data run probability scan on subject carlo as alias for suspect working probability subject carlo as alias for suspect is ninetysixpointtwo percent yeah thats what i think second run probability subject carlo manufactures illegals he subsequently sells working insufficient data for scan request further input to complete thats where youre wrong she pushed away from the desk to pace on the faded roses on the antique rug he makes it he bottles it he sells it he uses it control its all about control sixty thousand a year from one client for what three ounces of that shit troll the net hook a couple dozen rich marks and youre rolling but its not about the money she stalked to one of the rows of tall arched windows flipped the drape and stared out over the vast blooming estate even for roarke whod been desperately poor achingly hungry it wasnt about the money so much as it was about the game of compiling it having it using it to make more of it and wielding the power of it but this was about neither greed nor need twenty k an ounce and you slip a quarter of that into the first victim after shes alone with you helpless and naked in her apartment after youve already poured more than two ounces of whore into her computer street value illegal whore working hormonibitalsix commonly known as whore street value sixtyfivethousand usd per fluid ounce known street use of this substance is negligible derivative exotica is common street value exotica fifty usd per fluid ounce do you require listing of other common derivatives negative derivatives arent good enough for this guy no clones no substitutes no weak sisters date cost him about a hundred and fifty thousand you could buy ten of the best lcs in new york for that and have a hell of a party but its not about money and its not about sex theyre only factors in the game i wonder why you think you need me mira said from the doorway eve turned thinking out loud so i heard i appreciate you coming out here eve began i know youre busy and so are you i always love coming into this room mira glanced around at the walls of books that dominated the twolevel room civilized luxury she commented youve hurt your face oh eve rubbed her knuckles along her jaw its nothing miras face was eve always thought perfect serene and lovely framed by a smooth sweep of sable hair she wore one of her quiet and elegant suits that looked like it had been formed out of cool fresh limes the long gold chain around her neck was as thick as eves pinky and enhanced with a single creamcolored pearl she smelled of apricots and her skin was baby smooth as she brushed her lips lightly over eves jaw habit she said and her blue eyes smiled easily at the line that formed between eves kissing hurts to make them better shall we sit yeah sure she never quite knew how to handle miras maternal attitude toward her mothers were a mystery with too many of the pieces missing to attempt to form a picture youll want tea id love some because she knew miras habits she programmed for a cup of the fragrant herbal brew mira favored and because she was in her own space eve programmed the second cup for coffee how are you eve im okay still not getting enough sleep mira commented when eve brought her tea i get by on caffeine and nerves how is roarke hes she started to pass it off but this was mira what happened with mick connellys still weighing on him some hes dealing with it but its i dont know its knocked him off stride some grief levels us we go on we do whats necessary but theres a shadow on the heart knowing youre there for him lightens the shadow hes horned in on the investigation and i havent given him as hard a time about it as i probably would have otherwise youre a good team in a number of areas mira sampled the tea approved it i imagine he has some concerns about you standing as primary in this type of investigation sexual homicides ive done them before ill do them again i know how to handle it i agree and from your reports from the thinking aloud i overheard youve already formed your own profile mira slipped a disc out of her bag and now you have mine eve turned the disc in her hand one profile mira sat back watching eve as she sipped her tea two there are two whether individuals or personalities i cant tell you with absolute certainty while multiple personality syndrome is rare except in fiction it does exist i dont think this is mps i read up on it last night she explained when mira looked surprised the same basic method the same basic motivation the same staging but two different styles two different target types he used a condom or spermicide sealed his hands with the second victim but left dna and latents with the first if it was mps thered be more distinction one personality to hunt another to kill one to hunt and kill the other to function normally this is two guys two working together and taking turns at bat im inclined to agree but i cant rule out mps she crossed her legs settling in comfortably to the talk of murder and madness the first murder appears to be accidental or consciously unplanned there is the possibility that the thrill and fear of the first triggered the more deliberate and more violent tone of the second turns at bat is an accurate analogy he or they are game players theres a need here to dominate women to debase them but to do so with what is perceived as style and charm romance and seduction the sexual act is wholly selfish but would be rationalized as mutually satisfying as with the drug the victims would be eager and aggressive more punch because as it happens shes looking at him as a sexual creature a desire because at the core of it hes the focus precisely mira agreed its not rape in the traditional sense which uses force violence or intimidation he doesnt look for fear but for surrender hes smart patient he spends time getting to know them their fantasies their hopes their weaknesses then plays on them and fashions himself into those fantasies pink roses not red for passion not white for purity pink for romance were dealing with two very specific very technical skills computer technology and chemistry i have new data and have run a probability on it its very likely that a third alias is in use for the purpose of selling sexual illegals highend illegals one of these guys knows his drugs how to get them more in my opinion how to create them maybe he risks selling them because its how he makes his living but i think its more i think he feeds on risk agreed mira inclined her head he likes to take chances calculated ones the computer technology is ace when roarkes impressed you can be damn sure the skills earned it is mps going to give one guy two highly developed skills in different areas again not impossible noting the impatience that crossed eves face mira gestured you want a yes or no and i cant oblige you i could give you case studies eve but they wouldnt hold up against your instincts well say two for the sake of argument two individuals one is fanciful lives in his head a great deal his female ideal is sharp and sexy and sophisticated he wants to enthrall her as much as he wants to dominate and conquer her hes a man who can and does become caught up in the moment he sent roses to bankhead at work eve pointed out grace lutz received no roses the second is more calculating more deliberate and potentially more violent he doesnt delude himself to the same extent as the first that this is romance he knows its rape accepts that he wants youth and innocence because he wants to possess then destroy them the second would be the dominant partner yes almost certainly but they do have a symbiotic relationship they need each other not only for the details and the skills but for the reinforcement of ego male to male approval as when arena ball players slap each other on the ass or catch each other in headlocks after a score teamwork i pass you kick and we make the goal yes this is a great game to them mira set her tea aside toyed absently with the pearl on the end of her chain and they need the competition they are defective and brilliant minds with young spoiled boys egos manipulators who didnt learn to be that way overnight they come from money and privilege are used to demanding or taking what they want as they want it and with impunity they deserve it theyd have played games before eve put in nothing to this level theyve worked up to this oh yes one mind or two theyve known each other a very long time and shared a great deal theres a lack of maturity that leads me to believe they may very well be in the same age bracket as their victims early twenties midtwenties at best they dont simply enjoy the finer things they must have them outward appearances eve added the snazzy clothes the status of the wine labels the exclusive venues for the dates mmm status and exclusivity are vital and whats more i think what theyre accustomed to to deny themselves or be denied is intolerable under the sheen of romance is a fear and a hatred for women look for a mother figure who was either dominant and abusive or weak and abused neglectful or overly protective a man particularly in his youth most usually forms opinions and images of women based on his opinion and image of the woman who raised him she thought of roarke and of herself motherless child what if he doesnt know her then he forms them another way but a man who seeks to exploit and hurt and abuse women will certainly have some female figure in his life who these represent to him if i stop one do i stop both if you stop one the other will selfdestruct but he may very well kill on his way down she did what she did when there was too much data too many threads too many angles to all mix and match and tangle she went back to the victim when she used her master to uncode the police seal and unlock bryna bankheads apartment she blanked her mind of facts and opened it to impressions the air was stuffy there was no scent of candlewax or roses now but the faint dusty odor left behind by the sweepers no music no softly glowing light she ordered the lights on full checked that the privacy screen was in place then wandered the room while an airbus rattled across the graying sky beyond the glass strong colors contemporary art and still essentially female the attractive nest of a single woman of very defined style and taste who enjoyed her life and her work a woman young enough that she had yet to form any serious or permanent sexual relationships and confident enough to experiment adventurous enough to form a fanciful attachment with a faceless man over the net shed lived alone both tidily and fashionably but was friendly with her neighbors very eclectic music library eve mused as she flipped through the discs filed orderly in the entertainment unit she came across mavis live and kicking and despite the grim task felt the grin stretch over her face her friend mavis freestone nearly always made her grin but it had been classical that night eve remembered his choice or hers his she decided it had all been his choice his fingerprints on the wine bottle hed brought it with him opened it poured his fingerprints along with hers on one wineglass only his on the second handed her the wine perfect gentleman she walked into the bedroom the sweepers had bagged the rose petals the bed had been stripped down to bare mattress ignoring it eve opened the balcony doors stepped out the wind lifted the choppy ends of her hair streamed it back away from her face it was starting to rain soft thin drops that fell soundlessly her stomach pitched but she made herself step to the rail made herself look down a long drop she thought long last step what had made him think of the balcony there was no indication hed been to the apartment before she replayed the security disc in her head and watched bryna and her killer approach the front door of the building from the street no he hadnt looked up at the building new yorkers never did anyway theyd been completely absorbed in each other why had he thought of the balcony why hadnt he just run in panic as he had in the cybercafe because part of his brain had stayed cool enough to click into survival mode both times had he thought the chemicals wouldnt show on a tox screen had he thought that far ahead or just the first desperate step he lives in the moment mira had said and the moment had been shocking shes dead and im in such trouble what should i do selftermination ploy toss her away out of sight out of mind but why not clean up evidence and leave it as a potential selfoverdose and buy more time to escape to cause confusion she decided as he had in the cafe he could have uploaded a virus in the single unit but programmed it to spread and was knowledgeable enough about those who frequented such places to be sure a riot would result a woman splats on the sidewalk witnesses are shocked stunned afraid they might run to the body or away from it but they dont rush into the building looking for a killer and the killer gains time to rush out and away but how did he think of the balcony as the rain thickened and began to plop as her stomach churned at the height she scanned the street the neighboring buildings son of a bitch she cursed softly as she read the sign coffee and a byte it was hardly more than a hole in the wall ten tables fitted with lowend units counter service for six but the coffee smelled fresh and the floors were clean the counter was manned by a droid of the freshfaced geek variety his hair was styled to fall in a pointed brown flap across his forehead two of the tables were occupied by the same type in human form and the waitress was young and too perky not to be another automation hi welcome to coffee and a byte would you like a table she had poofy blonde hair and lips the color of bubblegum her breasts were like two ripe melons that peeked rosily out of the bodice of her snug white top eve imagined the geeks had nightly wet dreams with her name on them i need to ask you some questions both of you the waitress bitsy according to her name tag replied everythings on the menu including specials but either tad or i will be really happy to explain anything bitsy and tad eve shook her head jesus who thought of this shit sit down bitsy im sorry but im not supposed to sit would you like to hear about todays coffee beverage no eve pulled out her badge this is a police investigation and i have to ask you some questions were programmed to cooperate fully with the police and security the fire the health and the emergency medical departments this was from tad who whisked his flap of hair back with his fingers thats good she sensed movement and shifted to point at the thinshouldered man who was trying to slide invisibly from behind his table theres no trouble here she told him just questions why dont you sit back down relax you might be able to answer some of them i didnt do anything good keep not doing anything she advised she turned back to the droids but kept her body angled so the tables knew she had them in her scope you know what happened across the street the woman who died oh yeah tad brightened a student with the answer for the teacher she got tossed out the window there you go eve took the photo of bryna bankhead laid it on the counter did she ever come in here no maam dont call me maam he blinked rapidly at that trying to process im supposed to call female customers maam im a cop not a customer except she sniffed the air is that real coffee oh yes his face underwent several expressions ended up baffled lieutenant eve said helpfully oh yes lieutenant we serve only genuine soy products with or without caffeine additives never mind she held up the photo so both men at the tables could see it either of you ever see this woman the one whod tried to slither out the door shifted in his seat i guess i did i didnt do anything we got that part whered you see her around i live a couple blocks down thats why i come here its close and its not all crowded and noisy and full of freaks and slicks slicks you know the ones who cruise cyberhouses to pick up dates i do serious work here you ever talk to her nah women like that dont talk to guys like me i just saw her sometimes is all around the neighborhood she was really pretty so i looked at her i didnt do anything whats your name milo milo horndecker doomed she thought from birth to geekdom milo you keep telling me you didnt do anything im going to start thinking you did she pulled out the three stills of the three faces the killer had used do you know any of these men she laid them on the counter first for tad and bitsy and got simultaneous head shakes out of them but theyre really pretty too bitsy added the negative responses from the customers had eve reevaluating okay you have anyone in here the past few weeks somebody who just started coming in recently hasnt been in since the murder hed want to sit near the front window hed come around in the mornings but not after ten or in the evenings but not before six she had to shuffle through the files in her head to come up with brynas regular work schedule if he came in otherwise it would be on tuesdays hed order fancy coffee slim latte grande with chestnut flavoring he came in two tuesdays in a row bitsy bounced on the toes of her pink slippers he sat in the front and he always had two lattes while he worked and then he left which table he always used station one always she pursed her bubblegum lips it has a nice view of the street and bryna bankheads building eve thought she pulled out her communicator and tagged feeney im at a cyberclub across from bankheads building im looking at a unit he used i need an impound warrant and an image tech o o sitting at station one eve drank the genuine soy product with caffeine additives beggars couldnt be choosers she had only to angle her head to see the twelfth floor of the apartment building across the street brynas apartment windows the little terraces he likes to be thorough she said to feeney hes a data addict and needs his input fix she told him in her emails what she usually did on her days off how she liked to open the windows first thing to see what sort of day it was i love to take that first breath of new york in the morning shed written i know what people say about city air but i think its so full so exciting and romantic all the scents and flavors and colors i have them all and on my day off i bask in them he probably watched her step out on the terrace maybe shed have a cup of coffee out there standing by the rail being a creature of order shed tidy up the apartment get dressed probably go out shopping awhile meet a friend he would have tailed her just to make sure what she told him in email clicked with her habits want to make sure she lived alone that there was no boyfriend or whatever to cramp his style more he wanted to see how she behaved how she looked when she was unaware of him she had to be good enough to fuck after all she looked back at feeney who with his magic fingers and droopy eyes was giving the unit its first check hes a creature of habit too she said and the habits are a trail can you find him on this he used it we can find out when and how gonna take time to filter through all the data and find his but what he put in we can get out with a nod she pushed away from the table and walked back to where the image tech worked with the droids the one thing about droids she thought was no matter how annoying they might be their eyes were a reliable camera already she could see the face and features coming to life on the techs compcanvas soft face bland features a hairline starting to recede from a wide dome of brow and left to shag messily over the ears the kind of face that passed through a crowd unnoticed that blended to the point where it was a faint smear on the memory except for the eyes they were sharp and cold whatever he did to his face eve knew when she looked into those eyes she would know him o o there was no cyberjoint within view of grace lutzs building no coffee shop or little diner there was a small walkin deli with one long narrow aisle but eves morning run of luck ran out there shed sent for peabody and her aide walked in just as she was buying a candy bar thats a very childish lunch peabody said craving it is that veggie hash fresh what have you got for me a big gaping pit where my stomach used to be peabody told her and ordered a takeout serving of the hash im trying this new diet where you eat only the white of a hardboiled egg for breakfast then peabody cruelly eve unwrapped the candy took a slow deliberate bite have you somehow mistaken me for someone who has an interest in dietary matters thats really mean youre got a mean temperament because youre spending your caloric intake on processed sugar and is that caramel bet your ass eve licked a glossy string of it off her index finger while peabody enviously followed the move outside i need to walk oh well if were going to exercise give me one of what shes got peabody demanded and dug for more money on the street she scooped up forksful of hash slowly to make it last and matched her stride to eves if you can manage to swallow peabody id like your report its pretty good i think they used dill we listed sixteen possibles she said quickly roarke well i dont have to tell you but hes one mag tech so fast and smooth and when he does manual searches have you ever noticed his hands she ate more hash at eves steely stare yeah guess you have anyway weve had sixteen names that jibed with the purchases and we factored them down to ten deleting two guys who got married in the last two weeks may and june still big months for weddings another who got run over by a maxibus a couple days ago did you read about that this guy hes walking along doing his stock checks on his ppc and steps right off the curb in front of the bus blap peabody okay well we narrowed it down to ten mostlikelies going with the outlets mcnab came up with incity for the enhancements the wigs are taking longer because hes got to target the manufacturer and he says theres about two hundred who use that highgrade human material then hit the brand then the product name the style used in the first murder is a pretty popular hair alternative and goes by several names depending on the brand and material used she flipped her empty takeout carton into a recycler and began to peel the wrapper off her candy bar with the slow precision and intense concentration of a woman stripping her lover he wants to have pizza tonight what roarke wants pizza no mcnab mcnab wants to have pizza with me tonight he says he wants to talk and stuff but this morning we broke a couple of public moral codes outside your gates shit shit eve pressed her fingers under her eye where a muscle began to tic wildly there it goes again why do you tell me this stuff it makes me spasm if we have pizza were going to have sex what does that mean its more than a spasm i think its an embolism one of those brain bombs and you have your finger twitching on the button i dont want to get messed up again but i feel messed up anyway eve sighed what do i know about this kind of stuff peabody its taken me more than a year to find my rhythm with roarke and i still screw it up half the time cops are bad bets she turned jamming her hands in her pockets the street was dirty the traffic loud and the smoke that belched from the glidecart they passed stank of fried rehydrated onions she could see an illegals deal in the making a half block down and across the street trying to have a life off the job is work two of you trying to have a life off it i dont know damn it her heart might have been going soft for her aide but her eyes were still hard and clear thats going bad call for the beat cops then back me up she pulled out her badge pulled out her weapon and was already zagging across the street when one of the men on the opposite sidewalk drew a blade there was a swipe a dodge then the second man flashed out a knife of his own they jabbed circling each other bystanders scattered police drop your weapons they ignored her and she could see one was jonesing the other high that made both of them dangerous lose the stickers or i drop you both as one they turned on her the man desperate for his fix lunged wildly she heard one of the pedestrians screaming as the knife arched up she took her man down with a stun across the knees he fell toward her she pivoted blocked then brought the heel of her boot down hard on his knife hand while he wailed flopped she saw the second man had moved fast he had the side of his blade lodged at the throat of the screaming pedestrian and he had zeus in his eyes that elixir that made gods of men drop it let her go and drop it fuck you fuck her this is my goddamn corner you cut her youll die on this goddamn corner the man on the ground was weeping now she could smell the piss leaking onto the sidewalk where his bladder had let go you put your piece down or i cut her from ear to ear he leaned in running his tongue over the terrified womans cheek and drink the blood okay looks like youve got me she lowered her weapon watching his eyes follow it down then watching them jitter as peabody stepped in from behind and laid her stunner against the back of his neck eve sprang forward grabbing his knife hand twisting it the civilian slid to the ground like an empty sack stun him again eve shouted as the druginduced strength had the knife jamming toward her throat she felt the prick that hot sting of metal against flesh and both of them scented her blood his body jerked then lifted when eve plowed her knee into his groin she shifted her weight sliced her heel into his instep then curled to use the momentum to flip him over her back he landed like a felled tree flat out and with a solid crack of skull on concrete eve scooped up the knife and wheezing stayed bent over dallas you okay did he cut you yes damn it get that one she pointed at the first man still weeping trying to crawl away she heaved the second man over clapped on restraints the hostage was on the ground as well and still screaming eve wiped the blood off her throat with the back of her hand and glanced over somebody shut her up chapter ten she had a long shallow cut from just under her right ear to just above the jugular a little more pressure the mt peabody had summoned behind her back had cheerfully noted a little more depth and shed have pumped herself dry quick fast and in a hurry as it was it wasnt so bad though she had blood on her shirt theyve got stuff thatll take the blood right out peabody assured her as they drove uptown my mother always used salt and cold water though does the job mostly so does chucking it in the rag pile though she imagined summerset would pluck it out again work some sort of household voodoo and it would end up back in her closet good as new see if you can put a hook in mcnamara id like to work him into my day see what he has to say about the partnership scandal and sex drugs while peabody made the call eve checked in for messages grumbling when there was nothing new from feeney or mcnab dr mcnamaras off planet sir isnt expected back for a couple days ive left a request that he contact you with his admin and on his voice mail okay well shuffle him down in the pile for now give me the run on this first guy lawrence q hardley thirtytwo single white male family hit it big in the late twentieth in the silicon valley explosion no marriage or cohabitation on record no criminal or military record and no prints on file none nyc resident since fortynine assists in running family business ny branch and holds title of exec vp in charge of marketing reported income salary investments dividends expense quota approximately five million two annually peabody studied the image alongside the data looks pretty good too maybe hell fall in love with me and beg me to marry him thereby providing me with the style of living to which i would be willing to become accustomed it didnt work out that way hardley showed no particular interest in peabody but he did toward his pretty male admin things had looked hopeful when hed become flustered and annoyed at the questioning had refused to answer without his attorney present it took twenty minutes to arrange for the consult and another twenty to wade through standard questions with the addition of the attorney through holoprojection an hour wasted eve thought as she slid back into her car ticking hardley off the list why didnt he just tell us he was gay peabody wondered and had an alibi for both nights in question some people are still uncomfortable with alternative sexuality even when its theirs run number two o o they eliminated three out of the ten before eve cut peabody loose for the day because she knew her job she didnt have to like it she swung to the curb in front of peabodys building and asked the question so are you having pizza or what i dont know peabodys shoulders rose and fell i think probably not itll just get all weird and screwedup again hes really an asshole but she said it wistfully he really got hyped and looney about charles eve shifted in her seat wishing she could stem the thin trickle of sympathy for mcnab i guess it could be rough on a guy to figure he was competing with someone like charles we never said we were exclusive and he cant go around trying to direct my life he cant just start telling me who i can see who i can be friends with heating up peabody turned the glare on eve and if i had been having sex with charles which i wasnt it wouldnt be any of his damn business whoops eve thought forget your job for one little minute and take a blast right in the forehead right absolutely right once an asshole always an asshole good to remember that so screw him peabody huffed out a breath and felt righteous he didnt even bother to tag me during the day to see if i was up for it anyway so screw him sideways well interview the last names on the list tomorrow what peabody brought herself back right yes sir tomorrow thinking shed done a reasonably decent job of it eve shoved the car into crosstown traffic with luck she could be home in thirty minutes while she fought her way across and uptown roarke sipped a beer and did his job i think the pizzas a good approach mcnab said shes got a weakness for it and it keeps it casuallike friendly id pick up a bottle of red nothing fancy thats good mcnabs face brightened but no flowers or anything not this time if you want to put things back as they were you need to take her off guard keep her guessing yeah roarke in mcnabs estimation was the guru of romance anybody who could make dallas soft was a veritable genius in affairs of the heart but this deal with charles he began forget it forget it but mcnab stuttered in shock set it aside ian at least for now shes fond of him and whatever their relationship might be its important to her every time you take a jab at him you push her away they were sitting sharing beer in some sort of den area mcnab hadnt even known existed there was a pool table an oldfashioned bar view screens on opposing walls and deep leather sofas and chairs the color of good red wine the art on the remaining walls were nudes but they were classy nudes long streamlined female bodies that looked somehow foreign and refined it was mcnab thought a real guy room away from the work stations away from the links where the only women were stylized art that didnt drive you crazy here there were acres of wood the smell of leather and tobacco back to class mcnab thought charles had class if that was what peabody was after he was sunk before he floated we had some good times you know not just good naked times i mean i was sort of getting into that stuff you suggested before you know taking her out places coming up with flowers and shit some times but when we busted up it was bad he gulped beer really bad i figured the hell with her but we work together a lot so youve got to have some level right maybe i should just leave it like that before it gets messed up again thats an option roarke took out a cigarette lighted it blew out smoke thoughtfully from what ive seen youre a good detective ian and an interesting man of interesting tastes if you didnt have a good brain neither feeney nor eve would be working with you however despite being a good detective with a good brain and an interesting man of interesting tastes youre leaving one vital factor out of this current equation what roarke leaned forward gently patted mcnabs knee youre in love with her his jaw dropped the beer in the pilsner slid dangerously toward the edge as it tipped roarke righted it i am im afraid so mcnab stared at roarke with the expression of a man whod just been told he had a fatal disease well hell o o fifty minutes two stops and a long subway ride later mcnab knocked on peabodys door dressed in her rattiest sweatpants an nypsd tshirt and a new seaweed face pack guaranteed to give the skin a clear youthful glow she opened to see him holding a pizza box and a bottle of cheap chianti thought you might be hungry she looked at him the pretty face the silly clothes and caught the sirens whiff of spicy sauce i guess i am o o it seemed to be the night for dating in the posh and fragrant royal bar of the roarke palace where a trio in evening dress played bach charles lifted a shimmering flute of champagne to the moment he said louise clinked her glass musically to his and to the next dr dimatto he skimmed a finger lightly over her hand as he drank isnt it a happy coincidence we both had the evening off isnt it and an interesting one that wed meet this morning at dallass you said youd known her more than a year yes we brushed together on another of her cases that must be why she lets you get away with calling her lieutenant sugar he laughed topped a small blini with caviar and offered it she intrigued me right from the start i admit im attracted to strongwilled intelligent and dedicated women what are you attracted to louise men who know who they are and dont pretend otherwise i grew up with pretense with roleplaying and i shook it off as soon as i could manage i stuck with medicine because its my passion but i practice it my way my way didnt please my family tell me more about your clinic she shook her head not yet youre too good at drawing out personal information without giving any in return ill tell you i became a doctor because i have a need and a talent to heal why did you become an lc i have a need and a talent for giving pleasure not just sexually he added thats often the simplest and most elemental part of the job spending time with someone discovering what it is they need or want even if they dont know themselves then providing it if you do the satisfactions more than physical for both parties and sometimes its just about fun she made him laugh shed been making him laugh he realized since he first met her sometimes if you were a client but im not she didnt say it with a sting but with a slow very warm smile if you were i might have suggested drinks just like this giving us time to relax to flirt to get to know each other the server topped off their glasses but neither of them noticed and then louise prompted then we might dance a little so youd grow used to the way i held you and i to the way you want to be held id love to dance with you she set her glass down he rose took her hand on the way to the dance floor they passed a shadowy booth where a couple ignored their own bottle of champagne and kissed passionately he turned slid his arms around louise fit her body to his with the easy skill of a man who knew perfectly how a woman fit against a man there was a delicacy about her that stirred him a directness that aroused and appealed in the cab that morning she had handed him a card and suggested he call her sometime when he wasnt working very direct he thought again as he drew in the scent of her hair very clear she was attracted interested but not as a client hed been attracted interested and had suggested they have drinks that same evening louise mmm i wasnt free tonight i broke an engagement to be here she tipped back her head so did i she laid her head on his shoulder again i like the way you hold me i felt something as soon as i saw you this morning i know she relaxed drifted on the music on the moment i dont have time for a relationship theyre so messy and take so much effort im selfish charles about my work and often very often resent anything that gets in the way of it her fingers trailed into his hair but i felt something too i think i could make time to find out what its about i havent had much luck with relationships my work usually gets in the way he turned his face into her hair breathed in the scent id like to take time to find out tell me she brushed her cheek against his smooth she thought with just enough friction to make her skin shiver if i were a client what would we do after we dance depending on what you wanted we might go upstairs to the suite id have reserved id undress you he skimmed his palm over the warm bare skin of her back slowly id tell you how beautiful you are as i took you to bed how your skins like silk id show you how much i want you as i made love to you maybe next time she drew away just a little so she could look at him and it sounds nearly perfect but if the next time comes charles well take each other to bed and ill make love with you his fingers tightened on hers it doesnt matter to you what i do why should it she had to rise on her toes to touch her mouth to his and left it at merely a whisper anymore than it should matter to you what i do excuse me a minute i want to freshen up she walked to the womens lounge and when she was sure she was out of sight pressed a hand to her jittery stomach shed never had a reaction like this to a man to want a man of course to enjoy his company to feel desire and interest and humor affection but never all at once never so much of all on such short acquaintance she needed a minute to settle down she stepped inside the opulent lounge moved directly to one of the deeply cushioned chairs in front of its individual triple mirror she took out her compact then simply sat staring at her own reflection shed said no more than the truth she didnt have time for a relationship particularly one that was bound to be intense and complex and complicated she had so much she wanted to accomplish it was one thing to socialize now and then a date a party particularly if she could use the time to garner interest in the clinic or the abuse shelter or the expansion of the free medvan units she was working on but a relationship with charles would be pure indulgence shed had no idea how much shed want to indulge she opened and closed her compact a few times then began to powder her nose while lecturing herself to be a grownup as she fussed with her hair a long slim brunette in a clingy black gown came out of the stall area she was humming a quick jumpy tune that suited her quick jumpy moves when she plopped into a chair and took out her lipstick ooh she said and snagged one of the cutglass bottles of scent do me she spritzed it on lavishly then to louises surprised amusement tucked the bottle in her evening bag thats just the idea she scooped back her long mane of curls sent louise a glittery smile congratulate me moniqua rose skimmed her hands over her breasts down her hips im about to get really lucky congratulations louise told her and laughed a little as moniqua slithered out of the room she slithered right up to the booth where the man she knew as byron was already standing holding out a hand ready she took his hand leaned in and rubbed her body provocatively over his want to hear what im ready for though she whispered as they walked they skirted close enough to where charles sat that he caught one very imaginative suggestion idly he glanced after them and wondered because of the mans subtle detachment if he was an lc on the job then he looked over saw louise walking back and couldnt think of anything but her o o moniqua cline worked hard as a paralegal in one of the citys midlevel firms she had aspirations and ambitions most of which were oriented toward career but she had more intimate ones as well which involved fantasies about the perfect mate who would share her love of neoclassic art tropical getaways and poetry a man in her dreams with a sophisticated edge a toned body a romantic mind and some good urban polish it seemed shed found him in byron he was so handsome with his shouldersweeping bronze hair his golden tan her nervous pulse had jumped like dice in a cup when shed seen him waiting in the booth theyd agreed upon hed already had champagne poured and ready when hed spoken her name the warmth the faintest of british accents in his voice had made her want to melt the first glass of champagne had gone to her head shed been so hot so itchy when shed slid across the booth she hadnt been able to stop herself from getting her hands on him her mouth on him shed felt drunk and happy now they were alone in her apartment and everything seemed soft and fluid as if she were looking through a thin veil of warm rippling water there was music playing sweeping rainbow arches of music and more champagne to dance in her head and sweeten her tongue his mouth was silky as it skimmed over hers his hands so skilled that everywhere he touched her throbbed and ached unbearably he said lovely things to her though it was hard to understand them through the dizziness the arousal that bloomed inside her like roses then he drew away and made her moan in protest i want to prepare he took her hands traced kisses over the backs set the stage you want romance moniqua im going to give it to you wait here for me her head spun as she watched him get to his feet pick up his bag she couldnt quite think i want i need to she got shakily to her feet gestured toward the bathroom freshen up for you of course dont be long i want to be with you i want to take you places youve never been i wont she strained against him lifting an eager mouth to his its so perfect byron yes he led her to the bathroom door nudged her gently inside its perfect he lighted the candles he turned down the bed sprinkled rose petals on the sheets plumped the pillows hed chosen well he decided as he studied the bedroom he approved the art the colors the good fabric of the spread she was a woman of taste he touched the slim old volume of poetry on her bedside table and intellect he might have loved her if love existed he set two fresh flutes of champagne on the table added three drops of the drug to one he would dilute it this time extend the experience lucias had told him she could live for two hours perhaps a bit more with the combination of drugs in this proportion in her bloodstream he could do a great deal with her in two hours he turned when she came to the bedroom door he held out a hand beautiful moniqua my love lets discover each other o o it was better this time even better lucias was right he was always right the excitement of knowing this experience would be her last that he would be the last thing she saw felt smelled even tasted was almost unbearably erotic oh she responded to him tirelessly her heart stormed against his and still she pleaded with him for more she gave him two hours two magnificent hours when he felt her dying he watched her almost tenderly say my name he whispered byron no kevin i want to hear you say it kevin i want to hear you scream it he rammed himself into her plunging toward the end and when she screamed his name he knew the most perfect pleasure of his life because of it he drew the sheet gently over her body laid his lips on her brow in a soft kiss before he walked out of her apartment he couldnt wait to get home and tell lucias everything o o it was an hour later when she moved her fingers scraped over the sheet the eyes behind her closed lids twitched there was a numbness in her chest and under it a kind of terrifying unspeakable pain her head burned like the sun tears leaked out trickled down her cheek as she struggled to lift her arm it felt dead and the effort had small strangled sounds trembling on her lips her fingers brushed a glass on the table knocked it to the floor where it shattered and the sound of it was dim like glass breaking under a pillow her fingers crawled over the table bumped the link sweat sheathed her as she forced those fingers up forced her confused mind to count slot by slot until she reached the top key on memory she pushed it then her hand fell limp and her body lay drenched in exhaustion what is your emergency miss cline help me her lips tripped over the words as if they were some exotic foreign language please help me she managed to whisper before she fell back into unconsciousness o o eve woke when the world started to sway she opened gritty eyes and stared into roarkes why are you carrying me because lieutenant you need to sleep not at your desk he added as he stepped into the elevator in her home office in a bed i was just resting my eyes rest them in bed she should on principle insist he set her back on her feet but it was kind of nice to get carted around especially when she only had to turn her head to sniff his neck what time is it just after one he carried her into the bedroom climbed the short steps to the platform then sat cradling her on the side of the bed do you know what i was thinking she snuggled in ive got a pretty good idea he laughed ran a hand over her hair i can put my mind to that as well but i was thinking when i walked into your office and saw you with your head on your desk and your face pale the way it gets when youre finally too exhausted to take another step that in a matter of weeks well have been married a full year and im still fascinated by you were doing okay huh yes were doing just fine he tugged on the chain she wore around her neck slid the diamond pendant hed once given her out from under her shirt where she most often wore it you were angry with me when i gave you this yet you wear it more often than anything ive ever given you but your wedding ring you told me you loved me when you gave it to me it pissed me off and it scared me i guess maybe i wear it because it doesnt piss me off anymore but it still scares me sometimes though his cheek rested on the top of her head he traced a finger unerringly along the mark the knife had left on her throat loves a scary business she turned into him why dont we terrify each other her lips were a breath from his when the link beeped ah damn it damn it she crawled over the bed to answer it o o eve burst out of the elevator into icu strode down the deathly quiet corridor she hated hospitals more than morgues she slapped her badge on the counter at the nurses station i need to see whoevers in charge i need to see moniqua cline dr michaels is in with her now if youd just wait in there eve jabbed a finger toward a set of thick glass doors she was through them before the nurse could do more than let out a piping sound of protest she knew who she was looking for shed gotten a solid description from the medtech whod helped transport the victim into the er she passed a glasswalled room scanned the bed inside the woman lying on it looked a hundred and fifty and was tethered to so many machines she no longer looked human give me a full blast right in the heart eve thought and end my time clean in the next room the man was much younger and cocooned in a thin transparent tent she found moniqua one door down with the doctor scanning the readout on a monitor while his patient lay white as death and still as stone he glanced over with annoyance and a frown marred the face set off by a natty beard and mustache the color of paprika youre not allowed in here lieutenant dallas nypsd she offered her badge shes mine on the contrary lieutenant shes mine is she going to make it i cant say were doing all that can be done look i dont want the company line two other women havent made it to the hospital they went straight to the morgue mt told me she had a cardiac incident a bp that hit the cellar and complications from the od i need to know if shes going to come out of it enough to tell me who put her here and i cant tell you her heart was damaged were unable to determine as yet if there was brain damage as well her vitals are low and weak shes in a coma her systems been so compromised by the drugs its a minor miracle she was aware enough to call nineeleven but she did and i say that makes her tough she looked down at moniqua willed her to consciousness the drugs were administered without her knowledge are you aware of that that hasnt been confirmed but ive heard the media reports on the two murders he doused her with the two illegals then he raped her i need someone in here with a rape kit ill have one of the physicians assistants take care of it i need a police rep too to collect whatever evidence shes got in her i know the drill michaels said with a snap of impatience in his voice get your rep get your evidence thats not my concern keeping her alive is and mine is pinning the son of a bitch who put her here that doesnt make her less to me youve examined her personally he opened his mouth again then whatever he read on eves face had him nodding i have any trauma bruises bites cuts no none nor any sign of forced sexual activity was she sodomized no he laid a hand almost protectively over moniquas what are we dealing with lieutenant don juan with an attitude wholl know he didnt finish the job once this hits the media im putting a guard on her twentyfourseven and i dont want any visitors none no one gets into this room except authorized staff and cops her family you clear them through me first me personally she added i need to know if and when theres any change in her condition i need to know the instant she wakes up and i dont need any bullshit about her not being able to answer questions he meant her to die and she didnt two others have hes having too much fun to stop now you wanted to know her chances less than fifty percent well im betting on her eve leaned over the bed spoke quietly spoke firmly moniqua you hear that im betting on you if you give up he wins so youre not going to give up lets kick this bastard in the balls she stepped back nodded at michaels you contact me when she wakes up chapter eleven by the time she left central it was nearly four am and exhaustion was wrapped around her like a damp blanket that smothered the senses rather than trust her reflexes she programmed for auto and hoped the jokers down in maintenance hadnt played any pranks with the mechanism still she was too tired to care if she ended up in hoboken there were bound to be beds in hoboken the recycle trucks were already out limping along with their monotonous whooshbangthump and their teams moving like shadows to dump contents of sidewalk receptacles and bins and prepare the city for another days garbage a utility crew in their ghostly white reflector suits was tearing up a half block section along tenth the nasty toothdrilling buzz of their hydrojack competed with the headache spiking into her left temple a couple of the guys gave her the onceover from behind their safety goggles as she idled at the light one smooth customer grabbed at his crotch grinning with what she imagined passed for charm in his limited world while he jerked his hips the pantomime had several of his cronies laughing uproariously she knew she was past her personal threshold when she couldnt drum up the irritation to step out of the car and bust their balls while she cited them for sexual harassment instead she let her head lay against the seat closed her eyes as the sensors picked up the light change and the car cruised through mentally she took herself through moniquas apartment again champagne this time eve had recognized the label as one of roarkes and knew the bubbly could go for upwards of a grand a bottle a hell of an outlay in her opinion for some pop and fizz hed taken glasses into the bedroom this time but the rest of the setup was identical to the others creatures of habit she thought drifting a little taking turns keeping score most games were competitions werent they the goal hadnt been reached with moniqua would they try to finish it or just sit back and hope she did the job for them and coded out she shifted in the seat seeking comfort call michaels in the morning check status brief guards at change of shift shed put the dependable trueheart on the first shift hed be solid process data on allegany and j forrester follow through with dr theodore mcnamara nag feeney re cutting through blocks on the account number charles had provided continue to nag re data search on unit impounded from cyberjoint so far shed gotten nowhere on the roses take another push at the flowers take dose of goddamn awake and swallow a stupid pain blocker before your head explodes she hated drugs they made her feel stupid or weak or overcharged drugs would be trickling into moniquas system now sliding inside her working to bolster her heart clear brain channels and god knew if the tide turned the right way shed wake up and remember shed be scared confused disoriented her mind would feel detached from her body at least at first thered be blank spots and the questions that had to be asked would drop into some of them the mind she knew protected itself from horror when it could to wake in the hospital with the machines the pain the strange faces what could the mind do but hide whats your name theyd asked her that it was the first thing theyd asked her doctors and cops standing over the gurney while shed stared up at them whats your name little girl the phrase sent her heart racing made her try to curl up into herself little girl terrible things happened to little girls theyd thought at first she was mute either physically or psychologically but she could speak she just didnt know the answers the cop hadnt looked mean hed come after the doctors and the others in flapping white coats or pale green smocks shed learned later that it had been the police whod brought her out of the alley where shed hidden she didnt remember it but she had been told her first memory was of the light over her head burning into her eyes and the dull detached pressure of her broken arm being set she was filthy with sweat dirt and dried blood they spoke gently to her those strangers as they poked and prodded but like the cop the smiles didnt reach their eyes those were grim or aloof filled with pity or questions when they went down down to where shed been torn she fought like an animal teeth nails with the howling screams of a wounded animal thats when the nurse had cried a tear sliding down her cheek as she helped hold her down until the calmer in the pressure syringe could be administered whats your name the cop had asked her when shed drifted back where do you live who hurt you she didnt know she didnt want to know she closed her eyes and tried to go away again sometimes the drugs let her slip under but if they took her too deep the air was cold cold cold and smeared dirty red she was afraid more afraid down there than of the strangers with their quiet questions sometimes when she was in that cold place someone was with her candy breath and fingers that skittered over her skin like the roaches that skittered across the floor when the lights came on when those fingers were on her even the drug couldnt stop her screams they thought she couldnt hear them couldnt understand when they spoke in their hushed murmurs beaten raped longterm sexual and physical abuse suffering from malnutrition dehydration severe physical and emotional trauma shes lucky to have survived bastard who did this ought to be cut into little pieces one more victim worlds full of them no identity records were calling her eve eve dallas she woke with a jolt when the car stopped stared blankly at the dark stone of the house the glow of lights against the glass her hands were shaking fatigue she told herself just fatigue if she related to moniqua cline it was only natural one more tool she thought as she climbed out of the car in the investigation she knew who she was now shed become eve dallas and it was more than a name the system had labeled her with who shed been before what had come before couldnt be changed if that broken frightened child still lived inside her that was okay theyd both survived she dragged herself upstairs stripping off her jacket releasing her weapon harness stumbling and peeling off her clothes as she headed for the bed she tumbled in curling under warm smooth sheets and willing the voices that still echoed in her head to quiet in the dark roarkes arm came around her drew her back against him she shuddered once she knew who she was she felt his heart the steady beat of it against her back his arm the comforting weight of it over her waist the tears that stung her throat shocked and appalled her where had they been hiding the sudden wave of cold warned her the shakes would follow she turned to him into him i need you she said as her mouth found him need you desperate for warmth for him she fisted her hands in his hair she knew him in the dark taste scent texture here with him there were no questions just answers all the answers she felt his heart that had been so steady against her back leap against her breast he was there for her as no one else had ever been say my name eve his lips ran warm over the bruise on her face took the ache away my eve so strong he thought so tired whatever images that were playing in her brain she sought to fight hed fight with her it wasnt tenderness she sought but a kind of ruthless comfort he slid a hand down her body used his mouth and fingers to bring her that first sharp release she trembled but no longer from cold the aches that ravaged her body were no longer from fatigue she arched against him when he found her breast quick little bites that shot flashes of pleasure into her a busy tongue that laved heat over heat she rolled with him her breath ragged as they tangled in the sheets her body was a rage of wants and grew slick under the hands that met them he loved the long lean length of her craved it with a hunger that was never quite sated her skin always a surprise of delicacy was damp and hot so that it slid like wet silk over his as they moved together her mouth came back to his burning like a fever and drenched them both in madness inside me she rolled crawling clawing over him straddling him inside me and took him hard fast deep her hips pistoned a speed that blurred his brain he could see the shape of her over him the gleam of her eyes against the dark as she drove them both brutally battered he rocked in the pleasure let her take and take until her head fell back until he felt the orgasm punch through her like a fist through glass until she shattered then he reared up dragged her still shuddering body against him and let go o o she fell into sleep like it was a pit and stayed there sprawled facedown for three hours she felt considerably better when she woke she told herself the headache was gone and it was so deeply buried under denial it was nearly the same thing and a couple of catnaps during the day she was sure would do more for her than some chemical she didnt even make it out of bed before roarke was sitting beside her fully dressed he had his morning stock reports on screen muted a pot of coffee still seductively steaming on the table in the sitting area and he held a pill in one hand a suspiciouslooking glass of liquid on the bedside table open up he ordered uhuh i hate to give you more bruises but if i must i must they both knew hed enjoy using brute force i dont need anything youre nothing but a chemihead pusher darling you say the sweetest things in a move too fast to evade he had her earlobe pinched between his thumb and forefinger one flick of his wrist and the shock of the twist had her mouth dropping open he popped the pill in phase one she swung at him but since she was choking her aim was off the next thing she knew he was yanking her head back by her hair and pouring the liquid down her throat she swallowed twice in selfdefense before she managed to shove at him ill kill you all of it with grim efficiency he pinned her and forced the rest of the booster into her phase two youre a dead man roarke she swiped the back of her hand over her chin where some of the booster had dripped you dont know it but youve already stopped breathing the walking dead i wouldnt have to put us both through that if youd take reasonable care of yourself and when you finally realize youre dead and drop to the ground feeling better and youre laying there im going to step over your cold lifeless body open the doors of that department store you call a closet and i torch it really darling no need to get nasty yes better he decided with a nod i hate you i know he leaned in to give her a light kiss i hate you too im in the mood for eggs benedict why dont you have your shower then you can update me over breakfast im not talking to you his grin flashed as he rose such a cliched and female weapon he turned started down the stairs and wasnt the least surprised when she landed on his back thats more like it he managed as she squeezed his windpipe with her crooked arm just be careful who you call a female ace she dropped off strode naked into the bath watching the indignant twitch of her ass roarke chuckled i dont know what i was thinking o o she only ate because there was no point in wasting the food she only updated him because it helped her sort through data when she relayed events out loud he listened idly stroking the cat between the hospital and mt staff he commented the media will have been fed by now that could work in your favor im figuring these two theyre not the type to go into the wind too much ego on the line for them to stop cold ive got a lot of data on them maybe too much maybe thats part of the problem too much data not enough focus you got all these lines to tug they can get tangled on you she got up to strap on her shoulder harness ive got to streamline it why dont you let me take allegany its mine after all people would be more likely to tell me things they wouldnt tell a badge and what they dont tell me he added i can find out in other ways ways that would probably be legal more or less since i now own the company your definition of more or less has a wider scope than mine but it would save her time and time was essential try to stay close to the line on it whose line would that be yours or mine har ive got a briefing with the team at central pass me anything you pick up naturally bringing the cat with him he rose and crossed to her kissed her take care of yourself lieutenant why should i she headed for the door you get such a charge out of doing it for me roarke glanced down at the cat as he listened to his wifes boots click down the hall thats a point o o in the conference room shed booked at central eve played the security disc from moniquas building we see here shes more in line with bryna bankhead similar physical type more sophisticated appearance and lifestyle he uses yet another look himself here which tells me he doesnt like to repeat his character keeps it fresh for him same pattern but he can walk through the performance from a new angle feeney he picked up the rhythm according to the overscan of her home unit he used the name byron in correspondence with her probability indicates this is from the poet guy lord byron the email messages go back two weeks again follows pattern he takes his time with this pattern hed have studied her in real life finding a place near her apartment or her workplace we check both she glanced over as the door opened trueheart young and ridiculously fresh in his uniform flushed as heads turned in his direction sorry excuse me sir im late no youre on schedule report sir subject clines condition remains unchanged no one without authorization entered her hospital room i remained on post inside the room throughout the shift were there any calls of inquiry relating to her several lieutenant beginning at approximately oh six hundred when the first media report hit five inquiries from reporters requesting medical information that jibes as ive had double that on my office link sign out trueheart go get some sleep i want you to resume your post at the hospital at eighteen hundred ill clear your duty sheet with your sergeant yes sir lieutenant i appreciate you requesting me eve shook her head when hed closed the door behind him thanking me for sticking him with the most boring duty on or off planet okay roarkes digging into allegany i want all pertinent data on j forrester and this theodore mcnamara whos currently dodging my messages and we slog away at the online dealer we concentrate on the chemicals how why and where they get their supply my source in illegals only came up with one strong possible feeney said one known local dealer who specialized in the upperend sex trade and made a profit names otis gunn and he was in the swim about ten years ago had a pretty good line going until he got cocky and started cooking and serving his own rabbit at parties whats he up to now year nine of twenty feeney pulled a bag of nuts out of one of his sagging pockets rikers yeah i havent visited the old homestead in a while wonder if theyve missed me she broke off as her communicator signalled paced away to answer i just cleared louise through she said as she tucked the communicator away again she claims to have some information on last nights hit she looked at the case board at the new picture shed pinned to it shed kept moniquas face separate from the dead she wanted it to stay there when she turned back she saw something pass between mcnab and peabody something with just a little heat so she looked away fast peabody why dont i have any damn coffee i dont know sir but i will rectify that immediately peabody popped up was actually humming under her breath as she programmed the autochef and there was a bright look in her eyes when she carried the coffee to eve eat any good pizza lately eve muttered and the light in peabodys eyes turned instantly to embarrassed guilt maybe just a slice or two eve leaned in ate the whole damn pie didnt you it was really good pizza i sort of you know missed the taste of it no more humming on duty peabody squared her shoulders no sir all humming will cease immediately and no sparklyeye crap either eve added and yanked open the door to look for louise you can look pretty sparklyeyed after really good pizza too peabody muttered then decided not to press her luck when eve snarled dallas louise doubletimed it down the corridor she wasnt wearing a power suit this morning but the worn jeans and roomy shirt she usually donned for the clinic im so glad you are here i didnt want to go into all this over a link sit down because louise was pale despite her rush through centrals labyrinth eve took her arm and pulled her to a chair take a breath then tell me what youve got last night i had a date last night drinks at the royal bar roarkes place in the palace hotel yes i saw them dallas i saw them sitting in a booth near our table i spoke with her in the ladies lounge slow down peabody some water here i wasnt paying attention louise continued if i had been id have seen i can see her face right now as she sat in front of the mirror it wasnt just champagne im a doctor goddamn it i should have seen she was drugged i can see it now we see all kinds of things after here she shoved the water into louises hands drink then suck it in louise suck it in and tell me everything you remember sorry she sipped once when i saw the media report this morning i recognized her realized she drank again i called and checked on her condition on the way over theres been no improvement none her chances decrease every hour last night concentrate on last night youre having drinks in the bar yes she drew in a breath steadied champagne caviar it was lovely we were talking i wasnt paying much attention to anything but him but i did notice sort of absently the couple in the booth they had champagne and caviar too i think im nearly sure they were already seated when we got there they were sitting very close together very intimate they were a very attractive couple okay what next we danced i forgot about them but i went into the lounge sat down to freshen up and to get my balance it was a very intense first date for me while i was there she came out of the stalls she was throwing off all kinds of sexual sparks told me to congratulate her that she was going to get very lucky i was amused and half wishing i could be that confident they were leaving when i came out they were leaving and i never gave it a thought she sighed her color was too high her eyes were glassy i can see it now what do you remember about him polished attractive they looked right together and he looked natural in that sort of setting i wish id noticed more maybe charles did eve felt the jolt in her belly saw it in the quick jerk of her aides shoulders charles yes charles monroe i tried to reach him this morning but he has his link on message mode only okay oh boy i may need to talk to you again you can reach me at the clinic all day she got to her feet i wish i was more help everything helps o o eve said nothing about it as she drove she intended to say nothing about it ever in this lifetime but peabodys absolute silence broke her down you okay about this im thinking about it it wasnt a job what they had this vibe going yesterday it was a date not a job im okay with it she decided i mean were just friends it was just kind of a shock thats all she glanced over at the entrance to charless building when eve pulled to the curb apparently shed better be all right with it he was heading to the elevator as they stepped off dallas i was just coming in to see you i just saw i know lets go inside first you know but louise is she upset i need to call her eves eyebrows raised as he fumbled with the keycode of his door the unflappable charles was definitely flapped later shes okay not thinking straight he confessed and ran a hand absently over peabodys shoulder as they all stepped inside i spent an hour in the relaxation tank this morning didnt turn on the screen until a few minutes ago the report hit me in the face we saw them just last night him and the woman he tried to kill tell me it was almost identical to louises statement save for the interlude in the lounge but charless speculation that the man was an lc interested her why did you think that he was detached just a little its hard to explain he was very solicitous very smooth but there was calculation under it he let her make all the physical advances and let her pay the check i was preoccupied he admitted but i noticed the way he looked after her when she went into the lounge calculation again and smugness just a quick impression on my end some lcs think of clients that way how about clients sorry some clients look at lcs that way he studied eves face then nodded yes youre right about that she turned for the door check with some of your associates for me will you charles for a client who likes classical music pink roses and candlelight she tossed a glance over her shoulder and poetry you people keep client files on preferences right if we want to stay in business we do ill ask around delia can i have a minute eve kept going ill get the elevator i know wed penciled in dinner this evening he began dont worry about it she found it easy to kiss his cheek thats what friends were for i like her thanks he gave peabodys hand a squeeze so do i chapter twelve it usually made employees nervous when roarke showed up unexpectedly at one of his companies to his way of thinking a few nerves helped keep people on their toes he paid well and the working conditions that were found in all his companies factories subsidiaries and offices throughout the world and its satellites were unquestionably high he knew what it was to be poor and to be surrounded by the dingy the dark the dirty for some himself for instance those were motivators to achieve more by whatever means possible but for most a stingy wage and an airless box in which to earn it fostered hopelessness resentment and pilfering he preferred a higher overhead which tended to keep those who belonged to him comfortable loyal and productive he walked through the main level of allegany making mental notes on what might need to be adjusted in security in decor he found no glitches in communication as within moments of his requesting to speak with the chief chemist he was being escorted to the thirtieth floor the flustered receptionist who led the way offered him coffee twice and apologized for the delay in locating dr stiles a total of three times before theyd reached the mans office im sure hes very busy roarke glanced around the large somewhat disorganized room where the sun and privacy screens were both firmly fixed to the window the place was as dim as a cave oh yes sir im sure he is sir may i bring you some coffee while you wait three for three he thought no thank you if dr stiles is in one of the labs perhaps he broke off when the man stalked in all flapping lab coat and scowl im in the middle of a project so i imagined roarke said mildly im sorry to interrupt you what are you doing in here he demanded of the horrified receptionist havent i told you i dont want people fussing around in my office yes but scoot scoot he scooted her personally waving his hands at her like a farm wife scattering chickens what do you want he said to roarke and slammed the office door smartly its nice to see you again too stiles i dont have time for chitchat and politics were working on the new heart regenerative serum hows it going it has momentum which youre stopping by calling me out of my lab he sat gracelessly a beefy man with the shoulders of an arena ball fullback his face was dominated by a nose that sliced down the center of his face like an ax through granite his eyes were black and brooding his mouth set in a permanent frown his hair a dingy gray he refused to change sprang up out of his scalp like steel wool he was illmannered illtempered surly and sarcastic roarke liked him very much you worked here when allegany was associated with j forrester hah stiles took out a pipe he hadnt filled in fifteen years and chewed on the stem ive worked here since you were still sucking your thumb and drooling on your chin fortunately i grew out of both distressing habits the partnership had to do with a particular project sexual dysfunction people didnt worry about sex so much theyd get more done but what would be the point roarke lifted a box filled with what appeared to be a decades worth of periodical discs set it on the floor married now arent you sex goes out the window roarke thought of eve rising over him in the dark is that what happened to it the amusement in the tone had stiles snorting out what might have been a laugh in any case roarke continued i need information about the partnership the project and the players i look like a fucking data bank to you roarke ignored the question more he ignored the delivery something he wouldnt have done for many ive already accessed considerable data but the personal touch is helpful theodore mcnamara asshole as i believe thats your affectionate term for nearly everyone in your acquaintance and out of it perhaps you could be more specific more interested in profit than the results in glory than the big picture administrate you to death and back again just for the enjoyment of proving who was pushing the buttons wanted a name for himself he was top dog around here then and he made sure we all knew it by pissing on everyone as often as possible courted the media like a publicity whore i take it you didnt get together for a quick beer after a hard day over the petri dish couldnt stand the son of a bitch cant knock his professional skills theres a brilliant mind in that puffed up prima donna he sucked on his pipe a little thinking he handselected most of the teams brought his doormat of a daughter in on it what the hell was her name hah who gives a shit good brain worked like a dog and had nothing to say for herself can i assume from this the project was primarily mcnamaras baby he made the majority of decisions made the blueprints for the direction the work took it was a corporate project but mcnamara was the figurehead spokesperson main son of a bitch in charge there was a lot of money riding on the deal corporate money private investors sex sells we had some luck in a couple areas considerable guaranteeing a man he can still get a boner when hes a hundred and two and letting a woman keep her biological clock ticking past the halfcentury mark stiles shook his head money and media from that bumped things up the less snappy stuff we accomplished infertility aids without the risks of multiple births wasnt as newsworthy the brass was looking for more and mcnamara put on the pressure for us to give them more we were working with dangerous elements unstable ones tempting ones the costs rose and experiments were pushed too fast to make up the margin bad chemistry side effects unsanctioned use recreational too lawsuits started piling up and they shut the project down and mcnamara managed to stay out of the stink stiless mouth turned down in disgust he knew what was going on nothing ever got by him what about staff anyone you remember who had a particular affection for recreational use do i look like a weasel stiles barked actually ah you meant metaphorically not literally give it another fifty years you wont look so pretty either just one more thing to look forward to stiles roarke switched gears sobered leaned forward this is hardly gossip two women murdered one in a coma if theres a possibility the source springs back to that project what women what murders roarke nearly sighed how could he have forgotten who he was talking to get out of the lab occasionally stiles why there are people out there nothing fucks things up faster than people theres a person or persons out there right now drugging women with the very chemicals you and this lab experimented in drugging them to death not bloody likely do you know how much it would take to induce death the cost of the elements involved i have that data thank you the cost in this case doesnt seem to be an issue hell of a lot of money even if hes cooking it himself what would it take to cook it himself stiles thought for a moment good lab diagnostic and equation units firstclass chemist airseal lock for holding during stabilization process has to be privately funded black market any accredited lab or center was working on this id know about it put your ear to the ground roarke told him and see if you hear about anything thats not accredited his pocketlink beeped excuse me he engaged privacy mode flipped on the earpiece roarke o o eve hated cooling her heels she particularly hated it in a space where she was considered as much roarkes wife maybe more than a badge the palace was one of those spaces she hated it only slightly less after being escorted to roarkes hotel office where she could interview the waiter whod served moniqua and her attacker she preferred her visit to rikers where the facilities were spare the staff snarly and the inmates vicious even if her interview with gunn had been a dead end it had been in more comfortable surroundings ill have jamal brought up to you the moment he arrives the ruthlessly sleek lounge hostess gestured when the elevator doors opened if theres anything else i or any of the palace staff can do to aid in your investigation youve only to ask it required both a thumbprint and a code to unlock the office and this required enlisting the help of the executive office manager security was never taken for granted in a roarke industries holding in the meantime the hostess smiled warmly may i offer you any refreshment a sparkling mango peabody leaped in with the request before eve could throw up the wall against such niceties she met eves dour look im kind of thirsty of course the hostess glided over to the carved cupboard that held the refreshment center and programmed the autochef and for you lieutenant just the waiter hes due in very shortly she offered peabody the mango in a tall fluted glass if theres nothing else i can do for you ill give you your privacy she stepped out closing the doors discreetly behind her these are really good peabody savored each swallow you should go for one were not here to slurp down fancy drinks eve wandered the room despite the cuttingedge equipment it was more luxury apartment than office i want the waiters statement before i hit dr mcnamara stop guzzling that and check on moniqua clines condition i can do both while she did eve contacted feeney give me something you been to rikers already come and gone gunn and i passed a few pleasantries during which he suggested i perform various sexual acts on myself that however inventive are either anatomically impossible or illegal same old gunn feeney said with some affection otherwise he was a washout he was pissed off enough to find out somebody was out there making money in his area for me to believe he doesnt know a damn thing so give me something i told you it was gonna take time times passing one of them may have a date tonight dallas you know how much craps passed through this unit its a public rental for christs sake i cant just reach in and pluck a single user out like a frigging rabbit out of a hat youve got clines unit cant you run the crosscheck do i look like this is my first day on the job he didnt play with her on this one not that i can find you want me to explain what the hell im doing here or you want me to do it do it she started to cut off caught herself sorry she added then cut off no change peabody told her shes still critical and comatose the door opened eve told herself she shouldnt have been the least surprised to see roarke walk in what are you doing here i believe this is my office he glanced around yes im sure it is jamal this is lieutenant dallas and officer peabody theyre going to ask you some questions and require your full cooperation yes sir relax jamal eve told him youre not in any trouble no this is about the woman in the coma i saw a bulletin and wondered if i should go to the police station or to work he glanced at roarke the surroundings are a bit more comfortable here roarke said easily so you say eve muttered under her breath sit down jamal roarke invited would you like anything to drink no sir thank you would you mind eve interrupted if i conducted this interview not at all roarke walked over took a seat behind his desk and no im not leaving jamals entitled to have a representative present i would like to help jamal sat his back arrowstraight and folded his hands neatly on his lap even if i hadnt been instructed to give full cooperation i would want to help its my duty well thats a refreshing attitude jamal im going to record this peabody yes sir record on interview with jamal jabar regarding the attempted murder of moniqua cline casefile hc dallas lieutenant eve conducting the interview also present peabody officer delia as aide and roarke as subject jabars chosen representative jamal youre employed as waitstaff in the royal bar of the roarke palace hotel correct yes ive been serving here for three years and last night in that capacity you served a couple in station five of your section i served four couples at that station during my shift eve took out the stills held them up do you recognize these people i do they were in my section last night at station five they had a bottle of dom perignon beluga caviar with full accompaniments the gentleman arrived at just before nine oclock and was very specific in what he wished to be served and how he arrived first oh yes nearly thirty minutes before the lady but he instructed me to bring the champagne right away and to open the bottle he wished to pour himself the caviar was to be served after she arrived did he have a bag black leather long strap with him he did he didnt wish to check it he kept it on the booth beside him he made one call on his link i assumed it was to the lady as he was waiting so long for her but he didnt seem impatient and when i stopped by to make certain he was comfortable and inquired if his guest was late he told me she was not when did he pour the champagne i didnt notice precisely but when it was nearly ninethirty the glasses were full she arrived shortly after that and i realized thought i realized why he had come so early if indeed she was timely i assumed hed been nervous as this was a first date how did you know it was a first date i would have guessed because there was an excitement and a slight formality between them at the beginning but i was sure of it as i heard her say how happy she was to finally meet him facetoface what did they talk about jamal turned toward roarke were not supposed to listen to the guests conversations you got ears hearing isnt the same as listening no it isnt jamals face registered his appreciation for her distinction when i served the caviar they were speaking of art and literature the way people do as they look for a comfortable spot to settle with each other he was very attentive but gentlemanly at the beginning but that changed you could say they became very at ease with each other very quickly they touched kissed in a way that indicated intimacy or the willingness for it if you understand me lieutenant yeah i follow you when i cleared the caviar it was the lady who paid this seemed distasteful to me as he had been the one to order he looked a little sheepish but she gave me a very generous tip they lingered over the wine she became it seemed to me quite aggressive at one point he shifted in his chair relinked his fingers i saw her hand under the table and well in his trousers as this is against restaurant policy i debated reporting it to my supervisor but then she got up and went into the ladies lounge when she returned they left had you ever seen either of them before last night i dont remember her but we see so many people the royal bar is a city landmark after all but i remember him eves head came up just an inch how hes been in my section before that same station only a week ago perhaps a little more with another man he didnt look the same but it was him last night his hair was lighter and longer his face different somehow i cant really say but you recognized him his ring id admired it before my wife is a jeweler so i tend to notice a good piece when i see it its a wide band with alternating ribbons of white and yellow gold with a square stone a ruby with a dragons head carved into it very distinctive his companion had one as well but with a sapphire i thought at the time they were mates and these their wedding rings this man last night had on the ruby ring yes i nearly remarked on it but as he looked so different i assumed he didnt wish to be recognized and he indicated quite clearly he didnt wish to speak with his server eve got to her feet circled the room tell me about the time you saw him before him and the other man i only remember it was about a week ago i dont remember which evening but i think it was early in my shift near seven oclock they had wine and hors doeuvres he smiled thinly and didnt tip well how did they pay cash what did they talk about i didnt hear very much they seemed to be arguing but goodnaturedly over which of them would start the game they were in very high spirits and it amused me when i was taking an order from station six that the gentlemen in five were flipping a coin bryna bankhead eve thought had died on the flip of a coin i need you to work with an imaging tech jamal im afraid i wont be able to describe him very well let us worry about that we appreciate your cooperation youve been a really big help someone will contact you about the imaging all right he glanced at roarke got the nod of approval and rose i hope whatever ive told you helps you stop him from hurting anyone else jamal roarke got to his feet ill speak to your supervisor youll be paid for whatever time you need to take off to assist the police any lost time wont affect your benefits or salary thank you sir we run the ring eve snapped the minute the doors closed behind jamal every jewelry store in new york that does custom work order an imaging tech priority one on it peabody replied lieutenant roarkes voice stopped her before shed taken two steps toward the door what where are you going central to review the security discs see if i can spot the rings you can do that here and on this equipment a great deal faster computer replay security disc royal bar june six twentytwo fortyfive working display selection wait a minute youve got visual security on the lounge i believe in being thorough she cursed under her breath you couldve mentioned it seeing its so much more effective wall screen one the lounge spilled onto the screen all opulence and color the elegant sat at tables or glided on the dance floor while those who served them moved with seamless efficiency from table to booth from booth to what she assumed was the kitchen the images sped up as roarke manually ordered fastforward he should be coming along any ah he stopped the progress froze the screen eve stepped closer concentrating on his hands cant see the ring from this angle play it forward she waited watched him speak briefly to the evening hostess watched him being led to his reserved booth his hands were under the table and out of view when jamal stepped up to greet him come on come on come on eve urged scratch your nose or something jamal returned with the bottle of champagne the flutes completed the setup but when he offered to pour the wine he was impatiently waved away freeze image eve ordered but roarke already had increase sector twenty through thirty fifty percent when roarke repeated her request eve realized the unit was set for his voice command only any irritation she might have felt was overpowered by the satisfaction of seeing the ruby ring in full detail i want a printout of that how many give me a dozen and transfer this disc run to my office unit and peabodys ppc peabody opened her mouth then wisely decided not to ask how a civilian could transfer data to an official unit without pass codes and electronic authorization lets see if we can save some time peabody i want you to do link calls to the jewelers show them the image of the ring see if we can tag the shop or craftsman who made it is there a place she can set up here for maybe an hour eve asked roarke of course he contacted his executive assistant on the interoffice communicator ariel officer peabody requires a private workspace shell meet you at main he glanced at peabody just go out to the main reception this floor ariel will take care of it great and with visions of another sparkling mango in her future peabody headed out youll want to see the rest of this roarke said and resumed play at normal speed and range onscreen the killer lined the flutes side by side he poured a half glass of each scanning the room as they foamed and bubbled his hand lifted hovered over one of the glasses freeze enhance she walked to within inches of the screen and saw clearly the trickle of clear liquid spilling from his hand into the glass when i get this bastard the pas going to do fucking cartwheels over this disc resume play same enhancement quarter speed there there look at that hes got a vial palmed in his hand premeasured or im a monkeys butt and i can attest youre not time stamp roarke continued shows hes given himself a few minutes leeway in case shes early hes filled both glasses now set the spiked one across the table give me full view again look at him look at his face awful damned pleased with himself a little private toast now he makes the call his partner everythings in place cant wait to get home and tell you how it went well get a lip reader to study this see how close i am here she comes roarke commented moniqua stepped into the lounge hesitated then her lips curved there he is shes thinking eve said quietly and hes handsome just as she hoped he would be look perfect gentlemans getting up takes her hand a little peck on the knuckles for that romantic touch champagne how delightful click glasses perfect script youd hardly notice that predatory look on his face as she drinks if you didnt know he was a monster if you didnt know in his mind hes killing her right now ill never know how you do this day after day roarke spoke from behind her now laying his hands on her shoulders to rub at the knots of tension because i know in my mind ill get him them both of them they think theyve covered all the angles but you never hit them all there are always mistakes little mistakes he thinks hes safe thinks hes smart anybody looking at them would see shes the one making the moves here shes the one sliding closer in the booth touching his arm his hair leaning in whod look at that pretty scene and see rape it hurts you dont tell me it doesnt he said and there was an edge in his voice you bandage it but it hurts you it only makes me work harder to stop him oh jeez theres charles and louise is that why you sent peabody out i dont need her distracted and im not thinking about her weirdass platonic thing with charles and her weirderass sexual one with mcnab because it distracts me what is it standard seduction plan a champagne and caviar you preferred coffee and red meat as i recall ill take real cow over a bunch of fish eggs any there hes given her a booster same little palm deal new vial two doses in her before they get to her place thats off lab found traces of whore in the living room glass rabbit in the bedroom but her tox screen didnt put that much whore in her system thats why shes not dead shes drinking it roarke pointed out yeah giving him a little hand job under the table and swilling it back he gives her the third dose at her place how does her system absorb that much because it didnt she purged sicked it up shes slim but not skinny eve mused doesnt look like the eating disorder type probably just got queasy when she was in the lounge here or at home tossed up some of the wine and fish eggs and enough of the drug to keep her system from fully overloading mistake she said he didnt think of that when he left her she was out cold and he took her for dead tells me hes not a doctor or any sort of medtech its the other guy who knows that end this ones just the computer freak run the disc from the second murder i want to see if i can get a good image of that ring too o o kevin you really are becoming tedious there was a mechanical whoosh and a fog of cold air as lucias unsealed the cryounit and selected the desired solution in its freezer pack the first time youre nearly hysterical because the girl died now youre biting your nails because this one didnt i didnt mean to kill the first one and did the second with tongs lucias set the pack in a slot in a treated glass tray id say as far as the game goes old friend youre in the minus column youre the one doing the cooking suspicion mixed with anger and fear made kevins voice ugly whats to stop you from playing around with the mix for my bag a sense of fair play of course cheating would lessen the satisfaction of winning we agreed on the honor system kev shes very likely to die so dont mark your score card quite yet thats the spirit and again in the interest of fair play i suggest we consider her hospitalization as five points as we put death at a full ten if your little playmate dies before i get home from my date tonight youll actually be in the lead again cant get fairer than that and if she doesnt he shrugged then slid the tray with its various packs into a thin compartment programmed time and temperature i go ahead we can increase the stakes with some double booking two in one day the horror and the thrill of the idea struck kevin simultaneously if youre man enough we havent prepared the schedule calls for three nights off after this evenings round none of the targets are in line until next week schedules are for amateurs and drones lucias prepared them both a little cocktail unblended scotch with a dash of zoner lets rack them up kev well both have impressive american scores before we move the game to france a picnic in the park kevin considered an afternoon rendezvous yes that might be fun and it would be best to start mixing up our methods toss the police a sudden curve to screw up their probabilities and profiles day games they have their own special panache dont you think chapter thirteen no pops on the rings eve told her team shed had to pull rank step on toes and bribe the scheduling clerk with a block of swiss chocolate but shed managed to hook a conference room roarke was good for the chocolate and would only smirk a little at the bribery angle best weve got is theyre not heirlooms the jewelers peabody tapped agree that theyre not antiques if the stones and settings are genuine the values estimated at two hundred fifty k each any guy wears a quarter mil on his fingers a putz was feeneys opinion and a showoff agreed putz and showoff percentages are high i want to take the search on them global so im passing that ball to edd and shed tap her own personal source on showoff items roarke might not wear baubles himself but he was sure an expert at buying them and draping them all over her imagings working with the waiter but its slow hes a lot clearer on the rings than the guys wearing them we can access security discs for the last week or two weeks from the palace but itll take time to pick through them and luck to home in on our men ill be doing that run personally but meanwhile if nothing jumps by morning im going to request our witness agrees to hypnotherapy theres no guarantee they werent wearing enhancements when they met for drinks mcnab pointed out and earned a rare nod of approval from eve thats right but we detail the image anyway we keep building the box until we lock them inside progress on the rental unit she glanced at feeney and dont crawl up my ass funny you should ask we cleaned out most of the chatter you wouldnt believe the shit people send through rentals porn sites win ten to one its so good to have my view of the general citizenship reinforced after that you got your entertainment and amusement sites then your financials personal email comes after most promising user name is wordsworth all his transmissions are cloaked you get through one layer of the cloak and the sucker bounces you to another locale he shot the goods from the cyberjoint to madrid start picking there and it bounces to delta colony then i get the picture what did you find feeney sulked a little crunched on nuts i uncloaked one transmission so far looks like he did three maybe four more the one i stripped down went to an account registered to stefanie finch a lot of mushy stuff shoot the mushy stuff and her address to my units youre a cyberwizard feeney that soothed his ruffles yeah dont i know it i gotta take a couple hours medical get a quick eye fix detective cyberwiz herell keep on it im in the field peabody with me peel off she ordered as she strode out and toward a glide snag me an energy bar or something meet me in the garage in ten i need to stop by my office first theres vending right outside the bullpen the vending machines around here hate me they steal my credits and laugh in my face youve had your vending privileges suspended again for kicking the equipment havent you i didnt kick it i punched it and just get me the damn bar without waiting for a response eve hopped the glide and flipped out her communicator to check in with the imaging tech peabody merely sighed and backtracked to the closest food vender she was perusing the choices debating between energy or chemical sweetener for herself when mcnab came up behind her since their session the night before she expected him to go for a little pinch or grab but he dipped his hands into two of the twelve pockets in his butter yellow trousers and just stood there you doing okay he asked her yeah just ordering up a few boosts figuring dallas could have them both in the field for hours yet she went for energy and sweetener i figure youre bent about what happened you shouldnt be stuff like that doesnt mean anything thinking of pizza and the frantic bout of sex on her living room floor the second more thorough session in her bed she felt her stomach tighten right who said it meant anything im just saying you shouldnt be like embarrassed or upset she turned to him kept her face absolutely stone still do i look embarrassed or upset to you look you dont want to talk about it fine with me his personal sense of outrage leaped up snagged him by the throat charles had all but rubbed his new lady in peabodys face and she still couldnt see him for what he was everybody knows it was never going anywhere if you thought otherwise then you deserve just what you get thanks for the bulletin and you can just she searched for something and settled on eves favored suggestion bite me shoving him aside with her elbow she marched to the nearest glide fine he kicked the vending machine storming off as it issued the standard warning if she wanted to get twisted up over having her pet lc trot another woman out under her nose why the hell should he care by the time peabody made it to the garage shed eaten her energy bar and started on the candy and she was steaming already in the vehicle eve merely held out a hand then hissed when peabody slapped the bar into her palm sharply enough to burn i should have kicked his ass just mopped the floor with his skinny bony ass christ in defense eve shot out of her slot dont start im not starting im finished pig bastard wants to stand there and tell me i shouldnt be embarrassed shouldnt be upset because last night didnt mean anything i will not listen i will not listen i will not listen eve repeated over and over in her head finch lives on riverside drive alone employed as shuttle pilot for intercommuter air hes the one who came knocking on my door with his pitiful pizza and big sloppy smile shes twentyfour eve said desperately single perfect fit for target profile of killer number one and whos everyone who the hell is everyone peabody if i just agree that mcnab is a pig bastard that you should kick his ass even give you my solemn word that i will help you kick the pig bastards ass at the first reasonable opportunity can we pretend were focused on this investigation yes sir peabody sniffed but id appreciate it if you would not speak the pig bastards name in my presence ever again thats a deal were going to finchs once i get a sense of her well see if she can stand up as bait or needs to be removed to protective custody next on the list is mcnamara we pin him down today on or off planet if mcnab the pig bastard she corrected when peabodys head snapped around manages to uncloak any more target accounts we move on them immediately the civilian targets are priority understood sir check in with the officer on duty at the hospital were more likely to get word from our own first on any change in the victims condition than we are from medical staff yes sir can i say one more thing about the pig bastard absolutely the last thing i have to say on the subject the last thing well then i cant wait to hear it i hope his balls shrivel up like overbaked prunes then fall off in useless husks a very pleasant final image i applaud you now tag the guard shuttle pilots eve decided pulled in a fine fat per annum the apartment building was swank and silver a shining spear ringed by glides that allowed residents and guests private exterior access if they were cleared as shed already had her height quota for the next little while eve chose the interior access the electronic greeting station requested her business her name and destination in a pleasant and nononsense tone police business dallas lieutenant eve and aide to see stefanie finch she held her badge up to the security screen listened to the faint hum as it was scanned and verified im sorry lieutenant dallas ms finch is not in residence at this time you may leave a message for her by requesting visitor voice mail when is she expected back im sorry lieutenant dallas i am not authorized to give that information without a warrant i bet roarke owns this place peabody commented as she gazed around the spacious blackandsilver lobby its his style i bet if you told it youre his wife no it irritated her just to think about it i want to see the resident or residents in apartment nextdoor neighbor good thinking one moment lieutenant dallas mrs hargrove is in residence ill submit your request for visitation yeah you do that how do people stand being closed up in these places eve wondered like little ants in a hive i think its bees in a hive ants are shut up peabody yes sir mrs hargrove will allow visitation lieutenant dallas and aide please use elevator bank five enjoy your visit and the rest of your day alicanne hargrove turned out to be not only willing but thrilled at the visit police she all but pulled eve into her apartment so exciting has there been a robbery no maam id like to speak to you regarding stefanie finch stef the animation on alicannes pretty face faded oh my goodness shes all right isnt she she just left this morning for a shuttle run as far as i know shes fine you and ms finch are friendly yes very oh im sorry sit down she gestured to the painfully modern living area with its trio of gelsofas to eve they looked big enough squishy enough to swallow any number of household pets thanks but this wont take long can you tell me if you know if ms finch is seeing anyone socially men stef sees a lot of men shes a dynamo anyone named wordsworth oh the poet shes been having a romance with him through email i think theyre scheduled to meet when she gets back from her shuttle run day after tomorrow shell be based in london until then it seems to me she said theyd made a tentative date for next week drinks at the top of new york but the way stef juggles men i cant be sure if she gets in touch or comes back before schedule ask her to contact me its urgent card peabody peabody dug out one of eves cards passed it over can i tell her what its about just tell her to contact me right away thanks for your time oh but wouldnt you like some coffee or she trotted hopefully after them as eve strode out track her down peabody her own communicator beeped dallas lieutenant truehearts earnest face filled the tiny screen i think somethings going on three medical staff just went into the subjects room including dr michaels and he came on the run stand by trueheart im on my way o o since the floor nurse all but threw herself in front of the icu doors eve gave her sixty seconds to produce dr michaels he whisked out with a swirl of his long white coat and an annoyed expression lieutenant this is a hospital not a police station you can consider it both as long as moniqua cline is your patient whats her status shes conscious very disoriented her vital signs show improvement but are still in the dangerous range shes far from out of the woods i need to question her hers isnt the only life at stake hers is the life under my care because one hard case recognized another eve nodded dont you think shed rest easier knowing the person who did this to her has been put away look im not going to interrogate her im not going to browbeat her i understand the pathology of the victim i appreciate the import of your investigation lieutenant but this woman isnt a tool eve kept her voice steady shes not just a tool to me but to the man who put her here shes less than that shes a game piece bryna bankhead and grace lutz didnt have a chance to tell anyone what happened to them whatever he saw in her face had him pushing open the door just you he said and im staying with her that works for me peabody stand by a nurse monitored the machines and spoke in a soothing voice though moniqua didnt respond eve thought she heard something her eyes traveled back and forth as if measuring the glass box of the room they flicked over eve passed on then lingered on michaelss face im so tired was all she said and her voice fluttered soft as bird wings you need to rest he stepped to the bed and covered her hand with his in that gesture eves confidence in him solidified moniqua wasnt just a patient to him she was a person this is lieutenant dallas she needs to ask you some questions i dont know im going to stay right here ms cline eve took the other side of the bed so that moniqua lay between her and the doctor i know youre confused and youre tired but anything you can tell me will help i dont remember you corresponded through email with an individual you knew as byron yes we met in a chat nineteenthcentury poets you agreed to meet him last night for drinks at the royal bar in the palace hotel her brow pale as marble creased yes at ninethirty was that last night wed been talking online for weeks and i met him i remember what else do you remember i i was a little nervous at first wed hit it off so well in cyber but real lifes different still it was just drinks and in such a lovely setting if it didnt work out what was the harm but it did he was just as i expected did i have an accident am i dying youre doing very well michaels told her youre very strong you had drinks with him eve continued drawing her attention away from michaels again what did you talk about moniquas face went vague again talk about with byron when you had drinks with him last night oh ah poetry and art travel we both like to travel though hes been so many more places than i have we had champagne and caviar ive never had caviar before i dont think it agreed with me i must have gotten ill were you ill at the hotel no i no i dont think i must have had too much to drink im usually careful not to have more than one glass i remember i remember now feeling very strange but good happy he was so perfect so attractive i kissed him kept kissing him i wanted to get a room in the hotel thats not like me her fingers pulled weakly at the sheet i mustve had too much to drink you suggested getting a room in the hotel yes he laughed it wasnt a pleasant laugh but i was so drunk i didnt care why did i drink so much and he said take me home with you and well do things the poets write of she closed her eyes corny but it didnt seem corny then he told me to pay the check i wasnt offended or surprised that he meant for me to pay even though hed made the date i went in to freshen up and all i could think was i was going to have amazing sex with this perfect man and i could hardly wait to get my hands on him we took a cab i paid for that too and in the cab the faintest color washed into her cheeks i think i mustve dreamed all this i must have dreamed it he whispered a suggestion in my ear what he wanted me to do she opened her eyes again i went down on him in the cab i couldnt wait to it wasnt a dream was it no it wasnt a dream what did he give me she groped for eves hand her fingers trying to squeeze but only twitching what was in those drinks her hand moved restlessly eve covered it gripped it i wasnt drunk was i it was like being hypnotized you werent drunk moniqua and youre not responsible for anything you did he drugged you tell me what happened when you got to your apartment she needs to rest now michaels glanced at the monitors back at eve shes talked long enough you have to leave no moniquas fingers moved in eves hand he gave me something that made me do those things to him with him made me let him do those things to me he nearly killed me didnt he very nearly eve agreed but youre a hell of a lot stronger than he anticipated help me catch him tell me what happened in your apartment its hazy i was dizzy queasy he put on music lit candles he had candles in his bag and another bottle of champagne i didnt want anymore but he wanted me to drink i did exactly what he asked me to do every time he touched me i wanted him to touch me again he said it needed to be perfect that he was going to prepare set the stage i should wait i felt sick i didnt want to tell him i felt sick because he might not stay so when he went into the bedroom i went into the bath and was sick after i felt a little better steadier i went into the bedroom he had champagne by the bed and dozens of candles lighted there were rose petals all over the bed pink roses like the ones he must have sent me at work a few days before id never had anyone go to such trouble tears spilled down her cheeks it was so lovely almost painfully romantic i actually loved him in that instant when i walked in and saw him i was wildly recklessly in love with him he undressed me said i was beautiful it was all very gentle at first very sweet and intimate a fantasy really after a while he handed me the glass i told him i didnt want more champagne but he just looked at me told me to drink it and i did then it wasnt gentle it was outrageous like going mad like becoming an animal i couldnt breathe couldnt think burning from the inside out and my heart beating so fast it felt like it would explode he was watching me i can see his eyes now watching me he told me to say his name but it wasnt his name what name was it kevin he told me his name was kevin then it was as if things inside me my head my body ripped and everything stopped i couldnt move or see or hear buried alive now she wept he buried me alive no he didnt eve leaned over before michaels could move in youre here and safe and alive hes never going to touch you again moniqua hes never going to touch you again she turned her face weakly to the pillow as the tears flowed i let him inside me no you didnt he violated you he forced you no i let he forced you eve repeated look at me listen to me he took your choice away and he raped you his weapon was a drug instead of a knife or his fists but it was still a weapon putting rose petals on the bed doesnt make what he did any less criminal but you beat him and im going to put him away for you i know someone you can talk to wholl help you through this i never told him to stop i didnt want him to youre not responsible this wasnt about sex rape never is this was about him controlling you you couldnt stop him last night but you can now dont let him control you now he raped me and then he left me to die i want him to pay for making me feel like this leave that part to me eve felt slightly ill when she stepped out again it was brutal always brutal for her to interview rape victims to look at them and see herself she took a moment bracing a hand against the outer doors waiting to settle again lieutenant she straightened turned to michaels you did very well with her id expected you to push for more detail i will next time ive got to dig out my rubber hose cant recall where i left it he offered a slow half smile i didnt expect her to live medically her chances were slim to none but thats one of the rewards of my profession the small miracles she still has a rough road ahead physically and emotionally you can contact dr charlotte mira impressed he angled his head dr mira if she cant treat moniqua personally shell give the case to the best rape therapist available you guys work on giving her back her physical and emotional health ill work on giving her justice she pushed through the doors signalled to peabody and kept going she wanted out of the hospital almost as much as she wanted to breathe sir peabody jogged to keep pace everything all right shes alive shes talking and shes given us the bastards first name kevin solid but i was talking about you you look a little whipped im fine i just hate fucking hospitals she muttered maintain the guard on moniqua and the checks on her condition make a note to contact mira and ask her to consult with michaels over her therapy i didnt think mira took private consults just make a note of it peabody she kept her breathing shallow until she shoved through the hospital doors and strode outside christ how do people stand being in those places ive got a personal call to make step aside will you call moniquas status into the commander and tell him my report will be forthcoming yes sir theres some benches just over there why dont you make that call sitting down because youre white as a sheet she wanted to say but knew better eve walked over to sit in a little area of green the city planners liked to call microparks the trio of dwarf trees and scatter of flowers were jammed into a narrow island between parking lots but she supposed it was the thought that counted still she wished theyd thought to plant something with fragrance she wanted the stench of hospital out of her system she wasnt sure where to tag roarke she tried his personal line first was switched to voice mail so she disconnected she put the next through to his midtown offices and hit on his admin i need to locate him of course lieutenant hes on a holotransmission if you wouldnt mind waiting a moment how are you right eve thought courtesy and conversation a duo she often neglected fine thanks how are you caro very well delighted the boss is back though it seems were busier yet when hes in the cockpit ill just beep in and let him know youre on the line waiting eve tipped her face back to the sun it was always cold in hospitals she thought the kind of cold that crept into her bones lieutenant she focused her attention on roarkes voice on his face onscreen whats wrong he queried nothing need a favor eve whats wrong nothing really moniqua cline regained consciousness i just finished questioning her shes going to tough this out but its hard on her and on you i know some of whats going through her head i know some of what shes going to feel in the middle of the night she shook it off thats not why i called and youre in the middle of a transmission it can wait a benefit of being in charge what can i do for you question is it possible for you to monitor a standard account monitor any email block same private citizens who attempt any of the above are in violation of eprivacy laws and subject to fines and or imprisonment which means you can oh i assumed the question was rhetorical he smiled at her who do you want me to monitor stefanie finch shes a potential target at the moment shes in the air somewhere between the us and england on shuttle runs when she lands i want to tell her who and what shes been playing with in hopes i can enlist her help to reel these guys in but i dont know how shell react and shes going to have too much time to fiddle around before i have her under control i cant chance her going off on a rip and tipping her cyberpal so you want to block all her transmissions and cyberactivities thats the ticket i dont want anything she sends getting through until im sure of her cooperation and i have a warrant to put a filter on her transmissions the warrants not going to cover us until shes back in new york you know how it excites me whenever you ask me to slip through one of the loops in the law remind me later why i married a pervert ill be happy to his smile spread because color had come back into her face how soon can you have it done i have some things to finish up here best to do this little task at home on the unregistered give me two hours oh lieutenant i dont suppose this bit of business goes into my report as expert consultant civilian kiss ass as long as its yours darling chapter fourteen when eve finally ran theodore mcnamara to ground she was shown into his office by a bird of a woman who chirped about the doctors demanding schedule and the need to keep the audience brief the doctor really has no time for an extra appointment today as you know dr mcnamara has just returned from a very important consult session on tarus ii hes about to have a very important consult session on planet earth eve returned for her own amusement eve lengthened her stride so the woman was forced to trot to keep up as they navigated the short breezeway that connected mcnamaras office to the main building at j forrester outside the glass a medicopter banked left for landing on the heliport of the adjoining hospital facilities she saw a half dozen medical personnel waiting for the transport and imagined the noise was horrendous but inside the breezeway the air was silent cool and faintly floral it appeared dr mcnamara had disconnected himself from the petty pains and troubles of those his facility served the breezeway opened into the office area done in stark white walls rugs consoles chairs even the uniforms of the drones who went silently about their business were unrelieved white it was eve thought like walking inside an eggshell they passed through a set of glass doors that whisked open silently at their approach and moved down yet another corridor at the end loomed a set of glossy white doors the woman knocked with a kind of fearful reverence the doors slid apart but the woman stood where she was lieutenant dallas and aide dr mcnamara yes yes see that were not disturbed ten minutes come in lieutenant my time is very valuable he sat in front of a wall of glass at a desk so massive and white it resembled an ice floe it stood on a platform three steps above the rest of the office so that mcnamara peered down an eagle on his perch at lesser mortals his hair was white a sleek closecut cap that hugged his skull he had a long hollowed face dominated by dark impatient eyes that scowled beneath the white peaks of his brows his black suit was a slash of power against the frigid white of the room golly peabody said under her breath its the great and powerful oz state your business he demanded im a busy man and one who liked to intimidate eve mused they were not invited to sit but even standing she was forced to look up to meet his gaze youd have saved us both time if youd returned the transmissions i sent to you on tarus ii the consult session was my priority i am not attached as a medical consultant to the nypsd which makes you a civilian and gives me the authority to continue this interview at cop central which i will enforce if necessary now we can continue this pissing contest or you can agree to cooperate youre in my office it appears i am cooperating annoyed eve strode up the steps to the platform she saw cold fury wash over his face as he was forced to tip his head back peabody stills though she knew it was small of her peabody enjoyed watching her lieutenant screw up the power structure of the room yes sir she passed the photos up eve laid them on the pristine surface of the desk do you recognize any of these women i do not bryna bankhead grace lutz moniqua cline ring any bells no funny as their names and faces have been all over the media the last few days his stare never wavered ive been off planet as you know last i heard they had media transmissions on tarus ii i dont have time for gossip and media blathering nor for guessing games now miss dallas if youd tell me what it is you wish to discuss lieutenant dallas you were involved in a research project partnered by j forrester and allegany pharmaceuticals that involved experimentation with certain controlled substances research on sexual dysfunction and infertility successful research he added that resulted in two landmark medications the project was aborted due to cost overruns lawsuits and rumors of substance abuse and sexual misconduct by project staff your information is flawed abuse was never substantiated the project produced important results and simply ran its course apparently someones still experimenting two women are dead anothers in critical condition they were given fatal doses of the substances commonly known as whore and wild rabbit in combination someone has a substantial supply of both or the means to create them drugs used to benefit mankind can and will be abused in the wrong hands its not my job to police the masses its yours who on your former research team might have those wrong hands all doctors and technicians who were involved were thoroughly screened and hand selected and still there was recreational and criminal use this isnt gossip or blathering she said before he could interrupt this is a murder investigation sex and power thats a heady temptation we were scientists not sex mongers why are all the records sealed why are there seals on all the civil cases brought against the project no civil cases were ever brought to trial no charges of misconduct were ever pressed therefore its a matter of privacy to seal records of frivolous suits that impinged upon the names and reputations of those associated with the project of maintaining dignity eve pushed the photographs closer someone invaded their privacy doctor bigtime and didnt leave them with their dignity that has nothing to do with me the project made a lot of money for its top people and its initial investors it takes a lot of money to play with these particular illegals im looking for two men men with the means to buy or create substantial quantities of those illegals men with expert knowledge of chemistry and electronics men who consider women not only fair game but disposable entertainment sexual predators dr mcnamara who worked with you who fits that bill i cant help you your problem has nothing to do with the project nothing to do with me the project created medication that changed lives i wont have you besmirch my work or my reputation because youre unable to do your job he shoved the stills back toward eve its more likely these women invited even encouraged the use of the drugs any woman who agrees to meet a man she knows only through mail is soliciting a sexual advance i guess she solicits them just because she was born with tits eve scooped up the stills it sounds like you caught some blathering after all i never mentioned how these women met their attackers your times up he pressed a button under the desk and the doors opened if you wish to speak with me again youll have to contact my attorneys if i hear any public mention of my name this facility or the project in connection with your investigation they will be contacting you she debated hauling him in then and there then punching her way through the legal uproar the media would go wild and the case could potentially be damaged by the exposure i always wonder how it is some doctors have such little respect for human life she stepped off the platform handed the stills to peabody well talk again she told him and strode out just before the doors clicked shut at her back hes a creep peabody said a misogynist and a demigod and he knows something i want a low profile on this so we play it by the book with him contact his reps and arrange a formal interview at central were going to put some pressure on breaking those sealed records get yourself back to central and start the paperwork hell fight it yeah but hell lose eventually im working from home ill pass on data as i get it o o roarke was already there when she arrived but she left the door between their offices closed she sat at her desk and began generating a series of reports she knew enough about politics and demigods to be certain shed have to cover her ass as far as mcnamara was concerned men like him didnt just call lawyers she had no doubt her commanders the chiefs the mayors even the governors ears would be ringing with her name in very short order she could handle the heat but she didnt want the fire taken off the case while it was scorching her ass when she was satisfied she transmitted copies to all appropriate parties next came the pitch to break sealed files for investigatory use in multiple homicides it was a tricky business and even if the request went through it would take precious days there was a quicker way she glanced up at the door that joined her workspace with roarkes quicker slicker and virtually undetectable if she gave him the job shed crossed that line before and would again if she had to but for now shed try the system computer absently she rubbed at the back of her neck all available data on mcnamara dr theodore display on wall screen working data displayed she rose working the tension out of her shoulders as she read the information the man was eightysix and obviously made good use of his face and body sculptors his education and work records were impressive hed had one marriage and one child from it a daughter eve pursed her lips and speculated when she heard the door behind her open she spoke without turning youve got a man who doesnt particularly like women as a species considers them inferior well to be fair considers everyone inferior but i got a definite vibe women were lowest on his feeding chain called me miss she grumbled and lived roarke stepped behind her and began rubbing her shoulders it passed briefly through her mind that he had some sort of weird psychic ability to hit just the right spot id have knocked him around for it but hes almost ninety anyway a guy like this has one kid and that kid turns out to be a female thatd be a disappointment wouldnt it i suppose it would if hes an asshole yeah hes an asshole so why didnt he try again until he got it right if the wife was the problem fertility or otherwise there are plenty of ways around it even forty fifty years ago there were ways around it but maybe he didnt have enough soldiers to do the job what a pisser speaking as a man i can say that finding oneself unable to create a child would be difficult to accept he brushed his lips over her hair and if a child was desired id do whatever could be done to fix the problem fertility tests they must be really personal embarrassing especially for a guy with a really whopping ego she glanced over her shoulder are you asking my opinion as you assume i have a really whopping ego we could fill madison square with your ego pal it just runs different than this jerks maybe it explains why he shifted gears from private practice into research sexual dysfunction and fertility research lets take a look at the daughter computer standard background run on dunwood sarah nee mcnamara working to show how goodnatured i am roarke began ill ignore that insult and tell you ive just finished my assignment transmissions are blocked and will be diverted to an account ive just created for you i didnt ask you to divert them two services for the price of one he whipped her around and crushed his mouth to hers his hands gripped her butt squeezed and molded her body against his there that ought to cover it stop trying to cloud my brain im on the clock data accessed display or audio display eve said even as roarke ordered audio conflicting command holding cut it out eve ordered as he tugged her shirt from her waistband whats wrong with you apparently not a thing but he laughed and let her muscle away display data shes fiftythree eve said followed in daddys footsteps right down the line same schools same training same hospital residency and straight into research one marriage one child carbon copy except she got the boy and look at his dob only a year after the start of the project shed already been married eight years wouldnt surprise me if she not only worked on the project but was part of the study she blew out a breath and what the hell does that have to do with murder theres a connect i know theres a connect her husband was part of the team too but hes too old for these hits and the sons too young what is he twentyone twentytwo he was an infant during the heyday of the project still computer access all available data dunwood lucias display on wall screen working o o while his data was being accessed a few blocks away lucias strolled into the formal parlor of his townhouse his grandfather rarely paid personal calls and certainly never spurofthemoment visits if the king dropped by there was a reason speculating on what it might be had luciass palms going damp he wiped them distractedly on his slacks before he entered the room smoothed them over his tight red curls then fixed a pleased and welcoming expression on his face grandfather what a wonderful surprise i didnt realize you were back i arrived last night where is kevin oh at his computers where else shall i arrange for drinks i have a very nice scotch i think youll approve of it this isnt a social call lucias i want to speak with kevin as well of course the sweat that had dampened his palms ran in a thin nasty line down his back he gestured casually to the waiting server droid tell mr morano my grandfathers here and wishes to see him immediately mcnamara added of course and how was your trip lucias went to the antique cabinet that held the liquor his grandfather might not want a drink but he needed one productive a word youve become unfamiliar with since you graduated college with honors lucias pointed out and poured scotch neat into heavy crystal just taking a sabbatical after years of study and actually ive been doing some work in my lab a pet project you know all about pet projects after all mcnamara turned away briefly the boy was a disappointment to him a severe disappointment he had helped create him handpicking the man hed deemed best suited for his daughter a man much like himself intelligent driven strong ambitious their inability to conceive a child had been a monumental frustration for him but had helped him launch the project the project that had advanced his career created his grandson and had very nearly ruined everything still he had risen above it his name had never been marred and never would be and hadnt he nurtured the child educated him molded him given him every opportunity to refine and develop the superior mind hed been born with instead the boy had been spoiled his mothers doing mcnamara thought grimly a womans weakness shed pampered and coddled him had ruined him now he was very much afraid that child had put his name his career his reputation in the greatest jeopardy what have you done lucias lucias downed the scotch poured more im not prepared to talk about the experiment though its coming along quite well i believe and how is grandmother as ever he took the glass lucias offered studied his grandsons face and saw what he had always seen a blank wall she misses you it seems you had no time to visit her or call while i was away well ive been a busy little bee the whiskey helped considerably ill be sure to make time for her very soon ah here comes kevin he went back to pour a drink for his friend and yet another for himself dr mcnamara what a delightful surprise so i just said myself lucias handed kevin the glass it isnt often were so privileged that will be all he said to the droid then dropped into a chair now what shall we talk about i want to see your lab mcnamara demanded im afraid not lucias sipped scotch you know how we mad scientists are about our experiments hushhush top secret after all i learned all about the sacrosanct from you didnt i youve been using illegals again no i havent i learned my lesson didnt i kevin we both learned our lessons well when you had us tucked quietly away in rehab on delta last year hushhush he said again and nearly giggled top secret youre a liar mcnamara exploded striding to his grandson knocking the heavy glass from his hand do you think i cant recognize the signs youre using again both of you destroying your minds your futures for a weakness a temporary indulgence that glass was an heirloom luciass hands wanted to shake but with anger as much as the innate fear the bonedeep loathing his grandfather always brought to him you should have more respect for family grandfather you speak to me of respect the police came to my office today they questioned me ive been ordered into interview tomorrow and theres a request being processed to open the sealed files on the project ohoh luciass bright blue eyes twinkled a mischievous boy caught in a prank as he looked at kevin now that would be quite the scandal what do you think kevin about having all those secrets the grand passions that conceived us both revealed i think it would be embarrassing in some quarters yes indeed couples well coupling under the fierce scrutiny of the exalted dr theodore mcnamara no candlelight and music to romanticize the exercise no indeed no muss no fuss just a clinical process hyped by sexual enhancement drugs with one purpose us he laughed now and swilled back scotch and a rousing success it was medical advancement procreation of the species mcnamaras voice trembled with rage i had assumed incorrectly it seems that both of you were mature enough to understand the scope of what you were part of but then we werent really part of it were we lucias countered we were simply part of the results i dont believe we were given a choice in the matter i dont believe a number of the participants were either isnt that what we discovered kev when we read through the files those files are sealed mcnamara said seals were made to be broken lucias continued just like rules you broke a number of rules grandfather in the name of science why shouldnt kevin and i do the same in the name of entertainment what have you done mcnamara demanded nothing to concern you it concerns me when im ordered into interview and it best concern you as well as questions will be asked about murdered women that lead to you to us kevin set down his drink but thats not possible how could they know shut up lucias sprang to his feet what did they say about us what did you tell them i didnt want to believe it mcnamara braced a hand on the back of a chair forced himself to stand when he wanted to sink you murdered those women dont be ridiculous murder youve lost your mind if youre in some sort of trouble with the police luciass tirade was cut short as mcnamara slapped him you disgust me all of my hopes for you my dreams and look at you youre worthless you and your pathetic friend all of your talent wasted wasted on games drugs and your selfish pursuit of pleasure you created me tears hot with humiliation from the slap stung luciass eyes you made me i gave you all that was in my power to give every advantage and it was never enough you gave me orders expectations ive detested you all my life i live as i choose to live now and theres nothing you can do youre right quite right and nothing i will do i wont clean up your mess this time i wont pay to have you protected nor will i sacrifice myself to shield you when they find you and they will find you i wont lift a hand you wont let them take me im all you have then god help us both changing tacks lucias grabbed mcnamaras arm put a plea in his voice grandfather we mustnt argue like this i apologize i was overwrought kevin and i have been working very hard working mcnamara repeated how did you come to be monsters with so much at your fingertips were scientists dr mcnamara kevin ranged himself beside lucias this is all a mistake thats all just a mistake there was an accident yes an accident lucias tried to nudge his grandfather into a chair and perhaps we got a little carried away but these things happen when you try to expand the box you understand that they were only women test subjects take your hands off me youll face this both of you youll pay the price for your actions if you want my help youll come with me to the police tomorrow ill arrange for a legal team and a psychiatric study were not crazy youd let them lock me up your own flesh and blood he leaped knocking over a table as he fell on top of his grandfather the priceless lamp that stood on it crashed and showered glass enraged mcnamara shoved lucias aside and tried to regain his feet for years i tried not to see what you were allowed myself to see you both of you as what i knew you could be he managed to kneel braced a hand on the arm of the chair what weve done is no different from what you did a generation ago lucias swiped a trembling hand over his mouth you dosed test subjects some with their knowledge some without for the purpose of copulation and conception you did it for procreation so you say were doing it for fun and with more style youve killed a lab rat is a lab rat and an acceptable sacrifice it was horror now that clutched in mcnamaras throat youve destroyed yourselves im going to the police the two of you are nothing but an experiment gone wrong with a cry of fury lucias snatched up the base of the lamp used it like a club were men men blood sprayed over the chair the rug as mcnamara slumped to the side flailed out to try to defend himself theyll send us to prison to prison stupid old bastard he staggered to his feet screaming as he pounded his grandfather to the floor i wont go in a cage because you have no vision breath heaving lucias stepped back tossed the bloodied lamp aside my god kevins voice was soft almost reverent is he dead mcnamaras face was bloody his mouth agape still panting lucias crouched down and checked for a pulse no not yet then he sat back on his haunches and forced himself to think but he will be he has to be hed give us over to the police give us over like we were nothing though his breathing was shallow kevin nodded we cant let that happen well finish it lucias got carefully to his feet but not here we have to take him away from the house make it look like a robbery you ive never seen anything ive done us both a favor staring down at his grandfather lucias patted kevins arm he was in control again perhaps he realized fully in control for the first time in his life hes outlived his usefulness and hes a danger to us so we take him out of the equation it has to be done but my god ive never seen so much blood if youre going to be sick get it over with no im not going to be sick he couldnt look away so much blood its fascinating the others the women it was almost gentle really but this he moistened his lips and his face was pale and shining as he looked at his friend how did it feel when you struck him how did it feel lucias had to stop and consider his hands slick with blood were steady now his mind already clearing powerful he decided extremely energizing i want to try it well finish him off together then but not here lucias checked his wrist unit we have to work quickly i have a date tonight o o it didnt take long all things considered it was a matter of pulling his grandfathers car into the garage as a point of pride and control dr mcnamara made a habit of driving himself nearly everywhere he wouldnt lucias thought drive himself to his final destination with kevins help he wrapped his grandfathers nude body in plastic and folded it into the trunk he might have told someone he was coming here kevin pointed out low probability he disliked sharing personal business your grandmother her least of all lucias tossed the bag of clothes and valuables into the trunk it wouldnt have occurred to him to bother nor would it occur to her to ask if he had any plans now he slammed the trunk closed brushed his hands together youve reprogrammed the droid check therell be no record we had any company excellent we have the location for disposal your computer scan indicated was the best for our purposes you follow in your car we finish it then dump him and the goodie bag you did weigh it down enough didnt you absolutely itll sink to the bottom of the river and he wont perfect we torch the car drive back home and i have plenty of time to dress for my evening out youre a cool one lucias ive always admired that about you thank you well wed best be off you know this will be a record two perfect crimes in one night ill have to claim the lions share of points for the first though i cant argue about that kevin gave him a friendly smack on the shoulder o o clean as a whistle eve said as she studied luciass data that either makes him a droid or a whats that term mavis uses dweebazoid no school infractions no traffic violations following right along with the family tradition too thats why theyre called family traditions roarke pointed out what will ours be i wonder crime of course but which side of the spectrum she spared him a look hes got his own residence here in the city im going to make time to talk to him hes rolling in money so hes a hit there hes got knowledge of chemistry attractive young man roarke commented nodding toward the picture beside the written data young being the operative word hes barely been out of university a full year im checking him out and ill use checking him out to see if it makes his grandfather a little more forthcoming he pissed you off thats affirmative and im going to piss him off right back when i get authority to open the sealeds i can get that data for you ive already had you do an unauthorized and illegal computer block lets leave our black marks to a minimum the block may save a life thats no black mark and i can get you some of that sealed data by perfectly legal means a single link call to a source at allegany who worked on the project if you want names to run ill get you names just a call very simple then do it all right but itll cost you because she recognized the gleam in his eye she narrowed her own get out im not paying for information with sex consider it taking one for the team he suggested and tumbled her into the sleep chair by the time shed paid up her ears were ringing and every ounce of tension had melted out of her body it seemed her bones had melted along with it as she discovered when she tried to stand she wore only her boots and the diamond pendant hed once given her you know if you hadnt become a cop you might have had a future in porn vids and i mean that in the best possible way christ eve youre a picture dont even think about trying for a second round i want that data pal a deals a deal he rose fluidly wearing nothing but his grin why dont you order us up a meal of some sort he suggested as he started for his office im starving she watched him go talk about pictures she thought if she didnt consider herself on duty shed have been tempted to sprint after him tackle him and sink her teeth into his really superior ass instead shed settle for an autochef burger she leaned down scooped up her clothes catch she straightened and as her arms were full took the robe he tossed her in the face might as well be comfortable he said and oh darling i could use a glass of wine chapter fifteen a cheeseburger wouldnt have been his first choice particularly with the savignon blanc but it was eves show why didnt you tell me about this guy before he watched eve shake a blizzard of salt over her fries and winced had your blood pressure checked lately just answer the question you had a lot of irons in the fire so i took this one stiles was bound to be more cooperative with me than with you as illustrated by the fact that after only minimal grousing hes digging through his files and his memory youll have your data by the time we finish this delightfully adolescent meal more onion rings you trust him i do yes stiles makes a career out of being irritable but under the rough exterior is an equally rough but honest interior youd like him it was plain roarke did and she trusted his instincts what i need is project staff who got a little too involved with the experimentation people who might have taken it home with them their family friends associates and so i explained relax lieutenant or youll give yourself indigestion he watched her scarf up onion rings though thats pretty much a given in any case youre just sulking because i didnt pick out rack of lamb or something the murders are connected to the project it just follows logic you have to figure supply and intent you dont pick these particular illegals up on the street derivatives diluted clones but not the pure goods she lifted her wineglass studied the pale gold liquid just like this stuff you cant walk into the corner liquor store a twentyfourseven and cop a bottle of this you can get cheap substitutes inferior what do you call them labels but for the snooty stuff you need a highend supplier and the wherewithal or your own vineyard or your own vineyard she agreed you got that you can drink it like water he doesnt settle for substitutes hes better than that deserves the very best the best illegals the best wines the best clothes and the women of his choice just another commodity he has the means to indulge himself in every vice isnt it probable hes worked his way up to this ultimate indulgence yeah if you go by percentages probabilities of profiling but theres more to it because there are two of them teamwork competition mutual dependence the first one fucked up he hadnt worked his way up to killing yet so he panicked but that upped the stakes second guy cant let his pal get ahead of him hes got more violence in him and isnt afraid of seeing that part of himself he enjoys it then you bounce back to the first player and he messes up again he leaves her alive hes losing the game youre dismissing multiple personalities even if its mps were dealing with two but im more inclined toward the simple route two styles two killers i wonder if anybody on the project list had two sons brothers maybe it would make sense if or childhood friends she shifted her attention back to roarke guys who grew up together thats like brotherhood isnt it he thought of mick it is more so in a way as you dont have the family dynamics the antagonisms getting in the way with mick and brian and the rest of us we were a family we created rather than one wed been born into its a powerful bond okay tell me this from a species that does the majority of its thinking with its penis i resent that i dont think with my penis more than twentyfive percent of the time tell that to somebody you didnt just nail in the sleep chair and i can tell you it took very little thought but your question is guysll bang anything if they get the chance yes and were proud of it no offense thats just the way the machine works but when they have a choice a selection even a fantasy they tend toward a certain type most commonly that fantasy or type is based on a female figure that was or is important to the man either the type resembles that figure in some way or opposes it since i assume in this case youre eliminating basic chemistry emotion and relationship i wont disagree the female machine runs much the same way yeah thats how he gets them molding himself into their fantasy but im betting the women he selects are looking for the type he is or appears to be on the surface he doesnt have to change much why should he its his game im going to run some probabilities roarke heard the signal from his office for incoming data stiles came through ill transfer that over for you thanks she glanced at her wrist unit ninefifteen she announced nearly date time o o her name was melissa kotter and she was from nebraska a genuine farm girl whod fled the fields for the bright lights of the big city she had hopes as did thousands of other young women who streamed into new york of being an actress a serious actress of course one who would remain true to her art infusing new life into the classic roles played by all the greats whod trod the board before her while she was waiting to light up broadway she waited tables went to auditions and took whatever work came her way it was in her opinion the way all the great artists began their careers at twentyone she was full of optimism and innocence and dreams she waited tables with tireless cheer and her farmfresh looks earned her as many tips as her speedy service she was blonde blueeyed and delicate of build a sociable creature melissa had made a number of friends she was always eager for friendships conversation experiences she adored new york with the passion of a new lover and in the six months shed lived in the city her affection hadnt dimmed by a watt shed told her acrossthehall neighbor wanda about her date that night and had laughed off her friends concerns the media reports about the murdered women didnt apply to her hadnt sebastian brought them up himself hadnt he said hed understand completely if she didnt feel comfortable meeting him tonight as shed told wanda hed hardly have brought the matter up if he was a dangerous individual he was a wonderful man intelligent erudite exciting and so very different from all the boys back home most of them hadnt known chaucer from chesterfield but sebastian knew all about poetry and plays hed traveled all over the world had attended performances in all the great theaters shed read his emails over and over until she could recite them by heart no one who could write such lovely things could be anything but wonderful and he was meeting her at jeanlucs one of the most exclusive clubs in the city she made the dress herself patterning it after a gown worn by the actress helena grey when shed accepted her tony the previous year the deep midnight blue material was synthetic rather than silk but it had a lovely drape with it she wore the pearl earrings her grandmother had given her on her twentyfirst birthday in november they looked almost real dripping from her lobes the shoes and the bag had been snagged on sale at macys she did a quick laughing twirl how do i look you look mag mel but i wish you wouldnt go stop being such a worrywart wanda nothings going to happen to me wanda bit her lip she looked at melissa and saw a little woolly lamb whod bah cheerfully as she was led to the slaughter maybe ill call in sick hang out here in your place until you get home dont be silly you need the money go on go get ready for work melissa draped an arm around wandas shoulders and walked her to the door if it makes you feel better ill call you when i get back promise scouts honor i think im going to order a martini ive always wanted to try one which do you think is more sophisticated gin or vodka vodka she decided before wanda could weigh in a vodka martini very dry with a twist you call me the minute you get back and dont you bring him up here no matter what i wont melissa twirled herself to the stairs wish me luck i do be careful melissa dashed down all three flights feeling very glamorous she called out greetings to neighbors struck a pose at the wolf whistle delivered by mr tidings in when she rushed out on the sidewalk her cheeks were flushed and rosy she thought about taking a cab but since she had more time than money thought it best to take the subway uptown she joined the hordes on the underground platform humming to herself as she anticipated the evening she squeezed on the train and stood propped up by bodies crowds didnt bother her she thrived on them if she hadnt been so busy writing the script for her meeting with sebastian shed have struck up any number of conversations with her fellow passengers it was only with onetoone encounters with men she found herself shy and tonguetied but she was sure she was positive shed be neither with sebastian it was as if they were made for each other when the train jerked to an abrupt halt and the lights dimmed she was tossed unceremoniously against the burly black man wedged in beside her excuse me thats cool sister aint enough to you to put a dent in i wonder whats wrong she tried to see through people over them in the greenish wash of emergency lighting always some mess with this uptown train dont know why they dont fix the sumbitch he skimmed his gaze down her and up again you got you some date doncha yes i hope were not delayed long or ill be late i hate being late look like you guys not gonna mind a wait his friendly face went hard and cold and sent melissas heart bounding to her throat brother you wanna take your fingers off this ladys purse or im gonna break em into little pieces melissa jolted snatched her purse around to press it to her belly she glanced back and caught a glimpse of the small man in a dark trench coat as he slithered back into the jammed bodies oh thank you sometimes i forget to be careful dont pay to forget you keep that purse close yes i will thank you again im melissa melissa kotter bruno biggs they just call me biggs cause i am during the tenminute delay she chatted with him she learned he worked in construction had a wife named ritz and a baby boy they called bj for bruno junior by the time theyd reached her stop shed given him the name of the restaurant where she worked and had invited him to bring his family in for dinner as people gushed off the train she waved and let herself be swept along by the current bruno saw her trying to hurry along her purse once again trailing behind her he shook his head and muscled his way off just before the doors closed melissa broke free of the crowd and raced up the stairs she was going to be late unless she ran the last three blocks she made a dash for the corner something hit her from behind low on the back and sent her pitching forward the strap of her purse snapped clean she managed one short scream as she tumbled off the curb there were shrieking brakes shouts then a bright blinding pain as she hit the street she heard something else snap ms kotter melissa bruno bent over her god almighty sister i thought youd get yourself run over got this back for you he shook her purse i i forgot to be careful okay now okay you need the mts how bad you hurt i dont know my arm shed broken the arm and saved her life o o eight hundred and sixtyeight names eve squeezed the bridge of her nose just couldnt be simple that doesnt include building

you i couldnt possibly infringe on your valuable time coward you bet come on give me a shot what have you got cooking ive a number of pots simmering just now he dipped his hands in his pockets and tried to think which project or negotiation currently on his plate she could poke into with the least possible damage her desk link beeped saved so to speak by the bell well get back to this she warned him i sincerely hope not dallas lieutenant dallas stefanie finch youve been trying to reach me thats right where are you located just got back to new york had the last couple runs cancelled

she grabbed the boots and trotted out see you later o o stefanie didnt pretend to be pleased she opened the door and led with a scowl id she snapped eve flipped open her badge holding it out while stefanie took a good long look ive heard about you the cop who hooked roarke nice job gee thanks ill let him know you said so stefanie merely jerked a thumb toward peabody whats with the uniform my aide do we come in stefanie or do we discuss this in the hallway stefanie stepped back closed the door behind them i just had two lucrative runs cancelled my union rep is talking strike which is going

the worthless bastard the last six months we were together bailed him out twice on drunk and disorderlies then he she trailed off apparently i still have issues point is i was looking for his opposite somebody with some polish who could do more than grunt when he wanted another beer i guess i was looking for a little romance and he said all the right things bingo if its too good to be true its probably a big fat lie looks like i forgot that motto but a picnic in the park middle of the damn day youd think that would be safe i can handle myself she added i benchpress one twenty im a fifth degree black belt im nobodys victim no way hed take me down eve sized her up and agreed under most conditions the woman could probably handle herself just fine he plans to drug you with a very potent sexual illegal youd bring him back here because youd think its your call hed light candles put on music give you more laced wine hed sprinkle pink rose petals on the bed bullshit but shed gone white thats bullshit you wouldnt think of it as rape while it happened youd do everything he told you to do when he gave you the second drug youd lap it right up for him while your system overloaded your heart would give out you wouldnt even know youre dead you want to scare me stefanie got to her feet paced youre doing a damn good job thats right i want to scare you thats what he plans thats what

the time youre not going to speak or contact anyone about this as far as wordsworth is concerned youre meeting him tomorrow were there any plans to confirm the date only to cancel i was to let him know by noon if i had to cancel stand up a minute when stefanie obeyed eve rose as well circled her judged build height yeah two can play the disguise game when were done here you can play it two ways you can pack what you need and ill arrange to have you put in a safe house tonight or if you want to stay here ill have a couple of cops stay over with you either way youll sleep better oh yeah ill sleep like a baby tonight o o eve wasnt the only one putting in overtime mcnab was on a mission of his own hed fueled himself up for it with two bottles of home brew which were currently burning at his stomach lining he wasnt drunk hed stopped short of getting drunk because he wanted to be clearheaded when he kicked charles monroes pansy ass unaware hed become the target of a jealous and slightly queasy edetective charles nibbled on louises fingers they were sharing a late supper in his apartment i appreciate you agreeing to start the evening so late we both have odd schedules its wonderful wine she sipped wonderful food and i like your home very much more than a restaurant i wanted you to myself ive wanted you to myself all day i told you i havent had much luck with relationships charles she rose to wander to the windows im singleminded driven and havent given any relationship ive been in the attention it needs deserves i think your lucks about to change he turned her to face him i know mine has louise he lowered his head skimmed his lips lightly over hers once then twice drawing her in he circled her into a dance deepening the kiss when her arms came around him bringing her closer when she trembled come to bed with me he whispered let me touch you her head fell back as his mouth trailed along her throat wait just wait charles she eased back ive thought about this i spent entirely too much time thinking about this today and last night since i first saw you part of my problem is overthinking things she stepped away needing a little distance theres such a pull i havent felt a pull like this ever she managed but im not going to bed with you i cant he kept his eyes on hers nodded slowly i understand its difficult for you to accept the idea of being intimate with me difficult she said with a half laugh no i wouldnt say difficult you dont need to explain i know what i am she shook her head what you are licensed companions dont generally have a lot of luck with personal relationships either not real ones in any case im sorry she held up a hand you think i wont have sex with you because youre a professional charles that insults both of us he walked back to the table picked up his wineglass im confused i dont want to sleep with you now because its happening too fast because i think what im feeling for you goes deeper than that and id like a chance to find out before id just like to slow down a bit id like to spend more time getting to know each other i wouldnt be here now if what you did for a living was a problem for me and if you think im so petty and narrowminded that id i could fall in love with you it stopped her short stole her breath just the quiet way he said it i know oh god i know me too it scares me a little good because it scares me a lot he crossed back to her lifted her hand well slow down kissed it then her wrist drawing her in again he brushed his lips over her temple her cheeks her pulse spiked this is slowing down we wont go any faster than you want he tipped her face back and smiled trust me im a professional and while she laughed the buzzer sounded give me ten seconds to get rid of whoever that is and remember my place when he opened the door mcnab shoved him back a step okay you son of a bitch were going a round detective who the hell do you think you are mcnab shoved him again you think you can treat her that way rub your next skirt right in her face detective you dont want to lay hands on me again oh yeah maybe the second bottle hadnt been such a good idea he thought vaguely but gamely lifted his fists lets try these instead detective mcnab calmly louise stepped between them youre obviously upset maybe you should sit down dr dimatto flustered mcnab lowered his fists i didnt see you over there charles why dont you make some coffee ian its ian isnt it lets sit down beg your pardon but i dont want any goddamn coffee and i dont want to sit down i came to kick his ass he jabbed a finger at charles over her shoulder im sorry youre in the middle youre a nice woman but ive got business with this son of a bitch im assuming this has to do with delia as charles stepped away from louise mcnab rounded on him damn right you think because you take her to the fucking opera and fancy restaurants youve got a right to toss her over when something more interesting comes along no i dont delia means a great deal to me literally seeing red mcnab swung out his punch found its target had charless head snapping back he followed through with a shortarmed jab to the belly before charles recovered enough to fight back while they circled each other ramming fists spilling blood louise fled the room they were rolling on the floor in a sweaty grunting heap when she came back and threw a full bucket of ice water over them thats just about enough she slammed the bucket down slapped her hands on her hips as both of them gaped up at her you should be ashamed both of you fighting over a woman like she was a juicy piece of meat if either of you think peabody would appreciate this youre very much mistaken now on your feet hes got no right to hurt her mcnab began i wouldnt hurt delia for anything in the world and if i have ill do everything i can to make it up to her charles scooped back his dripping hair he was getting the picture now for christs sake you moron have you told her youre in love with her who said i was his bruised face went sheet white im just looking out for shut up she wants to roll with you when youre working other skirts thats her business but shes not a job he pointed at louise thats right shes not and nobody juggles peabody that way look obviously youre under the impression that delia and i have been it just happened ian louise interrupted quickly shot charles a warning look it wasnt planned im sorry if im responsible for this im not blaming you im as much to blame charles and i we want a chance to make something together can you understand so peabodys just out of the picture im sorry as the light dawned charles got to his feet i hope shell understand i hope we can still be friends shes a wonderful woman more than i deserve you got that part right pal drenched aching and more than a little sick mcnab managed to get up youd better find a way to make it right with her i will you have my word let me get you a towel i dont need a damn towel then try a piece of advice instead youve got a clear path try not to stumble off of it yeah right he strode out his exit hampered a bit by squeaking airboots well charles blew out a breath that was entertaining hold still louise ordered your lips bleeding as she dabbed at it with a napkin charles angled his head im soaking wet too yes you are i think he bruised my ribs ill take a look come on lets get you out of those wet clothes and patch you up this time she said im the professional i love playing doctor louise he stopped her made her turn and look at him delia and i shes really very special to me but we were never lovers yes i figured that out she patted her fingers gently on his bruised cheek i cant believe you were about to tell ian could be my brain was still rattled from having his bareknuckled fist slammed into my face were friends he added delias the best friend ive ever had and youve just done her a lovely favor come on now come with dr louise she slipped an arm around his waist its sweet isnt it the way he leapt to defend her sweet charles wiggled his jaw and saw a few stars he thinks im sleeping with her and that pisses him off then he thinks ive stopped sleeping with her and it pisses him off even more so he comes over here and punches me in the face yes very sweet its all point of view now take off your clothes first house calls free chapter sixteen eve stood on the sidewalk outside stefanie finchs apartment building took a moment to sort through her thoughts summer was coming she could feel the weight of it on the air does it feel like rain to you peabody peabody took a sniff no sir humiditys coming in its likely to be hot and heavy tomorrow in more ways than one but i dont want a storm to muck things up dallas if we move in on him tomorrow without using bait we cant be sure of getting him on anything but illegals possession and thats if hes carrying hell be carrying and weve got bait peabody glanced back up at the building you didnt say anything to her about keeping the date she wont be keeping it i will you with a shake of her head peabody gave eve a measuring glance if hes sticking to pattern we have to figure he knows what she looks like and you dont look like her youre close to the same height but colorings different features are different and shes well bustier no offense by one tomorrow ill look enough like her to pass im calling mavis oh peabody brightened oh thats iced easy for you to say you wont have to listen to lectures from her and trina on why i havent had my eyebrows shaped lately or why i havent used the butt cream or whatever and ill probably have to agree to a full treatment after the op this was said with undisguised bitterness i know how they work youre a true soldier sir

climate control working climate control is experiencing systemic problems do you wish to notify maintenance at this time oh fuck you eve said and rolled down all windows she shot away from the curb and unwilling to trust the indash link pulled out her own mrs whitney answered looking perfectly groomed and very annoyed im sorry to disturb you at home mrs whitney but i need to speak with the commander its after eleven oclock lieutenant cant this wait until morning no maam it cant one moment she snapped and switched eve to wait mode complete with canned music eve listened to violins and flutes as she drove onehanded through a snarl of traffic whitney im sorry to call you at home commander but theres been a break in the investigation im always ready to hear good news ive just come from questioning stefanie finch she has a date with the suspect tomorrow at thirteen hundred greenpeace park hes moved to days it fits the profile sir upping the risk finch is cooperating shes agreed

the brandy snifter that sat at his elbow probably what would you like anything that will blow that insult that abomination parked out front into a million tiny little pieces that can never be put back together again ah he swirled brandy sipped vehicular troubles again lieutenant is that a smirk the red haze was gathering again is that a smirk on your face because if it is she shoved up her sleeves mmm violence you know how that arouses me she managed a short scream and yanked at her own hair darling eve why dont you let some of my mechanics deal with it or better yet take whatever suits your needs out of the garage because thats like giving up those bastards in maintenance arent going to beat me she huffed out a breath anyway mavis and trina are coming over probably leonardo too theyre spending the night are we having a pajama party will there be pillow fights youre just a laugh a minute you want an update or do you want to fantasize about scantily clad women bashing each other with pillows his grin was quick and wicked guess she dropped into a chair and filled him in he picked up the cat as she spoke sat stroking galahad watching her he knew she was doing more than bringing him up to speed she was refining checking for holes firming up the operation as she talked it through they both knew no matter how meticulously planned the operation it only took one variable to upset the balance some men he said when shed finished lesser men might object to having their wife picnic in the park with another man ill bring you back some potato salad thats my girl you said feeney will pick his man inside the surveillance vehicle i believe he could be persuaded to select an expert consultant civilian the circle her mind was taking came to an abrupt halt then backtracked this is an nypsd op and theres no need for you to be there youve got your own work i do yes but i so enjoy watching you do yours he gave the cats ears a scratch with those long clever fingers that had galahad purring in pleasure why dont we let feeney decide no bribery his eyebrows shot up in amazement really lieutenant you wound me if i were easily offended i might not tell you ive separated crossfiled and indexed your data yeah youre pretty handy to have around lets have a look she got up to walk around to his side of the console he tapped a single key then setting the cat down tugged her onto his lap no funny stuff she ordered whos laughing he nipped her earlobe you see onscreen three of those project personnel with male children who would now be between the ages of twenty and thirtyfive that gives you twentyeight hits adding male siblings and grandchildren secondary dependents in that same age bracket garners another fifteen so thats what fortythree possibles thats workable however he kissed the nape of her neck refining and recalculating using those personnel who were reprimanded cited terminated or named in civil suits we decrease those possibles to eighteen i assumed youd want to start with them screen four keep this up the chiefs going to offer you a permanent position on the force now youre trying to scare me but im too strong for that knock out the overthirties im betting hes younger than that he nuzzled her neck and did it manually down to eight yeah we start with them computer run background check all data on individuals listed on screen four working itll take a minute roarke told her and worked his way from neck to jaw youre not authorized to attempt to seduce the primary investigator at this time ive vast experience in breaking the law he found her mouth sank in wow they always look so hot mavis freestone stood in the doorway in fourinch platform boots that rode up to her crotch in shiny eyewatering pink her hair tinted to match seemed to burst out of her head in an explosive topknot with it she wore a skimmer in dizzying swirls of pink and blue that fluttered down to meet the top of the boots she beamed smiles set off by sparkling face studs fixed to the corners of her mouth beside her trina her own hair in a foothigh ebony mountain snorted if this is part of the fringe bennies on cop work i want a badge eves fingers dug reflexively into roarkes arm dont leave me she whispered whatever you do dont leave me be strong good evening ladies leonardos bopping over later he had stuff summerset said to come right up mavis danced into the room we gave thumbsup to snacks weve got all kinds of goodies to try out on you dallas this is so ultra mag eves stomach turned whoopee where do you want me to set up trina asked and was already studying eve in a way that made the kickass cop want to whimper like a baby in my office this is an official consult not a personal treatment whatever trina blew an enormous purple bubble snapped the gum back show me what you want to look like and ill make it happen in her office eve put stefanie finchs official id photo onscreen and managed not to yelp when trina took her face in her hands hands with inchlong sapphire nails mmhmm you know lip dye isnt a crime in this state you ought to try it ive been kind of busy youre always kind of busy youre not using the eye gel i gave you you cant find a minute twice a day for eye gel you want bags and wrinkles you got the finest piece of mancandy on and off planet and you want him looking at your face with bags and wrinkles what are you going to do when he dumps you for a woman who takes time to maintain her face kill him that made trina laugh and sent the little sapphire she had centered on her left eyeteeth winking easier to use the gel i need a photo of you put it split screen with the image you want i need to run some morph programs before we start playing with your face sure grabbing the reprieve eve went to her computer cocktail meatballs frigid mavis snagged one from the tray summerset carried in summerset youre the summit his face transformed it always surprised eve that he could smile and his face not crack to pieces enjoy if youd like anything else just let me know and the autochef has been fully restocked you ought to stay and watch mavis speared a second meatball were going to make dallas into someone else that summerset said with his smile going thin and sour as a lemon slice when he glanced toward eve is the answer to a prayer and while tempting ill leave you to your work hes such a kidder mavis said when he walked out oh yeah he really cracks me up theres your image eve told trina ive got to check some data in the other room just let me know when youre ready for me she went back into roarke and was met with a cup of coffee though i imagine you could use a stiff drink i assumed youd opt for coffee thanks shes got three cases three filled with her hideous devices of torture she took a bracing gulp of coffee i should put in for hazardous duty pay for this she turned toward the wall screen lets see who weve got she leaned back on roarkes desk and studied the images and data one by one doctors lawyers students engineers she mused she earmarked one not currently employed with a minor illegals offense on his record hes not a drone she said half to herself not somebody whos pulling an eighthour shift he needs time for his hobby and hes got money hes a professional or hes just living on his portfolio whoa wait computer magnify current photographic image she stepped closer to the screen as the face filled it and stared into kevin moranos eyes this one rings with me yeah i know those eyes kevin yeah there you are kevin lets see so mama worked on the project no father listed she was a pr exec owns her own firm now london based with offices in new york paris and milan hes an only child and was born thirteen months after the project got off the ground interesting really interesting how a pr exec files a sexual harassment suit drops it again within six weeks agrees to have the records sealed and walks away with a kid and enough money to start an international firm she glanced back at roarke woman who runs her own public relations firm with that scope shed probably need a pretty slick image polished sophisticated it follows woman has a kid then after a little scandal in the workplace heads off here and there establishing herself an international company the payoff from mcnamara and company must have been considerable eve nodded but whyd she go through with the pregnancy why have the kid perhaps she wanted a child what for look at his schooling she started him fulltime at three all private facilities boarding schools and you can bet your ass someone else was doing the baby thing for the first three years she didnt found that company while she was changing diapers and carting a kid around some parents have been known to roarke pointed out beats me how but if she was into the mother thing she wouldnt have shipped him off when he was still sucking his thumb i tend to agree with you though our experience in this particular areas limited if i were to speculate id wonder if the payoff wasnt linked to her going through with the pregnancy buy her off buy the kid eve surmised its a continuation of the project in a way longterm results im going to have

ultimate butt in the chair eve turned and the eyes that had been flat and cool showed hints of fear this is just you know practice and its all temporary you dont do anything permanent to me right strip off the shirt you need bigger tits oh god o o while eve was getting a temporary breast enhancement peabody was winding down with a bowl of frozen nondairy dessert some marketing whiz had named iced delight drenched in chocolatesubstitute syrup it wasnt half bad or so peabody decided as she scraped the bottom of the bowl she washed the bowl so that it wouldnt be sitting there in the morning to remind her she had absolutely no willpower when she heard the knock on her door she was about to turn off the entertainment screen and head to bed if it was one of her neighbors again with a complaint about noise from another apartment she was telling them to call a cop she was off duty damn it and needed the six hours sleep she had coming a peek in the security screen made her gasp in surprise she unlocked the door pulled it open and stared at mcnab his lip was swollen his right eye boasted an impressive shiner and he was wet what the hell happened to you i had an incident he snapped i want to come in i tried to reach you youve got your links on message only i was busy i was off duty goddamn it okay okay she stepped back before he could plow into her were on at oh six

your boots are squeaking what i dont have ears i cant hear them squeaking what crawled up your ass and nested she sniffed the air you reek whatve you been drinking whatever i want would you get off my back look youre the one who came to my door bunged up wet and smelling like the floor of a bar i was on my way to bed ive got to get some sleep fine go to bed i dont know why i came here anyway he stalked to the door pulled it open slammed it shut again i went by monroes we got into it what do you mean you she stammered you had a fight with charles are you crazy maybe you dont think weve got anything going on but youre wrong thats it youre wrong and i see him pushing dr blonde in your face it pisses me off best thing could happen to you in my opinion but i didnt like the way he tossed you over tossed me over she repeated dumbfounded you break up with somebody you do it square hes going to apologize hes going to apologize what are you an echo she had to sit charles blackened your eye and split your lip he got in a couple of shots not to mention the gut punch that had him heaving up the homemade brew in the gutter like a common brew head his face isnt so perfect tonight either why are you all wet dishy dimatto was with him she dumped a bucket of water on us he shoved his hands in his damp pockets and stomped around the room on his squeaky boots idve taken him if she hadnt broken it up he shouldnt have treated you that way peabody opened her mouth to explain she hadnt been mistreated then wisely closed it again her mother hadnt raised a foolish daughter it doesnt matter she cast her eyes down in a sorrowful droop to hide the unholy gleam in them mcnab and charles fighting over her it was too mag for words hell it doesnt if it helps any i think he was really sorry hes a nice guy mcnab not the kind that hurts anyone on purpose doesnt change the sting he kneeled down in front of her look i want us to get back together we got together pretty good last night i dont mean just in the sheets i want us to pick up the way we were going but different wary now she eased back different how exclusive this time and we can you know go out to some fancy places hes not the only one who can get slicked up and take you to wherever i dont want to go out with anyone else and i dont want you going out with anyone else either her throat tickled but she was afraid to swallow so what youre asking me to go steady his face went hot his teeth bared and he shoved to his feet never mind put it down to too much to drink he swung toward the door again nearly got there yes she got up she wished her knees werent knocking but she got up he turned back slowly yes what i could give it a try see where it goes he took a step back exclusive yeah and another like a couple okay when she smiled he leaned in and kissed her oh shit then jolted back when pain exploded in his lip he blotted at it with the back of his hand saw fresh blood got anything for this sure she wanted to pet and cuddle him like a puppy let me get the firstaid kit when she came back in with it the bulletin announcement onscreen caught her attention the nude body of a man floating in the east river was discovered tonight by dock workers though police officials have not released cause of death the victim has been identified as dr theodore mcnamara holy hell peabody dropped the kit with a clatter and raced to her link chapter seventeen the body had been transported to the morgue and the crime scene cordoned off by the time eve arrived warehouses streamed in a messy ribbon of brick and concrete along the choppy slice between access road and river and all had the washedout false glare from the police lights the media jammed around the barricades and sensors like saturday night hopefuls vying to gain admission to an exclusive club and there was just as much chatter from them in the form of shouted questions demands and pleas uniformed officers stood in as bouncers most were smart enough to ignore the pleas promises and bribes for information but eve knew there would be one whod weaken and spring the first leak in the data dam accepting it as the natural relationship between cops and media she hooked her badge on her jacket and started muscling her way through dallas hey dallas nadine furst nipped her elbow whats the deal why were you called in whats your connection to theodore mcnamara im a cop hes dead come on dallas even in the harsh light nadine managed to look vivid and cameraready they dont trot you out for every murder in the city she flashed an angry look at nadine nobody trots me out now step back nadine youre in my way all right okay but the word is it looks like a robbery murder is that your take i dont know anything yet now friend or not you move or i bust you for obstruction nadine shifted aside somethings up she whispered to her camera operator something big pay attention im going to call my contact at the morgue see what i can wheedle out watch dallas she added if shes here shes the center eve pushed her way through reporters and gawkers she caught a whiff of the river now a sour smear on the air the crime scene team was at work the fluorescent yellow initials on the backs of their jackets searing through the hard white lights the beam of the powerful portables spilled out onto the pitchblack surface of the river so that it gleamed like oil outdoor nighttime murder eve thought was black and white she signalled to a uniform whos primary detective renfrew short guy dark hair brown suit and tie she added with just a hint of a sneer in her voice thats him standing with his hands on his hips looking at the water like the perps going to swim by doing the backstroke eve studied his back okay draw me a picture here couple of dock hands spotted the floater said they were taking their unionsanctioned break and you have to figure they were using the river for a toilet called it in at twentytwo thirty nineeleven caller ided himself as deke jones body hadnt been in long or else the fish werent very interested severe head and facial wounds no clothes no jewelry no nothing ided him by his prints took him off in the dead wagon about fifteen minutes ago this your patrol area officer lewis yes sir my partner and i responded to the nineeleven we were onscene within three minutes dock workers were gathered around like a dirt clod but nobodyd touched the body and lieutenant i mentioned this to the detective but he didnt seem interested theres a report of a car fire about a half mile from here late model lux sedan no passengers the way this current runs it could be the dumping point okay thanks renfrews going to give me grief isnt he yes sir lewis agreed he surely is eve wasnt feeling patient she wasnt feeling diplomatic but she told herself shed have to be both renfrew turned at her approach his gaze skimmed over her face dipped briefly down to her badge no one called cop central into this his shoulders went up and back like a boxer bracing for the first round she had a good inch on him in height and watched as he flexed his body forward on his toes to compensate oh yeah she thought noting his combative stance he was going to give her grief i didnt get the tag from central im not looking to trespass on your turf detective renfrew your victims connected to one of my cases i think we might be able to help each other out i dont need your help and im not interested in getting the fast shuffle from central on my case okay you can help me out youre on my crime scene and that makes one too many badges around here ive got work to do detective i need to know what youve got at this point you think you can pull rank on me he rocked higher on his toes jabbed a finger at her waltz in here and take over a highprofile murder so you can get your face splashed all over the screen again forget it im primary here eve imagined grabbing the finger he had in her face bending it back until the bone snapped but she kept her voice level im not interested in screen time in pulling rank or in taking over your case renfrew im interested in finding out why a man i had scheduled for formal interview tomorrow ends up dead in the river im asking you to reach out with some courtesy and cooperation courtesy and cooperation fuck that how much courtesy and cooperation did you show when you tore into the onetwentyeight a couple months ago i dont reach out to cops who turn on cops sounds like youve got issues renfrew the onetwoeight was a mess and a cop was killing cops he snorted through his nose so you say so i say and right now someones killing women who think theyre going out for a pleasant evening your case links to mine so we can stand here and piss on each other or we can share information that could close both cases quickly this is my crime scene he jabbed a finger at her again i say who comes on it and who doesnt and i want you out remove yourself or ill have you removed eve stuck her hands in her pockets before she could give in to the urge and punch him have me removed renfrew she dug out her recorder watched his face go red and tight as she fixed it to her jacket officially and on record have me removed from a crime scene that is potentially linked to an ongoing homicide investigation of which i am primary have me removed after ive asked you for the cooperation and courtesy to exchange information that may aid in both investigations she stared him down waited five humming seconds around them crime scene techs had stopped their work to watch have me removed she said again but before you take that step youd better think carefully about how such an action will look on the official record how its going to play in the media who are standing at the edges of your scene and how youre going to justify such an act to your superiors turn that goddamn recorder off it stays on were past doing this the easy way im identified as dallas lieutenant eve and request from you renfrew she dropped her gaze to his badge detective matthew a report on your investigation into the death of theodore mcnamara as this same individual was a potential witness a potential suspect in a series of homicides of which i am primary investigator you can read my report when i file it thats all im required to give you lieutenant ive got nothing to say to you at this time when he stalked off eve hissed out a breath she turned to one of the crime scene techs what have you got weve got nothing here body got tangled in some lines otherwise it wouldve kept on keeping on renfrew hes a dick he should have a unit looking upcurrent for the dump site time of death seventeenforty thanks me im loaded with cooperation and courtesy she spotted peabody and headed over with me she walked away from the crowd passed through the barricade at its thinnest point i want you to check on an automotive torching late model luxury vehicle about a half mile from here find out who its registered to yes sir eve pulled out her own link then saw mcnab what happened to you a slight altercation he touched fingers gingerly to his bruised eye peabody did you pop mcnab no sir since youre here and arent in the middle of an altercation with my aide you check on the torching peabody cozy up with some of the uniforms first onscene was lewis and her partner see what else you can get from them steer clear of the primary thats detective renfrew the flaming asshole did you pop the flaming asshole sir no but it was a close call she turned away and used her link when the me answered his voice was slurred with sleep gee morris did i wake you up what is this you never sleep so no one else is allowed to what the hell time is it time to do a friend a favor when he sat up shifted eve winced man either block video or watch the sheets will you despite male propaganda i can officially attest that one mans balls are pretty much the same as anothers but he twitched the sheets back up to his waist but when you fantasize about me later and you will make it good now what do you need youve got a victim checking into the morgue mcnamara theodore dr theodore mcnamara thats the one morris whistled since im talking to you i have to assume the famous doctor didnt buy it from natural causes hes recently been plucked out of the east river and it doesnt appear hed decided to take a little swim if youre calling to ask me to flag him priority youre wasting a favor highprofile name highprofile treatment thats not the favor im not primary on this one but mcnamaras connected to my sexual homicides i had a chat with him this afternoon and had him booked for formal tomorrow i need a headsup on the autopsy all the data from the body and from the primarys interaction with the pathologist assigned why doesnt the primary copy you he doesnt like me i gotta tell you my feelings are real hurt over it whos primary renfrew detective matthew ah morris plumped the pillows behind him laid back territorial little bastard poor social skills and a tendency to refuse to broaden his focus in other words a flaming asshole in other words i think ill go in and take a look at the recently departed myself ill get back to you thanks morris i owe you one yeah i like that part morris whats the tattoo grinning morris tapped a finger on the illustration just under his left nipple the grim reaper an equal opportunity employer youre a sick man morris she clicked off a sick man shed kept her back to the reporters as she talked and her radar up most of them with nothing to feed on were slipping away to do quick liveremotes mcnab jogged up to her walk and talk she ordered i want to keep clear of the media once they make a connection we lose whatever advantage weve got it was mcnamaras sedan good and torched nyfds saying there was a chemical accelerant rd its a kind of flammable acid you get a flash fire burst and it eats right through the metal while it burns really thorough witness saw the flash went to take a looksee and had the presence of mind to note down the vehicle id before it evaporated five ten more minutes wed have had nothing smart but not smart enough they shouldve blasted off the id before they torched it little mistakes she looked back toward the river robbery my ass who rolls a guy even takes his clothes then wastes a luxury sedan what do you bet mcnamara paid his killer a visit after i talked to him id put the bank on it if renfrew was less of a moron we could wrap this up tonight staring into middle distance she juggled possibilities dunwood doesnt know renfrews a moron renfrewll notify next of kin but thats the wife no reason for the grandson to come into play there and no reason for me not to pay him a visit to express my sympathy for his loss and question him lucias dunwood get his address lets shake him up you got it they separated and eve made another call this one to home hi she tried a smile when roarke came on i guess theyre still there huh as there was music blasting and the sound of halfdrunken laughter rolling over it roarke just shrugged look im sorry i dumped it on you maybe you should lock yourself in one of the rooms theyll never find you in that place im considering it i take it youve called to let me know youll be some time yet i dont know how long a lot going on if i cant close it down tonight im still going to need mavis and trina tomorrow maybe you should lock them in a room not to worry i suspect theyll pass out soon enough theres that hold on she turned to mcnab what got an address but its bogus what do you mean bogus i mean the address listed for lucias dunwood is the fun house times square i know because i spend a lot of time there its a big eamusement center no residences on premises he likes to play games she replied give me some room here she stepped away until she was out of earshot listen youd like me to find dunwoods actual address mcnamara wouldve had it im not going to be able to access his files from here because the primary on this is playing big stud dog with the investigation i see roarke was already moving away from the music i could call whitney and get clearance but thats messy plus it makes me feel like a tattletale or something mmhmm i could tag feeney and hed wangle authorization through edd but ive already gotten one person out of bed tonight she glanced back at mcnab maybe more and im already up yeah technically well just skimming the technicalities im authorized to access some data because hes a suspect whether this data includes his address files or personal data is debatable but id have clearance for it in the morning anyway so why wait would you like that address now or would you like to keep rationalizing a bit longer she blew out a breath noting that hed gone up to his office while shed been talking ill just take the address he gave it to her oh lieutenant since thats only a few blocks from here perhaps youll make it home while i still have my sanity ill do my best guess i owe you one too be sure ill collect she broke transmission signalled mcnab get peabody were moving she was nearly to her vehicle when she saw nadine leaning on the hood and examining her nails thats city property youre resting your ass on why do they go out of their way to make official vehicles so ugly i dont know but im taking it up with my congressman first chance i get rumor is you and detective renfrew got into a little power tussle rumors are your department then you wouldnt be interested that rumor continues that hes a jerk and you cut him down bloodlessly nadine tossed her streaky blonde hair but you may be interested in a deduction since deductions are your department i deduce that dr theodore mcnamara plays into the sexual homicides youre investigating that robbery had nothing to do with his ending up in the river and that you have a very good idea who bashed him about the head and face earlier this evening and whoever that may be has a starring role in your homicides thats a lot of deducing nadine will you confirm eve merely crooked a finger walked away when the camera operator fell into step behind nadine eve stopped her with one steely stare wait for me nadine told her shes just doing her job dallas were all just doing our jobs turn the recorder off recorder dont waste my time we go off record or you get nothing nadine sighed heavily and strictly for form then disconnected the recorder worked into her gold lapel pin off record you dont go on the air with anything until i tell you do i get a oneonone nadine i dont have time to negotiate with you for all i know theres another woman dead tonight and no ones found her yet you go on air with your deductions and there could be another one dead tomorrow okay it stays in holding until you say mcnamaras connected i talked to him this afternoon he wasnt cooperative i believe he knew or suspected the identity of the killer i believe he confronted that individual after our conversation and as a result ended up a floater that only confirms my deductions im not finished i believe the root of these murders goes back to a project partnered by j forrester and allegany pharmaceuticals nearly twentyfive years ago sex scandals illegals abuse payoffs and coverups dig there for your background and youll be several steps ahead of the other networks was mcnamara directly involved in the killings years ago he spent a lot of time energy and money making sure that facts actions and criminal activities that should have been part of the public record were sealed he refused to cooperate by volunteering information pertinent to the investigation of the murder of two women and the attack on another instead opting to withhold that information did he kill them no is he responsible thats a moral call thats not my department either nadine touched her arm as eve turned away i have a contact at the morgue mcnamara was struck several blows on the head and face nearly an hour before he died one defensive wound right wrist while the initial injuries came from a blunt instrument about eight inches wide the killing blow was delivered by a different weapon a long slim metal object such as a crowbar or tire iron that might be found in the tool kit of a car she paused i believe in the courtesy and cooperation of shared information i really hate knowing that phrase is going to follow me around for the next six weeks eve walked back to the car backseat mcnab how come i cant sit in front i outrank her and my legsre longer shes my aide youre ballast she climbed in and didnt speak again until mcnab had stopped grumbling and arranged himself on the backseat were going to pay a visit to lucias dunwood howd you get the address she glanced at mcnab in the rearview mirror i have my ways of ascertaining data peabody youll go in with me mcnab youll stay in the vehicle but i go in with a uniform not a uniform and a detective and not a detective who looks like he spent his evening brawling in the streets youll stay behind with your communicator open as mine will be if we run into any trouble you call for backup then using your judgment decide whether you wait for that backup or come in and assist now i want you to get me another address kevin morano making the best of things he pulled out his ppc and stretched his length out on the backseat hey theres a candy bar taped to the back of the passengers seat even as peabody swiveled around to try to look eve bared her teeth first one who touches it gets their fingers ripped off and stuffed up their nose peabody sprang back into position youre hoarding candy its not a hoard its an emergency supply which the sneaking candy thief who keeps raiding my office hasnt found yet and if he or she does find it ill know why she paused significantly and you will pay im on a diet anyway you dont need to diet shebody you are a justright female mcnab eve said yes sir shut up its all right dallas were a couple a couple of what no dont tell me dont talk to me dont talk to each other let there be silence across the land peabody managed to muffle a snicker then tried to adjust the climate control manually its busted shut up saying nothing peabody rolled down her window mcnab shifted in the back permission to speak on official business sir what kevin moranos address yankee stadium do you want me to contact roarke and have him i mean he amended when she glared in the rearview do you want to implement your ways of ascertaining data no i know where he lives when she stopped in front of the grand old brownstone it was after one am the house was dark but for the red pinprick of light on the armed security system are you armed mcnab my offduty stunner keep it set on low keep your communicator open dont approach the house unless i signal you to do so come on peabody lets go wake this prick up she crossed the sidewalk when she stepped onto the first stone stair the security system went into a warning hum she pressed the bell instantly light washed down from overhead and the security system went on first alert you are currently under surveillance please state your name and your business any attempt to enter the premises or cause damage to same and this system will immediately notify the police and the neighborhood watch lieutenant dallas nypsd she held her badge up to the view screen i need to speak with lucias dunwood regarding a police matter one moment please while your identification is processed and verified please wait while mr dunwood is informed of your request lieutenant do you think eve shifted her body subtly and stepped on peabodys foot under camera range i think its difficult having to wake mr dunwood up to tell him about his grandfathers death but theres never a good time for hard news and no point in waiting for morning to give it no sir peabody cleared her throat fixed a sober expression on her face as she realized she was being told they were likely under audio as well as video surveillance it took several minutes before the light in the first floor windows flashed on she didnt hear locks being disengaged which told her the door was fully soundproofed it opened silently and she got her first look at lucias his bright red hair was disheveled he wore a long white nightrobe belted loosely at the waist and gave every appearance of a young man just roused out of sleep and puzzled as to the reason why im sorry he blinked owlishly youre the police yes she offered her badge again are you lucias dunwood thats right whats this about is there some trouble in the neighborhood not that im aware of may we come in and speak to you mr dunwood all right sorry im a little punchy he stepped back gestured them into a wide foyer with marble floors glowing under the lights from a threetiered silver chandelier ive been in bed a couple of hours im not used to having the police come to my door im sorry to disturb you so late i have some difficult news it might be better if we sat down what kind of news whats wrong mr dunwood im sorry to tell you that your grandfather is dead my grandfather eve watched with reluctant admiration as he paled lifted a hand that trembled very slightly to his lips dead my grandfathers dead was there an accident no he was murdered murdered oh god oh my god i do need to sit down he made it as far as a long silver bench in the foyer then collapsed on it i cant believe this its like im dreaming what happened what happened to him your grandfather was found in the east river earlier tonight the investigation into his death is underway im sorry for your loss mr dunwood but it would help us if youd answer some questions of course of course i will are you here alone alone his head came up and she saw suspicion pass quickly over his face before he lowered it again if youre alone perhaps theres someone youd like my aide to call to stay with you no no im all right ill be all right whens the last time you saw your grandfather hes been away some consult business off planet i suppose its been several weeks did he at that time express to you any concerns any fears for his safety why no lucias looked up again i dont understand theres a possibility your grandfather was killed by someone he knew a car registered in his name was set on fire only hours before his body was found the car was parked near the groundshuttle tracks off east onefortythree are you aware of any business that would take him to that area none whatsoever his car was set on fire that sounds like like some sort of vendetta but grandfather was he was a humanitarian a great man who dedicated his life to medicine and research this has to be some terrible mistake are you studying to be a doctor im taking a leave from schooling just now he pressed his fingers to his temple covering most of his face and eve studied the dragons head carved into the sapphire in the blended gold ring on his right hand i wanted time to think to explore to decide what area of medicine would suit me best my grandfather his voice broke he looked away he leaves big footprints to fill he was my mentor my inspiration im sure he was very proud of you you were close then i think so he was larger than life a man who drove himself to excel i hope to be worthy of his memory to end like this thrown in the river like sewage my god to have been stripped of his dignity at the end of his life how he would hate that you have to find who did this to him lieutenant they have to pay for what they did well find them and theyll pay im sorry but i have to ask its standard procedure can you account for your whereabouts tonight between the hours of seven and midnight my christ i hadnt thought id be a kind of suspect i was home here until about eightthirty then i went out to a club i didnt actually talk to anyone didnt see anyone very interesting id been hoping okay i confess id thought i might pick up a girl for the evening but it didnt work out i came home early tenthirty id say my security system would verify that so you were alone essentially i have a house droid he got to his feet i can get it you can question it as to when i left when i came back oh and i have a cash receipt for drinks im sure theyre time and date stamped will that help very much well just clear this up so we can move on in the investigation anything i can do anything to help ill get the droid and while youre doing the questioning ill get the receipt im sure i stuck it in my pocket appreciate it oh i should tell you your address is mislisted in the city files excuse me your address theres an error i got your correct location from your grandfathers files you might want to see to that when you get the chance how odd yes ill take care of it excuse me just a minute he got the droid having no doubt kevins careful reprogramming and falsified input would hold but his fists were clenched when he strode into his bedroom kevin rushed in behind him you said theyd never identify the car well they did lucias shot back but it doesnt matter everythings fine looks like its just as well that stupid bitch didnt show up at jeanlucs tonight i wouldnt have this he tugged the receipt out of his trouser pocket alibied all around and playing the shocked and grieving grandson what about me they dont know about you and theres no reason they should theres no connection between this and the project as far as the cops are concerned and no connection that can be proved between me and my grandfathers death just stay up here and be quiet im handling this he hurried down again lieutenant in my pocket just as i thought he handed eve the receipt fine id like my aide to make a copy of this for the files of course he waited while peabody scanned the receipt is there anything else i can do anything at all not at this time well be in touch youll let me know if you when you find who did this youll be the first eve promised she walked back to the car slid behind the wheel coldblooded son of a bitch he was enjoying that droid couldve been reprogrammed mcnab said from the backseat same for the security the guy whos been doing the ework couldve done both itd be cake still we didnt get much out of him peabody complained didnt we eve tapped her fingers on the wheel i never said his grandfathers name and he never asked he has the requisite two both new york city residents but he never asked which one was dead didnt have to ask and that bit about being stripped of his dignity at the end of his life thats just what hed done what hed intended to do and he outthought himself by not just saying his pal and housemate kevin was with him part of the evening didnt want to share the spotlight i guess we got more out of him than i thought thats right little mistakes chapter eighteen roarke met them at the door it only took one look at eves face to confirm his suspicion that she was running on fumes at that moment hed have preferred closing the door in peabodys and mcnabs faces scooping his wife up and pouring her into bed because she read something of his thoughts eve nudged everyone inside it was quicker to bring them here we can catch a cab downtown peabody said sacrificing the delights of lolling in one of the magnificent beds for a few hours dont be silly roarke skimmed a hand over eves hair a subtle gesture of reassurance weve plenty of room whose fist did you run into ian monroes he smirked and sent his sore lip throbbing we ran into each others its nothing to brag about eve stripped off her jacket crash here the briefings at oh six hundred anyway pick a couple of bedrooms on opposite sides of the house aw was all peabody said laughing roarke patted her arm she doesnt mean it do too eve replied mavis and trina in the pool along with leonardo who arrived about two hours ago i bowed out when they decided it was time for nude relay races theyre naked mcnab perked right up wet and naked you know a quick swim would be good just a passing thought he murmured when peabody curled her lip playtimes over bed eve pointed up the stairs weve got a major op tomorrow and i want you both fresh where are the mermaids and friend bunking oh here and there roarke said easily why dont you go up ill settle our company in good ive got some things left to run before i turn in she started up the stairs and i dont want to hear the patter of little feet sneaking around the corridors shes so strict peabody said under her breath tired and cross is what she is now why dont we take the elevator roarke gestured i think youll like the accommodations i have in mind plenty of room for two eve went to his office first brought up a diagram of greenpeace park after highlighting the picnic site she let the computer select the most strategic locations for her men shed see if she agreed after a few hours of sleep she listed the men she wanted for the operation transmitted the order and copied whitney a shower she decided when her vision blurred maybe a shower would wash some of the fog out of her brain so she could put another hour in she was staggering into the bedroom when her pocketlink beeped dallas figured id tag you on the portable morris yawned hugely our guest this evening departed this plane of existence at sevenforty previously he had an unpleasant altercation with a blunt object this altercation would have resulted in death within an hour perhaps a tad less the medical term would be having ones brains bashed in got it too tired to stand she sat on the arm of the sofa in the sitting area i hate to be the one to break this to you morris but i already got the data from a media source youve got a gossip in your house no why im shocked and amazed a city official leaking information to the media what is the world coming to youre a fucking jolly soul love your work love the world i dont imagine your media contact had quite everything as ive just gotten the tox results she shook her head clear as roarke came into the room he was drugged between the initial insults and the coup de grace the doctor was given a stimulant they tried to revive him her thoughts jumbled then cleared before morris could answer no that doesnt make sense they wanted to keep him alive a little longer give the lady a stuffed panda the substance used stimulates the heart and its quickly absorbed if wed gotten him in here twenty thirty minutes later we wouldnt have found a trace of it they kept him alive so they could get him to a dumping site and kill him there hed have died anyway right from the initial beating without immediate medical attention yes and even then his chances were minimal hed certainly have drowned without that final blow so they wanted to give him that last shot when he was unconscious helpless stripped of his dignity youve got yourself mighty nasty customers dallas im sending the data to our mutual friend renfrew his robbery theory doesnt cut the mustard thanks i appreciate you handling this yourself just part of our luxury package get some sleep for sweet christs sake dallas ive got customers in here who look perkier than you yeah ill do that she broke transmission then just sat staring down at her link she blinked back when roarke released her weapon harness you put them in a room together didnt you havent you more to worry about than the sexual activities of your subordinates my subordinates come dragging their asses into the briefing because theyve spent whats left of the night playing hide the salami whatre you doing taking off your boots youre going to bed she stared down at the top of his head jesus the man had the most incredible hair all black and silky she thought as her head started to loll so you just wanted to bury your hands in it your face in it and she snapped back im going to grab a shower and get another hour in no eve youre not temper simmered in his voice as he tossed her boots aside with just enough force to have them bounce and skitter im not standing here watching while you make yourself sick you go to bed on your own or i knock you out and put you there she frowned at him it wasnt often the rage showed that hot and bubbling violence they both knew lived inside him seeing it leap she knew she must look every bit as ragged as morris indicated i saw his face i looked in his face she spoke quietly i cant sleep roarke because ill see it she pressed her fingers to her eyes then rose i looked at him and if i hadnt known what he was i wouldnt have seen it she walked away dragged open a window breathed hes young his face is still a little soft around the edges his hairs all red and curly like i dont know a pretty kids doll or something hed killed tonight taken a life a life connected to him by blood with deliberation and forethought and extreme violence and he sat there talking to me teary remorseful he played it perfectly and i wouldnt have seen it i wouldnt have seen whats in him he hated to hear the fatigue in her voice and more the discouragement that ghosted through it why should you because i was watching for it and it wasnt there she whirled back he enjoyed it i know that in my gut but i didnt see it on his face didnt see it in his eyes he was entertained id upped the stakes for him again same game new level i wanted to hurt him she continued personally i wanted to ram my fist into his face until i erased it erased him instead you walked away he crossed to her certain she was unaware that her cheeks were wet because youll erase him by stopping him by putting him in a cage for the rest of his life eve he framed her face in his hands brushed at the damp with his thumbs darling eve youre exhausted right down to the bone if you dont rest wholl stand for those women she lifted her hands to his wrists the dream i had the last one with my father standing there bleeding from dozens of holes id put in him he said id never be rid of him he was right you take one down and another ones right there right there waiting i cant sleep because ill see them not tonight he drew her in we wont let them come in tonight if you wont sleep he brushed his lips over her temple youll rest he picked her up carried her back to the sofa what are we doing well watch a movie he told her a movie roarke its something you dont do enough of he laid her down selected a film disc go outside yourself and into makebelieve dramas or comedies joys and sorrows that pull you away from your own for a bit of time he came back slid behind her and tucked her head on his shoulder ive told you about this one magda lane it took me out of my own miseries once it felt so good to lie with him to have his arm hooked cozily around her waist the opening music swept into the room color and costume swirled onscreen how many times have you seen this she asked him oh dozens i suppose shh youll miss the opening lines she watched and when her lids drooped she listened then she slept o o when she woke it was quiet and it was dark and his arm was still around her fatigue wanted to drag her back under but she willed it back and turned her wrist up to check the time already after five she thought shed had a solid three hours sleep and it would have to be enough but when she started to move roarkes arm tightened take a few minutes more cant its going to take a half hour in the shower to beat my brain back into shape i wonder if i can take a shower lying down its called a bath not the same why are you whispering im not whispering she cleared her throat and felt as if shed swallowed splinters of glass just a little hoarse lights on ten percent in the dim glow he nudged her onto her back pale as a ghost too he said and laid a hand on her brow something like panic ran over his face i think youre running a fever i am not if he could feel panic at the thought of illness she could feel fear im not sick i dont get sick you dont sleep more than a handful of hours in a week and live on coffee you get sick damn it eve youve sabotaged your immune system once too often i have not she started to sit up then plopped back when the room spun im just getting my bearings i ought to strap you in bed for the next month you need a bloody keeper he rolled off the sofa strode to the house link i dont know what youre so pissed off about her voice was perilously close to a whine and appalled her im just a little muggy yet you set a single toe off that sofa and im hauling you to the doctor you just try it pal and well see who needs medical attention since the threat came out in a wheeze it wasnt particularly effective roarke simply glared at her and snapped into the link summerset eves ill i need you up here what what are you doing she shoved herself up nearly gained her feet before roarke stalked back and held her down hes not touching me he lays one hand on me and im beating you both bloody wheres my weapon its him or the health center she sucked in air you are not the boss here prove it he challenged take me down she pushed up he shoved her back she reared again and this time pumped her fist into his belly its gratifying to see you have some strength left even if that was a girl punch the insult nearly rendered her speechless the first chance the very first chance i get im tying your dick into a knot wont that be fun he looked over as summerset came in shes running a fever i am not dont you touch me dont lay a hand she cursed struggled when roarke straddled her and pinned her arms such childishness summerset clucked his tongue laid a hand on her brow temperatures slightly elevated he danced his long fingers under her jaw along her throat stick out your tongue eve roarkes single word was drenched in warning as she pressed her lips tightly together she stuck out her tongue do you have any pain summerset asked her yeah in my ass i call it summerset i see your droll wit hasnt suffered just a bit of a bug he said to roarke due i imagine to exhaustion stress and juvenile eating habits we can ward it off and treat the symptoms ill go get what she needs shell do best with a day or two in bed get off me she said in a low clear voice when summerset went out right now no her arms were trembling under his grip and he didnt think it was all from temper not until weve dealt with this are you cold no she was freezing and the pitiful struggle shed put up had awakened aches everywhere then why are you shivering he bit off an oath snagged a throw from the back of the couch and had it flung over her before she could push the order from brain to body to move damn it roarke hes going to come back and poke at me and try to make me drink one of his weird brews i just need a hot shower let me up have a heart i do and its yours he lowered his brow to hers thats the problem im feeling better really it was a lie poorly executed as her voice was beginning to tremble and when i close this case ill take a day off ill sleep for twenty hours ill eat vegetables he had to smile i love you eve then dont let him back in here her eyes wheeled as she heard the elevator doors open hes coming she whispered in the name of everything holy save me she needs to sit up summerset set a tray on the table on it was a glass of milky liquid a trio of white tablets and a pressure syringe eve let herself go limp and when roarke eased back she sprang it was a sweaty battle but a short one without batting a lash summerset stepped over pinched her nose closed dropped the tablets in her mouth and chased them down her throat with the liquid he smiled at roarke while she sputtered i recall having to do that to you a time or two thats where i learned it get her shirt off the vitamin booster will work fastest this way to save time and his own skin roarke simply ripped off her sleeve hows that good enough shed gone past anger into weeping humiliating herself everything hurt head body pride when the syringe pressed against her arm she barely felt it shh baby shh shaken roarke stroked her hair and rocked her its all over now dont cry go away she said even as she clung to him just go away leave me alone with her summerset touched roarkes shoulder felt a pang when he saw the naked emotion on his face give us a few minutes all right roarke held her tight another minute ill be in the gym when he set her aside she curled into a ball summerset sat beside her saying nothing until shed sniffled herself into silence what he feels for you overwhelms him summerset began there was never anyone else the women who came and went before you were diversions temporary interests he might care because despite everything that was done to him hes a man with a large capacity for caring and still there was no one before you dont you see how he worries she uncurled herself rubbed her hands over her wet face as if she could rub away the embarrassment of the tears he shouldnt worry he does and he will you need rest lieutenant and a few days without work and worry and so does he so very much does he he wont take his without you i cant not now wont she closed her eyes go up to my office look at the faces of the dead pinned to my board then tell me to step away he wouldnt would he but to do what you need to do you require your strength energies and wit he leaned over picked up the glass finish it she frowned at the glass she hated to admit whatever hed given her was already working so she wouldnt its probably poison poison he said amused why didnt i think of that perhaps next time harhar she took the glass downed the remaining contents there must be a way to make this taste less like sewage certainly he set the glass back on the tray then got to his feet but im entitled to my small pleasures i might suggest you try some moderate exercise now she didnt have time but she took it anyway and went down to the gym he wasnt using the machines he rarely did but was steadily sweatily working his way through bench presses he had the screen on with the audio set to spew out the various stock reports she found she didnt understand the words any more than she did the symbols she went to him knelt by his head im sorry he continued to lift set lower feeling better yeah roarke im sorry i was an idiot dont be mad at me i dont think i could handle it right now im not mad at you he lifted the bar into the safety then slid out from under the situation occasionally rips my throat out i cant do anything else i cant be anything else he reached down for his towel rubbed it over his face i wouldnt want you to do or be anything else its beyond my capabilities not to react as i do when you run yourself into the ground you usually drag me back out before the ground closes over my head he looked at her face still so pale he thought nearly transparent doesnt seem i was quite quick enough this time lets go to mexico excuse me the house in mexico she figured if she could surprise him she was still in reasonable shape its been a while why dont we take a long weekend once this is over considering her he drew the towel between his hands then hooked it behind her head to bring her closer whos dragging who back out now lets drag each other give me time to close this down and you do whatever it is you do to clear a few days then well run away well lie on the beach well get drunk and have monkey sex well watch film discs until our eyes fall out go back to the monkey sex she laid her hands on his cheeks ive got to get ready for the briefing weve got a deal right yes he pressed his lips to her forehead relieved to find it cool again we definitely have a deal she got up but when she reached the door turned back to look at him he still sat on the bench lean and sweaty in a black muscle shirt hed tied his hair back and had yet to bother with shoes and he watched her through eyes so brilliantly blue it seemed she could dive through them and into him there was never anybody before you she said i just wanted to say that and when i did what i do and it opened a crack in me like it did last night there was nobody there to hold on to me i didnt want anyone to hold on to me until you and i got through and i got by and it was okay but i think maybe if id just kept getting through and getting by id have come to a point where i couldnt do it anymore and if i couldnt do it anymore itd be the end of me roarke she took a steadying breath so when you hold on to me youre helping me stand up one more time and the dead youre standing for them too i just wanted to say that she went out quickly and left him staring after her o o when she strode into her office at six minutes after six she was heavyeyed pale but clearheaded she found mcnab and peabody had already raided the autochef and feeney just arrived was helping himself to the spread set out across her desk what the hell do you think this is the breakfast barn gotta have fuel feeney munched into a strip of bacon mother mary its pig meat know how long its been since i had a slice of real pig she nipped it out of his fingers ate it herself then get a damn plate you can eat while i bring you up to speed peabody it appears theres no cup of coffee in my hand i can only assume ive somehow stepped into an alternate universe peabody swallowed a heaping forkful of ham and eggs maybe in this one im the lieutenant and youre she hopped up propelled by eves frightening look let me get you a cup of coffee lieutenant sir you do that the rest of the team are due here by oh eight hundred ive already got the diagram of the target area onscreen with computergenerated selections for personnel placement well consider those and adjust if warranted feeney id suggest you take mcnab into the surveillance vehicle id prefer a spot in the park sir and a chance to be in on the takedown eve angled her head at mcnab and copped another slice of bacon from the plate feeney had just fixed you should have thought of that before you picked a fight and got your pretty face all banged up which will only draw attention to you in a place where children play and birds sing merrily in the trees gotcha there feeney said to mcnab youre with me youll want another eman as point eve continued you know your men better than i do so i leave it to you good because ive already picked him roarke he said and wagged a finger at the doorway as the man in question strode in good morning he was still in black and though the shirt and trousers were elegant he managed to look every bit as lean and dangerous as he had in the muscle shirt sorry am i late you think youre sneaky dont you he snatched the bacon eve had snatched out of her hand not at all lieutenant i know i am which is why im very suited for this op you want in its up to him she jerked a thumb at feeney but remember this is my op he bit into the bacon handed it back to her how could i forget by eightthirty the full team was briefed she began assigning roles and positions hey hey detective baxter waved a hand how come i have to be a sidewalk sleeper because you make such a good one eve told him and you look so sexy with a beggars license around your neck trueheart ought to be the sleeper baxter insisted hes the rookie i dont mind lieutenant eve glanced at trueheart youre too young too wholesome baxters got some miles on him peabody you and roarke will do the couples stroll through this area eve used her laser pointer to highlight the diagram onscreen trueheart youre park maintenance staff and youll cover this sector ive got the best gig peabody told mcnab nobody approaches the suspect eve continued that time of the afternoon spring day the parks going to have a lot of traffic people taking their lunch in the open air kids running around the parks open daily to botany clubs birdwatching clubs school field trips the area the suspect selected is fairly secluded but there will be civilians weapons are not to be drawn without extreme need i dont want to see little johnny stunned off the swing set because somebody got jumpy she sat on the edge of her desk youll also be on the lookout for the second suspect we have no way of knowing if they work in tandem during their setup stage if you spot him if you think youve spotted him you relay that data to feeney you do not repeat do not move on him if he shows hes to be kept under surveillance she scanned the room to lock this cage tight i have to wait for this asshole to spike the drink and offer it to me when that occurs we take him possibly both of them quick quiet clean questions chapter nineteen the last question was asked and answered and the troops dispersed surveillance and placement in the park would begin at eleven hundred hours the entire op will be recorded every man will be wired audio and video well have all the angles still she paced her office searching for any holes in her plan youll have him in hand in a matter of hours roarke told her yeah ill have him she stopped peered out the window it was a beautiful day full of flowers and warmth and white puffy clouds springtime in new york come out and play the park would be full of people thats what he wanted she thought he liked crowds they added to the thrill the risk the satisfaction kill in plain sight ill have him she repeated but i want it quick and clean carrying the illegals isnt enough mixing it with a drink isnt enough but once he hands it to me hes done she turned looked at the board looked at the faces finch make any transmissions i should know about none whatsoever good i thought she was smart enough to be scared the others she wondered had they been frightened had there been a moment one instant when theyd understood enough to have the fear leaping into their throats clawing toward a scream you saved her eve but for you her face would be on that board it doesnt feel like enough peabody had said that eve remembered right at the beginning i have a lot of questions for kevin morano its unlikely the answers will satisfy you having them is sometimes the only satisfaction you get and shed have to make it enough i dont want you taking a weapon she said as she turned to roarke a weapon he asked innocently why lieutenant an expert consultant civilian isnt issued a weapon issued my ass youve got a fucking arsenal in your museum upstairs leave them there of course i give you my word i wont take anything out of my fully registered and legal collection roarke im warning you it sounds like your other consultants are on their way giggles bounced into the room be sure to remind them about the weapon policy you want me to have you searched before the op only if you do it darling his voice was ohsowarm and very irish im shy her pithy response was drowned out as mavis and company piled into the room hey dallas you missed the party so i hear we were supposed to have a practice session trina reminded her i was you know unavoidably detained she had to order herself to stand her ground when trina came up to stare at her face what you look crappy thanks thats just the look i was going for when this is over youre in for a full treatment including relaxation therapy actually eve said im going out of town right after you can go wherever the hell you like after the treatment how am i supposed to use you to drum up new clients when you go around looking like you spent a week in a cave you trying to ruin my reputation yes actually thats been my central goal since we met funny lets get started ill just leave you to it roarke said where are you going eve made a grab for him much like a drowning man would grab at a dangling rope he evaded her hand i have work and he turned his back on the love of his life deserting her without a backward glance now youre mine trina smiled with lips dyed a summer grass green strip o o leonardos whipping up an outfit for you mavis said sometime later he said you dont have anything in your wardrobe that suits this look it just gets better and better eve kept reminding herself that shed vowed to protect and serve whatever the cost even if that was ninety minutes of allowing a crazy woman to smooth pack and tuck god knew what all over her face and body coming along with her green skinsuit covered with a bright pink smock trina smoothed at the face putty shed used to redefine eves chin how you holding up boobs feel funny heavy thats because you have some now i know a guy who can do that permanent for you at cost ill keep my own thanks just the same up to you hold still this needs a minute to set why is it taking so long i cant believe those assholes spent hours a day prepping for these dates probably not change your appearance that way in under an hour if you know what youre doing but were not just changing yours were replicating as close as we can somebody elses image trina snapped the kiwiscented gum she was chewing its lots trickier its really working too in a smock of dizzying neon swirls of blue and yellow mavis stood in as first assistant the whole shape of your face is different dallas youve lost the chin dent the edge of your cheekbones you look softer wanna see no not till its done how much longer ive got to get in the field final innings coming up ive gotta blend this color do the surface enhancements trina rubbed a bit of color into the back of eves hand pursed her lips studied the computer image of stefanie finch what do you think she asked mavis need to pink it up just a little yeah she added a dab to a testing bowl blended yeah yeah this is it im a fucking genius mav better call leonardo and tell him to hustle it with the outfit i need to know how much of her to cover with this as little as possible eve begged relax your face im going to start there this is a nice face she added as she went to work pretty and all yours is actually the more interesting of the two though golly trina im all atingle if you took basic care of it it would last you another fiftysixty years without serious sculpting cause you got good bones across the room mavis was cooing into the house link it seemed to eve she and leonardo couldnt have a conversation with each other without cooing white skinsuit red swish mavis announced elbow sleeves scooped neck to midboobs hell have it down in five what the hells a swish eve wanted to know no talking till i finish the lip area very sexy trina said to mavis good choice with this coloring can you do the extremities frigid i just love playing with the goop i have to take your wedding ring dallas ill give it to roarke instinctively eve curled her fingers in protest a gesture that made maviss romantic heart sigh dont worry she gave eves hand a part i remember when he put this on you the first time almost a year ago it was the best wedding eve relaxed again listened to maviss chatter with half an ear she knew leonardo came in by maviss purr of greeting then there was cooing and kissy sounds wonderful job trina his rich voice sounded very close to eves head which told her hed bent down to study the work i wouldnt have recognized her did you decide on the silitrex or the plastisinal base silitrex more pliable and she doesnt need it to last that long eve opened one eye when a finger poked at her cheek and saw leonardos wide golden face looming in front of hers am i done yet she asked him he smiled eyes warming teeth flashing white and gold almost youre going to be pleased what about the eyes he asked trina temp gels well get them close shell wear some amber sunshades too she peered at something over eves shoulder great outfit ive got a lip dye that matches that red and well use crisp tones on the cheeks and eyes can you guys handle doing her nails i dont need my nails done woman goes on a hot date she does her nails fingers and toes trina added fifteen more minutes she promised it took nearly twice that and eve was considering making a break for it but since she was surrounded she stayed put and nearly wept with relief when trina fixed on the wig shed dyed and styled the night before eve sat while her three keepers took several steps back and studied her ive got one thing to say trina began i am good she snapped a finger wardrobe and accessories o o two hours after the transformation began eve stood in front of the mirror leonardo hauled in after the first jolt she settled down to study and critique she knew what a swish was now it was exactly that a swish of material that swirled down in a kind of openfronted skirt this one was murderous red and fell to midcalf it did nothing as far as she could see to make the skinsuit more modest nothing could they were called skinsuits for a reason the same reason she never wore the damn things might as well walk around naked the body she was walking around in was curvier than her own despite the fact the breasts werent hers she felt uncomfortable having them so prominently displayed another inch of flesh and shed have had to cite herself for indecent exposure her hair was lighter longer sort of a subtle blonde that scooped into points at her chin a rounded undented chin with soft and rounded cheeks her mouth didnt look quite so wide with those cheeks that chin still with the rich red dye it practically popped off the face her eyes were hazel with hints of green but the expression in them was all eve okay she nodded watched stefanies face nod back at her you are good but lets give it the big test she crossed the room walked into roarkes office he was on the link had a laser fax coming in and a holoblueprint of a building hovering over his desk ill approve the changes to the first level yes but ill need to see he trailed off stared for a full five seconds sorry jansen ill have to get back to you he ended transmission tapped something that had the holo evaporating he rose walked to her around her amazing truly are you in there he murmured then looked into her eyes ah yes there you are what tips it trina may be a miracle worker but she cant do anything about those cops eyes when she frowned roarke lifted her chin with his hand feels very natural he added with a gentle rub of his thumb check the boobs trina invited from behind eve theyre the latest temps cant tell them from godmade go ahead take a squeeze well if you insist ignoring eves growl of warning he cupped the breasts you feel very healthy they come off the minute i take him down so dont get any sick ideas they taste real too trina assured him roarkes eyebrow arched really dont even think about it she slapped his hands away give me the verdict will he buy it hook and line lieutenant you might want to adjust your gait a bit saunter rather than stride saunter check and try not to look at him as though you already had him in interview youre going to a picnic in the park try to remember what thats like ive never had a picnic in the park he skimmed a finger down her chin just where the dent would be well have to fix that soon o o she rode to the north end of the park in the surveillance vehicle leaning over feeneys shoulder as he did the checks running sweeps baxter the first of feeneys screens showed a fountain fed by a leaping dolphin she could hear the tinkle of water against water snatches of conversations as people strolled and baxters whiny plea for contributions the screen jumped slightly as he circled doing your gimp routine baxter eve demanded roger that he replied just remember whatever you take in from the suckers goes in the greenpeace fund as feeney moved from man to man she gauged the situation as shed predicted the park was a popular place on a bright june afternoon she watched a trio of teachers herding a school group like woolly sheep through the botanical gardens possible sighting peabodys voice came over the speakers male caucasian shoulderlength black hair wearing tan trousers light blue shirt carrying wicker picnic basket and black leather bag heading east on path endangered species section i see him eve studied the man onscreen now that was sauntering she decided watching the way he swung the basket gently at his side and on his hand was a bicolored gold ring set with a ruby go in on the ring she told feeney he blocked magnified and she saw the dragons head carved into the stone thats a positive id we got our man keep him in sight baxter hell be moving into your sector copy that im on him peabody you and roarke maintain your distance hes thirty minutes early she said needs time to get set up lets give it to him truehearts got a visual mcnab said from his bank of screens possible suspect moving south now hes heading toward the arranged area looks like weve got him maintain distance eve warned trueheart angle a little to your left perfect lets watch the show he moved off the path onto the grassy area designated for picnics two other couples were there before him as well as a trio of women obviously taking a long lunch break from work one lone male lay flat on his back sunbathing at eves order he rolled lazily to his side propped an ebook by his elbow and gave her a new angle on kevin morano kevin paused turning his head right and left as he studied the area he opted for shade turning for the largest tree where sun dappled softly on the grass there he set down basket and bag i want all available eyes on him eve announced then she hissed as she saw the visual from peabodys recorder peabody roarke not too close lovely spot for a picnic roarkes voice was warm and cheerful just let me spread this blanket darling i wouldnt want you to get grass stains on that lovely outfit blanket i didnt clear that eve began this sure is a surprise peabody gave what eve recognized as an uneasy laugh i wasnt expecting a picnic whats life without some surprise she saw roarkes face and the amused look on it as he spread a blanket on the ground several feet away kevin mirrored the move such a pretty spot roarke continued then lowered his voice as he sat we can enjoy the view without getting in anyones way i want no interference from any location no one repeat no one moves in without my signal naturally champagne sweetheart peabody you take one sip and youre busted to traffic even as she spoke she watched kevin he opened the basket removed three pink roses and laid them on the blanket he lifted wineglasses held them to the sunlight to watch them sparkle he opened a bottle of white poured a glass okay okay add the chaser you son of a bitch but instead he raised the glass in a kind of selftoast and sipped then he turned his wrist checked the time taking out his pocketlink he made a call up your audio peabody eve ordered lets see if we can get an ear on him she heard birds conversations giggles a childs war hoop before she could demand it feeney was filtering kevins voice came clearly couldnt be better ten people in the immediate area so thats a point for public venue i suspect well have to pass some park police on the way out bonus points there he paused laughed a very young very happy sound yes having her do that to me in broad daylight in a public park would certainly shoot me into the lead ill let you know he tucked the link away then sat a moment breathing deep admiring the view just a game eve murmured its going to be a pleasure taking these bastards down he continued his preparations moving a bit faster now taking out a cold pack opening it to a presentation of caviar he set out toast points and the accompaniments foie gras cold lobster fresh berries gotta admit the guy knows how to set out a spread shut up mcnab eve muttered he sampled a berry then another as he nibbled she saw his eyes change there she thought there it was the coolness the calculation it remained steady as he poured the second glass of wine he watched and watched carefully as he opened the black bag he reached in brought his hand out again with the palm facing his body and casually he held his hand over the second glass tipped she saw in roarkes recorder a thin trickle of liquid bingo hes ready for her im coming in take third stage positions report any possible sightings of alternate target she moved to the rear doors im under take him down kid feeney said and kept his eyes glued to the screens she stepped out into the sun and warmth when she caught herself striding she did her best to saunter she was barely into the park when a lunchhour jogger trotted up to her hey beautiful how about a little run how about you back off before i knock you on your pudgy ass thats my cop roarke said softly in her ear as she kept walking she spotted baxter under a stringy tangle of dirtcolored hair a torn tshirt and drooping trousers that were both smeared with what looked like egg substitute and ketchup most park patrons were giving him a wide berth as she neared him she caught the whiff of old sweat and stale brew mixed with urine the man really got into character she thought when she passed him she got a wheezy wolf whistle bite me i dream of it he said behind his hand night and day in the five minutes it took her to move through the park she was approached with propositions four times you might want to take the illkickyourasstheneatit look off your face lieutenant mcnab suggested most guysd be a little put off by it ive never been roarke commented caviar he said to peabody well i guess eve fixed what she hoped was a pleasant expression on her face and thought about the nice little chat shed be having with her personnel including her expert consultant civilian then the view opened she saw kevin everything else was set aside he saw her as well a slow boyish smile crossed his face just a little shy at the edges he got to his feet hesitated then walked to her make my dreams come true and tell me youre stefanie im stefanie and youre wordsworth he took her hand lifted it to his lips youre even lovelier than i imagined than i hoped and youre everything i thought youd be she left her hand in his dating had never been one of her strong suits but shed planned carefully how she would behave what she would say i hope im not late not at all i was early i wanted he gestured toward the picnic i wanted everything to be perfect oh it looks wonderful youve gone to so much trouble ive looked forward to this for a long time he led her to the blanket she passed within a foot of roarke caviar she said as she sat you certainly know how to throw a picnic she leaned over turned the bottle of wine around so she could see the label the same hed used with bryna bankhead my favorite she made her lips curve its as if you could read my mind ive felt that way ever since we first corresponded getting to know you online i felt as if i knew you had always known you was somehow meant to this guy is good mcnab breathed in her ear i felt the connection too eve said using stefanies words to her as a guide the letters the poetry we shared all the fabulous stories about your travels i think its fate it is he that saith not kismet oh shit eve thought mind scrambling she opened her mouth and roarke whispered the rest of the quote in her ear it is he who knows not fate she repeated what do you think fate has in store for us wordsworth who can say but i cant wait to find out give me the damn wine you worthless murdering bastard but instead he handed her the roses theyre lovely she made herself sniff them somehow i knew theyd suit you best pink rosebuds soft warm romantic he lifted his own glass toyed with the stem ive looked forward to giving them to you to having this time with you shall we have a toast yes she continued to look into his eyes while she willed him to pick up the glass to put it into her hand trying for flirtatious she brushed the rosebuds against her cheek and he picked up the glass he put it into her hand to fateful beginnings and even better she said to destined endings she brought the glass to her lips saw his gaze greedily follow it and the shadow of irritation smoke over them as she lowered it again without drinking oh just one second she let out a quick laugh set the wine aside and opened her purse theres just one thing i want to do first with her free hand she took his then pulling out the restraints snapped them on kevin morano youre under arrest what what the hell is this when he tried to yank away she had the pleasure of knocking him flat rolling him and with her knee in the small of his back securing the restraints for the murder of bryna bankhead the attempted murder of moniqua cline and accessory in the murder of grace lutz what the hell are you talking about what are you doing when he tried to buck she simply held her weapon to his head who the hell are you im lieutenant eve dallas remember it im your goddamn fate my name is dallas lieutenant eve she repeated because her gorge wanted to rise into her throat and ive stopped you so what a voice whispered in her ear her fathers voice anothers coming another always is for an instant just an instant her finger twitched on her weapon tempted she heard the voices behind and above her the alarmed buzzing of civilians the clipped orders from her team and she felt roarke there just there at her side rising she dragged kevin up looks like this wasnt such a fucking picnic after all you have the right to remain silent she began o o she escorted him to transport herself she needed to he wasnt remaining silent instead he babbled about mistaken identity miscarriages of justice and his influential family he wasnt yet babbling for his lawyer but he would eve was sure of it shed be lucky to have fifteen minutes in interview with him before his terror and shock settled back into calculation ive got to go in get started on him right away eve she shook her head at roarke im all right im okay but she wasnt there were drums banging inside her skull in defense she dragged off the wig scooped her hand through her hair ive got to get this crap off me they should be finished booking him by the time i get back to normal trinas going to meet you at central give you a hand with it good i guess ill see you at home im coming in with you theres no point in discussing it he finished nor in telling her he was going to administer the next round of meds summerset had given him why dont i drive you well get there faster o o it took forty minutes to get back into her own skin eve could only think roarke had said something to trina the woman didnt utter a single complaint about dismantling her masterpiece so soon nor did she launch into a lecture on face and body maintenance when eve was blissfully rinsing her face in cold water trina shuffled her feet i helped do something really important right face dripping eve turned her head yeah you did we couldnt have brought this down today without you gives me a rush she blushed guess you get that a lot you going to go squeeze his balls now yeah im going to go squeeze his balls give them an extra twist for me she opened the door surprised at seeing roarke walk into the bathroom trina tapped the sign on the door you definitely aint no woman sweet buns with a wink she headed out shes right you definitely aint no woman even at central we have certain standards of behavior and guys dont come into the womens toilet facilities i thought youd prefer a little privacy for this he took a packet pills and the dreaded pressure syringe out of the small bag he carried what she backed up stay away from me you sadist eve you need your next dose i do not tell me look at me tell me you dont have a massive headache in addition to body aches and that your own sweet buns arent starting to drag lying to me he continued before she could speak is just going to piss me off enough so i gain twisted pleasure in forcing the meds on you which we both know from experience i can do she gauged the distance to the door shed never make it i dont want the shot well thats a pity as youre getting it dont put us through another round like this morning be a brave little soldier now and roll up your sleeve i hate you yes i know weve added a bit of flavoring to the liquid packet raspberry gee my mouths just watering chapter twenty she was rolling up her other sleeve as she walked toward interview room a apparently it wasnt just her car that was having an electronic rebellion climate control was on the fritz in this section and the air was hot stuffy and violently scented with bad coffee peabody was waiting outside the door perspiring lightly in full uniform he whining for a lawyer yet not yet sticking to the mistaken identity story beautiful hes going to be an idiot sir in my opinion he thinks were the idiots better and better come on lets do this eve pushed open the door kevin sat at the single table at one of the two chairs he was sweating as well and not so delicately he looked over as eve came in and his lips trembled thank god i was afraid id just been left here and forgotten theres been some horrible mistake maam i was having a picnic with a woman i met online a woman i knew only as stefanie suddenly she went crazy she said she was the police and then i was brought here he spread his hand a gesture of reason and puzzlement i dont know whats going on ill just bring you up to speed she drew out a chair straddled it but calling me crazy isnt going to endear you to me kevin he stared im sorry i dont even know you now kevin what a thing to say after you gave me those pretty flowers and quoted poetry to me men peabody what are you going to do cant live with them cant beat them with a stick kevins eyes darted from one face to the other you it was you in the park i dont understand i told you to remember my name engage recorder she said interview with suspect kevin morano regarding charges of murder in the first in the case of bryna bankhead accessory to murder in the case of grace lutz attempted murder in the cases of moniqua cline and stefanie finch additional charges of sexual assault rape illegals possession administering illegals to persons without consent also filed interview conducted by dallas lieutenant eve also present peabody officer delia mr morano has been informed of his rights isnt that so kevin i dont did you receive the revised miranda warning kevin yes but do you understand your rights and obligations as contained in that warning of course but she made a mildly impatient sound held up a finger dont be in such a hurry she stared at him went silent when he licked his lips opened them she wagged a finger at him again and watched a single line of sweat drip down his temple hot in here she said conversationally theyre working on the climate control must be pretty miserable under that wig and face putty you want to ditch them i dont know what you she merely reached over gave the wig a quick jerk then tossed it to peabody i bet that feels cooler its not a crime to wear hair alternatives he raked unsteady fingers through his shortcropped hair you wore a different one the night you killed bryna bankhead another still the night you tried to kill moniqua cline he looked eve dead in the eyes i dont know those women no you didnt know them they were nothing to you just toys did it amuse you to seduce them with poetry and flowers with candlelight and wine kevin did it make you feel sexy manly maybe you cant get it up unless the womans drugged and helpless you cant get a boner unless its rape thats ridiculous a ripple of anger passed over his face insulting well pardon the hell out of me but when a guy has to rape a woman to get off it tells me he cant do the job otherwise his chin lifted a fraction i have never raped a woman in my life i bet you believe that they wanted it didnt they once you slipped a little whore into their wine they were practically begging you for it but you only did it to loosen them up eve rose walked around the table just priming the pump guy like you doesnt have to rape women youre young handsome rich sophisticated educated she leaned over from behind him put her mouth close to his ear but its boring isnt it guys entitled to a little extra zip and women hell theyre all whores under the skin like your mother for instance he cringed away from her what are you talking about my mother is a highly regarded and highly successful businesswoman who got knocked up in a lab did she even know your father i wonder did it matter to her once she was revved to go how much did they pay her to drop the suit and complete the pregnancy she ever tell you you have no right to speak to me this way his voice was thick with tears were you looking for mommy in those women kevin did you want to fuck her punish her or both thats disgusting there i knew wed hit a point of agreement in the end she sold herself didnt she no difference really between her and those other women and all you did was bring out their true natures they were cruising for it on the web got what they asked for and then some is that what you and lucias figured he jerked and his breath hitched i dont know what youre talking about im not going to listen to any more of this i want to see your superior whose idea was it to kill them it was his wasnt it youre not a violent man are you bryna that was an accident wasnt it just bad luck that might help you out some kevin might help you out a little with bryna being accidental but youll have to work with me on that i told you i dont know any bryna she whirled until her face was pushed into his your pants are on fire asshole look at me weve got you cold all the goodies in your little black bag the illegal substance you slipped into the wine we had you under surveillance fully recorded from the time you stepped into the park heard you talking to your pal about the points you were going to rack up and youre real photogenic kevin i bet the jury thinks so too when they see the disc of you slipping the illegal into the wine i bet theyll be so goddamn impressed theyll give you oh id say three life sentences no possibility of parole on an off planet penal colony a nice concrete cage to call your own she hammered it at him while he stared at her with horror creeping over his face three squares a day oh not the squares youre used to she added fingering the material of his shirt but theyll keep you alive a long long time and you know what happens to rapists in prison especially pretty ones theyll all try you out then theyll fight over you and try you out some more theyll fuck you half to death kevin and the more you beg them to stop the more you plead the harder theyll ram into you she straightened stared into the twoway glass into the nightmare that lived in her own eyes that crawled in her own belly if youre lucky she said somebody named big willy will make you his bitch and keep the others off you feeling lucky kevin this is harassment this is intimidation this is reality she snapped this is fate this is destiny this is your goddamn kismet pal you trolled for women in online chats poetry chats thats where you found bryna bankhead you developed a relationship with her while using the name dante and working with your friend and fellow creep lucias dunwood you arranged to meet her she paused let it sink in you sent her flowers pink roses at work you spent some time watching her on her day off you used a unit in the cyberjoint across the street we got you nailed there you know weve got a whole frigging division of cybergeeks on the payroll kev ill tell you a little secret she eased in again dropped her voice to a conspirators whisper youre not as good as you think you are not there not at the joint on fifth either you left prints she watched his lips tremble like a child about to cry anyway she said back to bryna bankhead you met her at the rainbow room coming back to you yet kevin she was a pretty woman you had drinks or you did and she had whore you mixed with her wine when she was primed with it you went back to her place gave her a little more just in case she slapped her hands on the table leaned in you turned on music you lit the candles you tossed fucking pink rose petals on the bed and you raped her to give it all a little more kick you fed her some wild rabbit her system couldnt take it and she died died right there in the bed of roses scared you didnt it pissed you off what the hell did she mean by dying and messing up your plans you threw her off the terrace threw her out on the street like she was garbage no did you watch her fall kevin i dont think so you were done with her had to cover your ass didnt you run home to lucias and ask him what to do she straightened turned away strolled over and got herself a cup of water he runs you doesnt he you havent got the spine to run yourself no one runs me not lucias not you not anyone im a man my own man then it was your idea no it was i have nothing to say i want my lawyer good she eased a hip down on the table i was hoping youd say that because once you bring the lawyers in i dont have to work with you toward any sort of deal ive got to tell you kevin just the idea of making a deal with you was making me sick to my stomach and ive got a really strong stomach right peabody titanium steel sir yep thats me eve gave her stomach a little pat but you managed to churn it now im all steady again picturing you spending the rest of your pitiful life in a cage without your pretty suits all snuggled up with big willy she pushed off the table when i have lucias sitting where youre sitting now ill get a little sick again working with him because hes going to go for a deal and roll right over on you what are the current odds on that in the pool peabody three to five on dunwood sir i better place my bet lets get you that lawyer kevin break in interview due to suspects request for representation she turned for the door wait her eyes january ice met peabodys something on your mind kevin i just wondered strictly out of curiosity what you mean by a deal sorry i cant get into that as youve called for your lawyer the lawyer can wait gotcha eve thought and turned back record on continuation of interview same subjects please repeat that kevin for the record the lawyer can wait id like to know what you mean by a deal im going to need a nausea pill she sighed sat again okay you know what youve got to do kevin youve got to come clean tell me how it all happened i need chapter and verse and youre going to have to show me some good faith and some sincere remorse you pull that off and ill go to bat for you recommend that youre given better facilities separated from the general population of buttfuckers i dont understand what sort of deal is that you think im going to go to jail oh kevin kevin she sighed i know youre going over what happens to you after youre there is up to you i want immunity and i want to sing show tunes on broadway neither one of us have a chance in hell of realizing those precious dreams we got your dna you stupid putz you didnt suit up for your parties we got your juice your prints and you know that little sample they took from you at booking theyre running it right now its going to match kevin we both know its going to match what you left behind in bryna and moniqua once it does once i have the dna match in my hot little hand play times over ill put you down like a sick dog and all the lawyers in all the land wont be able to help you you have to give me something a plea bargain a way out i have money her hand whipped out snatched his shirtfront was that a bribe kevin am i adding bribing a cop to your list of credits no no i just i need some help here he tried to calm himself to sound reasonable cooperative i cant go to prison i dont belong in prison it was just a game a contest it was all luciass idea it was an accident a game a contest someone elses idea an accident she shook her head is this multiple choice we were bored thats all we were bored and needed something to do we were just having a little fun a kind of reenactment of his bastard grandfathers great experiment then it went wrong it was an accident she wasnt supposed to die who wasnt supposed to die kevin that first woman bryna i didnt kill her it just happened she leaned back now tell me how it happened kevin tell me how it just happened o o an hour later eve stepped out of interview a miserable pusboil on the ass of humanity yes sir he is you wrapped him up tight peabody added a platoon of lawyers wont be able to poke so much as a pinhole in that confession hes gone yeah the other boil wont break so easy alert the team peabody same personnel as the park im getting a warrant for dunwood they deserve to be in on act two you got it dallas what do you really want to sing show tunes on broadway doesnt everyone she pulled out her communicator prepared to request her warrant it beeped in her hand dallas my office whitney ordered now yes sir what is he psychic round up the crew peabody i want to move on dunwood within the hour with the interview on her mind and the anticipation of getting her hands on lucias hot in her blood she walked into whitneys office shed been prepared to give him her report orally her plans changed when she saw renfrew and another man in whitneys office face impassive whitney remained behind his desk lieutenant captain hayes i believe you and detective renfrew have already met yes sir detective renfrew is here with his captain hes considering filing a formal complaint re your conduct in the theodore mcnamara investigation of which he is primary of record in hopes to avoid any such action ive asked you to come here so that the matter can be discussed there was a dull roar inside her head a low burn deep in her gut let him file lieutenant neither i nor this department have a desire to wade through the mess of a complaint if it can be avoided i dont give a damn what you or the department wants her tone bit and had something unidentifiable flashing in whitneys eyes you file your complaint renfrew file it and ill finish you i told you how it was renfrew bared his teeth got no respect for the badge no respect for fellow officers she comes onto my crime scene throwing her weight around pulling rank undermining my investigation questioned my crime scene unit after i requested her to remove herself before she contaminated the scene goes behind my back to the me getting data on a body thats not hers whitney held up a hand to halt renfrews tirade your response to this lieutenant you want my response to this ill give it to you funous she yanked a disc out of her pocket slapped it onto the desk theres my response to this on record you idiot she said to renfrew i was going to let it slide that was my mistake nobody should let cops like you slide you think the badge is some sort of protection for you some sort of hammer you can toss around its your fucking responsibility your goddamn duty not your cushion and not your weapon hayes made a move to speak whitney silenced him by lifting a single finger dont you tell me about duty renfrew braced his hands on his thighs leaned his body forward everybody knows youre out for other cops dallas youre in iabs pocket the rat squads poster girl i dont have to justify what i did about the onetwoeight to you it seems youve forgotten cops were dying want their names because ive got them in my head i stood over them renfrew you didnt you want a piece of me over that you shouldve taken it outside the department off a homicide investigation you want a shot at me you dont take it over the dead were supposed to stand up for i asked you to reach out i asked you to share information vital to both our investigations so we could do the damn job my robberyhomicide hasnt been connected to your sex whacks and youve got no business on my scene without authority youve got no right recording on that scene and anything in such a recording is bogus you pompous egotistical ignorant fuckhead you dont have a robberyhomicide ive got one half of your murder team in the tank ive got a full confession on record that includes the murder of theodore mcnamara renfrew leaped out of his chair you go around me to bring my suspect into interview my suspect brought in for questioning re my investigation which as i told you asshole is connected with yours if you hadnt been so busy taking the easy way so tightassed about cooperating youd have been part of the op that brought him in get out of my face and get out of it now or ill take that badge you dont deserve and make you eat it thats enough lieutenant its not enough she whirled back to whitney its not enough i just listened to a twentytwoyearold boy tell me how he and his sick friend were bored and made up a game a dollar a point a goddamn dollar a point for the one who bagged the most women in the most inventive ways they drugged them raped them killed them for the satisfaction of being the top stud and when mcnamara realized what his grandson and his playmate were doing when he confronted them they bashed his brains in kept him alive with a stimulant stripped him naked bashed him again and tossed him in the river where he had the bad luck to be assigned to this disgrace three people are dead and ones in the hospital fighting to come back because one cop decides to take a personal dislike to another there might have been more so its not enough its never going to be enough you think you can hang your screwups on me renfrew began stand down detective hayes got slowly to his feet captain i said stand down now there will be no complaint filed from my house if lieutenant dallas wishes to file i have no wish to file hayes inclined his head then youre a better man than i id like to request a copy of that disc commander request granted ill consider the contents of the recording and take such actions as are deemed appropriate open your mouth renfrew and ill be filing myself i want you to step outside thats an order the insult went deep enough to have him vibrating yes sir but under protest so noted hayes waited until the door slammed my apologies commander whitney for bringing this mess to your door and for the unbecoming behavior of my officer your officer needs discipline captain he needs a kick in the ass sir and i can promise you hell get one my apologies to you as well lieutenant unnecessary captain thats the first thing youve said i disagree with since you walked in renfrew is a problem child but he is for the moment my problem child i run a clean house lieutenant and take responsibility for any untidiness that works its way in thank you for your time commander he started for the door paused and turned lieutenant sergeant clooney and i rookied together i went to see him after the events of last may came to light he said you were an untarnished badge and he was grateful you were the one to bring him in i dont know if that makes any difference to you but it did to him he nodded again stepped out and closed the door quietly at his back when they were alone whitney rose and walked to his autochef coffee lieutenant no sir thank you sit down dallas commander i apologize for my disrespect and insubordination my behavior was impressive whitney interrupted dont spoil it by remembering whos in charge in this room now she winced and searched for something to say i have no excuse i didnt ask for one he brought his coffee back to his desk but if i required one i might start by asking how much sleep you got last night i dont answer the question a couple and the night before i dont i cant say i told you to sit down he reminded her shall i make it an order she sat ive never been a witness to you dressing down an officer heard rumors he added now i can safely say youve earned your rep you did what had to be done with clooney and the onetwentyeight that doesnt mean you wont take flak for it understood sir he studied her face and because he could see hints of fatigue grief anger knew she was running thin the badge doesnt make the man eve its the other way around she blinked off balance by his use of her first name yes sir i know youre highprofile professionally and personally that kind of exposure and shine causes jealousy and resentment in certain types renfrews a prime example he doesnt concern me personally commander glad to hear it you have kevin moranos confession yes sir she started to rise to give her oral but whitney gestured her back down i dont require a formal report at this time i got the gist from your rant has the warrant for lucias dunwood been issued requested it should be waiting for me in my office then go get him lieutenant whitney sipped his coffee as she got to her feet contact me when youve wrapped him up well need to schedule a press conference after which youre ordered to go home and use whatever method you choose to guarantee you eight full hours sleep when she left whitney picked up the disc turned it in his hand light glinted from it an untarnished badge he thought it was a good description of her watching the light play he contacted chief tibble to make his own report o o it was tempting to blow the doors on the brownstone and blast in with a full squad of cops armed with riot guns and body armor the circumstances of the case and the weight of the charges gave her the option to do just that it would make a splash a blistering statement and it would be completely selfindulgent eve let the fantasy fly away and with only peabody beside her approached the door all stations manned and ready thats affirmative feeney said through her earpiece he tries to rabbit and gets past you well scoop him up copy that she glanced at peabody hes not getting past us not in this life eve pressed the bell counted off seconds as she rocked on the balls of her feet shed reached ten when the house droid opened the door remember me she gave him a toothy smile i need to speak with mr dunwood yes lieutenant please come in ill tell mr dunwood youre here may i offer you some refreshment while you wait no were set thanks very well please make yourself comfortable he walked away stiff and formal in his classic black uniform now if roarke would ditch summerset and get a droid i could be treated politely like that every day yeah peabody grinned youd really hate it who says those who know you best sir i think i know me best she countered what makes you say hold that thought she said when she saw lucias turn into the foyer mr dunwood lieutenant hed dressed in black as well had used just a hint of makeup to give his face a grieving pallor it had worked wonders on his mother that morning and he had no doubt it would set just the right tone with the cops you have some news about my grandfather i spent the morning with my mother and she he trailed off looked away as if composing himself wed both be grateful for any news anything at all to help us make some sense out of our loss i think i can help you with that we already have someone in custody he looked back at her an instant of surprise before it was masked i cant tell you what this means to us to have his killer brought to justice quickly brightens my day too indulgent she told herself she was being indulgent after all but what the hell actually there were two people responsible one has been charged and an arrest of the second is imminent two two against a helpless old man he worked rage into his voice i want them to suffer i want them to pay were riding the same wave on that one so lets get started lucias dunwood youre under arrest she whipped out her weapon when he took a quick step back oh please she invited keep going i didnt have the opportunity to use this on your pal kevin and its made me twitchy you stupid bitch ill take the bitch but hey which one of us is going into a cage stupid is as stupid does hands up and behind your head now he raised his hands and when she turned him to face the wall made him move maybe she let him eve wasnt going to lie awake at night debating the point but when he shoved she let her body flow back gave him room to swing and ducking under the arch of his fist rammed her own twice into his gut resisting arrest she said when he fell to his hands and knees retching another mark on your permanent record she nudged him flat with her foot then put her boot lightly on the back of his neck i wont add assaulting an officer because you missed restrain this clown peabody while i finish stating the charges against him and read him his rights he was demanding a lawyer before shed finished chapter twentyone the sky was still blue a deep dreamy evening blue when she walked up the steps to her own front door for the first time in days her mind was clear enough to let the sound of birdsong and the soft drift of flowers register she considered just sitting down on the steps and drawing it in all those sweet and simple pleasures the world could offer remembering taking the time to remember there was more than death more than blood and those who spilled it with the selfishness of spoiled children made the difference between living and sinking instead she pinched off a sprig of the purple flower spilling out of an urn and went inside there was something she wanted more than fresh air summerset took one look at the blossom in her hand and scowled lieutenant the arrangements in the urns are not cutting flowers i didnt cut it i snapped it off is he home in his office if you want a display of verbena you can order one from one of the greenhouses blah blah blah she said as she walked up the stairs yak yak yak summerset nodded with approval it seemed the medications had put her back to normal roarke was at the window holding a conversation on his headset it seemed to be something about a revision to the prototype of some new communication data system but there was too much ejargon for her to decipher so she tuned out the words themselves and just listened to the flow of his voice the irish in it occasionally gave her a strange thrill along with misty images of warriors and fragrant fires and poetry she supposed maybe the female of the species was just hardwired to react to certain stimuli maybe in ten or twenty years shed actually get used to it to him the sun sinking in the sky spilled in the window and drenched him in shimmering gold hed tied back his hair which made her think hed been at something that had required his hands and no distractions the light made a halo around him they both knew he didnt deserve but that looked incredibly right he had the screen on and a news report was humming his desk link beeped and was ignored there was a scent to the room that was money that was power that was roarke inside her rose a need basic as breath and he turned to her with her eyes locked on his she crossed the room jerked him to her by his shirtfront and captured his mouth with hers in the headset a voice continued to buzz in his ear dim under the stirring of his own blood he caught her hips pressed heat against heat later he muttered into the headset then pulled it off tossed it aside welcome home lieutenant and congratulations he lifted a hand to brush it over her hair i caught your press conference on seventyfive then you know its over she offered the verbena thanks for your help youre welcome he sniffed the flower anything else i can do for you as a matter of fact she tugged the band out of his hair ive got another assignment for you really my schedules a bit tight right now but i want to do my civic duty he tucked the little flower behind her ear what sort of assignment is it and be specific you want me to be specific i do yes very very specific with a laugh she boosted herself up so she could wrap her legs around his waist i want you to get naked ah an undercover assignment bracing her hips he started toward his office elevator is it dangerous its deadly neither of us may make it out alive inside the elevator he pressed her back against the wall felt the strength of her and the yielding master bedroom he ordered then ravaged her mouth i live for danger tell me more it involves a lot of physical exertion timing her breath clogged when his teeth found her throat rhythm coordination has to be perfect working on it he managed and swung her out of the elevator into the bedroom the cat stretched across the bed like a fat furry rag leaped up with a hissing complaint when they dropped onto the mattress beside him roarke reached out gave him a light shove that sent him jumping down with a thud this is no place for civilians with a snort of laughter eve locked her arms tight around him naked she raced kisses over his face get naked i want to sink my teeth into you tugging at clothes they rolled over the bed her shirt tangled in her weapon harness making her curse breathlessly as she fought free of both their mouths met again a frantic mating of lips teeth tongues that had the blood rushing hot through her veins and her body plunging under his she tugged at his shirt yanking it down from his shoulders so she could dig her fingers into that hard ripple of muscle and test strength to strength but he caught her hands in his drew her arms over her head stared down at her with those depthless blue eyes until her own muscles began to quake i love you darling eve mine he lowered his mouth to hers in a soft soft kiss that turned those trembling muscles to water his mouth left hers to skim along her jaw down the column of her throat he would know she thought as her heart shuddered he would know she needed more than the flash and the fire she needed the sweet and the simple she relaxed and drew it in he felt her open surrender herself there was for him no more powerful seduction than the yielding of her to him and to herself when she accepted the tenderness inside him he found himself filled with bottomless wells of it gently his lips slid over her skin savoring the flavor gently his hands played over her body cherishing the shape her heart beat thick under the glide of his tongue and she reached down to cradle his head against her when he nuzzled lazily at her breast she smelled of her shower at central of the practical soap available to her there it made him want to pamper her to smooth away the harshness she was too accustomed to so his lips were like a balm over her flesh teasing out the warmth before the heat she drifted on a cushion of sensation sliding into pleasure so subtle so soft it wrapped around her like mists her fingers threaded through his hair as the mists became a river and the river a quiet sea of bliss with a sigh she let herself sink into it she heard him murmur as he moved down her body the gaelic he used when he was most stirred it sounded like music both exotic and romantic what does it mean her voice was sleepy my heart youre my heart he traced a line of kisses down her torso fascinated always fascinated by the long lean line of her so much strength and courage lived inside that whiptight body in the heart he thought as his hands whispered over her breasts in the gut he rubbed his lips over her belly the muscles quivered and he heard the first unsteady catch of her breath still he took his time his slow and torturous time until that catch of breath became a moan until that tough toned body trembled when he took her over he felt her release spill through her and into him and the sea where she was drifting turned restless bliss became a craving and pleasure a deep and throbbing ache that pulsed through her like a hunger she arched against his busy mouth crying out as her system erupted desperate now he worked his way up her body inciting a dozen fires a riot of the pulses maddening himself even as he maddened her go up go up breath heaving he drove his fingers into her into the drenched heat i want to watch you again god her eyes went wide and blind as the orgasm ripped through her as she shuddered over the crest he closed his mouth over hers danced his tongue over hers until her breath his breath slowed thickened slid slowly slowly inside her her eyes cleared deepened held his love like silvered velvet shimmered over the red haze of passion she lifted a hand to his cheek as they moved together the rise and fall of lovers who loved the sweet and the simple when her pleasure peaked this time it was like grace he lowered his head kissed away the tear that spilled down her cheek my heart he said again then pressed his face into her hair and poured himself into her o o she lay with her body curled against his side the light was going the end of a long day roarke hmm you should sleep for a bit i dont have the words the way you do i can never seem to find them when they matter most i know what they are he toyed with the ends of her hair turn your mind off eve and rest a while she shook her head pushed up so she could look down at him how could he be so perfect she thought and still be hers say what you said before again the irish thing i want to say it back to you he smiled took her hand youll never pronounce it yes i will still smiling he said it slowly waited for her to fumble through but her eyes stayed steady and serious as she brought his hand to her heart laid hers on his and repeated the words she saw emotion move over his face his heart leaped hard against her hand you undo me eve he sat up dropped his brow against hers thank god for you he murmured in a voice gone raw thank god for you o o she refused to sleep so he talked her into sharing a meal in bed she sat crosslegged on the sheets plowing her way through a plate of spaghetti and meatballs the combination of sex food and a blistering shower had done the job morano broke down in interview she began id put it that you broke him down roarke corrected i watched you and had seen the way shed stared into the glass into herself he wouldnt have known how difficult it was for you not so difficult because i knew id break him i didnt know you were there i was part of the operational team he twirled a bit of her pasta onto his fork and i enjoy watching you work it was a contest to them and the women game pieces all i had to do was box morano into a corner and game over the way he sees it it was dunwoods fault and he was just trying to keep up bankhead was an accident cline didnt die and mcnamara well that was in his view a kind of selfdefense i looked at him and i didnt see anything calculating or particularly vicious hes just empty weak and empty a kind of it sounds hokey void of evil it sounds accurate dunwoods a different kettle isnt he and then some she picked up her wineglass sipped then leaned over to sample some of roarkes linguini with clam sauce mines better she decided pleased after the session with renfrew in whitneys office what session forgot i didnt tell you so between mouthfuls of spaghetti and the herbed bread he offered she did i cant believe i practically told whitney to shut up he shouldve slapped me down for it hes a smart man and a good cop renfrew now hes just the type of cop who made things relatively easy for me during a past and regrettable period of my life he added soberly when she frowned at him more ambitious than clever narrow of view and focus lazy he scooped up another forkful of her pasta she was right hers was better and he continued he epitomizes my previous view of the species the view i held of badges before i got to know one more intimately his kind pisses me off but his captain hes solid hell deal with it anyway anyway she let out a long breath she was stuffed but still wanted more i took the team minus our civilian consultant to his place to bring him in he lawyered straight off and kept his mouth shut hes not stupid and hes not weak his mistake is believing everyone else is thats whatll take him under no youre what will take him under his absolute confidence in her warmed as much as any words of love really stuck on me arent you apparently how about letting me have whats left of that meatball she nudged the plate in his direction dunwood had three lawyers in tow before we finished booking him he claims to know nothing about nothing except he did notice his good friend and companion kevins been acting a bit strange coming in at odd hours dressing up in strange getups to go out friendships a beautiful thing you bet weve got no dna on him and he knows it hes playing the innocent victim the outraged citizen and letting his reps do all the talking he didnt even blink when we brought up the home lab and the samples were testing from it didnt even get a shrug out of him when i pointed out wed found the wig and the suit worn in the lutz security disc in his bedroom closet that his bathroom vanity contained the brand of face putty and enhancements found on her body and her sheets his story is kevin used them planted them same thing with the carlo account she added the illegals operation he doesnt know a thing it mustve been kevin where do you go from here feeneys doing his ething with all the links and computers we confiscated from the townhouse hell find something dunwood was meeting someone on the night he killed his grandfather and my take is she didnt show we find her verify the correspondence and the meeting scheduled that night for the club where he bought drinks and we add more layers the samples from the lab are going to test out for whore and rabbit his lawyers can try to dance around that experimenting isnt illegal and we have to prove use and or distribution for sale but it adds the next tier we dig until we connect him to the distribution of those illegals as carlo through charles monroes client crime scenes fluoroscoping the house and theyll find blood weve got moranos pointbypoint confession weve got plenty for an indictment when we add up everything well lock in over the next couple days well wrap him up in it more due to a need to move around than a sense of tidiness she cleared the plates off the bed ill sic mira on him she added but even shes going to have a tough time chipping at that shell in the end well dump all the evidence physical circumstantial forensic the psych profiles the statements into a box and wrap it up for the lawyers he wont walk away will you can you if youd asked me that twentyfour hours ago id have said no unless i lied she turned around to face him but yeah after i finish putting the case together take a couple more shots at him in interview ill pass it to the pa and ill walk away theres always another roarke and if i dont walk away i cant face the next i need time with you eve alone away no ghosts no obligations no grief were going to mexico right to start anyway i want two weeks she opened her mouth a dozen reasons why she couldnt take that much time ready to trip off her tongue and looking at him found the reason the one that mattered why she would when do you want to leave as soon as youre able ive dealt with my schedule give me a couple days to tie the ends together meanwhile ive got a direct order from my commander i have to follow im ordered to use whatever method guarantees me eight hours sleep and have you chosen your method darling eve yeah and its foolproof she dived onto him she had his robe off and her hands full when the interhouse link beeped what the hell does he want she demanded doesnt he know were busy dont forget your place roarke blocked video answered summerset unless the house is on fire or under massive enemy attack i dont want to hear from you until morning im sorry to disturb you but the lieutenants commander is here to see her shall i tell him shes unavailable no shit she was already scrambling up ill be right down have commander whitney wait in the main parlor roarke said well join him in a moment this isnt good this cant be good she yanked open a drawer and grabbed the first items that came to hand whitney doesnt drop in for drinks and an afterwork chat goddamn it without bothering with underwear she pulled on ancient jeans dragged a faded nypsd tshirt with the sleeves ripped off over her head still cursing she hopped into her boots in the same amount of time roarke had managed to dress in pleated black trousers and a pristine black tshirt he slipped into loafers while she caught her breath you know if i wasnt in a real hurry that would make me sick what would that be how you can put yourself together like some fashion plate in under two minutes she complained and hurried out of the room in the main parlor amid the gleaming wood and glinting glass whitney and galahad studied each other with cautious and mutual respect when eve strode in whitney looked relieved lieutenant roarke im sorry to intrude on your evening its not a problem commander eve said quickly is something wrong i wanted to tell you personally and facetoface rather than have you hear it secondhand lucias dunwoods attorneys asked and received an immediate bond hearing eve read the results of it on his face they let him out she said flatly what kind of judge sets bail for a man charged with multiple firstdegrees a judge who as a friend of the dunwood and mcnamara families should have excused himself from the hearing it was argued that theres no physical evidence against dunwood there will be in a matter of hours eve began and further argued whitney continued that the heaviest weight in the charges stems from the confession of kevin morano which implicates dunwood that dunwood has no priors is a member of a respected family a man who only last night was informed of his grandfathers tragic death murder eve snapped out one he committed his mother attended the hearing made a personal plea that bail be granted so that her only son could assist her in memorializing and burying her father bail was set at five million paid and dunwood was released into his mothers custody think roarke laid a hand on eves shoulder before she could speak will he run she drew herself in forced herself to see through the rage no its still a contest just a different game he intends to win but hes pissed because i changed the board on him so hes likely to do something rash hes spoiled and hes angry we need to put a flag on the lab work we need positive identification of the chemical samples taken from the townhouse already done whitney told her i spoke with dickhead berenski he corrected on the way here you have a positive match for the illegals found in the victims using that evidence and the judges relationship to the accused the pa has filed for immediate revocation of bond will he get it well know within the hour regretfully im going to have to countermand my order for you to get eight hours sleep lieutenant your day isnt finished nor is mine he added ill go back to central and stand by with any luck youll be picking dunwood back up tonight i intend to go with you with me but she caught herself in time swallowed the words back yes sir i put my time in on the streets lieutenant i can assure you desk jockey or not im not dead weight no sir no disrespect intended with your permission commander ill tag feeney have him snatch up mcnab so they can put in time tonight on the electronics we have in evidence it remains your case plug the holes ill contact you as soon as i have word from the prosecutor commander roarke kept his hand on eves shoulder he could feel her vibrating under it revving to act to do have you had dinner not as yet ill catch something at my desk it took two squeezes of roarkes hand on her shoulder for eve to clue in um why dont you have something here commander save yourself some travel time i dont want to put you out its no trouble at all roarke assured him ill keep you company while eve makes her calls he gestured to the doorway your familys well i hope eve took a deep breath and watched them leave the room she wasnt sure which was weirder her commander settling down to have dinner in her house or him settling down to have that meal in the company of a man whod spent the majority of his life successfully breaking every law on the books and some that hadnt even been written allaround weird she said to galahad and leaving the socializing to roarke she headed up to her office to get back to work chapter twentytwo because she understood his feelings exactly and his way with words when riled was even more inventive than she was eve let feeney rant rave and spew and didnt mention the fact that hed answered the link wearing pajamas with little red hearts on them and that the music in the background was some bassvoiced singer crooning about making sweet love to his woman it seemed she wasnt the only one whod had seduction in the plans for the evening well get him back she said when feeney ran down to sputters im going to order surveillance on the mothers place and his townhouse i dont think hell rabbit but i dont want to risk it get me something on those electronics feeney find me something to add to the pile judge oughta be stripped down dragged through the streets with a big sign that says braindead fuckface tied to his dick yeah well thats a pleasant and satisfying image but ill settle for a quick overturn on the bail youll tag mcnab probably bouncing on peabody feeney barked talk about rabbits eve decided it showed great restraint and sterling character for her not to mention the heart pajamas at such a prime opening if he is i dont want to know about it but you can tell peabody to stand by for data you pull anything out she can follow it through you dont want her with you on the takedown no ive got another cop coming along whitney jack feeneys drooping face brightened like a boys no shit no shit what do i do with him feeney if we run into anything hinky am i supposed to give him orders youre primary yeah yeah she pinched the bridge of her nose ill play it by ear get me something oh and feeney love the pjs she broke transmission okay maybe she didnt have such a sterling character she called in requested surveillance on the two locations then got up to pace off the time what was taking the pa so long she should probably go downstairs and play hostess she was better at it than shed been a year ago not good at it but better still she usually did that duty when there were groups business dinners or parties where there were so many people giving anyone a lot of personal attention wasnt necessary casual conversation and small talk were roarkes strengths not hers she took the cowards way and stalled by going back to the bedroom for her weapon harness the minute she strapped it on she felt more in control o o lucias felt the same way in control the rage the insult was a black bubbling brew beneath the ice and if from time to time it burned a hole through he was still in control hed known his mother would whine and beg and weep for him she was so predictable women were to his way of thinking they were by nature weak and submissive they required direction and a firm hand his grandfather then his father had always given his mother a firm hand he was simply carrying on the mcnamaradunwood tradition dunwood men ran the show dunwood men were winners dunwood men deserved respect obedience and unquestioning loyalty they were not to be treated like common criminals to be pushed around locked in a cage questioned and they were never never to be betrayed naturally theyd let him go hed never doubted hed be released hed never go to prison never allow himself to be locked away like an animal he would one way or the other come out of this the winner but that didnt make up for the humiliation of being dragged behind bars taken into a courtroom deprived of his rights hed deal with eve dallas under it all she was just a woman god knew women should never be put in positions of authority or power that at least had been something he and his late unlamented grandparent had agreed on hed bide his time with her plan carefully pick his time and place when he was ready hed pay her back for laying hands on him for spoiling the game for the public embarrassment shed caused him a quiet place a private interlude oh yes he intended to have a very hot date with lieutenant dallas this time shed be the one in restraints when she was loaded with whore begging for the one thing women truly wanted he wouldnt even fuck her hed hurt her oh yes hed give her pain exquisite pain but hed deny her that final glorious release shed die desperate just another bitch in heat the idea made him hard and the hardening only proved he was a man but dallas and her punishment would wait there was he knew a natural order to things and first there was kevin a lifetime friendship was no buffer against the sin of disloyalty kevin had to pay and in paying would essentially ensure luciass own vindication hed groomed himself carefully for this particular task his hair was a gleaming copper worn like a snug helmet over his skull his complexion milkwhite his name was terrance blackburn as his identification would verify and he was kevin moranos attorney of record there were flaws lucias could admit there were flaws in the disguise but the need to hurry outweighed the need to polish every small detail in any case he knew people generally saw what they expected to see he looked a great deal like blackburn would identify himself as such he wore the sharp conservative suit of a successful criminal attorney carried the expensive leather briefcase fixed the sober and aloof expression on his face he passed through the levels of security at central without trouble when he demanded a consultation with his client he elicited annoyance more than interest from the duty cop he submitted coolly to the cursory patdown to having the contents of his briefcase xrayed once again and when he was shown into a consultation room he sat folded his hands and waited for his client seeing kevin escorted in wearing a baggy fluorescent orange jumpsuit put a nice chilly scrim over luciass bubble of rage his friends face appeared gray and drawn above the hideous prison clothes but he looked momentarily hopeful when he spotted lucias mr blackburn i wasnt expecting you to come back tonight you said you were arranging for me to go into testing tomorrow to show my emotional and mental dependence is there something new something better well discuss it when kevin sat lucias waved the guard away with an absent gesture and opened the briefcase the door closed with a satisfying snick how are you feeling terrible he linked and unlinked his fingers im in a cell alone lieutenant dallas she kept her word on that but its dark and it it smells and theres no privacy none at all i really dont think i can go to prison mr blackburn it just isnt possible there must be a way to arrange testing so that it comes out in my favor i could spend some time in a private rehabilitation facility or or accept athome incarceration but i cant possibly go to prison well just have to find a way to avoid that really relieved kevin leaned forward but before you said well it doesnt matter thank you thank you i feel so much better knowing youll make some arrangements ill need more money to smooth the path anything anything you need kevin buried his face in his hands i cant stay in this place i dont know how ill make it through even one night you need to stay calm let me get you some water he rose crossed over to the water cooler in the corner and as he filled a cup added the contents of the vial he wore on a chain under his shirt your confession lucias added as he brought the cup back clearly states that lucias dunwood was to blame it was his game and one he was winning i feel terrible about that what else could i do the things dallas said would happen to me he gulped at the water and its not my fault anyone can see its not my fault id never have gone so far without lucias egging me on hes smarter than you stronger no no hes not hes just lucias hes competilive inventive i cant help it if it came down to him or me anyway kevin worked up a weak smile i guess at this point i won the game do you think so you couldnt be more wrong i dont know what you his vision swam went gray at the edges i dont feel very well youll pass out first lucias said softly just slide under youll be dead before they get you to the infirmary you shouldve been loyal kev lucias panicked he tried to rise but his legs buckled help me somebody help me its much too late lucias got to his feet slid the chain from around his neck and looped it around kevins tucked it neatly under the jumpsuit you cant mean to do this kevin gripped luciass arm weakly lucias you cant mean to kill me i have killed you but painlessly kev for old times sake theyll think selftermination at first itll take them a while to figure out your visitor wasnt blackburn and since im at home with mother it couldnt have been me one consolation he added as kevin crumbled to the floor you wont go to prison he reached over closed the briefcase brushed at his suit jacket our games over he mumbled i win he hit the panic button under the table then crouched down began tapping kevins cheeks with his hand he passed out he told the guard went into a rant about not being able to stand the thought of prison then collapsed he needs medical attention and while his dying friend was being carried to medical lucias dunwood walked briskly out of cop central o o whitney and roarke were sharing afterdinner coffee and cigars when eve walked in she actually heard whitney laugh not the low rumbling chuckle shed occasionally heard out of him but a big rollicking belly laugh that stopped her in her tracks he was still grinning from it when she managed to unstick her feet and continue into the dining room i dont know how the pair of you stay so fit with the menu to choose from in this place amusement slid slyly over roarkes face as he lifted his cup we work out a lot isnt that right darling yeah exercise is the key to good health im glad you enjoyed your meal sir feeneys on the electronics ive arranged for surveillance on dunwoods townhouse and his mothers home peabodys standing by to run any new data as it comes in i goosed csu and they report they found blood on the living room floor and rug that matches mcnamaras type o neg dunwoods also o neg but with some pressure on the tech on duty at the lab i had him run the full dna early indications are its mcnamaras sir well confirm that before morning whitney puffed on the cigar a small luxury his wife denied him do you ever wind down dallas at her blank look he shook his head sit down have some coffee everythings being done that can be done we cant move until the pa reports in she wont argue if its an order roarke pointed out i hate to in her own house please whitney pointed to a chair roarke tells me youre off to mexico for two weeks have you put in for the time no sir restless and reluctant she sat ill take care of it in the morning consider it taken care of youre an exceptional cop lieutenant exceptional cops burn out faster than mediocre ones a good marriage helps i can attest to that children he added then laughed at her expression of sheer horror when the time comes friendships family in other words a life outside the job without it you can forget why you do what you do why it matters that every time you close a case and put one down theres one less yes sir i think since ive sat here eating your food smoking your mans very excellent cigar you could call me jack she thought about it for about three seconds no sir im sorry i cant he leaned back blew a lazy smoke ring ah well he said and his communicator beeped he went from relaxed to command in a single heartbeat whitney bail is hereby revoked the pa announced lucias dunwood is to be remanded into custody all charges holding immediately copies of the revocation order and new warrant transmitting now whitney waited while they spit out of the data slot good work he shoved the communicator away lieutenant lets go do the job when roarke rose as well whitney inclined his head the civilian consultant on this case has requested permission to accompany us and that request has been granted he handed her the paperwork do you have a problem with that lieutenant as primary she sucked in a breath as roarke gave her an easy smile a lot of good it would do me so no sir i have no problem with it o o sarah dunwood lived in a twolevel apartment in a quiet building only blocks from her son security pissed around with the usual retired for the evening not receiving visitors until eve drilled through the muck with badge warrant and bitter threats impressive whitney commented as they stepped on the elevator but tell me is it technologically possible to rip out a mother board and stuff it up a computers ass ive never had to follow through sir the threats usually sufficient dunwoods likely to resist she continued he wont like being thwarted this way and his instinct will be to attack before his control snaps back she hesitated commander id like to arm the consultant for his own protection thats your call lieutenant nodding she bent down released her clutch piece from its ankle grip its on low stun and it stays there it doesnt come into your hand it is not deployed unless youre in immediate physical jeopardy clear crystal lieutenant roarke slid the weapon into his pocket as they stepped out on the dun woods floor im at point she continued we do this fast go in locate and restrain i want you to clear any and all civilians out of the area she buzzed and the instant the door opened pushed inside police bail for lucias dunwood has been revoked hes ordered to turn himself over to my authority immediately you cant come in this way miss sarah miss sarah roarke drew the shrieking maid aside clearing eves path youll want to sit down now before you get hurt scanning entries and exits eve strode into the living area her fingers twitched toward her weapon then away again as a woman came rushing down the stairs what is it whats the matter who are you she was a small railthin woman with a gleam of curly red hair disordered now and a mildly pretty face spoiled by bruising under her left eye and along the soft curve of her jaw mrs dunwood yes im mrs dunwood youre the police youre the woman who arrested my son im lieutenant dallas nypsd she offered her badge but her eyes tracked for any movement and her ears were pricked for any sound lucias dunwoods bail has been revoked im here to take him into custody you cant i paid the judge i have the revocation order and the warrant mrs dunwood is your son upstairs hes not here you cant have him did he do that to your face there was terror now in the pitch of her voice i fell why wont you leave him alone she began to cry hes just a boy that boy killed your father thats not true that cant be true she covered her face with her hands and broke into wild sobs commander go mrs dunwood you need to sit down leaving the men to deal with the hysteria eve laid her hand on her weapon and started her search she went upstairs first trusting lucias could be dealt with if he made any move on the lower level she swept each room entered searched when she came to a locked door she drew out her master bypassed the locks hed kept a room here she noted as she stepped inside a pampered indulged boys room full of highclass toys the entertainment unit spread over an entire wall video audio screen game components the data and communication center took up most of an lshaped counter shelves were stocked tight with discs books mementos there was a minilab fully equipped set up in the adjoining room in both areas the drapes were drawn tight over the windows the doors locked to the outside hallways it was a little world of secrets she thought she searched the closets first found more wigs stored in clear boxes along with what she assumed he considered his secondary wardrobe in the bath she found traces of face putty and face base on the counter no he wasnt here she thought and he hadnt walked out as himself holstering her weapon she walked back to the data center computer display last opened file image or data cannot comply without password well see about that she hurried out went to the top of the stairs roarke i need you a minute she walked back through the bedroom into the lab and helped herself to a can of sealit the maid claims dunwood and his mother had a shouting match roarke told her as he came in or rather dunwood did the shouting she heard his mother crying heard the sound of blows thats when she ran out of the kitchen area she heard him slam out and found mrs dunwood on the floor apparently its not the first time hes used his fists on her like his grandfather and father before him the fathers in seattle on business he doesnt spend much time here big happy family i want whatever you can get me out of this last work first its passcoded if you have to touch anything use this she tossed him the sealant ill be back in a minute she left him to it went downstairs hes not on the premises she told the commander mrs dunwood where did lucias go for a walk he just went out for a walk his minds troubled ill say eve thought but crouched down mrs dunwood youre not helping him youre not helping yourself the longer it takes to find him the harder its going to go on him tell me where he is i dont know he was upset and angry how was he dressed when he left i dont know what you mean yes you do he disguised himself again and you knew when you saw him that way you knew in some part of yourself that hed done everything hes been accused of i dont i dont believe it eve turned away when her communicator signaled she strode out of earshot listened then she gave the order for an apb kevin moranos dead she said it flatly watched shock and horror pale mrs dunwoods face kevin no no he was poisoned he had a visitor this evening in a consultation room you know what that visitor looked like dont you mrs dunwood your son went to visit his friend and he killed him then he walked away how the hell did he get through security whitney demanded to know by looking like this roarke came back in held out a hard copy of an image this data was the last work on his computer blackburn eve said without looking at the printout moranos attorney of record theyd have passed him through with minimal checks hes a wellknown criminal attorney theres something else roarke offered her another printout the rules of the game seduce and conquer eve read a contest of romantic and sexual exploits between lucias dunwood and kevin morano and scanned the rest it was all there meticulously organized and detailed the setup the rules the payoff system the goals disgust tightened her belly as she whirled back look at this she ordered sarah dunwood read this this is what hes done this is what he is she pushed the sheet under mrs dunwoods face do you want to leave me with nothing tears spilled down her cheeks as she stared at eve rather than the printout i carried him in my body after months of tests and treatments of grief and hope i made him inside me will you leave me with nothing im not the one leaving you with nothing mrs dunwood hes taken care of that himself she turned away again and ordered two uniforms up to the apartment he needs a place to remove the disguise she said as they left the apartment hell come back here eventually but he doesnt have all his things here hell want more of his toys clothes she tried to put herself in his head gotta ditch the disguise first hell know well come around to him with moranos death he cant afford to leave any trace of that around but he thinks were slow and stupid hes so much smarter hell hurry but he wont rush hell go home take off the face and hair clean up spend some time gloating packing some things up destroying anything he thinks might be incriminating you put men on the house whitney reminded her theyll spot him maybe maybe not because hell expect them to be there will you drive sir she asked as they stepped outside i need the civilian to draw me a picture he drove fast and without sirens whitneys eyebrows lifted but he said nothing when at eves request roarke quickly called up blueprints of the townhouse on his ppc you got holofeatures on there naturally display data holographically the image spilled out into eves lap she studied it and planned well move the surveillance team to the rear one man in one man out additional men entering here and here we go in the front roarke youll go left and up the stairs the commander right to sweep the main level ill take the steps down hes got full security with video so if hes paying attention and he pays attention hell know were coming watch each others backs because at the core hes a coward while she committed the holo to memory she called for additional backup when they pulled up behind the surveillance vehicle she hopped out demanded status she detailed the situation gave her orders quickly seal hasnt been breached whitney commented as they approached the front he wouldnt use the main door there are three other entrances twelve firststory windows she detoured at a jog to the side of the house farthest away from the surveillance broken glass she reported hes in there both she and whitney pulled out masters i beg your pardon sir no forgot myself go he replaced the master with his weapon she uncoded the seal on three she likes to go in low roarke told whitney and on eves count went in the door with her high they speared off three arrows eve called out the required warning as she took the stairs to the lower level with her back to the wall the droid met her at the bottom i am programmed to deflect restrain or impede any and all unauthorized intruders on these premises if you attempt to come any farther i will be forced to cause you physical harm back off were the police fully authorized and warranted to enter these premises and remand lucias dunwood into custody i am programmed to deflect restrain or impede he began moving toward her fuck this she muttered and blasted him while he sparked and shuddered she kicked him aside lights on she ordered and didnt bother to swear when her order was ignored she moved in the dark leading with her weapon each time she approached a doorway at the soft sound of footsteps behind her she whirled finger twitching goddamn it roarke you have two men covering the first level additional backup on the way thisll go faster with two of us down here and he continued moving up to guard her back down here is where he is her instincts told her the same which was why shed taken the area personally labs going to be straight back she said quietly though shed already picked up the security cameras tucked into the corners of the ceiling hes boxed in but hes ready for us the door was locked im going to bypass she whispered in roarkes ear hell expect us to rush thats what hes ready for dont go through the door until i give the signal she slipped the locks kicked the door then spun away the move saved her something crashed in the dark near the toes of her boots she saw the smoke heard the hiss and was forced to sidestep before the acid eating into the floor hit leather there was a flash from inside she felt a bright shocking pain in her left shoulder shit youre hit roarke dived across the open doorway blocked her body with his as another series of blasts shot through like lightning bolts just glanced me her arm was numb now shoulder to fingertip get my communicator out of my pocket my left hands dead he pulled it out lowest level east end he said into it dunwoods armed the lieutenants been hit minimal damage she snapped irritated im not down repeat i am not down security panels over there she jerked her head bypass the damn voice command and get the lights on dunwood she shouted duckwalking to the doorway with her left arm hanging useless and her weapon in her right hand its over the house is surrounded youve got nowhere to go throw out your weapon and come out with your hands up its not over until i say its over im not finished he fired again do you think im losing to a woman the lights went on and gave her a good look at the blackened hole in the floor only inches from her feet seduce and conquer we accessed your game lucias not too smart of you to write it all down so nice and tidy for us we know you did kevin that was slick but you dont know as much about law as you do about chemistry his confession stands and you were stupid enough to leave traces of putty and base in your bathroom really losing points fast glass crashed inside the room and his voice raged as temper lashed out its my game you bitch my rules she held up her gun hand signaling the men back as she heard them rushing down the stairs new game new rules and youll never beat me lucias im better than you are throw out the weapon and come out or im going to hurt you you wont win he was weeping now a spoiled boy choked by a tantrum nobody beats me im undefeated im a dunwood cover me she drew in a breath tucked and rolled into the room the stunner blasts jolted over her head shot along the floor by her hip as she dived for cover not smart lucias she pressed her back into a wide cupboard nope not so smart you keep missing aiming wild you buy that off the street did they tell you it was fully charged they lie i bet if you check the discharge rate youre more than half out already ive got a full load and i dont miss i won the game and my prize is locking you into a cage for the rest of your life a womans going to lock you away lucias she angled herself signaled to roarke to lay down fire to her right on the blast she leaped up she swore fired a stun shot but was already too late the vial he held slid out of his hand as he shuddered and collapsed call for mts she shouted and leaped over the broken glass she kicked his weapon away crouched what did you take what i gave kevin he smiled coldly double the dose for speed no womans locking me away i end the game my way so i win i always win you lose bitch she watched him die and felt nothing no everybody wins epilogue she stood outside breathing in the night air cradling her now tingling left arm in the palm of her right hand sarah dunwood would be burying both her father and her son daughter and mother trapped in loves and loyalties that made no sense maybe they werent meant to do you want medical attention lieutenant she glanced over at whitney no sir flexed her fingers its coming back you played him as well as anyone could together they watched the black bag that held lucias dunwood twentytwo boy genius beloved son and predator being carried out of the house you couldnt guess hed selfterminate rather than surrender to you but she had eve thought a part of her had known exactly what she was doing and had done it had goaded him to it with cold calculation had they carried her father out of that freezing filthy room in a black bag then she closed her eyes because she was a cop and the badge stood for everything i knew it was a risk commander i pushed his buttons fully aware there was a probability hed take himself out rather than lose when we had him cornered i could have ordered the room rushed potentially hed be on his way to lockup instead of the morgue he was armed dangerous and had already fired on you with a black market weapon set on full men might have been lost certainly injured who are going home to their families tonight you played him as well as anyone could he repeated file your report then go get some sleep yes sir thank you rolling her awakening shoulder she crossed the street to where roarke waited i have to go in write and file my report hows your arm it feels like there are about six million hot needles sticking in it she wiggled her fingers again should be back to normal in a couple hours which is about what itll take to do the paperwork because he knew her and what she was thinking he said the worlds better off with him out of it eve maybe but that wasnt my decision to make you didnt make it he did he had only to give up youd have taken him in turned him into the system and been satisfied yeah because it was true she settled again im sending a police counselor to his mother she doesnt need to hear about this from me and shell need someone who has the right words later when her griefs not so raw we might send someone from the abuse shelter to talk to her he took her good hand in his walk away eve she nodded lets go tonight she said as they walked to the car go yeah to mexico as soon as ive closed this lets just head out take one of those snappy transpos of yours and get the hell out of town he kissed her fingers before opening the door for her ill make the arrangements
