the enchantress of sylaire clark ashton smith why you big ninny i could never marry you declared the demoiselle dorothйe only daughter of the sieur des flиches her lips pouted at anselme like two ripe berries her voice was honey but honey filled with beestings you are not so illlooking and your manners are fair but i wish i had a mirror that could show you to yourself for the fool that you really are why queried anselme hurt and puzzled because you are just an addleheaded dreamer pouring over books like a monk you care for nothing but silly old romances and legends people say that you even write verses it is lucky that you are at least the second son of the comte du framboisier for you will never be anything more than that but you loved me a little yesterday said anselme bitterly a woman finds nothing good in the man she has ceased to love dolt donkey cried dorothйe tossing her blonde ringlets in pettish arrogance if you were not all that i have said you would never remind me of yesterday go idiot and do not return anselme the hermit had slept little tossing distractedly on his hard narrow pallet his blood it seemed had been fevered by the sultriness of the summer night then too the natural heat of youth had contributed to his unease he had not wanted to think of women a certain woman in particular but after thirteen months of solitude in the heart of the wild woodland of averoigne he was still far from forgetting crueller even than her taunts was the remembered beauty of dorothйe des flиches the fullripened mouth the round arms and slender waist the breast and hips that had not yet acquired their amplest curves dreams had thronged the few short intervals of slumber bringing other visitants fair but nameless about his couch he rose at sundawn weary but restless perhaps he would find refreshment by bathing as he had often done in a pool fed from the river isoile and hidden among alder and willow thickets the water deliciously cool at that hour would assuage his feverishness his eyes burned and smarted in the mornings gold glare when he emerged from the hut of wattled osier withes his thoughts wandered still full of the nights disorder had he been wise after all to quit the world to leave his friends and family and seclude himself because of a girls unkindness he could not deceive himself into thinking that he had become a hermit through any aspiration toward sainthood such as had sustained the old anchorites by dwelling so much alone was he not merely aggravating the malady he had sought to cure perhaps it occurred to him belatedly he was proving himself the ineffectual dreamer the idle fool that dorothee had accused him of being it was weakness to let himself be soured by a disappointment walking with downcast eyes he came unaware to the thickets that fringed the pool he parted the young willows without lifting his gaze and was about to cast off his garments but at that instant the nearby sound of splashing water startled him from his abstraction with some dismay anselme realized that the pool was already occupied to his further consternation the occupant was a woman standing near to the center where the pool deepened she stirred the water with her hands till it rose and rippled against the base of her bosom her pale wet skin glistened like white rosepetals dipped in dew anselmes dismay turned to curiosity and then to unwilling delight he told himself that he wanted to withdraw but feared to frighten the bather by a sudden movement stooping with her clear profile and her shapely left shoulder toward him she had not perceived his presence a woman young and beautiful was the last sight he had wished to see nevertheless he could not turn his eyes away the woman was a stranger to him and he felt that she was no girl of the village or countryside she was lovely as any chatelaine of the great castles of averoigne and yet surely no hdy or demoiselle would bathe unattended in a forest pool thickcurling chestnut hair bound by a light silver fillet billowed over her shoulders and burned to red living gold where the sunrays searched it out through the foliage hung about her neck a light golden chain seemed to reflect the lusters of her hair dancing between her breasts as she played with the ripples the hermit stood watching her like a man caught in webs of sudden sorcery his youth mounted within him in response to her beautys evocation seeming to tire of her play she turned her back and began to move toward the opposite shore where as anselme now noticed a pile of feminine garments lay in charming disorder on the grass step by step she rose from the shoaling water revealing hips and thighs like those of an antique venus then beyond her he saw that a huge wolf appearing furtively as a shadow from the thicket had stationed itself beside the heap of clothing aoselme had never seen such a wolf before he remembered the tales of werewolves that were believed to infest that ancient wood and his alarm was touched instantly with the fear which only preternatural things can arouse the beast was strangely colored its fur being a glossy bluishblack it was far larger than the common gray wolves of the forest crouching inscrutably half hidden in the sedges it seemed to await the woman as she waded shoreward another moment thought anselme and she would perceive her danger would scream and turn in terror but still she went on her head bent forward as if in serene meditation beware the wolf he shouted his voice strangely loud and seeming to break a magic stillness even as the words left his lips the wolf trotted away and disappeared behind the thickets toward the great elder forest of oaks and beeches the woman smiled over her shoulder at anselme turning a short oval face with slightly slanted eyes and lips red as pomegranate flowers apparently she was neither frightened by the wolf nor embarrassed by anselmes presence there is nothing to fear she said in a voice like the pouring of warm honey one wolf or two will hardly attack me but perhaps there are others lurking about persisted anselme and there are worse dangers than wolves for one who wanders alone and unattended through the forest of averoigne when you have dressed with your permission i shall attend you safely to your home whether it be near or far my home lies near enough in one sense and far enough in another returned the lady cryptically but you may accompany me there if you wish she turned to the pile of garments and anselme went a few paces away among the alders and busied himself by cutting a stout cudgel for weapon against wild beasts or other adversaries a strange but delightful agitation possessed him and he nearly nicked his fingers several times with the knife the misogyny that had driven him to a woodland hermitage began to appear slightly immature even juvenile he had let himself be wounded too deeply and too long by the injustice of a pert child by the time anselme finished cutting his cudgel the lady had completed her toilet she came to meet him swaying like a lamia a bodice of vernal green velvet baring the upper slopes of her breasts clung tightly about her as a lovers embrace a purple velvet gown flowered with pale azure and crimson moulded itself to the sinuous outlines of her hips and legs her slender feet were enclosed in fine soft leather buskins scarletdyed with tips curling pertly upward the fashion of her garments though oddly antique confirmed anselme in his belief that she was a person of no common rank her raiment revealed rather than concealed the attributes of her femininity her manner yielded but it also withheld anselme bowed before her with a courtly grace that belied his rough country garb ah i can see that you have not always been a hermit she said with soft mockery in her voice you know me then said anselme i know many things i am sephora the enchantress it is unlikely that you have heard of me for i dwell apart in a place that none can find unless i permit them to find it i know little of enchantment admitted anselme but i can believe that you are an enchantress for some minutes they had followed a little used path that serpentined through the antique wood it was a path the hermit had never come upon before in all his wanderings lithe saplings and lowgrown boughs of huge beeches pressed closely upon it anselme holding them aside for his companion came often in thrilling contact with her shoulder and arm often she swayed against him as if losing her balance on the rough ground her weight was a delightful burden too soon relinquished his pulses coursed tumultuously and would not quiet themselves again anselme had quite forgotten his eremitic resolves his blood and his curiosity were excited more and more he ventured various gallantries to which sephora gave provocative replies his questions however she answered with elusive vagueness he could learn nothing could decide nothing about her even her age puzzled him at one moment he thought her a young girl the next a mature woman several times as they went on he caught glimpses of black fur beneath the low shadow foliage he felt sure that the strange black wolf he had seen by the pool was accompanying them with a furtive surveillance but somehow his sense of alarm was dulled by the enchantment that had fallen upon him now the path steepened climbing a densely wooded hill the trees thinned to straggly stunted pines encircling a brown open moorland as the tonsure encircles a monks crown the moor was studded with druidic monoliths dating from ages prior to the roman occupation of averoigne almost at its center there towered a massive cromlech consisting of two upright slabs that supported a third like the lintel of a door the path ran straight to the cromlech this is the portal of my domain said sephora as they neared it i grow faint with fatigue you must take me in your arms and carry me through the ancient doorway anselme obeyed very willingly her cheeks paled her eyelids fluttered and fell as he lifted her for a moment he thought that she had fainted but her arms crept warm and clinging around his neck dizzy with the sudden vehemence of his emotion he carried her through the cromlech as he went his lips wandered across her eyelids and passed deliriously to the soft red flame of her lips and the rose pallor of her throat once more she seemed to faint beneath his fervor his limbs melted and a fiery blindness filled his eyes the earth seemed to yield beneath them like an elastic couch as he and sephora sank down lifting his head anselme looked about him with swiftly growing bewilderment he had carried sephora only a few paces and yet the grass on which they lay was not the sparse and sundried grass of the moor but was deep verdant and filled with tiny vernal blossoms oaks and beeches huger even than those of the familiar forest loomed umbrageously on every hand with masses of new goldengreen leafage where he had thought to see the open upland looking back he saw that the gray lichened slabs of the cromlech itself alone rernained of that former landscape even the sun had changed its position it had hung at anselmes left still fairly low in the east when he and sephora had reached the moorland but now shining with amber rays through a rift in the forest it had almost touched the horizon on his right he recalled that sephora had told him she was an enchantress here indeed was proof of sorcery he eyed her with curious doubts and misgivings be not alarmed said sephora with a honeyed smile of reassurance i told you that the cromlech was the doorway to my domain we are now in a land lying outside of time and space as you have hitherto known them the very seasons are different here but there is no sorcery involved except that of the great ancient druids who knew the secret of this hidden realm and reared those mighty slabs for a portal between the worlds if you should weary of me you can pass back at any time through the doormay but i hope that you have not tired of me so soon anselme though still bewildered was relieved by this information he proceeded to prove that the hope expressed by sephora was wellfounded indeed he proved it so lengthily and in such detail that the sun had fallen below the horizon before sephora could draw a full breath and speak again the air grows chill she said pressing against him and shivering lightly but my home is close at hand they came in the twilight to a high round tower among trees and grassgrown mounds ages ago announced sephora there was a great castle here now the tower alone remains and i am its chatelaine the last of my family the tower and the lands about it are named sylaire tall dim tapers lit the interior which was hung with rich arrases vaguely and strangely pictured aged corpsepale servants in antique garb went to and fro with the furtiveness of specters setting wines and foods before the enchantress and her guest in a broad hall the wines were of rare flavor and immense age the foods were curiously spiced anselme ate and drank copiously it was like some fantastic dream and he accepted his surroundings as a dreamer does untroubled by their strangeness the wines were potent drugging his senses into warm oblivion even stronger was the inebriation of sephoras nearness however ansehne was a little startled when the huge black wolf he had seen that morning entered the hall and fawned like a dog at the feet of his hostess you see he is quite tame she said tossing the wolf bits of meat from her plate often i let him come and go in the tower and sometimes he attends me when i go forth from sylaire he is a fiercelooking beast anselme observed doubtfully it seemed that the wolf understood the words for he bared his teeth at anselme with a hoarse preternaturally deep growl spots of red fire glowed in his somber eyes like coals fanned by devils in dark pits go away malachie commanded the enchantress sharply the wolf obeyed her slinking from the hall with a malign backward glance at anselme he does not like you said sephora that however is perhaps not surprising anselme bemused with wine and love forgot to inquire the meaning of her last words morning came too soon with upwardslanting beams that fired the treetops around the tower you must leave me for awhile said sephora after they had breakfasted i have neglected my magic of late and there are matters into which i should inquire bending prettily she kissed the palms of his hands then with backward glances and smiles she retired to a room at the towers top beside her bedchamber here she had told anselme her grimoires and potions and other appurtenances of magic were kept during her absence aoselme decided to go out and explore the woodland about the tower mindful of the black wolf whose tameness he did not trust despite sephoras reassurances he took with him the cudgel he had cut that previous day in the thickets near the isoile there were paths everywhere all leading to fresh loveliness truly sylaire was a region of enchantment drawn by the dreamy golden light and the breeze laden with the freshness of spring flowers anselme wandered on from glade to glade he came to a grassy hollow where a tiny spring bubbled from beneath mossed boulders he seated himself on one of the boulders musing on the strange happiness that had entered his life so unexpectedly it was like one of the old romances the tales of glamor and fantasy that he had loved to read smiling he remembered the gibes with which dorothйe des flиches had expressed her disapproval of his taste for such readingmatter what he wondered would dorothйe think now at any rate she would hardly care his reflections were interrupted there was a rustling of leaves and the black wolf emerged from the boscage in front of him whining as if to attract his attention the beast had somehow lost his appearance of fierceness curious and a little alarmed anselme watched in wonder while the wolf began to uproot with his paws certain plants that somewhat resembled wild garlic these he devoured with palpable eagerness anselmes mouth gaped at the thing which ensued one moment the wolf was before him then where the wolf had been there rose up the figure of a man lean powerful with blueblack hair and beard and darkly flaming eyes the hair grew almost to his brows the beard nearly to his lower eyelashes his arms legs shoulders and chest were matted with bristles be assured that i mean you no harm said the man i am malachie du marais a sorcerer and the onetime lover of sephora tiring of me and fearing my wizardry she turned me into a werewolf by giving me secretly the waters of a certain pool that lies amid this enchanted domain of sylaire the pool is cursed from old time with the infection of lycanthropy and sephora has added her spells to its power i can throw off the wolf shape for a little while during the dark of the moon at other times i can regain my human form though only for a few minutes by eating the root that you saw me dig and devour the root is very scarce anselme felt that the sorceries of sylaire were more complicated than he had hitherto imagined but amid his bewilderment he was unable to trust the weird being before him he had heard many tales of werewolves who were reputedly common in medieval france their ferocity people said was that of demons rather than of mere brutes allow me to warn you of the grave danger in which you stand continued malachie du marais you were rash to let yourself be enticed by sephora if you are wise you will leave the purlieus of sylaire with all possible dispatch the land is old in evil and sorcery and all who dwell within it are ancient as the land and are equally accursed the servants of sephora who waited upon you yestereve are vampires that sleep by day in the tower vaults and come forth by night they go out through the druid portal to prey on the people of averoigne he paused as if to emphasize the words that followed his eyes glittered balefully and his deep voice assumed a hissing undertone sephora herself is an ancient lamia wellnigh immortal who feeds on the vital forces of young men she has had many lovers throughout the ages and i must deplore even though i cannot specify their ultimate fate the youth and beauty that she retains are illusions if you could see sephora as she really is you would recoil in revulsion cured of your perilous love you would see her unthinkably old and hideous with infamies but how can such things be queried anselme truly i cannot believe you malachie shrugged his hairy shoulders at least i have warned you but the wolfchange approaches and i must go if you will come to me later in my abode which lies a mile to the westward of sephoras tower perhaps i can convince you that my statements are the truth in the meanwhile ask yourself if you have seen any mirrors such as a beautiful young woman would use in sephoras chamber vampires and lamias are afraid of mirrors for a good reason anselme went back to the tower with a troubled mind what malachie had told him was incredible yet there was the matter of sephoras servants he had hardly noticed their absence that morning and yet he had not seen them since the previous eve and he could not remember any mirrors among sephoras various feminine belongings he found sephora awaiting him in the towers lower hall one glance at the utter sweetness of her womanhood and he felt ashamed of the doubts with which maiachie had inspired him sephoras bluegray eyes questioned him deep and tender as those of some pagan goddess of love reserving no detail he told her of his meeting with the werewolf ah i did well to trust my intuitions she said last night when the black wolf growled and glowered at you it occurred to me that he was perhaps becoming more dangerous than i had realized this morning in my chamber of magic i made use of my clairvoyant powers and i learned much indeed i have been careless malachie has become a menace to my security also he hates you and would destroy our happiness is it true then questioned anselme that he was your lover and that you turned him into a werewolf he was my lover long long ago but the werewolf form was his own choice assumed out of evil curiosity by drinking kom the pool of which he told you he has regretted it since for the wolf shape while giving him certain powers of harm in reality limits his actions and his sorceries he wishes to return to human shape and if he succeeds will become doubly dangerous to us both i should have watched him well for i now find that he has stolen from me the recipe of antidote to the werewolf waters my clairvoyance tells me that he has already brewed the antidote in the brief intervals of humanity regained by chewing a certain root when he drinks the potina as i think that he means to do before long he will regain human form permanently he waits only for the dark of the moon when the werewolf spell is at its weakest but why should malachie hate me asked anselme and how can i help you against him that first question is slightly stupid my dear of course he is jealous of you as for helping me well i thought of a good trick to play on malachie she produced a small purple glass vial triangular in shape from the folds of her bodice this vial she told him is filled with the water of the werewolf pool through my clairvoyant vision i learned that malachie keeps his newly brewed potion in a vial of similar size shape and color if you can go to his den and substitute one vial for the other without detection i believe that the results will be quite amusing indeed i will go ansehne assured her the present should be a favorable time said sephora it is now within an hour of noon and malachie often hunts at this time if you should find him in his den or he should return while you are there you can say that you came in response to his invitation she gave anselme careful instructions that would enable to find the werewolfs den without delay also she gave him a sword saying that the blade had been tempered to the chanting of magic spells that made it effective against such beings as malachie the wolfs temper has grown uncertain she warned if he should attack you your alder stick would prove a poor weapon it was easy to locate the den for wellused paths ran toward it with little deviation the place was the mounded remnant of a tower that had crumbled down into grassy earth and mossy blocks the entrance had once been a lofty doorway now it was only a hole such as a large animal would make in leaving and returning to its burrow anselme hesitated before the hole are you there malachie du marais he shouted there was no answer no sound of movement from within anselme shouted once more at last stooping on hands and knees he entered the den light poured through several apertures latticed with wandering treeroots where the mound had fallen in from above the place was a cavern rather than a room it stank with carrion remnants into whose nature anselme did not inquire too closely the ground was littered with bones broken stems and leaves of plants and shattered or rusted vessels of alchemic use a verdigriseaten kettle hung from a tripod above ashes and ends of charred faggots rainsodden grimoires lay mouldering in rusty metal covers the three legged ruin of a table was propped against the wall it was covered with a medley of oddments among which anselme discerned a purple vial resembling the one given him by sephora in one corner was a litter of dead grass the strong rank odor of a wild beast mingled with the carrion stench anselme looked about and listened cautiously then without delay he substituted sephoras vial for the one on malachies table the stolen vial he placed under his jerkin there was a padding of feet at the caverns entrance anselme turned to confront the black wolf the beast came toward him crouching tensely as if about to spring with eyes glaring like crimson coals of avernus anselmes fingers dropped to the hilt of the enchanted sword that sephora had given him the wolfs eyes followed his fingers it seemed that he recognized the sword he turned from anselme and began to chew some roots of the garliclike plant which he had doubtless collected to make possible those operations which he could hardly have carried on in wolfish form this time the transformation was not complete the head and body of malachie du marais rose up again before ansehne but the legs were the hind legs of a monstrous wolf he was like some bestial hybrid of antique legend your visit honors me he said half snarling with suspicion in his eyes and voice few have cared to enter my poor abode and i am grateful to you in recognition of your kindness i shall make you a present with the padding movements of a wolf he went over to the ruinous table and groped amid the confused oddments with which it was covered he drew out an oblong silver mirror brightly burnished with jeweled handle such as a great lady or damsel might own this he offered to anselme i give you the mirror of reality he announced in it all things are reflected according to their true nature the illusions of enchantment cannot deceive it you disbelieved me when i warned you against sephora but if you hold this mirror to her face and observe the reflection you will see that her beauty like everything else in sylaire is a hollow lie the mask of ancient horror and corruption if you doubt me hold the mirror to my face now for i too am part of the lands immemorial evil anselme took the silver oblong and obeyed malachies injunction a moment and his nerveless fingers almost dropped the mirror he had seen reflected within it a face that the sepulcher should have hidden long ago the horror of that sight had shaken him so deeply that he could not afterwards recall the circumstances of his departure from the werewolfs lair he had kept the werewolfs gift but more than once he had been prompted to throw it away he tried to tell himself that what he had seen was merely the result of sorne wizard trick he refused to believe that any mirror would reveal sephora as anything but the young and lovely sweetheart whose kisses were still warm on his lips all such matters however were driven from anselmes mind by the situation that he found when he reentered the tower hall three visitors had arrived during his absence they stood fronting sephoia who with a tranquil smile on her lips was apparently trying to explain something to them anselme recognized the visitors with much amzement not untouched with consternation one of them was dorothйe des flиches clad in a trim traveling habit the others were two serving men of her father armed with longbows quivers of arrows broadswords and daggers in spite of this array of weapons they did not look any too comfortable or at home but dorothйe seemed to have retained her usual matteroffact assurance what are you doing in this queer place anselme she cried and who is this woman this chatelaine of sylaire as she calls herself anselme felt that she would hardly understand any answer that he could give to either query he looked at sephora then back at dorothйe sephora was the essence of all the beauty and romance that he had ever craved how could he have fancied himself in love with dorothйe how could he have spent thirteen months in a hermitage because of her coldness and changeability she was pretty enough with the common bodily charms of youth but she was stupid wanting in imagination prosy already in the flush of her girlhood as a middleaged housewife small wonder that she had failed to understand him what brings you here he countered i had not thought to see you again i missed you anselme she sighed people said that you had left the world because of your love for me and had become a hermit at last i came to seek you but you had disappeared some hunters had seen you pass yesterday with a strange woman across the moor of druid stones they said you had both vanished beyond the cromlech fading as if in air today i followed you with my fathers serving men we found ourselves in this strange region of which no one has ever heard and now this woman the sentence was interrupted by a mad howling that filled the room with eldritch echoes the black wolf with jaws foaming and slavering broke in through the door that had been opened to admit sephoras visitors dorothйe des fleches began to scream as he dashed straight toward her seeming to single her out for the first victim of his rabid fury something it was plain had maddened him perhaps the water of the werewolf pool substituted for the antidote had served to redouble the original curse of lycanthropy the two serving men bristling with their arsenal of weapons stood like effigies anselme drew the sword given him by the enchantress and leaped forward between dorothйe and the wolf he raised his weapon which was straightbladed and suitable for stabbing the mad werewolf sprang as if hurled from a catapult and his red open gorge was spitted on the outthrust point anselmes hand was jarred on the swordhilt and the shock drove him backward the wolf fell thrashing at anselmes feet his jaws had clenched on the blade the point protruded beyond the stiff bristles of his neck anselme tugged vainly at the sword then the blackfurred body ceased to thrash and the blade came easily it had been withdrawn from the sagging mouth of the dead ancient sorcerer malachie du marais which lay before anselme on the flagstones the sorcerers face was now the face that anselme had seen in the mirror when he held it up at malachies injunction you have saved me how wonderfu cried dorothйe anselme saw that she had started toward him with outthrust arms a moment more and the situation would become embarrassing he recalled the mirror which he had kept under his jerkin together with the vial stolen from malachie du marais what he wondered would dorothйe see in its burnished depths he drew the mirror forth swiftly and held it to her face as she advanced upon him what she beheld in the mirror he never knew but the effect was startling dorothйe gasped and her eyes dilated in manifest horror then covering her eyes with her hands as if to shut out some ghastly vision she ran shrieking from the hall the serving men followed her the celerity of their movements made it plain that they were not sorry to leave this dubious lair of wizards and witches sephora began to laugh sofdy anselme found himself chuckling for awhile they abandoned themselves to uproarious mirth then sephora sobered i know why malachie gave you the mirror she said do you not wish to see my reflection in it anselme realized that he still held the mirror in his hand without answering sephora he went over to the nearest window which looked down on a deep pit lined with bushes that had been part of an ancient halffilled moat he hurled the silver oblong into the pit i am content with what my eyes tell me without the aid of any mirror he declared now let us pass to other matters which have been interrupted too long again the clinging deliciousness of sephora was in his arms and her fruitsoft mouth was crushed beneath his hungry lips the strongest of all enchantments held them in its golden circle
