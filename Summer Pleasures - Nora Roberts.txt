prologue contents next with the moon full and white and cold he saw the shadows shift and shiver like living things over the icecrusted snow black on white black sky white moon black shadows white snow as far as he could see there was nothing else there was such emptiness an absence of color the only sound the whistling moan of wind through naked trees but he knew he wasnt alone that there was no safety in the black or the white through his frozen heart moved a trickle of hot fear his breath labored almost spent puffed out in small white clouds over the frosted ground fell a black shadow there was no place left to run hunter drew on his cigarette then stared at the words on the terminal through a haze of smoke michael trent was dead hunter had created him molded him exclusively for that cold pitiful death under a full moon he felt a sense of accomplishment rather than remorse for destroying the man he knew more intimately than he knew himself hed end the chapter there however leaving the details of michaels murder to the readers imagination the mood was set secrets hinted at doom tangible but unexplained he knew his habit of doing just that both frustrated and fascinated his following since that was precisely his purpose he was pleased he often wasnt he created the terrifying the breathtaking the unspeakable hunter explored the darkest nightmares of the human mind and with cool precision made them tangible he made the impossible plausible and the uncanny commonplace the commonplace he would often turn into something chilling he used words the way an artist used a palette and he fabricated stories of such color and simplicity a reader was drawn in from the first page his business was horror and he was phenomenally successful for five years hed been considered the master of his particular game hed had six runaway bestsellers four of which hed transposed into screenplays for feature films the critics raved sales soared letters poured in from fans all over the world hunter couldnt have cared less he wrote for himself first because the telling of a story was what he did best if he entertained with his writing he was satisfied but whatever reaction the critics and the readers had hed still have written he had his work he had his privacy these were the two vital things in his life he didnt consider himself a recluse he didnt consider himself unsociable he simply lived his life exactly as he chose hed done the same thing six years before before the fame success and large advances if someone had asked him if having a string of bestsellers had changed his life hed have answered why should it hed been a writer before the devils due had shot to number one on the new york times list he was a writer now if hed wanted his life to change hed have become a plumber some said his lifestyle was calculated that he created the image of an eccentric for effect good promotion some said he raised wolves some said he didnt exist at all but was a clever product of a publishers imagination but hunter brown had a fine disregard for what anyone said invariably he listened only to what he wanted to hear saw only what he chose to see and remembered everything after pressing a series of buttons on his word processor he set up for the next chapter the next chapter the next word the next book was of much more importance to him than any speculative article he might read hed worked for six hours that day and thought he was good for at least two more the story was flowing out of him like ice water cold and clear the hands that played the keys of the machine were beautiful tanned lean longfingered and widepalmed one might have looked at them and thought they would compose concertos or epic poems what they composed were dark dreams and monsters not the dripping fang scalyskinned variety but monsters real enough to make the flesh crawl he always included enough realism enough of the everyday in his stories to make the horror commonplace and all too plausible there was a creature lurking in the dark closet of his work and that creature was the private fear of every man he found it always then inch by inch he opened the closet door half forgotten the cigarette smoldered in the overflowing ashtray at his elbow he smoked too much it was perhaps the only outward sign of the pressure he put on himself a pressure hed have tolerated from no one else he wanted this book finished by the end of the month his selfimposed deadline in one of his rare impulses hed agreed to speak at a writers conference in flagstaff the first week of june it wasnt often he agreed to public appearances and when he did it was never at a large publicized event this particular conference would boast no more than two hundred published and aspiring writers hed give his workshop answer questions then go home there would be no speakers fee that year alone hunter had summarily turned down offers from some of the most prestigious organizations in the publishing business prestige didnt interest him but he considered in his odd way the contribution to the central arizona writers guild a matter of paying his dues hunter had always understood that nothing was free it was late afternoon when the dog lying at his feet lifted his head the dog was lean with a shining gray coat and the narrow intelligent look of a wolf is it time santanas with a gentleness the hand appeared made for hunter reached down to stroke the dogs head satisfied but already deciding that hed work late that evening he turned off his word processor hunter stepped out of the chaos of his office into the tidy living room with its tall manypaned windows and lofted ceiling it smelled of vanilla and daisies large and sleek the dog padded alongside him after pushing open the doors that led to a terracotta patio he looked into the thick surrounding woods they shut him in shut others out hunter had never considered which only knew that he needed them he needed the peace the mystery and the beauty just as he needed the rich red walls of the canyon that rose up around him through the quiet he could hear the trickle of water from the creek and smell the heady freshness of the air these he never took for granted he hadnt had them forever then he saw her walking leisurely down the winding path toward the house the dogs tail began to swish back and forth sometimes when he watched her like this hunter would think it impossible that anything so lovely belonged to him she was dark and delicately formed moving with a careless confidence that made him grin even as it made him ache she was sarah his work and his privacy were the two vital things in his life sarah was his life shed been worth the struggles the frustration the fears and the pain she was worth everything looking over she broke into a smile that flashed with braces hi dad chapter contents prev next the week a magazine like celebrity went to bed was utter chaos every department head was in a frenzy desks were littered phones were tied up and lunches were skipped the air was tinged with a sense of panic that built with every hour tempers grew short demands outrageous in most offices the lights burned late into the night the rich scent of coffee and the sting of tobacco smoke were never absent rolls of antacids were consumed and bottles of eye drops constantly changed hands after five years on staff lee took the monthly panic as a matter of course celebrity was a slick respected publication whose sales generated millions of dollars a year in addition to stories on the rich and famous it ran articles by eminent psychologists and journalists interviews with both statesmen and rock stars its photography was firstclass just as its text was thoroughly researched and concisely written some of its detractors might have termed it quality gossip but the word quality wasnt forgotten an ad in celebrity was a sure bet for generating sales and interest and was priced accordingly celebrity was in a tough competitive business one of the leading monthly publications in the country lee radcliffe wouldnt have settled for less howd the piece on the sculptures turn out lee glanced up at bryan mitchell one of the top photographers on the west coast grateful she accepted the cup of coffee bryan passed her in the past four days shed had a total of twenty hours sleep good she said simply ive seen better art scrawled in alleys though she privately agreed lee only shrugged some people like the clunky and obscure with a laugh bryan shook her head when they told me to photograph that red and black tangle of wire to its best advantage i nearly asked them to shut off the lights you made it look almost mystical i can make a junkyard look mystical with the right lighting she shot lee a grin the same way you can make it sound fascinating a smile touched lees mouth but her mind was veering off in a dozen other directions all in a days work right speaking of which bryan rested one slim jeanclad hip on lees organized desk drinking her own coffee black still trying to dig something up on hunter brown a frown drew lees elegant brows together hunter brown was becoming her personal quest and almost an obsession perhaps because he was so completely inaccessible shed become determined to be the first to break through the cloud of mystery it had taken her nearly five years to earn her title as staff reporter and she had a reputation for being tenacious thorough and cool lee knew shed earned those adjectives three months of hitting blank walls in researching hunter brown didnt deter her one way or the other she was going to get the story so far i havent gotten beyond his agents name and his editors phone number there mightve been a hint of frustration in her tone but her expression was determined ive never known people so closemouthed his latest book hit the stands last week absently bryan picked up the top sheet from one of the tidy piles of papers lee was systematically dealing with have you read it i picked it up but i havent had a chance to start it yet bryan tossed back the long honeycolored braid that fell over her shoulder dont start it on a dark night she sipped at her coffee then gave a laugh god i ended up sleeping with every light in the apartment burning i dont know how he does it lee glanced up again her eyes calm and confident thats one of the things im going to find out bryan nodded shed known lee for three years and she didnt doubt lee would why her frank almondshaped eyes rested on lees because lee finished off her coffee and tossed the empty cup into her overflowing wastebasket no one else has the mount everest syndrome bryan commented and earned a rare spontaneous grin a quick glance would have shown two attractive women in casual conversation in a modern attractively decorated office a closer look would have uncovered the contrasts bryan in jeans and a snug tshirt was completely relaxed everything about her was casual and not quite tidy from her smudged sneakers to the loose braid her sharpfeatured arresting face was touched only with a hasty dab of mascara shed probably meant to add lipstick or blusher and then had forgotten lee on the other hand wore a very elegant iceblue suit and the nerves that gave her her drive were evident in the hands that were never quite still her hair was expertly cut in a short swinging style that took very little care which was every bit as important to her as having it look good its shade fell somewhere between copper and gold her skin was the delicate milky white some redheads bless and others curse her makeup had been meticulously applied that morning down to the dusky blue shadow that matched her eyes she had delicate elegant features offset by a full and obviously stubborn mouth the two women had entirely different styles and entirely different tastes but oddly enough their friendship had begun the moment theyd met though bryan didnt always like lees aggressive tactics and lee didnt always approve of bryans laidback approach their closeness hadnt wavered in three years so bryan found the candy bar shed stuck in her jeans pocket and proceeded to unwrap it whats your master plan to keep digging lee returned almost grimly i do have a couple of connections at horizon his publishing house maybe one of themll come through with something without being fully aware of it she drummed her fingers on the desk damn it bryan hes like the man who wasnt there i cant even find out what state he lives in im half inclined to believe some of the rumors bryan said thoughtfully outside lees office someone was having hysterics over the final editing of an article id say the guy lives in a cave somewhere full of bats with a couple of stray wolves thrown in he probably writes the original manuscript in sheeps blood and sacrifices virgins every new moon i wouldnt be surprised bryan swung her feet lazily while she munched on her chocolate bar i tell you the mans weird silent screams already on the bestseller list i didnt say he wasnt brilliant bryan countered i said he was weird what kind of a mind does he have she shook her head with a halfsheepish smile i can tell you i wished id never heard of hunter brown last night while i was trying to sleep with my eyes open thats just it impatient lee rose and paced to the tiny window on the east wall she wasnt looking out the view of los angeles didnt interest her she just had to move around what kind of mind does he have what kind of life does he live is he married is he sixtyfive or twentyfive why does he write novels about the supernatural she turned her impatience and her annoyance showing beneath the surface of the sophisticated grooming why did you read his book because it was fascinating bryan answered immediately because by the time i was on page three i was so into it you couldnt have gotten the book away from me with a crowbar and youre an intelligent woman damn right bryan agreed and grinned so why do intelligent people buy and read something thats going to terrify them lee demanded when you pick up a hunter brown you know what its going to do to you yet his books consistently spring to the top of the bestseller list and stay there why does an obviously intelligent man write books like that she began in a habit bryan recognized to fiddle with whatever was at hand the leaves of a philodendron the stub of a pencil the left earring shed removed during a phone conversation do i hear a hint of disapproval yeah maybe frowning lee looked up again the man is probably the best colorist in the country if hes describing a room in an old house you can smell the dust his characterizations are so real youd swear youd met the people in his books and he uses that talent to write about things that go bump in the night i want to find out why bryan crumpled her candy wrapper into a ball i know a woman who has one of the sharpest most analytical minds ive ever come across she has a talent for digging up obscure facts some of them impossibly dry and turning them into intriguing stories shes ambitious has a remarkable talent for words but works on a magazine and lets a halffinished novel sit abandoned in a drawer shes lovely but she rarely dates for any purpose other than business and she has a habit of twisting paper clips into ungodly shapes while shes talking lee glanced down at the small mangled piece of metal in her hands then met bryans eyes coolly do you know why there was a hint of humor in bryans eyes but her tone was serious enough ive tried to figure it out for three years but i cant precisely put my finger on it with a smile lee tossed the bent paper clip into the trash but then youre not a reporter because she wasnt very good at taking advice lee switched on her bedside lamp stretched out and opened hunter browns latest novel she would read a chapter or two she decided then make it an early night an early night was an almost sinful luxury after the week shed put in at celebrity her bedroom was done in creamy ivories and shades of blue from the palest aqua to indigo shed indulged herself here with dozens of plump throw pillows a huge turkish rug and a queen anne stand that held an urn filled with peacock feathers and eucalyptus her latest acquisition a large ficus tree sat by the window and thrived she considered this room the only truly private spot in her life as a reporter lee accepted that she was public property as much as the people she sought out privacy wasnt something she could cling to when she constantly dug into other peoples lives but in this little corner of the world she could relax completely forget there was work to do ladders to climb she could pretend la wasnt bustling outside as long as she had this oasis of peace without it without the hours she spent sleeping and unwinding there she knew shed overload knowing herself well lee understood that she had a tendency to push too hard run too fast in the quiet of her bedroom she could recharge herself each night so that shed be ready for the race again the following day relaxed she opened hunter browns latest effort within a half hour lee was disturbed uncomfortable and completely engrossed shed have been angry with the author for drawing her in if she hadnt been so busy turning pages hed put an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation and had done it with such skill that lee was already relating to the teacher whod found himself caught up in a small town with a dark secret the prose flowed and the dialogue was so natural she could hear the voices he filled the town with so many recognizable things she could have sworn shed been there herself she knew the story was going to give her more than one bad moment in the dark but she had to go on that was the magic of a major storyteller cursing him she read on so tense that when the phone rang beside her the book flew out of her hands lee swore again at herself and lifted the receiver her annoyance at being disturbed didnt last grabbing a pencil she began to scrawl on the pad beside the phone with her tongue caught between her teeth she set down the pencil and smiled she owed the contact in new york an enormous favor but shed pay off when the time came as she always did for now lee thought running her hand over hunters book she had to make arrangements to attend a small writers conference in flagstaff arizona she had to admit the country was impressive as was her habit lee had spent the time during the flight from la to phoenix working but once shed changed to the small commuter plane for the trip to flagstaff her work had been forgotten shed flown through thin clouds over a vastness almost impossible to conceive after the skyscrapers and traffic of los angeles shed looked down on the peaks and dips and castlelike rocks of oak creek canyon feeling a drumming excitement that was rare in a woman who wasnt easily impressed if shed had more time lee sighed as she stepped off the plane there was never time enough the tiny airport boasted a oneroom lobby with a choice of concession stand or soda and candy machines no loudspeaker announced incoming and outgoing flights no skycap bustled up to her to relieve her of her bags there wasnt a line of cabs waiting outside to compete for the handful of people whod disembarked with her garment bag slung over her shoulder she frowned at the inconvenience patience wasnt one of her virtues tired hungry and inwardly a little frazzled by the shaky commuter flight she stepped up to one of the counters i need to arrange for a car to take me to town the man in shirtsleeves and loosened tie stopped pushing buttons on his computer his first polite glance sharpened when he saw her face she reminded him of a cameo his grandmother had worn at her neck on special occasions automatically he straightened his shoulders did you want to rent a car lee considered that a moment then rejected it she hadnt come to do any sightseeing so a car would hardly be worthwhile no just transportation into flagstaff shifting her bag she gave him the name of her hotel do they have a courtesy car sure do you go on over to that phone by the wall there numbers listed just give em a call and theyll send someone out thank you he watched her walk to the phone and thought he was the one who should have said thank you lee caught the scent of grilling hot dogs as she crossed the room since shed turned down the dubious tray offered on the flight the scent had her stomach juices swimming quickly and efficiently she dialed the hotel gave her name and was assured a car would be there within twenty minutes satisfied she bought a hot dog and settled in one of the black plastic chairs to wait she was going to get what shed come for lee told herself almost fiercely as she looked out at the distant mountains the time wasnt going to be wasted after three months of frustration she was finally going to get a firsthand look at hunter brown it had taken skill and determination to persuade her editorinchief to spring for the trip but it would pay off it had to leaning back she reviewed the questions shed ask hunter brown once shed cornered him all she needed lee decided was an hour with him sixty minutes in that time she could pull out enough information for a concise and very exclusive article shed done precisely that with this years oscar winner though hed been reluctant and a presidential candidate though hed been hostile hunter brown would probably be both she decided with a half smile it would only add spice if shed wanted a bland simple life shed have bent under the pressure and married jonathan right now shed be planning her next garden party rather than calculating how to ambush an awardwinning writer lee nearly laughed aloud garden parties bridge parties and the yacht club that might have been perfect for her family but shed wanted more more what her mother had demanded and lee could only reply just more checking her watch she left her luggage neatly stacked by the chair and went into the ladies room the door had hardly closed behind her when the object of all her planning strolled into the lobby he didnt often do good deeds and then only for people he had a genuine affection for because hed gotten into town with time to spare hunter had driven to the airport with the intention of picking up his editor with barely a glance around he walked over to the same counter lee had approached ten minutes before fight on time yes sir got in ten minutes ago did a woman get off hunter glanced at the nearly empty lobby again attractive midtwenties yes sir the clerk interrupted she just stepped into the rest room thats her luggage over there thanks satisfied hunter walked over to lees neat stack of luggage doesnt believe in traveling light he noticed scanning the garment bag small pullman and briefcase then what woman did hadnt his sarah taken two suitcases for the brief threeday stay with his sister in phoenix strange that his little girl should be two parts woman already perhaps not so strange hunter reflected females were born two parts woman while males took years to grow out of boyhood if they ever did perhaps thats why he trusted men a great deal more lee saw him when she came back into the lobby his back was to her so that she had only the impression of a tall leanly built man with black hair curling carelessly down to the neck of his tshirt right on time she thought with satisfaction and approached him im lee radcliffe when he turned she went stonestill the impersonal smile freezing on her face in the first instant she couldnt have said why he was attractive perhaps too attractive his face was narrow but not scholarly rawboned but not rugged it was too much a combination of both to be either his nose was straight and aristocratic while his mouth was sculpted like a poets his hair was dark and full and unruly as though hed been driving fast for hours with the wind blowing free but it wasnt these things that caused her to lose her voice it was his eyes shed never seen eyes darker than his more direct more disturbing it was as though they looked through her no not through lee corrected numbly into in ten seconds they had looked into her and seen everything he saw a stunning milkpale face with dusky eyes gone wide in astonishment he saw a soft feminine mouth lightly tinted he saw nerves he saw a stubborn chin and molten copper hair that would feel like silk between the fingers what he saw was an outwardly poised inwardly tense woman who smelled like spring evenings and looked like a vogue cover if it hadnt been for that inner tension he might have dismissed her but what lay beneath peoples surfaces always intrigued him he skimmed her neat traveling suit so quickly his eyes might never have left hers yes well i forced to swallow she trailed off that alone infuriated her she wasnt about to be set off into stammers by a driver for the hotel if youve come to pick me up lee said curtly youll need to get my bags lifting a brow he said nothing her mistake was simple and obvious it would have taken only a sentence from him to correct it then again it was her mistake not his hunter had always believed more in impulses than explanations bending down he picked up the pullman then slung the strap of the garment bag over his shoulder the cars out here she felt a great deal more secure with the briefcase in her hand and his back to her the oddness lee told herself had come from excitement and a long flight men never surprised her they certainly never made her stare and stammer what she needed was a bath and something a bit more substantial to eat than that hot dog the car hed referred to wasnt a car she noted but a jeep supposing this made sense with the steep roads and hard winters lee climbed in moves well he thought and dresses flawlessly he noted too that she bit her nails are you from the area hunter asked conversationally when hed stowed her bags in the back no im here for the writers conference hunter climbed in beside her and shut the door now he knew where to take her youre a writer she thought of the two chapters of her manuscript shed brought along in case she needed a cover yes hunter swung through the parking lot taking the back road that led to the highway what do you write settling back lee decided she might as well try her routine out on him before she was in the middle of two hundred published and aspiring writers ive done articles and some short stories she told him truthfully enough then she added what shed rarely told anyone ive started a novel with a speed that surprised but didnt unsettle her he burst onto the highway are you going to finish it he asked showing an insight that disturbed her i suppose that depends on a lot of things he took another careful look at her profile such as she wanted to shift in her seat but forced herself to be still this was just the sort of question she might have to answer over the weekend such as if what ive done so far is any good he found both her answer and her discomfort reasonable do you go to many of these conferences no this is my first which might account for the nerves hunter mused but he didnt think hed found the entire answer im hoping to learn something lee said with a small smile i registered at the last minute but when i learned hunter brown would be here i couldnt resist the frown in his eyes came and went too quickly to be noticed hed agreed to do the workshop only because it wouldnt be publicized even the registrants wouldnt know hed be there until the following morning just how he wondered had the little redhead with the italian shoes and midnight eyes found out he passed a truck who hunter brown lee repeated the novelist impulse took over again is he any good surprised lee turned to study his profile it was infinitely easier to look at him she discovered when those eyes werent focused on her youve never read any of his work should i have i suppose that depends on whether you like to read with all the lights on and the doors locked he writes horror fiction if shed looked more closely she wouldnt have missed the quick humor in his eyes ghouls and fangs not exactly she said after a moment not that simple if theres something youre afraid of hell put it into words and make you wish him to the devil hunter laughed greatly pleased so you like to be scared no lee said definitely then why do you read him ive asked myself that when im up at am finishing one of his books lee shrugged as the jeep slowed for the turn off its irresistible i think he must be a very odd man she murmured half to herself not quite well not quite like the rest of us do you after a quick sharp turn he pulled up in front of the hotel more interested in her than hed planned to be but isnt writing just words and imagination and sweat and blood she added moving her shoulders again i just dont see how it could be very comfortable to live with an imagination like browns id like to know how he feels about it amused hunter jumped out of the jeep to retrieve her bags youre going to ask him yes lee stepped down i am for a moment they stood on the sidewalk silently he looked at her with what might have been mild interest but she sensed something more something she shouldnt have felt from a hotel driver after a tenminute acquaintance for the second time she wanted to shift and made herself stand still wasting no more words hunter turned toward the hotel her bags in hand it didnt occur to lee until she was following him inside that shed had a nonstop conversation with a hotel driver a conversation that hadnt dwelt on the usual pleasantries or tourist plugs as she watched him walk to the desk she felt an aura of cool confidence from him and traces very subtle traces of arrogance why was a man like this driving back and forth and getting nowhere she wondered stepping up to the desk she told herself it wasnt her concern she had bigger fish to fry lenore radcliffe she told the clerk yes ms radcliffe he handed her a form and imprinted her credit card before he passed her a key before she could take it hunter slipped it into his own hand it was then she noticed the odd ring on his pinky four thin bands of gold and silver twisted into one ill take you around he said simply then crossed through the lobby with her again in his wake he wound through a corridor turned left then stopped lee waited while he unlocked the door and gestured her inside the room was on the garden level with its own patio she was pleased to note as she scanned the room hunter carelessly switched on the tv and flipped through the channels before he checked the air conditioner just call the desk if you need anything else he advised stowing her garment bag in the closet yes i will lee hunted through her purse and came up with a five thank you she said holding it out his eyes met hers again giving her that same frozen jolt they had in the airport she felt something stir deep within but wasnt sure if it was trying to reach out to him or struggling to hide the fingers holding the bill nearly trembled then he smiled so quickly so charmingly she was speechless thank you ms radcliffe without a blink hunter pocketed the five dollars and strolled out chapter contents prev next if writers were often considered odd writers conferences lee was to discover were oddities in themselves they certainly couldnt be considered quiet or organized or stuffy like nearly every other of the two hundred or so participants she stood in one of the dozen lines at am for registration from the laughing and calling and embracing it was obvious that many of the writers and wouldbe writers knew one another there was an air of congeniality shared knowledge and camaraderie overlaying it all was excitement still more than one member stood in the noisy lobby like a child lost in a shipwreck clinging to a folder or briefcase as though it were a life preserver and staring about with awe or simple confusion lee could appreciate the feeling though she looked calm and poised as she accepted her packet and pinned her badge to the mintgreen lapel of her blazer concentrating on the business at hand she found a chair in a corner and skimmed the schedule for hunter browns workshop with a dawning smile she took out a pen and underlined creating horror through atmosphere and emotion speaker to be announced bingo lee thought capping her pen shed make certain she had a frontrow seat a glance at her watch showed her that she had three hours before brown began to speak never one to take chances she took out her notebook to skim over the questions shed listed while people filed by her or merely loitered chatting if i get rejected again im going to put my head in the oven your ovens electric judy its the thought that counts amused lee began to listen to the passing comments with half an ear while she added a few more questions and when they brought in my breakfast this morning there was a fivehundredpage manuscript under my plate i completely lost my appetite thats nothing i got one in my office last week written in calligraphy one hundred and fifty thousand words of flowing script editors she mused she could tell them a few stories on some of the submissions that found their way to celebrity he said his editor hacked his first chapter to pieces so hes going into mourning before the rewrites i always go into mourning before rewrites its after a rejection that i seriously consider taking up basket weaving as a profession did you hear jeffries is here again trying to peddle that manuscript about the virgin with acrophobia and telekinesis i cant believe he wont let it die a quiet death whens your next murder coming out in august its poison darling thats no way to talk about your work as they passed by her lee caught the variety of tones some muted some sophisticated some flamboyant gestures and conversations followed the same wide range amazed she watched one man swoop by in a long dramatic black cape definitely an odd group lee thought but she warmed to them it was true she confined her skill to articles and profiles but at heart she was a story teller her position on the magazine had been hardearned and shed built her world around it for all her ambition she had a firm fear of rejection that kept her own manuscript unfinished buried in a drawer for weeks and sometimes months at a time at the magazine she had prestige security and room for advancement the weekly paycheck put the roof over her head the clothes on her back and the food on her table if it hadnt been so important that she prove she could do all this for herself she might have taken the chance of sending those first hundred pages to a publishing house but then shaking her head lee watched the people mill through the registration area all types all sizes all ages clothes varied from trim professional suits to jeans to flamboyant caftans and smocks apparently style was a matter of taste and taste a matter of individuality she wondered if shed see quite the same variety anywhere else absently she glanced at the partial manuscript shed tucked into her briefcase just for cover she reminded herself that was all no she didnt believe she had it in her to be a great writer but she knew she had the skill for great reporting shed never never settle for being secondrate at anything still while she was here it wouldnt hurt to sit in on one or two of the seminars she might pick up some pointers more importantly she told herself as she rose she might be able to stretch this trip into another story on the ins and outs of a writers conference who attended why what they did what they hoped for yes it could make quite an interesting little piece the job after all came first an hour later a bit more enthusiastic than she wanted to be after her first workshop she wandered into the coffee shop shed take a short break assimilate the notes shed written then go back and make certain she had the best seat in the house for hunter browns lecture hunter glanced up from his paper and watched her enter the coffee shop lee radcliffe he mused finding her of more interest than the local news hed been scanning hed enjoyed his conversation with her the day before and as often as not he found conversations tedious she had a quality about her an innate frankness glossed with sophistication that he found intriguing enough to hold his interest an obsessive writer who believed that the characters themselves were the plot of any book hunter always looked for the unique and the individual instinct told him lee radcliffe was quite an individual unobserved he watched her from the way she looked absently around the room it was obvious she was preoccupied the suit she wore was very simple but showed both style and taste in the color and cut she was a women who could wear the simple he decided because she was a women whod been born with style if he wasnt very much mistaken shed been born into wealth as well there was always a subtle difference between those who were accustomed to money and those whod spent years earning it so where did the nerves come from he wondered curious he decided it would be worth an hour of his time to try to find out setting his paper aside hunter lit a cigarette and continued to stare at her knowing there was no quicker way to catch someones eye lee thinking more about the story she was going to write than the coffee shed come for felt an odd tingle run up her spine it was real enough to give her an urge to turn around and walk out again when she glanced over and found herself staring back at hunter it was his eyes she decided at first not thinking of him as a man or the hotel driver from the previous day it was his eyes dark almost the color of jet theyd draw you in and draw you in until you were caught and every secret youd ever had would be secret no longer it was frightening it was irresistible amazed that such a fanciful thought had crept into her own practical organized mind lee approached him he was just a man she told herself a man who worked for his living like any other man there was certainly nothing to be frightened of ms radcliffe with the same unsmiling stare he gestured to the chair across from him buy you a cup of coffee normally she wouldve refused politely enough but now for some intangible reason lee felt as though she had a point to prove for the same intangible reason she felt she had to prove it to him as much as to herself thank you the moment she sat down a waitress was there pouring coffee enjoying the conference yes lee poured cream into the cup stirring it around and around until a tiny whirlpool formed in the center as disorganized as everything seems to be there was an amazing amount of information generated at the workshop i went to this morning a smile touched his lips so lightly that it was barely there at all you prefer organization its more productive though he was dressed more formally than hed been the day before the pleated slacks and opennecked shirt were still casual she wondered why he wasnt required to wear a uniform but then she thought you could put him in one of those nifty white jackets and neat ties and his eyes would simply defy them a lot of fascinating things can come out of chaos dont you think perhaps she frowned down at the whirlpool in her cup why did she feel as though she was being sucked in in just that way and why she thought with a sudden flash of impatience was she sitting here having a philosophical discussion with a stranger when she should be outlining the two stories she planned to write did you find hunter brown he asked her as he studied her over the rim of his cup annoyed with herself he guessed accurately and anxious to be off doing what distracted lee looked back up to find those strange eyes still on her i asked if youd run into hunter brown the whisper of a smile was on his lips again and this time it touched his eyes as well it didnt make them any less intense no defensive without knowing why lee sipped at her cooling coffee why after the things you said yesterday i was curious what youd think of him once you met him he took a drag from his cigarette and blew smoke out in a haze people usually have a preconceived image of someone but it rarely holds up in the flesh its difficult to have any kind of an image of someone who hides away from the world his brow went up but his voice remained mild hides its the word that comes to my mind lee returned again finding that she was speaking her thoughts aloud to him theres no picture of him on the back of any of his books no bio he never grants interviews never denies or substantiates anything written about him any awards hes received have been accepted by his agent or his editor she ran her fingers up and down the handle of her spoon ive heard he occasionally attends affairs like this but only if its a very small conference and theres no publicity about his appearance all during her speech hunter kept his eyes on her watching every nuance of expression there were traces of frustration he was certain and of eagerness the lovely cameo face was calm while her fingers moves restlessly shed be in his next book he decided on the spot hed never met anyone with more potential for being a central character because his direct unblinking stare made her want to stammer lee gave him back the hard uncompromising look why do you stare at me like that he continued to do so without any show of discomfort because youre an interesting woman another man might have said beautiful still another might have said fascinating lee could have tossed off either one with light scorn she picked up her spoon again then set it down why you have a tidy mind innate style and youre a bundle of nerves he liked the way the faint line appeared between her brows when she frowned it meant stubbornness to him and tenacity he respected both ive always been intrigued by pockets hunter went on the deeper the better i find myself wondering just whats in your pockets ms radcliffe she felt the tremor again up her spine then down it wasnt comfortable to sit near a man who could do that she had a moments sympathy for every person shed ever interviewed you have an odd way of putting things she muttered so ive been told she instructed herself to get up and leave it didnt make sense to sit there being disturbed by a man she could dismiss with a fivedollar tip what are you doing in flagstaff she demanded you dont strike me as someone whod be content to drive back and forth to an airport day after day shuttling passengers and hauling luggage impressions make fascinating little paintings dont they he smiled at her fully as he had the day before when shed tipped him lee wasnt sure why shed felt hed been laughing at her then any more than why she felt he was laughing at her now despite herself her lips curved in response he found the smile a pleasant and very alluring surprise youre a very odd man ive been told that too his smile faded and his eyes became intense again have dinner with me tonight the question didnt surprise her as much as the fact that she wanted to accept and nearly had no she said cautiously retreating i dont think so let me know if you change your mind she was surprised again most men wouldve pressed a bit it was well expected lee reflected wishing she could figure him out i have to get back she reached for her briefcase do you know where the canyon room is with an inward chuckle he dropped bills on the table yes ill show you thats not necessary lee began rising ive got time he walked with her out of the coffee shop and into the wide carpeted lobby do you plan to do any sightseeing while youre here there wont be time she glanced out one of the wide windows at the towering peak of mount humphrey as soon as the conference is over i have to get back to where los angeles too many people hunter said automatically dont you ever feel as though theyre using up your air she wouldnt have put it that way would never have thought of it but there were times she felt a twinge of what might be called claustrophobia still her home was there and more importantly her work no theres enough air such as it is for everyone youve never stood at the south rim of the canyon and looked out and breathed in again lee shot him a look he had a way of saying things that gave you an immediate picture for the second time she regretted that she wouldnt be able to take a day or two to explore some of the vastness of arizona maybe some other time shrugging she turned with him as he headed down a corridor to the right times fickle he commented when you need it theres too little of it then you wake up at three oclock in the morning and theres too much of it its usually better to take it than to anticipate it you might try that he said looking down at her again it might help your nerves her brows drew together theres nothing wrong with my nerves some people can thrive on nervous energy for weeks at a time then they have to find that little valve that lets the steam escape for the first time he touched her just fingertips to the ends of her hair but she felt it experienced it as hard and strong as if his hand had closed firmly over hers what do you do to let the steam escape lenore she didnt stiffen or casually nudge his hand away as she would have done at any other time instead she stood still toying with a sensation she couldnt remember ever experiencing before thunder and lightning she thought there was thunder and lightning in this man deep under the strangely aloof oddly open exterior she wasnt about to be caught in the storm i work she said easily but her fingers had tightened on the handle of her briefcase i dont need any other escape valve she didnt step back but let the haughtiness that had always protected her enter her tone no one calls me lenore no he nearly smiled it was this look she realized the secret amusement the onlooker could only guess at rather than see that most intrigued she thought he probably knew that but it suits you feminine elegant a little distant and the only word there spoken was the whispered word lenore yes he let his fingertips linger a moment longer on her hair i think poe wouldve found you very apt before she could prevent it before she could anticipate it her knees were weak shed felt the sound of her own name feather over her skin who are you lee found herself demanding was it possible to be so deeply affected by someone without even knowing his name she stepped forward in what seemed to be a challenge just who are you he smiled again with the oddly gentle charm that shouldnt have suited his eyes yet somehow did strange you never asked before youd better go in he told her as people began to gravitate toward the open doors of the canyon room youll want a good seat yes she drew back a bit shaken by the ferocity of the desire she felt to learn more about him with a last look over her shoulder lee walked in and settled in the front row it was time to get her mind back on the business shed come for and the business was hunter brown distractions like incomprehensible men who drove jeeps for a living would have to be put aside from her briefcase lee took a fresh notebook and two pencils slipping one behind her ear within a few moments shed be able to see and study the mysterious hunter brown shed be able to listen and take notes with perfect freedom after his lecture shed be able to question him and if she had her way shed arrange some kind of oneonone for later lee had given the ethics of the situation careful thought she didnt feel it would be necessary to tell brown she was a reporter she was there as an aspiring writer and had the fledgling manuscript to prove it anyone there was free to try to write and sell an article on the conference and its participants only if brown used the words off the record would she be bound to silence without that anything he said was public property this story could be her next step up the ladder would be lee corrected the first documented authentically researched story on hunter brown could push her beyond celebritys scope it would be controversial colorful and most importantly exclusive with this under her belt even her quietly critical family would be impressed with this under her belt lee thought shed be that much closer to the top rung where her sights were always set once she was there all the hard work the long hours the obsessive dedication would be worth it because once she was there she was there to stay at the top lee thought almost fiercely as high as she could reach on the other side of the doors on the other side of the corridor hunter stood with his editor half listening to her comments on an interview shed had with an aspiring writer he caught the gist that she was excited about the writers potential it was a talent of his to be able to conduct a perfectly lucid conversation when his mind was on something entirely different it was something he roused himself to do only when the mood was on him so he spoke to his editor and thought of lee radcliffe yes he was definitely going to use her in his next book true the plot was only a vague notion in his head but he already knew shed be the core of it he needed to dig a bit deeper before hed be satisfied but he didnt foresee any problem there if hed gauged her correctly shed be confused when he walked to the podium then stunned then furious if she wanted to talk to him as badly as shed indicated shed swallow her temper a strong woman hunter decided a will of iron and skin like cream vulnerable eyes and a damnthedevil chin a character was nothing without contrasts strengths and weaknesses and secrets he thought already certain hed discover hers he had another day and a half to explore lenore radcliffe hunter figured that was enough the corridor was full of laughter and complaints and enthusiasm as people loitered or filed through into the adjoining room he knew what it was to feel enthusiastic about being a writer if the pleasure went out of it hed still write he was compelled to but it would show in his work emotions always showed he never allowed his feeling and thoughts to pour into his work they would have done so regardless of his permission hunter considered it a fair tradeoff his emotions his thoughts were there for anyone who cared to read them his life was completely and without exception his own the woman beside him had his affection and his respect hed argued with her over motivation and sentence structure losing as often as winning hed shouted at her laughed with her and had given her emotional support through her recent divorce he knew her age her favorite drink and her weakness for cashews shed been his editor for three years which is a close to a marriage as many people come yet she had no idea he had a tenyearold daughter named sarah who liked to bake cookies and play soccer hunter took a last drag on his cigarette as the president of the small writers group approached the man was a slick imaginative science fiction writer whom hunter had read and enjoyed otherwise he wouldnt be there about to make one of his rare appearances in the writing community mr brown i dont need to tell you again how honored we are to have you here no hunter gave him the easy half smile you dont theres liable to be quite a commotion when i announce you after your lecture ill do everything i can to keep the thundering horde back dont worry about it ill manage the man nodded never doubting it im having a small reception in my suite this evening if youd like to join us i appreciate it but i have a dinner engagement though he didnt know quite what to make of the smile the organizations president was too intelligent to press his luck when he was about to pull off a coup if youre ready then ill announce you any time hunter followed him into the canyon room then loitered just inside the doors the room was already buzzing with anticipation and curiosity the podium was set on a small stage in front of two hundred chairs that were nearly all filled talk died down when the president approached the stage but continued in pockets of murmurs even after hed begun to speak hunter heard one of the men nearest him whisper to a companion that he had three publishing houses competing for his manuscript hunter skimmed over the crowd barely listening to the beginning of his introduction then his gaze rested again on lee she was watching the speaker with a small polite smile on her lips but her eyes gave her away they were dark and eager hunter let his gaze roam down until it rested in her lap there her hand opened and closed on the pencil a bundle of nerves and energy wrapped in a very thin layer of confidence he thought for the second time lee felt his eyes on her and for the second time she turned so that their gazes locked the faint line marred her brow again as she wondered what he was doing inside the conference room unperturbed leaning easily against the wall hunter stared back at her his careers risen steadily since the publication of his first book only five years ago since the first the devils due hes given us the pleasure of being scared out of our socks every time we pick up his work at the mention of the title the murmurs increased and heads began to swivel hunter continued to stare at lee and she back at him frowning his latest silent scream is already solid in the numberone spot on the bestseller list were honored and privileged to welcome to flagstaff hunter brown the effusive applause competed with the growing murmurs of two hundred people in a closed room casually hunter straightened from the wall and walked to the stage he saw the pencil fall out of lees hand and roll to the floor without breaking rhythm he stooped and picked it up better hold on to this he advised looking into her astonished eyes as he handed it back he watched astonishment flare into fury youre a yes but youd better tell me later walking the rest of the way to the stage hunter stepped behind the podium and waited for the applause to fade again he skimmed the crowd but this time with such a quiet intensity that all sound died for ten seconds there wasnt even the sound of breathing terror hunter said into the microphone from the first word he had them spellbound and held them captive for forty minutes no one moved no one yawned no one slipped out for a cigarette with her teeth clenched tight lee knew she despised him simmering struggling against the urge to spring up and stalk out lee sat stiffly and took meticulous notes in the margin of the book she drew a perfectly recognizable caricature of hunter with a dagger through his heart it gave her enormous satisfaction when he agreed to field questions for ten minutes lees was the first hand up hunter looked directly at her smiled and called on someone three rows back he answered professional questions professionally and evaded any personal references she had to admire his skill particularly since she was well aware he so seldom spoke in public he showed no nerves no hesitation and absolutely no inclination to call on her though her hand was up and her eyes shot fiery little darts at him but she was a reporter lee reminded herself reporters got nowhere if they stood on ceremony mr brown lee began and rose sorry with his slow smile he held up a hand im afraid were already over time best of luck to all of you he left the podium and the room under a hail of applause by the time lee could work her way to the doors shed heard enough praise of hunter brown to turn her simmering temper to boil the nerve she thought as she finally made it into the corridor the unspeakable nerve she didnt mind being bested in a game of chess she could handle having her work criticized and her opinion questioned all in all lee considered herself a reasonable lowkey person with no more than her fair share of conceit the one thing she couldnt wouldnt tolerate was being made a fool of revenge sprang into her mind nasty petty revenge oh yes she thought as she tried to work her way through the thick crowd of hunter brown fans shed have her revenge somehow some way and when she did it would be perfect she turned off at the elevators knowing she was too full of fury to deal successfully with hunter at that moment she needed an hour to cool off and to plan the pencil she still held snapped between her fingers if it was the last thing she did she was going to make hunter brown squirm just as she started to push the button for her floor hunter slipped inside the elevator going up he asked easily and pushed the number himself lee felt the fury rise to her throat and burn with an effort she clamped her lips tight on the venom and stared straight ahead broke your pencil hunter observed finding himself more amused than hed been in days he glanced at her open notebook spotting the meticulously drawn caricature an appreciative grin appeared well done he told her howd you enjoy the workshop lee gave him one scathing look as the elevator doors opened youre a fount of trivial information mr brown youve got murder in your eyes lenore he stepped into the hall with her it suits your hair your drawing makes it clear enough what youd like to do why dont you stab me while you have the chance as she continued to walk lee told herself she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of speaking to him she wouldnt speak to him at all her head jerked up youve had a good laugh at my expense she grated and dug in her briefcase for her room key a quiet chuckle or two he corrected while she continued to simmer and search lose your key no i havent lost my key frustrated lee looked up until fury met amusement why dont you go away and sit on your laurels ive always found that uncomfortable why dont you vent your spleen lenore youd feel better dont call me lenore she exploded as her control slipped you had no right to use me as the brunt of a joke you had no right to pretend you worked for the hotel you assumed he corrected as i recall i never pretended anything you asked for a ride yesterday i simply gave you one you knew i thought you were the hotel driver you were standing there beside my luggage a classic case of mistaken identity he noted that her skin tinted with pale rose when she was angry an attractive side effect hunter decided id come to pick up my editor whod missed her phoenix connection as it turned out i thought the luggage was hers all you had to do was say that at the time you never asked he pointed out and you did tell me to get the luggage oh youre infuriating clamping her teeth shut she began to fumble in her briefcase again but brilliant you mentioned that yourself being able to string words together is an admirable talent mr brown hauteur was one of her most practiced skills lee used it to the fullest it doesnt make you an admirable person no i wouldnt say i was particularly while he waited for her to find her key hunter leaned comfortably against the wall you carried my luggage to my room she continued infuriated i gave you a fivedollar tip very generous she let out a huff of breath grateful that her hands were busy she didnt know how else she could have prevented herself from slapping his calm selfsatisfied face youve had your joke she said finding her key at last now id like you to do me the courtesy of never speaking to me again i dont know where you got the impression i was courteous before she could unlock the door hed put his hand over hers on the key she felt the little tingle of power and cursed him for it even as she met his calmly amused look you did mention however that youd like to speak to me we can talk over dinner tonight she stared at him why should she have thought he wouldnt be able to surprise her again you have the most incredible nerve you mentioned that already seven oclock she wanted to tell him she wouldnt have dinner with him even if he groveled she wanted to tell him that and all manner of other unpleasant things temper fought with practicality there was a job shed come to do one shed been working on unsuccessfully for three months success was more important than pride he was offering her the perfect way to do what shed come to do and to do it more extensively than she couldve hoped for and perhaps just perhaps he was opening the door himself for her revenge it would make it all the sweeter though it was a large lump lee swallowed her pride thats fine she agreed but he noticed she didnt look too pleased where should i meet you he never trusted easy agreement but then hunter trusted very little she was going to be a challenge he felt ill pick you up here his fingers ran casually up to her wrist before he released her you might bring your manuscript along im curious to see your work she smiled and thought of the article she was going to write i very much want you to see my work lee stepped into her room and gave herself the small satisfaction of slamming the door in his face chapter contents prev next midnightblue silk lee took a great deal of time and gave a great deal of thought to choosing the right dress for her evening with hunter it was business the deepblue silk shot through with thin silver threads appealed to her because of its clean elegant lines and lack of ornamentation lee would on the occasions when she shopped spend as much time choosing the right scarf as she would researching a subject it was all business now after a thorough debate she slipped into the silk it coolly skimmed her skin it draped subtly over curves her own reflection satisfied her the unsmiling woman who looked back at her presented precisely the sort of image she wanted to project elegant sophisticated and a bit remote if nothing else this soothed her bruised ego as lee looked back over her life concentrating on her career she could remember no incident where shed found herself bested her mouth became grim as she ran a brush through her hair it wasnt going to happen now hunter brown was going to get back some of his own if for no other reason than that halfamused smile of his no one laughed at her and got away with it lee told herself as she slapped the brush back on the dresser smartly enough to make the bottles jump whatever game she had to play to get what she wanted shed play when the article on hunter brown hit the stands shed have won shed have the satisfaction of knowing hed helped her in the final analysis lee mused there was no substitute for winning when the knock sounded at her door she glanced at her watch prompt shed have to make a note of it her mood was smug as after picking up her slim evening bag she went to answer inherently casual in dress but not sloppy she noted filing the information away as she glanced at the opencollared shirt under his dark jacket some men could wear black tie and not look as elegant as hunter brown looked in jeans that was something that might interest her readers by the end of the evening lee reminded herself shed know all she possibly could about him good evening she started to step across the threshold but he took her hand holding her motionless as he studied her very lovely hunter declared her hand was very soft and very cool though her eyes were still hot with annoyance he liked the contrast you wear silk and a very alluring scent but manage to maintain that aura of untouchability its quite a talent im not interested in being analyzed the curse or blessing of the writer he countered depending on your viewpoint being one yourself you should understand wheres your manuscript shed thought hed forget had hoped he would now she was back to the disadvantage of stammering it ah it isnt bring it along hunter ordered i want to take a look at it i dont see why every writer wants his words read she didnt it wasnt polished it wasnt perfect without a doubt the last person she wanted to allow a glimpse of her inner thoughts was hunter but he was standing watching with those dark eyes already seeing beyond the outer layers trapped lee turned back into the room and slipped the folder from her briefcase if she could keep him busy enough she thought there wouldnt be time for him to look at it anyway itll be difficult for you to read anything in a restaurant she pointed out as she closed the door behind her thats why were having dinner in my suite when she stopped he simply took her hand and continued on to the elevators as if he hadnt noticed perhaps ive given you the wrong impression she began coldly i dont think so he turned still holding her hand his palm wasnt as smooth as shed expected a writers to be the palm was as wide as a concert pianists but it was ridged with calluses it made lee discovered a very intriguing and uncomfortable combination my imagination hasnt gone very deeply into the prospect of seducing you lenore though he felt her stiffen in outrage he drew her into the elevator the point is i dont care for restaurants and i care less for crowds and interruptions the elevator hummed quietly on the short ascent have you found the conference worthwhile im going to get what i came for she stepped through the doors as they slid open and whats that what did you come for she countered you dont exactly make it a habit to attend conferences and this one is certainly small and off the beaten path occasionally i enjoy the contact with other writers unlocking the door he gestured her inside this conference certainly isnt bulging with authors whove attained your degree of success success has nothing to do with writing she set her purse and folder aside and faced him straight on easy to say when you have it is it as if amused he shrugged then gestured toward the window you should drink in as much of the view as you can you wont see anything like this through any window in los angeles you dont care for la if she was careful and clever she should be able to pin him down on where he lived and why he lived there la has its points would you like some wine yes she wandered over to the window the vastness still had the power to stun her and almost almost frighten once you were beyond the city limits you might wander for miles without seeing another face hearing another voice the isolation she thought or perhaps just the space itself would overwhelm have you been there often she asked deliberately turning her back to the window hmm to los angeles no he crossed to her and offered a glass of palegold wine you prefer the east to the west he smiled and lifted his glass i make it a point to prefer where i am he was very adept at evasions she thought and turned away to wander the room it seemed he was also very adept at making her uneasy unless she missed her guess he did both on purpose do you travel often only when its necessary tipping back her glass lee decided to try a more direct approach why are you so secretive about yourself most people in your position would make the most of the promotion and publicity thats available i dont consider myself secretive nor do i consider myself most people you dont even have a bio or a photo on your book covers my face and my background have nothing to do with the stories i tell does the wine suit you its very good though shed barely tasted it dont you feel its part of your profession to satisfy the readers curiosity when it comes to the person who creates a story that interests them no my profession is words putting words together so that someone who reads them is entertained intrigued and satisfied with a tale and tales spring from imagination rather than hard fact he sipped wine himself and approved it the teller of the tale is nothing compared to the tale itself modesty lee asked with a trace of scorn she couldnt prevent the scorn seemed to amuse him not at all its a matter of priorities not humility if you knew me better youd understand i have very few virtues he smiled but lee told herself shed imagined that brief predatory flash in his eyes imagined she told herself again and shuddered annoyed at her own reaction she held out her wineglass for a refill have you any virtues he like the fact that she struck back even when her nerves were racing some say vices are more interesting and certainly more entertaining than virtues he filled her glass to just under the rim would you agree more interesting perhaps more entertaining she refused to let her eyes falter from his as she drank certainly more demanding he mulled this over enjoying her quick response and her clean direct thoughtpatterns you have an interesting mind lenore you keep it exercised a woman who doesnt finds herself watching other people climb to the top while she fills water glasses and makes the coffee she could have cursed in frustration the moment shed spoken it wasnt her habit to speak that freely the point was she was here to interview him lee reminded herself not the other way around an interesting analogy hunter murmured ambition yes hed sensed that about her from the beginning but what was it she wanted to achieve whatever it was he mused she wouldnt be above stepping over a few people to get it he found he could respect that could almost admire it tell me do you ever relax i beg your pardon your hands are rarely still though you appear to have a great deal of control otherwise he noted that at his words her fingers stopped toying with the stem of her glass since youve come into this room you havent stayed in one spot more than a few seconds do i make you nervous sending him a cool look she sat on the plush sofa and crossed her legs no but her pulse thudded a bit when he sat down beside her what does small loud dogs he laughed pleased with the moment and with her youre a very entertaining woman he took her hand lightly in his i should tell you thats my highest compliment you set a great store by entertainment the worlds a grim place worse often tedious her hand was delicate and delicacy drew him her eyes held secrets and there was little that intrigued him more if we cant be entertained therere only two places to go back to the cave or on to oblivion so you entertain with terror she wanted to shift farther away from him but his fingers had tightened almost imperceptively on her hand and his eyes were searching for her thoughts if youre worried about the unspeakable terror lurking outside your bedroom window would you worry about your next dentist appointment or the fact that your washer overflowed escape he reached up to touch her hair it seemed a very casual very natural gesture to him lees eyes flew open as if shed been pinched i dont care for the word escape she was a difficult combination to resist hunter thought as he let his fingertips skim down the side of her throat the fiery hair the vulnerable eyes the cool gloss of breeding the bubbling nerves shed make a fascinating character and he realized a fascinating lover hed already decided to have her for the first now as he toyed with the ends of her hair he decided to have her for the second she sensed something when his gaze locked on hers again decision determination desire her mouth went dry it wasnt often that she felt she could be outmatched by another it was rarer still when anyone or anything truly frightened her though he said nothing though he moved no closer she found herself fighting back fear and the knowledge that whatever game she challenged him to she would lose because he would look into her eyes and know each move before she made it a knock sounded at the door but he continued to look at her for long silent seconds before he rose i took the liberty of ordering dinner he said so calmly that lee wondered if shed imagined the flare of passion shed seen in his eyes while he went to the door she sat where she was struggling to sort her own thoughts she was imagining things lee told herself he couldnt see into her and read her thoughts he was just a man since the game was hers and only she knew the rules she wouldnt lose settled again she rose to walk to the table the salmon was tender and pink pleased with the choice lee sat down at the table as the waiter closed the door behind him so far lee reflected shed answered more questions than hunter it was time to change that the advice you gave earlier to struggling writers about blocking out time to write every day no matter how discouraged they get did that come from personal experience hunter sampled the salmon all writers face discouragement from time to time just as they face criticism and rejection did you face many rejections before the sale of the devils due i suspect anything that comes too easily he lifted the wine bottle to fill her glass again she had a face made for candlelight he mused as he watched the shadow and light flicker over the creamsoft skin and delicate features he was determined to find out what lay beneath before the evening ended he never considered he was using her though he fully intended to pick her brain for everything he could learn about her it was a writers privilege what made you become a writer he lifted a brow as he continued to eat i was born a writer lee ate slowly planning her next line of questions she had to move carefully avoid putting him on the defensive maneuver around any suspicions she never considered she was using him though she fully intended to pick his brain for everything she could learn about him it was a reporters privilege born a writer she repeated flaking off another bite of salmon do you think its that simple werent there elements in your background circumstances early experiences that led you toward your career i didnt say it was simple hunter corrected were all born with a certain set of choices to make the matter of making the right ones is anything but simple every novel written has to do with choices writing novels is what i was meant to do he interested her enough that she forgot the unofficial interview and asked for herself so you always wanted to be a writer youre very literalminded hunter observed comfortable he leaned back and swirled the wine in his glass no i didnt i wanted to play professional soccer soccer her astonished disbelief made him smile soccer he repeated i wanted to make a career of it and might have been successful at it but i had to write lee was silent a moment then decided he was telling her precisely the truth so you became a writer without really wanting to i made a choice hunter corrected intrigued by the orderly logic of her mind i believe a great many people are born writer or artist and die without ever realizing it books go unwritten paintings unpainted the fortunate ones are those who discover what they were meant to do i might have been an excellent soccer player i might have been an excellent writer if id tried to do both id have been no more than mediocre i chose not to be mediocre therere several million readers whod agree you made the right choice forgetting the cool facade she propped her elbows on the table and leaned forward why horror fiction hunter someone with your skill and your imagination could write anything why did you turn your talents toward that particular genre he lit a cigarette so that the scent of tobacco stung the air why do you read it she frowned he hadnt turned one of her questions back on her for some time i dont as a rule except yours im flattered why mine your first was recommended to me and then she hesitated not wanting to say shed been hooked from the first page instead she ran her fingertip around the rim of her glass and sorted through her answer you have a way of creating atmosphere and drawing characters that make the impossibility of your stories perfectly believable he blew out a stream of smoke do you think theyre impossible she gave a quick laugh a laugh he recognized as genuine from the humor that lit her eyes it did something very special to her beauty it made it accessible i hardly believe in people being possessed by demons or a house being inherently evil no he smiled no superstitions lenore she met his gaze levelly none strange most of us have a few do you of course and even the ones i dont have fascinate me he took her hand linking fingers firmly its said some people are able to sense anothers aura or personality if the word suits you better by a simple clasp of hands his palm was warm and hard as he kept his eyes fixed on hers she could feel cool against her hand the twisted metal of his ring i dont believe that but she wasnt so sure not with him you believe only in what you see or feel only in what can be touched with one of the five senses that you understand he rose drawing her to her feet everything that is cant be understood everything thats understood cant be explained everything has an explanation but she found the words like her pulse a bit unsteady she might have drawn her hand away and he might have let her but her statement seemed to be a direct challenge can you explain why your heart beats faster when i step closer his face looked mysterious his eyes like jet in the candlelight you said you werent afraid of me im not but your pulse throbs his fingertip lightly touched the hollow of her throat can you explain why when weve yet to spend even one full day together i want to touch you like this gently incredibly gently he ran the back of his hand up the side of her face dont it was only a whisper can you explain this kind of attraction between two strangers he traced a finger over her lips felt them tremble wondered of their taste something soft something flowing moved through her physical attractions no more than chemistry science he brought her hand up pressing his lips to the center of her palm she felt the muscles in her thighs turn to liquid is there an equation for this still watching her he brushed his lips over her wrist her skin chilled then heated her pulse jolted and scrambled he smiled does this he whispered a kiss at the corner of her mouth have to do with logic i dont want you to touch me like this you want me to touch you hunter corrected but you cant explain it in an expected move he thrust his hands into her hair try the unexplainable he challenged before his lips closed over hers power it sped through her desire was a rush of heat she could feel need sing through her as she stood motionless in his arms she should have refused him lee was experienced in the art of refusals there was suddenly no wit to evade no strength to refuse for all his intensity for all the force of his personality the kiss was meltingly soft though his fingers were strong and firm in her hair so firm if shed tried to move away shed have found herself trapped his lips were as gentle and warm as the light that flickered on the table beside them she didnt know when she reached for him but her arms were around him bodies merging silk rustling the quiet intoxicating taste of wine was on his tongue lee drank it in she could smell the candle wax and her own perfume her ordered disciplined mind swam first with confusion then with sensation after alluring sensation her lips were cool but warmed quickly her body was tense but slowly relaxed he enjoyed both changes she wasnt a woman who gave herself freely or easily he knew that just as he knew she wasnt a woman often taken by surprise she seemed very small against him very fragile hed always treated fragility with great care even as the kiss grew deeper even as his own need grew surprisingly greater his mouth remained gentle on hers teasing requesting he believed that lovemaking from first touch to fulfillment was an art he believed that art could never be rushed so slowly patiently he showed her what might be while his hands stayed only in her hair and his mouth stayed softly on her he was draining her lee could feel her will her strength her thoughts seeping out of her and as they drained away a flood of sensation replenished what she lost there was no dealing with it no explaining it could only be experienced pleasure this fluid couldnt be contained desire this strong couldnt be guided it was the lack of control more than the flood of feeling that frightened her most if she lost her control shed lose her purpose then she would flounder with a murmured protest she pulled away but found that while he freed her lips he still held her later he thought at some lonely dark hour hed explore his own reaction now he was much more interested in hers she looked at him as though shed been struck face pale eyes dark though her lips parted she said nothing under his fingers he could feel the light tremor that coursed through her once then twice some things cant be explained even when theyre understood he said it softly so softly she might have thought it a threat i dont understand you at all she put her hands on his forearms as if to draw him away i dont think i want to anymore he didnt smile as he let his hands slide down to her shoulders perhaps not youll have a choice to make no shaken she stepped away and snatched up her purse the conference ends tomorrow and i go back to la suddenly angry she turned to face him youll go back to whatever hole it is you hide in he inclined his head perhaps it was best shed put some distance between them very abruptly he realized that if hed held her a moment longer he wouldnt have let her go well talk tomorrow she didnt question her own illogic but shook her head no we wont talk anymore he didnt correct her when she walked to the door and stood where he was when the door closed behind her there was no need to contradict her he knew theyd talk again lifting his glass of wine hunter gathered up the manuscript shed forgotten and settled himself in a chair chapter contents prev next anger perhaps what lee felt was simple anger without other eddies and currents of emotion but she wasnt certain whom she felt angry with what had happened the evening before could have been avoided should have been she corrected as she stepped out of the shower because shed allowed hunter to set the pace and the tone shed put herself in a vulnerable position and shed wasted a valuable opportunity if lee had learned anything in her years as a reporter it was that a wasted opportunity was the most destructive mistake in the business how much did she know of hunter brown that could be used in a concise informative article enough for a paragraph lee thought in disgust a very short paragraph she might have only one chance to make up for lost time time lost because shed let herself feel like a woman instead of thinking like a reporter hed led her along on a leash she admitted bitterly rubbing a towel over her dripping hair while the heat lamp in the ceiling warmed her skin instead of balking shed gone obediently where hed taken her and had missed the most important interview of her career lee tossed down the towel and stalked out of the steamy bathroom telling herself she felt nothing but annoyance for him and for herself lee pulled on a robe before she sat down at the small writing desk she still had some time before room service would deliver her first cup of coffee but there wasnt any more time to waste business first and last she pulled out a pad and pencil hunter brown lee headed the top of the pad in bold letters and underlined the name the problem had been she admitted that she hadnt approached hunter the assignment logically systematically she could correct that now with a basic outline she had after all seen him spoken to him asked him a few elementary questions as far as she knew no other reporter could make such a claim it was time to stop berating herself for not tying everything up neatly in a matter of hours and make the slim advantage she still had work for her she began to write in a decisive hand appearance not typical now there was a positive statement she thought with a frown in three bold strokes she crossed out the words dark lean rangy build she wrote like a longdistance runner a crosscountry skier her eyes narrowed as she brought his face to the foreground of her memory rugged face offset by an air of intelligence most outstanding feature eyes very dark very direct very unnerving was that editorializing she asked herself would those long quiet stares disturb everyone shrugging the question away lee continued to write tall perhaps sixone approximately a hundred sixty pounds very confident musicians hands poets mouth a bit surprised by her own description lee went on to her next category personality enigmatic not enough she decided huffing slightly arrogant selfabsorbed rude definitely editorializing she set down her pen and took a deep breath then picked it up again a skilled mesmerizing speaker she admitted in print perceptive cool taciturn and open by turns physical the last word had been a mistake lee discovered as it brought back the memory of that long soft draining kiss the gentleness of the mouth the firmness of his hands no that wasnt for publication nor would she need notes to bring back all the details all the sensations she would however be wise to remember that he was a man who moved quickly when he chose a man who apparently took precisely what he wanted humor yes under the intensity there was humor in him she didnt like recalling how hed laughed at her but when she had such a dearth of material she needed every detail uncomfortable or not she remembered every word hed said on his philosophy of writing but how could she translate something so intangible into a few clean pragmatic sentences she could say he thought of his work as an obligation a vocation it just wasnt enough she thought in frustration she needed his own words here not a translation of his meaning the simple truth was she had to speak to him again dragging a hand through her hair she read over her orderly notes she should have held the reins of the conversation from the very beginning if she was an expert on anything it was on channeling and steering talk along the lines she wanted shed interviewed subjects more closemouthed than hunter more hostile but she couldnt remember any more frustrating absently she began to tap the end of her pencil against the table it wasnt her job to be frustrated but to be productive it wasnt her job she added to allow herself to be so utterly seduced by an assignment she could have prevented the kiss it still wasnt clear to lee why she hadnt she could have controlled her response to it she didnt want to dwell on why she hadnt it was much too easy to remember that long strangely intense moment and in remembering to feel it all again if she was going to prevent herself from doing that and remember instead all the reasons shed come to flagstaff she had to put hunter brown firmly in the category of assignment and keep him there for now her biggest problem was how she was going to manage to see him again professionally she warned herself but she couldnt sit still thinking of it or him pacing she tried to block out the incredibly gentle feel of his mouth on hers and failed a flood of feeling shed never experienced anything like it the weakness the power it was beyond her to understand it the longing the need how could she know the way to control it if she understood him better perhaps no lee lifted her hairbrush then set it down again no understanding hunter would have nothing to do with fighting her desire for him shed wanted to be touched by him and though she had no logical reason for it shed wanted to be touched more than shed wanted to do her job it was unprecedented lee admitted as she absently pushed bottles and jars around on her dresser when something was unprecedented you had to make up your own guidelines uneasy she glanced up and saw a pale woman with sleepy eyes and unruly hair reflected in the glass she looked too young too fragile no one ever saw her without the defensive shield of grooming but she knew what was beneath the fastidiousness and gloss fear fear of failure shed built her confidence stone by meticulous stone until most of the time she believed in it herself but at moments like this when she was alone a little weary a little discouraged the woman inside crept out and with her all the tiny doubts and fears behind that laboriously built wall shed been trained from birth to be little more than an intelligent attractive ornament wellspoken wellgroomed welldisciplined it was all her family had expected of her no lee corrected it was what had been expected of her in that respect shed already failed what trick of fate had made it so impossible for her to fit the mold shed been fashioned for since childhood shed known she needed more yet it had taken her until after college to store up enough courage to break away from the road that would have led her from proper debutante to proper matron when shed told her parents she wasnt going to be mrs jonathan t willoby but that she was leaving palm springs to live and work in los angeles shed been quaking inside not until later did she realize it had been their training that had seen her through the very difficult meeting shed been taught to remain cool and composed never to raise her voice never to show any vulgar signs of temper when shed spoken to them shed seemed perfectly sure of her own mind while in truth shed been terrified of leaving that comfortable gilt cage theyd been fashioning for her since before she was born five years later the fear had dulled but it remained part of her drive to reach the top in her profession came from the very basic need to prove herself to her parents foolish she told herself turning away from the vulnerability of the woman in the glass she had nothing to prove to anyone unless it was to herself shed come for a story and that was her first her only priority the story was going to gel for her if she had to dog hunter browns footsteps like a bloodhound lee looked down at her notebook again and at the notes that filled less than a page shed have more before the day was over she promised herself much more he wouldnt get the upper hand again nor would he distract her from her purpose as soon as shed dressed and had her morning coffee shed look for hunter this time shed stay firmly behind the wheel when she heard the knock lee glanced at the clock beside her bed and gave a little sigh of frustration she was running behind schedule something she never permitted herself to do shed deliberately requested coffee and rolls for nine oclock so that she could be dressed and ready to go when they were delivered now shed have to rush to make certain she had a couple of solid hours with hunter before checkout time she wasnt going to miss an opportunity twice impatient with herself she went to the door drew off the chain and pulled it open you might as well eat nothing if you think you can subsist on a couple of pieces of bread and some jam before she could recover hunter swooped by her carrying her breakfast tray and an intelligent woman never answers the door without asking whos on the other side setting the tray on the table he turned to pin her with one of his long intrusive stares she looked younger without the gloss of makeup and careful style the traces of fragility hed already sensed had no patina of sophistication over them now though her robe was silk and the sapphire color flattering he felt a flare of desire and a simultaneous protective twinge neither could completely deaden his anger she wasnt about to let him know how stunned she was to see him or how disturbed she was that he was here alone with her when she was all but naked first a chauffeur now a waiter she said coolly unsmiling youre a man of many talents hunter i could return the compliment because he knew just how volatile his temper could be he poured a cup of coffee since one of the first requirements of a fiction writer is that he be a good liar youre well on your way he gestured to a chair putting lee uncomfortably in the position of visitor as though she werent the least concerned she crossed the room and seated herself at the table id ask you to join me but theres only one cup she broke a croissant in two and nibbled on it unbuttered youre welcome to a roll with a steady hand she added cream to the coffee perhaps youd like to explain what you mean about my being a good liar i suppose its a requirement of a reporter as well hunter saw her fingers tense on the flaky bit of bread then relax one by one no lee took another bite of her roll as if her stomach hadnt just sunk to her knees reporters deal in fact not fiction he said nothing but the silent look demanded more of her than a dozen words would have taking her time determined not to fumble again she sipped at her coffee i dont remember mentioning that i was a reporter no you didnt mention it he caught her wrist as she set down the cup the grip of his fingers told her immediately just how angry he was you quite deliberately didnt mention it with a jerk of her head she tossed the hair out of her eyes if shed lost she wouldnt go down groveling it wasnt required that i tell you ignoring the fact that he held one of her hands prisoner lee picked up her croissant with the other and took a bite i paid my registration fee and pretended to be something youre not she met his gaze without flinching apparently we both pretended to be something we werent right from the start he lilted his head at her reference to their initial meeting i didnt want anything from you you on the other hand went beyond the harmless in your deception she didnt like the way it sounded when he said it so petty so dirty and so true if his fingers hadnt been biting into her wrist she might have found herself apologizing instead lee held her ground i have a perfect right to be here and a perfect right to try to sell an article on any facet of this conference and i he said so mildly her flesh chilled have a perfect right to my privacy to the choice of speaking to a reporter or refusing to speak to one if id told you that i was on staff at celebrity she threw back making her first attempt to free her arm would you have spoken to me at all he still held her wrist he still held her eyes for several long seconds he said nothing thats something neither of us will ever know now he released her wrist so abruptly her arm dropped to the table clattering the cup lee found that shed squeezed the flaky pastry into an unpalatable ball he frightened her there was no use denying it even to herself the force of his anger so finely restrained had tiny shocks of cold moving up and down her back she didnt know him or understand him nor did she have any way of being certain of what he might do there was violence in his books therefore there was violence in his mind clinging to her composure she lifted her coffee again drank and tasted absolutely nothing im curious to know how you found out good her voice was calm unhurried she took the cup in both hands to cover the one quick tremor she couldnt control she looked like a kitten backed into a corner hunter observed ready to spit and scratch even though her heart was pounding hard enough to be almost audible he didnt want to respect her for it when hed rather strangle her he didnt want to feel a strong urge to touch the pale skin of her cheek being deceived by a woman was perhaps the only thing that still had the power to bring him to this degree of rage oddly enough i took an interest in you lenore last night he saw her stiffen and felt a certain satisfaction no he wasnt going to let her forget that any more than he could forget it himself last night he repeated slowly waiting until her gaze lifted to his again i wanted to make love with you i wanted to get beneath the careful layer of polish and discover you when i had youd have looked as you do now soft fragile with your mouth naked and your eyes clouded her bones were already melting her skin already heating and it was only words he didnt touch her didnt attempt to but the sound of his voice flowed over her skin like the gentlest of caresses i dont i had no intention of letting you make love to me i dont believe in making love to a woman only with his eyes never left hers she could feel her head begin to swim with passion her breath tremble with it only with hunter repeated when you left i turned to the next best way of discovering you lee gripped her hand together in her lap knowing she had to control the shudders how could a man have such power and how could she fight it why did she feel as though they were already lovers was it just the sense of inevitability that they would be no matter what her choice i dont know what you mean her voice was no longer calm your manuscript uncomprehending she stared shed completely forgotten it the night before in her fear of him and of herself anger and frustration had prevented her from remembering it that morning now on top of a dazed desire she felt the helplessness of a novice confronted by the master i never intended for you to read it she began without thinking she was shredding her napkin in her lap i dont have any aspirations toward being a novelist then youre a fool as well as a liar all sense of helplessness fled no one no one in all of her memory had ever spoken to her like that im neither a fool nor a liar hunter what i am is an excellent reporter i want to write an exclusive indepth and accurate article on you for our readers why do you waste your time writing gossip when youve got a novel to finish she went rigid the eyes that had been clouded with confused desire became frosty i dont write gossip you can gloss over it you can write it with style and intelligence but its still gossip before lee could retort he rose up so quickly so furiously her own words were swallowed youve no right working forty hours a week on anything but the novel you have inside you talents a twoheaded coin lenore and the other sides obligation i dont know what youre talking about she rose too and found she could shout just as effectively as he i know my obligations and one of thems to write a story on you for my magazine and what about the novel flinging up her hands she whirled away from him what about it when do you intend to finish it finish it she should never have started it hadnt she told herself that a dozen times damn it hunter its a pipe dream its good she turned back her brows still drawn together with anger but the eyes beneath them suddenly wary what if it hadnt been your camouflage would have worked very well he drew out a cigarette while she stared at him how could he be so patient move so slowly when she was ready to jump at every word i nearly called you last night to see if you had any more with you but decided it would keep i called my editor instead still calm he blew out smoke when i gave the chapters to her to read she recognized your name apparently shes quite a fan of celebrity you gave her astonished lee dropped into the chair again you had no right to show anyone at the time i fully believed you were precisely what youd led me to believe you were she stood again then gripped the back of her chair im a reporter not a novelist id like you to get the manuscript from her and return it to me he tapped his cigarette in an ashtray only then noticing her neatly written notes as he skimmed them hunter felt twin surges of amusement and annoyance so she was trying to put him into a few tidy little slots shed find it more difficult than shed imagined why should i do that because it belongs to me you had no right to give it to anyone else what are you afraid of he demanded of failure the words were almost out before lee managed to bite them back im not afraid of anything i do what im best at and i intend to continue doing it what are you afraid of she retorted what are you hiding from she didnt like the look in his eyes when he turned his head toward her again it wasnt anger she saw there nor was it arrogance but something beyond both i do what i do best lenore when hed come into the room he hadnt planned to do any more than rake her to the bone for her deception and berate her for wasting her talent now as he watched her hunter began to think there was a better way to do that and at the same time learn more about her for his own purposes he was a long way from finished with lenore radcliffe just how important is doing a story on me to you alerted by the change in tone lee studied him cautiously shed tried everything else she decided abruptly perhaps she could appeal to his ego its very important ive been trying to learn something about you for over three months youre one of the most popular and critically acclaimed writers of the decade if you he cut her off by merely lifting a hand if i decided to give you an interview wed have to spend a great deal of time together and under my terms lee heard the little warning bell but ignored it she could almost taste success we can hash out the terms beforehand i keep my word hunter i dont doubt that once its given crushing out his cigarette hunter considered the angles perhaps he was asking for trouble then again he hadnt asked for any in quite some time he was due how much more of the manuscript do you have completed that has nothing to do with this when he merely lifted a brow and stared she clenched her teeth humor him lee told herself youre too close now about two hundred pages send the rest to my editor he gave her a mild look im sure you have her name by now what does that have to do with the interview its one of the terms hunter told her easily ive plans for the week after next he continued you can join me with another copy of your manuscript join you where for two weeks ill be camping in oak creek canyon youd better buy some sturdy shoes camping she had visions of tents and mosquitoes if youre not leaving for your vacation right away why cant we set up the interview a day or two before terms he reminded her my terms youre trying to make this difficult yes he smiled then just a hint of amusement around his sculpted mouth youll work for your exclusive lenore all right her chin came up where should i meet you and when now he smiled fully appreciating determination when he saw it in sedona ill contact you when im certain of the date and when my editors let me know shes received the rest of your manuscript i hardly see why youre using that to blackmail me he crossed to her then unexpectedly combing his fingers through her hair it was casual friendly and uncannily intimate perhaps one of the first things you should know about me is im eccentric if a people accepts their own eccentricities they can justify anything they do anything at all he ended the words by closing his mouth over hers he heard her suck in her breath felt her stiffen but she didnt struggle away perhaps she was testing herself though he didnt think she could know she tested him too he wanted to carry her to the rumpled bed slip off that thin swirl of silk and fit his body to hers it would fit somehow he already knew shed move with him for him as if theyd always been lovers he knew though he couldnt explain he could feel her melting into him her lips growing warm and moist from his they were alone and the need was like iron yet he knew without understanding that if they made love now sated that need hed never see her again they both had fears to face before they became lovers and after hunter gave himself the pleasure of one long last kiss drawing her taste into him allowing himself to be overwhelmed just for a moment by the feel of her against him then he forced himself to level forced himself to remember that they each wanted something from the other secrets and an intimacy both would put into words in their own ways drawing back he let his hands linger only a moment on the curve of her cheek the softness of her hair while she said nothing if you can get through two weeks in the canyon youll have your story leaving her with that he turned and strolled out the door if i can make it through two weeks lee muttered pulling a heavy sweater out of her drawer i tell you bryan ive never met anyone who says as little who can irritate me as much ten days back in la hadnt dulled her fury bryan fingered the soft wool of the sweater lee dont you have any grubaround clothes i bought some sweatshirts she said under her breath i havent spent a great deal of my time in a tent advice before another pair of the trim slacks could be packed into the knapsack lee had borrowed from her bryan took her hand lee lifted one thin coppery brow you know i detest advice grinning bryan dropped down on the bed i know thats why i can never resist dishing it out lee really i know you have a pair of jeans ive seen you wear them she brushed at the hair that escaped her braid designer or not take jeans not seventyfivedollar slacks invest in another pair or two she went on while lee frowned down at the clothes still in her free hand put that gorgeous wool sweater back in your drawer and pick up a couple of flannel shirts thatll take care of the nights if it turns cool now because lee was listening with a frown of concentration she continued put in some tshirts blouses are for the office not for hiking take at least one pair of shorts and invest in some good thick socks if you had more time id tell you to break in those new hiking boots because theyre going to make you suffer the salesman said theres nothing wrong with them lee except theyve never been out of the box face it she stretched back among lees collection of pillows youve been too concerned about packing enough paper and pencils to worry about gear if you dont want to make an ass of yourself listen to momma with a quick hiss of breath lee replaced the sweater ive already made an ass of myself several times she slammed one of her dresser drawers hes not going to get the best of me during these next two weeks bryan if i have to sleep out in a tent and climb rocks to get this story then ill do it if you tried real hard you could have fun at the same time im not looking for fun im looking for an exclusive were friends though it was a statement not a question lee glanced over yes for the first time since shed begun packing she smiled were friends then tell me what it is that bothers you about this guy youve been ready to chew your nails for over a week though she spoke lightly the concern leaked through you wanted to interview hunter brown and youre going to interview hunter brown how come you look like youre preparing for war because thats how i feel with anyone else lee would have evaded the question or turned cold because it was bryan she sat on the edge of the bed twisting a newly purchased sweatshirt in her hands he makes me want what i dont want to want feel what i dont want to feel bryan i dont have room in my life for complications who does i know exactly where im going lee insisted a bit too vehemently i know exactly how to get there somehow i have a feeling that hunters a detour sometimes a detour is more interesting than a planned route and you get to the same place eventually he looks at me as though he knows what im thinking more as if he knows what i thought yesterday or last year its not comfortable youve never looked for the comfortable bryan stated pillowing her head on her folded arms youve always looked for a challenge youve just never found one in a man before i dont want one in a man violently lee stuffed the sweatshirt into the knapsack i want them in my work you dont have to go lee lifted her head im going then dont go with your teeth gritted crossing her legs under her bryan sat up she was as rumpled as lee was tidy but seemed oddly suited to the luxurious pile of pillows around her this is a tremendous opportunity for you professionally and personally oak creeks one of the most beautiful canyons in the country youll have two weeks to be part of it theres a man who doesnt bore or cater to you she grinned at lees arch look you know damn well they do one or the other and you cant abide it enjoy the change of scene im going to work lee reminded her not to pick wildflowers pick a few anyway youll still get your story and make hunter brown squirm bryan gave her throaty laugh tossing a pillow into the air if thats what youre set on doing youll do it id feel sorry for the guy if he hadnt given me nightmares after a quick grimace her look softened into one of affection and lee she laid her hand over her friends if he makes you want something take it life isnt crowded with offers give yourself a present lee sat silently for a moment then sighed im not sure if id be giving myself a present or a curse rising she went to her dresser how many pairs of socks but is she pretty sarah sat in the middle of the rug one leg bent toward her while she tried valiantly to hook the other behind her neck really pretty hunter dug into the basket of laundry sarah had scrupulously reminded him it was his turn to sort and fold i wouldnt use the word pretty a carefully arranged basket of fruits pretty sarah giggled then rolled and arched into a back bend she liked nothing better than talking with her father because no one else talked like him what word would you use then hunter folded a tshirt with the name of a popular rock band glittered across it she has a rare classic beauty that a lot of women wouldnt know precisely what to do with but she does he remembered he wanted she does sarah laid down on her back to snuggle with the dog that stretched out beside her she liked the soft warm feel of santanass fur in much the same way she liked to close her eyes and listen to her fathers voice she tried to fool you sarah reminded him you dont like it when people try to fool you to her way of thinking she was doing her job with one hand on the dogs neck sarah looked up at her father with big dark eyes so much like his own you never talk to reporters they dont interest me hunter came upon a pair of jeans with a widening hole in the knee arent these new sort of so why are you taking her camping with you sort of new shouldnt have holes already and im not taking her shes coming with me digging in her pocket she came up with a stick of gum she wasnt supposed to chew any because of her braces so she fondled the wrapped piece instead in six months sarah thought she was going to chew a dozen pieces all at once because shes a reporter or because she has a rare classic beauty hunter glanced down to see his daughters eyes laughing at him she was entirely too clever he decided and threw a pair of rolled socks at her both but mostly because i find her interesting and talented i want to see how much i can find out about her while shes trying to find out about me youll find out more sarah declared idly tossing the socks up in the air you always do i think its a good idea she added after a moment aunt bonnie says you dont see enough women especially women who challenge your mind aunt bonnie thinks in couples maybe shell incite your simmering passion hunters hand paused on its way to the basket what i read it in a book expertly she rolled so that her feet touched the floor behind her head this man met this woman and they didnt like each other at first but there was this strong physical attraction and this growing desire and i get the picture hunter looked down at the slim darkhaired girl on the floor she was his daughter he thought she was ten how in gods name had they gotten involved in the subject of passion you of all people should know that things dont often happen in real life the way they do in books fictions based on reality sarah grinned pleased to throw one of his own quotes back at him but before you do fall in love with her or have too much simmering passion i want to meet her ill keep that in mind still watching her hunter held up three unmatched socks just how does this happen every week sarah considered the socks a moment then sat up i think theres a parallel universe in the dryer on the other side of the door at this very minute someone else is holding up three unmatched socks an interesting theory reaching down hunter grabbed her as sarahs laughter bounced off the lofted ceiling he dropped her bottom first into the basket chapter contents prev next it was like every western shed ever seen with the sun bright in her eyes lee could almost see outlaws outrunning posses and indians hiding in wait behind rocks and buttes if she let her imagination go she could almost hear the hoofbeats ring against the rockhard ground because she was alone in the car she could let her imagination go the rich red mountains rose up into a painfully blue sky there was a vastness that was almost outrageous in scope with no lushness with no need for any with no patience for any it made her throat dry and her heart thud there was green the silvery green of sage clinging to the red rocky soil and the deeper hue of junipers which would give way to a sudden seemingly planned sparseness yet the sparseness was rich in itself the space the overwhelming space left her stunned and humble and oddly hungry for more everywhere there were more rocky ridges more color more lee shook her head just more even when she came closer to town the houses and buildings couldnt compete with the openness stop signs streetlights flower gardens were inconsequential her car joined more cars but five times the number would still have been insignificant it was a view you drank in she thought but its taste was hot and packed a punch she liked sedona immediately its tidy western flavor suited the fabulous backdrop instead of marring it she hadnt been sure anything could the main street was lined with shops with neat signs and clean plate glass she noticed lots of wood lots of bargains and absolutely no sense of urgency sedona clung to the aura of town rather than city it seemed comfortable with itself and with the spectacular spread of sky perhaps lee mused as she followed the directions to the rentalcar dropoff just perhaps shed enjoy the next two weeks after all since she was early for her arranged meeting time with hunter even after dealing with the paperwork on her rental car lee decided she could afford to indulge herself playing tourist she had nearly an hour to vacation before work began again the liquid silver necklaces and turquoise earrings in the shop windows tempted her but she moved past them thered be plenty of opportunities after this little adventure for something frivolous as a reward for success for now she was only passing time but the scent of fudge drew her slipping inside the little shop that claimed to sell the worlds best lee bought a half pound for energy she told herself as the sample melted in her mouth there was no telling what kind of food shed get over the next two weeks hunter had very specifically told her when hed contacted her by phone that hed handle the supplies the fudge lee told herself would be emergency rations besides some of bryans advice had been valid enough there was no use going into this thing thinking shed be miserable and uncomfortable there wasnt any harm getting into the spirit a bit lee decided as she strolled into a westernwear shop if she viewed the next two weeks as a working vacation shed be much better off though she toyed with conch belts for a few minutes lee rejected them they wouldnt suit her any more than the fringed or sequined shirts would perhaps shed pick one up for bryan before heading back to la anything bryan put on suited her lee mused with something closer to a sigh than to envy bryan never had to feel restricted to the tailored the simple or the proper was it a matter of suitability lee wondered or a matter of image with a shrug she ran a fingertip down the shoulder of a short suede jacket image or not shed locked herself into it for too long to change now she didnt want to change in any case lee reminded herself as she wandered through rows and rows of hats she understood lee radcliffe just as she was telling herself shed stay only another minute she set her knapsack at her feet she wasnt particularly athletic lee tried on a dungcolored stetson with a curved brim she wasnt flighty she exchanged the first hat for a smaller one with a spray of feathers in the band what she was was businesslike and downtoearth she dropped a black flatbrimmed hat on her head and studied the result sedate she decided smiling a little practical yes if she were in the market for youre wearing it all wrong before lee could react two strong hands were tilting the hat farther down on her head critically hunter angled it slightly then stepped away yes its the perfect choice for you the contrast with your hair and skin that practical sort of dash taking her shoulders her turned her toward the mirror where both his image and hers looked back at her she saw the way his fingers held her shoulders long and confident she could see how small she looked pressing against him in no more than an instant lee could feel the pleasure she wanted to ignore and the annoyance she had to concentrate on ive no intention of buying it embarrassed she drew the hat off and returned it to the shelf why not ive no need for it a woman who buys only what she needs amusement crossed his face even as anger crossed hers a sexist remark if ive ever heard one hunter continued before she could speak still its a pity you wont buy it it gives you a breezy air of confidence ignoring this lee bent down and picked up her knapsack again i hope i havent kept you waiting long i got into town early and decided to kill some time i saw you wander in here when i drove in even in jeans you walk as though you were wearing a threepiece suit while she tried to work out if that had been a compliment he smiled what kind did you buy what she was still frowning over his comment fudge he glanced down at the bag what kind did you buy caught again lee thought nearly resigned to it some milk chocolate and some rocky road good choice taking her arm he led her through the shop if youre determined to resist the hat we may as well get started she noted the jeep parked at the curb and narrowed her eyes this was certainly the same one hed had in flagstaff have you been staying in arizona he circled the hood leaving her to climb in on her own ive had some business to take care of her reporters sense sharpened research he gave her that odd ghost of a smile a writers always researching he wouldnt tell her yet that his research on lenore radcliffe had led him to some intriguing conclusions you brought a copy of the rest of your manuscript unable to prevent herself lee shot him a look of intense dislike that was one of the conditions so it was easily he backed up then pulled into the thin stream of traffic whats your impression of sedona i can see that the weather and the atmosphere would draw the tourist trade she found it necessary to sit very erect and to look straight ahead the same might be said of maui or the south of france she couldnt stop her lips from curving but turned to look out the side window it has the air of having been here forever with very little change the sense of space is fierce not at all soothing but it pulls you in i suppose it makes me think of the people who first saw it from horseback or the seat of a wagon i imagine some of them would have been compelled to build right away to set up a community so that the vastness didnt overwhelm them and others would have been drawn to the desert or the mountains so that the buildings wouldnt close them in as she nodded it occurred to her that she might fit into the first group and he into the second the road he took narrowed and twisted down he didnt drive sedately but with the air of a man who knew he could negotiate whatever curve was thrown at him lee gripped the door handle determined not to comment on his speed it was like taking the downhill rush of a roller coaster without having had the preparatory uphill climb they whooshed down a rock wall on one side a spiraling drop on the other do you camp often her knuckles were whitening on the handle but though she had to shout to be heard she was satisfied that her voice was calm enough now and again im curious she stopped and cleared her throat as hunter whipped around a snaking turn why camping did the rocks in the sheer wall beside them ever loosen and tumble onto the road she decided it was best not to think about it a man in your position could go anywhere and do anything he chose this is what i chose he pointed out all right why there are times when everyone needs simplicity her foot pressed down on the floorboard as if it were a brake pedal isnt this just one more way you have of avoiding people yes his easy agreement had her turning her head to stare at him he was amused to note that her hand loosened on the handle and that her concentration was on him now rather than the road its also a way of getting away from my work you never get away from writing but there are times you need to get away from the trappings of writing her gaze sharpened though her fingers itched for her notebook lee had faith in her own powers of retention you dont like trappings we dont always like whats necessary oblivious to the speed and the curves now lee tucked one leg under her and turned toward him that attracted him hunter reflected the way shed unconsciously drop that careful shield whenever something challenged her mind that attracted him every bit as much as her cool nineteenthcentury beauty what do you consider trappings as regards your profession the confinement of an office the hum of a machine the paperwork thats unavoidable but interferes with the story flow odd but that was precisely what she needed in order to maintain discipline if you could change it what would you do he smiled again hunter had never known anyone who thought in more basic terms or straighter lines id go back a few centuries to when i could simply travel and tell the story she believed him though he had wealth and fame and critical acclaim lee believed him none of the rest means anything to you does it the glory the admiration whose admiration your readers and the critics he pulled off the road next to a small wooden building that served as a trading post im not indifferent to my readership lenore but to the critics i admire the orderliness of your mind he said and stepped from the jeep it was a good beginning lee thought pleased as she climbed out the passenger side hed already told her more than anyone else knew and the two weeks had barely begun if she could just keep him talking learn enough generalities then she could pin him down on specifics but shed have to pace herself when you were dealing with a master of evasion you had to tread carefully she couldnt afford to relax do we have to check in from behind her back hunter grinned while lee struggled to pull out her knapsack ive already taken care of the paperwork i see her pack was heavy but she told herself shed refuse any offer of assistance and carry it herself a moment later she saw it wouldnt be an issue hunter merely stood aside watching as she wriggled into the shoulder straps so much for chivalry she thought annoyed that he hadnt given her the opportunity to assert her independence she caught the gleam in his eye he read her mind much too easily want me to carry the fudge she closed her fingers firmly over the bag ill manage with his own gear on his back hunter started down a path leaving her no choice but to follow he moved as though hed been walking dirt paths all his life as if perhaps hed cut a few of his own though she felt out of place in her hiking boots lee was determined to keep up and to make it look easy youve camped here before mmmhmm why he stopped turning to fix her with that dark intense stare that always took her breath away you only have to look she did and saw that the walls and peaks of the canyon rose up as if theyd never stop they were a color and texture unique to themselves enhanced by the snatches of green from rough hardy trees and shrubs that seemed to grow out of the rock as she had from the air lee thought of castles and fortresses but without the distance the plane had given her she couldnt be sure whether she was storming the walls or being enveloped by them she was warm the sun was strong even with the shade of trees that grew thickly at this elevation though she saw other people children adults babies carried papoosestyle she felt no sense of crowding its like a painting she realized all at once its as though were walking into a canvas the feeling it gave her was both eerie and irresistible she shifted the pack on her back as she kept pace with hunter i noticed some houses she began i didnt realize people actually lived in the canyon apparently sensing his mind was elsewhere lee lapsed into silence shed done too well to start pushing for now shed follow hunter since he obviously knew where he was going it surprised her that she found the walk pleasant for years her life had been directed by deadlines rush and selfimposed demands if someone had asked her where shed choose to spend two weeks relaxing her mind would have gone blank but when ideas had begun to come roughing it in a canyon in arizona wouldnt have made the top ten shed never have considered that the purity of air and the unimpeded arch of sky would be so appealing to her she heard a quiet musical tinkle that took her several moments to identify the creek lee realized she could smell the water the new sensation gave her a quick thrill her guide and her project continued to move at a steady pace in front of her lee banked down the urge to share her discovery with him hed only think her foolish did she realize how totally out of her element she looked hunter wondered it had taken him only one glance to see that the jeans and the boots she wore were straight out of the box even the tshirt that fit softly over her torso was obviously boutiqueware rather than a departmentstore purchase she looked like a model posing as a camper she smelled expensive exclusive wonderful what kind of woman carried a worn knapsack and wore sapphire studs in her ears as her scent wafted toward him again carried on the breeze hunter reminded himself that he had two weeks to find out whatever notes she would make on him hed be making an equal number on her perhaps both of them would have what they wanted before the time was up perhaps both of them would have cause to regret it he wanted her it had been a long time since hed wanted anything anyone that he didnt already have over the past days hed thought often of her response to that long lingering kiss hed thought of his own response theyd learn about each other over the next two weeks though they each had their own purposes but nothing was free theyd both pay for it the quiet soothed him the towering walls of the canyon soothed him lee saw their ferocity he their tranquility perhaps they each saw what they needed to see for a woman and a reporter you have an amazing capacity for silence the weight of her pack was beginning to take precedence over the novelty of the scenery not once had he asked if she wanted to stop and rest not once had he even bothered to look back to see if she were still behind him she wondered why he didnt feel the hole her eyes were boring into his back you have an amazing capacity for the insulting compliment hunter turned to look at her for the first time since theyd started out there was a thin sheen of perspiration on her brow and her breath came quickly it didnt detract an iota from her cool innate beauty sorry he said but didnt appear to be have i been walking too fast you dont look out of shape despite the ache that ran down the length of her back lee straightened im not out of shape her feet were killing her the sites not much farther reaching down to his hip he lifted the canteen and unscrewed the top its perfect weather for hiking he said mildly midseventies and theres a breeze lee managed to suppress a scowl as she eyed the canteen dont you have a cup it took hunter a moment to realize she was perfectly serious wisely he decided to swallow the chuckle packed away with the china he told her soberly enough ill wait she hooked her hands in the front straps of her knapsack to ease some of the weight suit yourself while lee looked on hunter drank deeply if he sensed her resentment he gave no sign as he capped the canteen again and resumed the walk her throat was all the drier at the thought of water hed done it on purpose she thought while she gritted her teeth did he think shed missed that quick flash of humor in his eyes it was just one more thing to pay him back for when the time came oh she couldnt wait to write the article and expose hunter brown for the arrogant coldhearted demigod hed set himself up to be she wouldnt be surprised if he were walking her in circles just to make her suffer bryan had been all too right about the boots lee had lost count of the number of campsites they passed some occupied and some empty if this was his way of punishing her for not revealing from the start that she worked for celebrity he was certainly doing an elaborate job disgusted exhausted with her legs feeling less like flesh and more like rubber she reached out and grabbed his arm just why when you obviously have a dislike for women and for reporters did you agree to spend two weeks with me dislike women his brows arched my likes and dislikes arent as generalized as that lenore her skin was warm and slightly damp when he curled his fingers around the back of her neck have i given you the impression i dislike you she had to fight the urge to stretch like a cat under his hand i dont care what your personal feelings are toward me this is business for you his fingers squeezed gently bringing her an inch closer im on vacation do you know your mouths every bit as appealing now as it was the first time i saw it i dont want to appeal to you but her voice was breathy i want you to think of me only as a reporter the smile hovered at the edges of his mouth around the corners of his eyes all right he agreed in a minute then he touched his lips to hers as gently as he had the first time and as devastatingly she stood still amazed to feel as intense a swirl of sensation as she had before when he touched her hardly touching her it was as if shed never been kissed before a new discovery a fresh beginning how could it be the weight on her back seemed to vanish the ache in her muscles turned into a deeper richer ache that penetrated to the bone her lips parted though she knew what she invited then his tongue joined with hers slipping into the moistness drinking up her flavor lee felt the urgency scream through her body but he was patient so patient she couldnt know what the patience cost him he hadnt expected pain no woman had ever brought him pain with desire he hadnt expected the need to flame through him like brushfire fast and out of control hunter had a vision with perfect clarity of what it would be like to take her there on the ground under the blazing sun with the canyon circling like castle walls around them and the sky like a cathedral dome but there was too much fear in her he could sense it perhaps there was too much fear in him when they came together it might have the power to topple both their worlds your lips melt against mine lenore he whispered its all but impossible to resist she drew back aroused alarmed and all to aware of how helpless shed been i dont want to repeat myself hunter she managed and i dont want to amuse you with clichés but this is business im a reporter on assignment if were to make it through the next two weeks peacefully itd be wise to remember that i dont know about the peace he countered but well try your rules first suspicious but finding no room to argue lee followed him again they walked out of the sunlight into the dim coolness of a stand of trees the creek was distant but still audible from somewhere to the left came the tinny sound of music from a portable radio closer at hand was the rustling of small animals with a nervous look around lee convinced herself they were nothing more than squirrels and rabbits with the trees closing around them they might have been anywhere the sun filtered through but softly on the rough uneven ground there was a clearing small and snug with a circle of stones surrounding a longdead campfire lee glanced around fighting off the uneasiness somehow she hadnt thought it would be this remote this quiet this alone therere shower and bathroom facilities a few hundred yards east hunter began as he slipped off his pack primitive but adequate the metal cans for trash be sure the lids tightly closed or itll attract animals hows your sense of direction gratefully she slipped out of her own pack and let it drop its fine now if she could just take off the boots and rest her feet good then you can gather some firewood while i set up the tent annoyed with the order she opened her mouth then firmly shut it again with only a slight hiss he wouldnt have any cause to complain about her but as she started to stalk off the rest of his sentence hit home what do you mean the tent he was already unfastening the straps of his pack i prefer sleeping in something in case it rains the tent lee repeated closing in on him as in singular he didnt even spare her a look one tent two sleeping bags she wasnt going to explode she wasnt going to make a scene after taking a deep breath she spoke precisely i dont consider those adequate arrangements he didnt speak for a minute not because he was choosing his words but because the unpacking occupied him more than the conversation if you want to sleep in the open its up to you hunter drew out a slim folded piece of material that looked more like a bed sheet than a tent but when we decide to become lovers the arrangements wont make any difference we didnt come here to be lovers lee snapped back furiously a reporter and an assignment hunter replied mildly two sexless terms they shouldnt have any problem sharing a tent caught in her own logic lee turned and stalked away she wouldnt give him the satisfaction of behaving like a woman hunter lifted his head and watched her storm off through the trees shed make the first move he promised himself suddenly angry by god he wouldnt touch her until she came to him while he set up camp he tried to convince himself it was as easy as it sounded chapter contents prev next two sexless terms lee repeated silently as she scooped up some twigs bastard she thought with grim satisfaction was also a sexless term it suited hunter brown to perfection he had no business treating her like a fool just because shed made a fool of herself already she wasnt going to give an inch shed sleep in the damn sleeping bag in the damn tent for the next thirteen nights without saying another word about it thirteen she thought sending a malicious look over her shoulder hed probably planned that too if he thought she was going to make a scene or curl up outside the tent to sleep in the open to spite him hed be disappointed shed be scrupulously professional unspeakably cooperative and utterly sexless before it was over hed think hed been sharing his tent with a robot but shed know better lee let out one long frustrated breath as she scouted for more sticks shed know there was a man beside her in the night a powerfully sexy impossibly attractive man who could make her blood swim with no more than a look it wouldnt be easy to forget she was a woman over the next two weeks when shed be spending every night with a man who already had her nerves jumping her job wasnt to make herself forget lee reminded herself but to make certain he forgot a challenge that was the best way to look at it it was a challenge she promised herself shed succeed at with her arms full of sticks and twigs lee lifted her chin she felt hot dirty and tired it wasnt an auspicious way to begin a war ignoring the ache she squared her shoulders she might have to sacrifice a round or two but shed win the battle with a dangerous light in her eyes she headed toward camp she had to be grateful his back was to her when she walked into the clearing the tent was smaller much much smaller than shed imagined it was fashioned from tough lightweight material that looked nearly transparent it arched rounded rather than pointed at the peak and low to the ground so low lee noted that shed have to crawl to get inside once in theyd be forced to sleep nearly elbow to elbow then and there she determined to sleep like a rock unmoving the size of the tent preoccupied her so that she didnt notice what hunter was doing until she was almost beside him fresh rage broke out as she dropped her load of wood on the ground just what the hell do you think youre doing unperturbed by the fury in her voice hunter glanced up in one hand he held a large clearplastic bag filled with makeup in the other a flimsy piece of peachcolored material trimmed with ivory lace you did know we were going camping he said mildly not to the beverly wilshire the color she considered the curse of fair skin flooded her cheeks you have no right to go digging around in my things she snatched the teddy out of his hand then balled it in her fist i was unpacking idly he turned the makeup bag over to study it from both sides i thought you knew to bring only necessities while ill admit you have a very subtle experienced way with this sort of thing he gestured with the bag eye shadow and lip gloss are excess baggage around a campfire his voice was infuriatingly friendly his eyes only lightly amused ive seen you without any of it and had no cause to complain you certainly dont have to bother with this on my account you conceited jerk lee snatched the bag out of his hand i dont care if i look like a hag on your account taking the knapsack she stuffed her belongings back inside its my baggage and ill carry it you certainly will you officious son of a she broke off barely just dont tell me how to run my life now now name callings no way to promote good will rising hunter held out a friendly hand truce lee eyed him warily on what terms he grinned thats what i like about you lenore no easy capitulations a truce with as little interference as possible on both sides an amiable business arrangement he saw her relax slightly and couldnt resist the temptation to ruffle her feathers again you wont complain about my coffee and i wont complain when you wear that little scrap of lace to bed she gave him a cool smile as she took his hand im sleeping in my clothes fair enough he gave her hand a quick squeeze im not lets see about that coffee as he often did he left her torn between frustration and amusement when he put his mind to it lee was to discover hunter could make things easier without fuss he had the camp fire burning and the coffee brewing its scent alone was enough to soothe her temper the economical way he went about it made her think more kindly of him there was no point in being at each others throats for the next two weeks she decided as she found a convenient rock to sit on relaxing might be out of the question she mused watching him take clever compact cooking utensils out of the pack but animosity wouldnt help not with a man like hunter he was playing games with her as long as she knew that and avoided the pitfalls shed get what shed come for so far shed allowed him to set the rules and change them at his whim that would have to change lee hooked her hands around a raised knee do you go camping to get away from the pressure hunter didnt look back at her but checked the lantern so they were going to start playing word games already what pressure lee might have sighed if she werent so determined to be pleasantly professional there must be pressures from all sides in your line of work demands from your publisher disagreements with your editor a story that just wont gel the way you want it to deadlines i dont believe in deadlines there was something lee thought and reached for her note pad but doesnt every writer face deadlines from time to time and cant they be an enormous pressure when the story isnt flowing or youre blocked writers block hunter poured coffee into a metal cup theres no such thing she glanced over for only a second brow raised oh come on hunter some very successful writers have suffered from it even sought professional help there must have been a time in your career when you found yourself up against a wall you push the wall out of the way frowning she accepted the cup he handed her how by working through it he had a jar of powdered milk which she refused if you dont believe in something refuse to believe it exists it doesnt not for you but you write about things that couldnt possibly exist why not she stared at him a dark attractive man sitting on the ground drinking coffee from a metal cup he looked so at ease with himself so relaxed that for a moment she found it difficult to connect him to the man who created stark terror out of words because there arent monsters under the bed or demons in the closet theres demons in every closet he disagreed mildly some better hidden than others youre saying you believe in what you write about every writer believes in what he writes thered be no purpose in it otherwise you think some she didnt want to use the word demon again and her hand moved in frustration as she sought the right phrase some evil force lee chose can actually manipulate people its more accurate to say i dont believe in anything possibilities did his eyes become darker or was it her imagination theres no limit to possibilities lenore his eyes were too dark to read if he was playing with her baiting her she couldnt tell uncomfortable she shifted the topic when you sit down to write a story you craft it spending hours days on the angles and the edges the same way a carpenter builds a cabinet he liked her analogy hunter sipped at the strong black coffee enjoying the taste enjoying the mingled scents of burning wood summer and lees quiet perfume telling a storys an art writings a craft lee felt a quick kick of excitement that was exactly what she was after those concise little quotes that gave an insight into his character do you consider yourself an artist then or a craftsman he drank without hurry noting that lee had barely touched her coffee the eagerness was with her again her pen poised her eyes fixed on his he found he wanted her more when she was like this he wanted to see that eager look on her face for him for the man not the writer he wanted to sense the ripe anticipation lover to lover arms reaching mouth softening if he were writing the script hed keep these two people from fulfilling each others needs for some time yet it was necessary to flesh them out a bit first but the ache told him what he needed carefully he arranged another piece of wood on the fire an artist by birth he said at length a craftsman by choice i know its a standard question she began with a brisk professionalism that made him smile but where do you get your ideas from life she looked over again as he lit a cigarette hunter you cant convince me that the plot for devils due came out of the everyday if you take the everyday twist it add a few maybes you can come up with anything so you take the ordinary twist it and come up with the extraordinary understanding this a bit better she nodded satisfied how much of yourself goes into your characters as much as they need again it was so simply so easily said she knew he meant it exactly do you ever base one of your characters on someone you know from time to time he smiled at her a smile she neither trusted nor understood when i find someone intriguing enough do you ever get tired of writing about other people when youve got a world of characters in your own head its my job thats not an answer im not here to answer questions why are you here he was closer lee hadnt realized hed moved he was sitting just below her obviously relaxed slightly curious in charge to do an interview with a successful awardwinning author an awardwinning author wouldnt make you nervous the pencil was growing damp in her hand she could have cursed in frustration you dont you lie too quickly and not easily at all his hands rested loosely on his knees as he watched her the odd ring he wore glinted dully gold and silver if i were to touch you just touch you right now youd tremble you think too much of yourself she told him but rose i think of you he said so quietly the pad slipped out of her hand unnoticed you make me want i make you nervous he was looking into her again she could almost feel it it should be an interesting combination over the next couple of weeks he wasnt going to intimidate her he wasnt going to make her tremble the sooner you remember im going to be working for the next two weeks the simpler things will be trying to sound haughty nearly worked lee wondered if he heard the slight catch in her voice since youre resigned to working he said easily you can give me a hand starting dinner after tonight well take turns making meals she wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of telling him she knew nothing about cooking over a fire he already knew neither would she give the satisfaction of being confused by his mercurial mood changes instead lee brushed at her bangs im going to wash up first hunter watched her start off in the wrong direction but said nothing shed find the shower facilities sooner or later he figured things would be more interesting if neither of them gave the other an inch he wasnt sure but hunter thought he heard lee swear from somewhere behind him smiling a little he leaned back against the rock and finished his cigarette groggy stiff and sniffing the scent of coffee in the air lee woke she knew exactly where she was as far over on her side of the tent as she could get deep into the sleeping bag hunter had provided for her and alone it took her only seconds to sense that hunter no longer shared the tent with her just as it had taken her hours the night before to convince herself it didnt matter that he was only inches away dinner had been surprisingly easy easy lee realized as she stared at the ceiling of the tent because hunters mood had shifted again when shed returned to help him fix it amiable no she decided cautiously stretching her cramped muscles amiable was too free a word when applied to hunter moderately friendly was more suitable cooperative he hadnt been at all hed spent the evening hours reading by the light of his lamp while shed taken out a fresh note pad and begun what would be a journal on her two weeks in oak creek canyon she found it helpful to write down her feelings lee had often used her manuscript in much the same fashion she could say what she wanted feel what she wanted without ever taking the risk that anyone would read her words perhaps it hadnt worked out precisely that way with her book since hunter had read more of her neat doublespaced typing under the steady lamplight but the journal would be for no ones eyes but her own in any case she thought it was to her advantage that hed been occupied with her manuscript she hadnt had to talk to him as the night had grown later the darkness deeper while hed still been reading shed been able to crawl into the tent and squeeze herself into a corner when hed joined her much later it hadnt been necessary to exchange words in the intimacy of the tent shed made certain hed thought her asleep though sleep hadnt come for hours in the quiet shed listened to him breathe beside her quiet steady that was the kind of man he was lee had lain still telling herself the closeness meant nothing but this morning she saw that her nails which had begun to grow again had been gnawed down the first night was bound to be the hardest she told herself and sat up dragging a hand through her hair shed survived it her problem now was how to get by him and to the showers where she could change out of the clothes shed slept in and fix her hair and face cautiously she crept forward to peek through the tent flap he knew she was awake hunter had sensed it almost the moment shed opened her eyes hed gotten up early to start coffee knowing if hed had trouble sleeping beside her hed never have been able to handle waking with her hed seen little more than the coppery mass of hair above the sleeping bag in the dim morning light of the tent because hed wanted to touch it draw her to him wake her hed given himself some distance today hed walk for miles and fish for hours lee could stick to her role of reporter and by answering her questions hed learn as much about her as she believed she was learning about him that was his plan hunter reminded himself and poured a second cup of coffee he was better off remembering it coffees hot hunter commented without turning around though shed taken great care to be quiet hed heard lee push the tent flap aside biting back an oath lee scooped up her pack the man had ears like a wolf i want to shower first she mumbled i told you that you didnt have to fix up your face for me he began to arrange strips of bacon in a skillet i like it fine the way it is infuriated lee scrambled to her feet im not fixing anything for you sleeping all night in my clothes tends to make me feel dirty probably sleep better without them hunter agreed mildly breakfasts in fifteen minutes so id move along if i wanted to eat clutching her bag and her dignity lee strode off through the trees he wouldnt get to her so easily if she wasnt stiff and grubby and halfstarved she thought making her way along the path to the showers god knows how he could be so cheerful after spending the night sleeping on the ground maybe bryan had been right all along the man was weird lee took her shampoo and her plastic case of frenchmilled soap and stepped into a shower stall the spot hed chosen might be magnificent the air might smell clean and pure but a sleeping bag wasnt a feather bed lee stripped and hung her clothes over the door she heard the water running in the stall next to hers and sighed for the next two weeks shed be sharing bathroom facilities she might as well get used to it the water came out in a steady gush lukewarm gritting her teeth she stepped under today she was going to begin to dig out a few more personal facts on hunter brown was he married she frowned then deliberately relaxed her features the question was for the article not for herself his marital status meant nothing to her he probably wasnt she soaped her hair vigorously what woman would put up with him besides wouldnt a wife come along on camping trips even if she detested them would that kind of man marry anyone who didnt like precisely what he did what did he do for relaxation besides playing daniel boone in the woods she added with a grim smile where did he live where had he grown up what sort of childhood had he had the water streamed over her sluicing away soap and shampoo the curiosity she felt was purely professional lee found she had to remind herself of that a bit too often she needed the whole man to do an incisive article she needed the whole man alarmed at her own thoughts she opened her eyes wide then swore when shampoo stung them damn the whole man she thought fiercely shed take whatever pieces of him she could get and write an article that would pay him back in spades for all the trouble hed caused her clean fragrant and shivering she turned off the water it wasnt until that moment that lee remembered she hadnt brought a towel campground showers didnt lay in their own linen supply damn it how was she supposed to remember everything dripping her chilled skin covered with gooseflesh she stood in the middle of the stall and swore silently and pungently for as long as she could stand it lee let the air dry her while she squeezed water out of her hair revenge she thought placing the blame squarely on hunters shoulders sooner or later shed have it she reached under the stall door for her pack and pulled out a fresh sweatshirt resigned she dabbed at her wet face with the soft outside once shed dragged it over her damp shoulders she hunted up underwear though her clothes clung to her her skin warmed in front of the line of sinks and mirrors she plugged in her blow dryer and set to work on her hair in spite of him lee thought not because of him she spent more than her usual time perfecting her makeup satisfied she repacked her portable hairdryer and left the showers smelling lightly of jasmine her scent was the first thing he sensed when she stepped back into the clearing hunters stomach muscles tightened as if he were unaffected he finished off another cup of coffee but he didnt taste it calmer and much more at ease now lee stowed her pack before she walked toward the lowburning camp fire on a small shelf of rocks beside it sat the skillet with the remainder of the bacon and eggs she didnt have to taste them to know they were cold feel better hunter asked conversationally i feel fine she wouldnt say one word about the food being cold and lee told herself as she scooped her breakfast onto a plate shed eat every bite shed give him no more cause to smirk at her while she nibbled on the bacon lee glanced over at him hed obviously showered earlier his hair glinted in the sun and he smelled cleanly of soap without the interference of cologne or aftershave a man didnt use aftershave if he didnt bother with a razor lee concluded studying the shadow of stubble over his chin it shouldve made him look unkempt but somehow he managed to look oddly dashing she concentrated on her cold eggs sleep well i slept fine she lied and gratefully washed down her breakfast with strong hot coffee you very well he lied and lit a cigarette she was getting on nerves he hadnt known he had have you been up long since dawn hunter thought long enough he glanced down at her barely scuffed hiking boots and wondered how long it would take before her feet just gave out i plan to do some hiking today she wanted to groan but put on a bright smile fine id like to see some of the canyon while im here preferably in a jeep she thought swallowing the last crumb of bacon if there was one cliché she could now attest to it was that the open air increased the appetite it took lee perhaps half again as long to wash up the breakfast dishes with the plastic water container as it wouldve taken hunter but she already understood the unstated rule one cooks the other cleans by the time she was finished he was standing impatiently binocular and canteen straps crisscrossed over his chest and a light pack in one hand this he shoved at her lee resisted the urge to shove it back at him i want my camera without giving him a chance to complain she dug it out of her own gear and slipped the small rectangle in the back pocket of her jeans whats in here she asked adjusting the strap of the pack over her shoulder lunch lee lengthened her stride to keep up with hunter as he headed out of the clearing if hed packed a lunch shed have to resign herself to a very long day on her feet how do you know where youre going and how to get back for the first time since shed returned to camp smelling like fragility and flowers hunter smiled landmarks the sun do you mean moss growing on one side of a tree she looked around hoping to find some point of reference for herself ive never trusted that sort of thing she wouldnt know east from west either he mused unless they were discussed la and new york ive got a compass if that makes you feel better it did a little when you hadnt the faintest idea how something worked you had to take it on faith lee was far from comfortable putting her faith in hunter but as they walked she forgot to worry about losing her way the sun was a white flash of light and though it was still shy of am the air was warm she liked the way the light hit the red walls of the canyon and deepened the colors the path inclined upward narrow pebbled with loose stones she heard people laugh and the sound carried so cleanly over the air they might have been standing beside her green became sparser as they climbed what she saw now was scrubby bushes dusty and faded that forced their way out of thin ribbons of dirt in the rock curious she broke off a spray of leaves their scent was strong tangy and fresh then she found she had to dash to catch up with hunter it had been his idea to hike but he didnt appear to enjoy it more he looked like a man who had some urgent unpleasant appointment to keep it might be a good time lee considered to start a casual conversation that could lead to the kind of personal information she was shooting for as the path became steadily steeper she decided shed better talk while she had the breath to do it the sweatshirt had been a mistake too her back was damp again this time from sweat have you always preferred the outdoors for hiking undaunted she scowled at his back i suppose you were a boy scout no your interest in camping and hiking is fairly new then no she had to grit her teeth to hold back a groan did you go off and pitch a tent in the woods with your father when you were a boy shed have been interested in the amused expression on his face if she could have seen it no you lived in the city then she was clever hunter reflected and persistent he shrugged yes at last lee thought what city la she tripped over a rock and nearly stumbled headlong into his back hunter never slackened his pace la she repeated you live in los angeles and still manage to bury yourself so that no one knows youre there i grew up in la he said mildly in a part of the city youd have little occasion for visiting socially lenore radcliffe formerly of palm springs wouldnt even know such neighborhoods existed that pulled her up short again she had to dash to catch him but this time she grabbed his arm and made him stop how do you know i came from palm springs he watched her with the tolerant amusement she found both infuriating and irresistible i did my research you graduated from ucla with honors after three years in a very classy swiss boarding school your engagement to jonathan willoby upandcoming plastic surgeon was broken when you accepted a position in celebritys los angeles office i was never engaged to jonathan she began furiously then decisively bit her tongue you have no business probing into my life hunter im doing the article not you i make it a habit to find out everything i can about anyone i do business with we do have a business arrangement dont we lenore he was clever with words she thought grimly but so was she yes and it consists of my interviewing you not the other way around on my terms hunter reminded her i dont talk to anyone unless i know who they are he reached out touching the ends of her hair as hed done once before i think i know who you are you dont she corrected struggling against the need to back away from a touch that was barely a touch and you dont have to but the more honest and open you are with me the more honest the article i write will be he uncapped the canteen when she refused his offer with a shake of her head hunter drank i am being honest with you he secured the cap if i made it easier for you you wouldnt get a true picture of who i am his eyes were suddenly dark intense and piercing without warning he reached out the power in his eyes made her believe he could quite easily sweep her off the path yet his hand skimmed down her cheek light as rain you wouldnt understand what i am he said quietly perhaps for my own reasons i want you to shed have been less frightened if hed shouted at her raged at her grabbed at her the sound of her own heartbeat vibrated in her head instinctively she stepped back escape her first and only thought her foot met empty space in an instant she was caught against him pressed body to body so that the warmth from his seeped right into hers the fear tripled so that she arched back raising both hands to his chest idiot he said with an edge to his voice that made her head snap up take a look behind you before you tell me to let you go automatically she turned her head to look over her shoulder her stomach rose up to her throat then plummeted the hands that had been poised to push him away grabbed his shoulders until the fingers dug into his flesh the view behind her was magnificent sweeping and straight down we we walked farther up than id thought she managed and if she didnt sit down very very soon she was going to disgrace herself the trick is to watch where youre going hunter didnt move her away from the edge but took her chin in his hand until their eyes met and held always watch exactly where youre going then youll know how to fall he kissed her just as unexpectedly as before but not so gently not nearly so gently this time she felt the full force of the strength that had been only an undercurrent each other time his mouth had touched hers if shed pitched back and taken that dizzying fall shed have been no more helpless than she was at this moment molded to him supported by him wrapped around him the edge was close inside her behind her lee couldnt tell which would be more fatal but she knew helplessly that either could break her he hadnt meant to touch her just then but the demanding climb up the path hadnt deadened the need hed woken with hed take this much her taste her softness and make it last until she willingly turned to him he wanted the sweetness she tried to gloss over the fragility she tried to deny and he wanted the strength that kept her pushing for more yes he thought he knew her and was very close to understanding her he knew he wanted her slowly very slowly for lingering mouthtomouth both soothed and excited him hunter drew her away her eyes were as clouded as his thoughts her pulse as rapid as his he shifted her until she was close to the cliff wall and away from the drop never step back unless youve looked over your shoulder first he said quietly and dont step forward until youve tested the ground turning he continued up the path leaving her to wonder if hed been speaking of hiking or something entirely different chapter contents prev next lee wrote in her journal on the eighth day of this odd onagain offagain interview i know more about hunter and understand less by turns hes friendly then distant theres an aloof streak in him bound so tightly around his private life that ive found no way through it when i ask about his preference in books he can go on indefinitely apparently he has no real preference except for the written word itself when i ask about his family he just smiles and changes the subject or gives me one of those intense stares and says nothing in either case he keeps a cloak of mystery around his privacy hes possibly the most efficient man ive ever met theres no waste of time no extra movements and infuriating to me never a mistake when it comes to starting a camp fire or cooking a meal such as they are yet hes content to do absolutely nothing for hours at a time hes fastidious the camp looks as if weve been here no more than a half hour rather than a week yet he hasnt shaved in that amount of time the beard should look scruffy but somehow it looks so natural i find myself wondering if he didnt always have one always ive been able to find a category to slip an assignment into an acquaintance into not with hunter in all this time ive found no easy file for him last night we had a heated discussion on sylvia plath and this morning i found him paging through a comic book over coffee when i questioned him on it his answer was that he respected all forms of literature i believed him one of the problems im having on this assignment is that i find myself believing everything he says no matter how contradictory the statement might be to another he makes can a total lack of consistency make someone consistent hes the most complex frustrating fascinating man ive ever known ive yet to find a way of controlling the attraction he holds for me or even the proper label for it is it physical hunters very compelling physically is it intellectual his mind has such odd twists and turns it takes all my effort to follow them either of these i believe i could handle successfully enough over the years ive had to deal professionally with attractive intelligent charismatic men its a challenge certainly but here i have the uncomfortable feeling that im caught in the middle of a silent chess game and have already lost my queen my greatest fear at this moment is that im going to find myself emotionally involved since the first day we walked up the canyon he hasnt touched me i can still remember exactly how i felt exactly what the air smelled like at that moment its foolish overly romantic and absolutely true each night we sleep together in the same tent so close i can feel his breath each morning i wake alone i should be grateful that he isnt making this assignment any more difficult than it already is and yet i find myself waiting to be held by him for over a week ive thought of little else but him the more i learn the more i want to know for myself too much for myself twice ive woken in the middle of the night aching and nearly turned to him now i wonder what would happen if i did if i believed in the spells and forces hunter writes of id think one was on me no ones ever made me want so much feel so much fear so much every night i wonder sometimes lee wrote of the scenery and her feelings about it sometimes she wrote a playbyplay description of the day but most of the time more of the time she wrote of hunter what she put down in her journal had nothing to do with her organized precisely written notes for the article she wouldnt permit it what she didnt understand and what she wouldnt write down in either space was that she was losing sleep and she was having fun though he was cannily evasive on personal details she was gathering information even now barely halfway through the allotted time lee had enough for a solid successful article more she knew than shed expected to gather but she wanted even more for her readers and undeniably for herself i dont see how any selfrespecting fish could be fooled by something like this lee fiddled with the small rubbery fly hunter attached to her line myopic hunter countered bending to choose his own lure fish are notoriously nearsighted i dont believe you clumsily she cast off but this time im going to catch one youll need to get your fly in the water first he glanced down at the line tangled on the bank of the creek before expertly casting his own he wouldnt even offer to help after a week in his company lee had learned not to expect it shed also learned that if she wanted to compete with him in this or in a discussion of eighteenthcentury english literature she had to get into the spirit of things it wasnt simple and it wasnt quick but kneeling lee worked on the tangles until she was back to square one she shot a look at hunter who appeared much too engrossed with the surface of the creek to notice her progress by now lee knew better he saw everything that went on around him whether he looked or not standing a few feet away lee tried again this time her lure landed with a quiet plop hunter saw the rare quick grin break out but said nothing she was hed learned a woman who generally took herself too seriously yet he saw the sweetness beneath and the warmth lee tried to be so frugal with she had a low smoky laugh she didnt use often enough it only made him want to urge it out of her the past week hadnt been easy for her hunter hadnt intended it to be you learned more about people by observing them in difficult situations than at a catered cocktail party he was adding to the layers of the first impression hed had at the airport in flagstaff but he had layers still to go she could unlike most people he knew be comfortable with long spells of silence it appealed to him the more careless he became in his attire and appearance the more meticulous she became in hers it amused him to see her go off every morning and return with her makeup perfected and her hair carefully groomed hunter made sure theyd been mussed a bit by the end of the day hiking fishing hunter had seen to it that her jeans and boots were thoroughly broken in often in the evening hed caught her rubbing her tired feet when she was back in los angeles sitting in her cozy office she wouldnt forget the two weeks shed spent in oak creek canyon now lee stood near the edge of the creek a fishing rod held in both hands a look of smug concentration on her face he liked her for it for her innate need to compete and for the vulnerability beneath the confidence shed stand there holding the rod until he called a halt to the venture back in camp he knew shed rub her hands with cream and they would smell lightly of jasmine and stay temptingly soft since it was her turn to cook shed do it though she still fumbled a bit with the utensils and managed to singe almost anything she put on the fire he liked her for that too for the fact that she never gave up on anything her curiosity remained unflagging shed question him and hed evade or answer as he chose then shed grant him silence to read while she wrote comfortable hunter found that she was an unusually comfortable woman in the quiet light of a camp fire whether she knew it or not she relaxed then writing in the journal which intrigued him or going over her daily notes for the article which didnt hed expected to learn about her during the two weeks together knowing hed have to give some information on himself in return that he considered was an even enough exchange but he hadnt expected to enjoy her companionship the sun was strong the air almost still with an early morning taste to it but the sky wasnt clear hunter wondered if shed noticed the bank of clouds to the east and if she realized thered be a storm by nightfall the clouds held lightning he simply sat crosslegged on the ground itd be more interesting if lee found out for herself the morning passed in silence but for the occasional voice from around them or the rustle of leaves twice hunter pulled a trout out of the creek throwing the second back because of size he said nothing lee said nothing but barely prevented herself from grinding her teeth on every jaunt hed gone back to camp with fish shed gone back with a sore neck i begin to wonder she said at length if youve put something on that lure that chases fish away hed been smoking lazily and now stirred himself to crush out the cigarette want to change rods she slanted him a look taking in the slight amusement in his arresting face when her muscles quivered lee stiffened them would she never become completely accustomed to the way her body reacted when they looked at each other no she said coolly ill keep this one youre rather good at this sort of thing for a boy who didnt go fishing ive always been a quick study what did your father do in la lee asked knowing he would either answer in the most offhand way or evade completely he sold shoes it took a moment as shed been expecting the latter sold shoes thats right in the shoe department of a moderately successful department store downtown my mother sold stationery on the third floor he didnt have to look at her to know she was frowning her brows drawn together surprised yes she admitted a bit i suppose i imagined youd been influenced by your parents to some extent and that theyd had some unusual career or interests hunter cast off again with an agile flick of his wrist before my father sold shoes he sold tickets at the local theater before that it was linoleum i think his shoulders moved slightly before he turned to her he was a man trapped by financial circumstances into working when hed been born to dream if hed been born into affluence he mightve been a painter or a poet as it was he sold things and regularly lost his job because he wasnt suited to selling anything not even himself though he spoke casually lee had to struggle to distance herself emotionally you speak as though hes not living ive always believed my mother died from overwork and my father from lack of interest in life without her sympathy welled up in her throat she couldnt swallow at all when did you lose them i was eighteen they died within six months of each other too old for the state to care for you she murmured too young to be alone touched hunter studied her profile dont feel sorry for me lenore i managed very well but you werent a man yet or no she mused perhaps he had been you had college to face i had some help and i waited tables for a while lee remembered the wallet full of credit cards shed carried through college anything shed wanted had always been at her fingertips it couldnt have been easy it didnt have to be he lit a cigarette watching the clouds move slowly closer by the tune i was finished with college i knew i was a writer what happened from the time you graduated from college to when your first book was published he smiled through the smoke that drifted between them i lived i wrote i went fishing when i could she wasnt about to be put off so easily hardly realizing she did it lee sat down on the ground beside him you mustve worked writing though many disagree is work he had a talent for making the sharpest sarcasm sound mildly droll another time she might have smiled you know thats not what i mean you had to have an income and your first book wasnt published until nearly six years ago i wasnt starving in a garret lenore he ran a finger down the hand she held on the rod and felt a flash of pleasure at the quick skip of her pulse youd just have been starting at celebrity when the devils due hit the stands one might say our stars were on the rise at the same time i suppose she turned from him to look back at the surface of the creek again youre happy there unconsciously she lifted her chin ive worked my way up from gofer to staff reporter in five years thats not an answer neither are most of yours she mumbled true enough whatre you looking for there success she said immediately security one doesnt always equal the other her voice was as defiant as the look she aimed at him you have both a writers never secure hunter disagreed only a foolish one expects to be ive read all of the manuscript you brought lee said nothing shed known hed bring it up before the two weeks were over but shed hoped to put it off a bit longer the faintest of breezes played with the ends of her hair while she sat staring at the moving waters of the creek some of the pebbles looked like gems such were illusions you know you have to finish it he told her calmly you cant make me believe youre content to leave your characters in limbo when youve drawn them so carefully your storys twothirds told lenore i dont have time she began not good enough frustrated she turned to him again easy for you to say from your little pinnacle of fame i have a demanding fulltime job if i give it my time and my talent theres no place i can go but up at celebrity your novel needs your time and talent she didnt like the way he said it as if she had no real choice hunter i didnt come here to discuss my work but you and yours im flattered that you think my novel has some merit but i have a job to do flattered he countered the deep black gaze pinned her again and his hand closed over hers no youre not you wish id never seen your novel and you dont want to discuss it even if you were convinced it was worthwhile youd still be afraid to put it all on the line the truth grated on her nerves and on her temper my job is my first priority whether that suits you or not doesnt matter its none of your business no perhaps not he said slowly watching her youve got a fish on your line i dont want you to eyes narrowing she broke off what theres a fish on your line he repeated youd better reel it in ive got one stunned lee felt the rod jerk in her hands ive got one oh god she gripped the rod in both hands again and watched the line jiggle ive really caught one what do i do now reel it in hunter suggested again leaning back on the grass arent you going to help her hands felt foolishly clumsy as she started to crank the reel hoping leverage would give her some advantage she scrambled to her feet hunter i dont know what im doing i might lose it your fish he pointed out grinning he watched her would she look any more exuberant if shed been given an interview with the president somehow hunter didnt think so though he was sure lee would disagree but then she couldnt see herself at that moment hair mussed cheeks glowing eyes wide and her tongue caught firmly between her teeth the latemorning sunlight did exquisite things to her skin and the quick laugh she gave when she pulled the struggling fish from the water ran over the back of his neck like soft fingers desire moved lazily through him as he took his gaze up the long length of leg flattered by brief shorts then over the subtle curves accented by the shifting of muscle under her shirt as she continued to fight with the fish to her face still flushed with surprise hunter she laughed as she held the still wriggling fish high over the grass i did it it was nearly as big as the largest one hed caught that week he pursed his lips as he sized it up it was tempting to compliment her but he decided she looked smug enough already gotta get it off the hook he reminded her shifting only slightly on his elbows off the hook lee shot him an astonished look i dont want to touch it you have to touch it to take it off the hook lee lifted a brow ill just toss it back in with a shrug hunter shut his eyes and enjoyed the faint breeze the hell she would your fish not mine torn between an abhorrence of touching the stillflopping fish and pride at having caught it lee stared down at hunter he wasnt going to help that was painfully obvious if she threw the fish back into the water hed smirk at her for the rest of the evening intolerable and she reasoned logically wouldnt she still have to touch it to get rid of it setting her teeth lee reached out a hand for the catch of the day it was wet slippery and cold she pulled her hand back then out of the corner of her eye she saw hunter grinning up at her holding her breath lee took the trout firmly in one hand and wiggled the hook out with the other if he hadnt been looking at her challenging her she never wouldve managed it with the haughtiest air at her disposal she dropped the trout into the small cooler hunter brought along on fishing trips very good he closed the lid on the cooler before he reeled in his line that looks like enough for tonights dinner you caught a goodsized one lenore thank you the words were icily polite and selfsatisfied itll nearly be enough for both of us even after youve cleaned it its as big as he was already walking back toward camp so that she had to run to catch up with him and his statement i clean it rule is you catch you clean she planted her feet but he wasnt paying attention im not cleaning any fish then you dont eat any fish his words were as offhand and careless as a shrug abandoning pride lee caught at his arm hunter youll have to change the rule she sighed but convinced herself she wouldnt choke on the word at least not very much please he stopped considering if i clean it youve got to balance the scales the smile flickered over his face no pun intended by doing me a favor i can cook two nights in a row i said a favor her head turned sharply but one look at his face had her laughing all right whats the deal why dont we leave it openended he suggested i dont have anything in mind at the moment this time she considered itll be negotiable naturally deal turning her palms up lee wrinkled her nose now im going to wash my hands she hadnt realized she could get such a kick out of catching a fish or out of cooking it herself over an open fire there were other things lee didnt realize she hadnt looked at the trim gold watch on her wrist in days if she hadnt kept a journal she probably wouldnt know what day it was it was true that her muscles still revolted after a night in the tent and the shower facilities were an inconvenience at best purgatory at worst but despite herself she was relaxing for the first time in her memory her day wasnt regimented by herself or by anyone else she got up when she woke slept when she was tired and ate when she was hungry for the moment the word deadline didnt exist that was something she hadnt allowed herself since the day shed walked out of her parents home in palm springs no matter how rapid hunter could make her pulse by one of those unexpected looks or how much desire for him simmered under the surface she found him comfortable to be with because it was so unlikely lee didnt try to find the reasons on this late afternoon in the hour before dusk she was content to sit by the fire and tend supper i never knew anything could smell so good hunter continued to pour a cup of coffee before he glanced over at her we cooked fish two days ago your fish lee pointed out carefully turning the trout this ones mine he grinned wondering if she remembered just how horrified shed been the first time hed suggested she pick up a rod and reel beginners luck lee opened her mouth ready with a biting retort then saw the way he smiled at her not only did her retort vanish but so did much of her defensive wall she let out a long quiet breath as she turned back to the skillet the man became only more dangerous with familiarity if fishing depends on luck she managed youve had more than your share everything depends on luck he held out two plates lee slipped the sizzling trout onto them then sat back to enjoy if you believe that what about fate youve said more than once that we can fight against our fate but we cant win he lifted a brow that consistently sharp consistently logical mind of hers never failed to impress him one works with the other he tasted a bit of trout noting that shed been careful enough not to singe her own catch its your fate to be here with me you were lucky enough to catch a fish for dinner it sounds to me as though you twist things to your own point of view yes doesnt everyone i suppose lee ate thoughtfully studying the view over his shoulder had anything ever tasted this wonderful would anything ever again but not everyone makes it work as well as you reluctantly she accepted some of the dried fruit he offered he seemed to have an unending supply but lee had yet to grow used to the taste or texture if you could change one thing about your life what would it be perhaps because hed asked without preamble perhaps because she was so unexpectedly relaxed lee answered without thinking id have more he didnt as her parents had done ask more what hunter only nodded we could say its your fate to want it and your luck to have it or not nibbling on an apricot she studied him the lowering light and flickering fire cast his face in shadows they suited him the short rough beard surrounded the poets mouth making it all the more compelling he was a man a woman would never be able to ignore never be able to forget lee wondered if he knew it then she nearly laughed of course he did he knew entirely too much what about you she leaned forward a bit as she did whenever the answer was important what would you change he smiled in the way that made her blood heat id take more he said quietly she felt the shiver race up her spine was all but certain hunter could see it lee found she was compelled to remind herself of her job you know she began easily enough youve told me quite a bit over this week more in some ways than id expected but much less in others steady again she took another bite of trout i might understand you quite a bit better if youd give me a runthrough of a typical day he ate enjoying the tender openair flavor the clouds were rolling in the breeze picking up he wondered if she noticed theres no such thing as a typical day youre evading again yeah its my job to pin you down he watched her over the rim of his coffee cup i like watching you do your job she laughed it seemed he could always frustrate and amuse her at the same time hunter why do i have the feeling youre doing your best to make this difficult for me youre very perceptive setting his plate aside he began to toy with the ends of her hair in a habit she could never take casually i have an image of a woman with a romantic kind of beauty and an orderly logical mind hunter wait im just fleshing her out shes ambitious full of nerves highly sensuous without being fully aware of it he could see her eyes change growing as dark as the sky above them shes caught in the middle of something she cant explain or understand things happen around her and shes finding it more and more difficult to distance herself from it and theres a man a man she desires but cant quite trust he doesnt offer her the logical explanations she wants but the illogic he offers seems terrifyingly close to the truth if she puts her trust in him she has to turn her back on most of what she believes is fact if she doesnt shell be alone he was talking to her about her for her lee knew her throat was dry and her palms damp but she didnt know if it was from his words or the light touch on the ends of her hair youre trying to frighten me by weaving a plot around me im weaving a plot around you hunter agreed whether i frighten you or not depends on how successful i am with that plot shadows and storms are my business as if on cue lightning snaked out in the sky overhead but all writers need a foil smooth pale skin he stroked the back of his hand up her cheek soft hair with touches of gold and fire against that i have darkness wind voices that speak from shadows logic against the impossible the unspeakable against cool polished beauty she swallowed to relieve the dryness in her throat and tried to speak casually i suppose i should be flattered but im not sure i want to see myself molded into a character in a horror story that comes back to fate again doesnt it lightning ripped through the early dusk as their eyes met again i need you lenore he murmured for the tale i have to tell and more nerves prickled along her skin all the more frantically because of the relaxed hours its going to rain but her voice wasnt calm and even her senses were already swimming when she started to rise she found that her hand was caught in his and that he stood with her the wind blew around her stirring leaves stirring desire the light dimmed to shadow thunder rumbled what she saw in his eyes chilled her then heated her blood so quickly she had no way to keep up with the change the grip on her hand was light lee couldve broken the hold if shed had the will to do so it was his look that drained the will from her they stood there hands touching eyes locked while the storm swirled like madness around them perhaps life was made up of the choices hunter had once spoken of perhaps luck swayed the balance but at that moment for hardly more than a heartbeat lee believed that fate ruled everything she was meant to go to him to give to him with no more choice than one of the characters his imagination formed then the sky opened the rain poured out the shock of the sudden drenching had lee jolting back breaking contact yet for several long seconds she stood still while water ran over her and lightning flashed in wicked bolts damn it but he knew she spoke to him not the storm now what am i supposed to do hunter smiled barely resisting the urge to cup her face in his hands and kiss her until her legs gave way head for drier land he continued to smile despite the rain the wind the lightning wet edgy and angry lee crawled inside the tent hes enjoying this she thought tugging on the sodden laces of her boots theres nothing he likes better than to see me at my worst it would probably take a week for the boots to dry out she thought grimly as she managed to pry the first one off when hunter slipped into the tent beside her she said nothing concentrating on anger seemed the best solution the pounding of the rain on the sides of the tent made the space inside seem to shrink shed never been more aware of him or of herself water dripped uncomfortably down her neck as she leaned forward to pull off her socks i dont suppose thisll last long hunter pulled the sodden shirt over his head i wouldnt count on it stopping much before morning terrific she shivered and wondered how the hell she was supposed to get out of the wet clothes and into dry ones hunter turned the lantern hed carried in with him down to a dim glow relax and listen to it its different from rain in the city theres no swish of tires on wet asphalt no horns no feet running on the sidewalk he took a towel out of his pack and began to dry her hair i can do it she reached up but his hands continued to massage i like to do it wet fire he murmured thats what your hair looks like now he was so close she could smell the rain on him the heat from his body called subtly temptingly to hers was the rain suddenly louder or were her senses more acute for a moment she thought she could hear each individual drop as it hit the tent the light was dim a smoky gray that held touches of unreality lee felt as though shed been running away from this one isolated spot all her life or perhaps shed been running toward it you need to shave she murmured and found that her hand was already reaching out to touch the untrimmed growth of beard on his face this hides too much youre already difficult to know am i he moved the towel over her hair soothing and arousing by turns you know you are she didnt want to turn away now from the look that could infuse such warmth through her chilled damp skin lightning flashed illuminating the tent brilliantly before plunging it back in to gloom yet through the gloom she could see all she needed to perhaps more than she wanted to its my job to find out more to find out everything and my right to tell you only what i want to we just dont look at things the same way no she took the towel and half dreaming began to dry his hair we have no business being together like this he hadnt known desire with claws if he didnt touch her soon hed be ripped through why were too different you look for the unexplainable i look for the logical but his mouth was so near hers and his eyes held such power hunter she knew what was going to happen recognized the impossibility of it and the pain that was bound to follow i dont want this to happen he didnt touch her though he was certain hed soon be mad from the lack of it you have a choice no it was said quietly almost on a sigh i dont think i do she let the towel fall she saw the flicker of lightning and waited six long heartbeats for the answering thunder maybe neither one of us has a choice her breath was already unsteady as she let her hands curl over his bare shoulders there was strength there she wanted to feel it but had been afraid to his eyes never left hers as she touched him though the force of need curled tight in his stomach hed let her set the pace this first time this most important time her fingers were long and smooth on his skin cool not so much hesitant as cautious they ran down his arms moving slowly over his chest and back until desire was taut as a bow poised for firing the sound of the rain drummed in his head her face was pale and elegant in the gloomy light the tent was suddenly too big he wanted her in a space that was too small to move in unless they moved together she could hardly believe she could touch him this way freely openly so that his skin quivered under the trace of her fingers all the while he watched her with a passion so fierce it would have terrified her if she hadnt been so dazed with her own need carefully afraid to make the wrong move and break the mood for both of them she touched her mouth to his the rough brush of beard was a stunning contrast to the softness of his lips he gave back to her such feelings such warmth with no pressure shed never known anyone who could give without taking this generosity was to her the ultimate seduction in that moment any reserve shed clung to was washed away her arms went around his neck her cheek pressed to his make love to me hunter he drew her away only far enough so that they could see each other again wet hair curled around her face her eyes were like the sky had been an hour before dusky and clouded with her lips curved her heart opened he poured inside make love with me then his hands were framing her face and the kiss was so gentle it drugged every cell of her body she felt him tug the wet shirt from her and shivered once before he warmed her his body felt so strong against hers so solid yet his hands played over her with the care of a jeweler polishing a rare gem he sighed when she touched him so she touched once again wanting to give pleasure as it was given to her shed thought the panic would return or at least the need to rush but theyd been given all the time in the world the rain could fall the thunder bellow it didnt involve them she tasted hunger on his lips but he held it in check hed sup slowly pleasure bubbled up inside her and came softly through her lips his mouth on her breast had the need leaping up to the next plane yet he didnt hurry even when she arched against him his tongue flicked his teeth nibbled until he could feel the crazed desire vibrating through her she thought only of him now hunter knew it even as he struggled to hold the reins of his own passion shed have more shed take all and so by god would he when she struggled with the snap of his jeans he let her have her way he wanted to be fleshtoflesh with her bodytobody without barriers in his mind hed already had her bare like this a dozen times her hair was cool and wet her skin smooth and fragrant spring flowers and summer rain the scents raced through him as her hands became more urgent her breathing was ragged as she tugged the wet denim down his legs she recognized strength power and control it was only the last she needed to break so that she could have what she ached for wherever she could reach she touched she tasted wallowing in pleasure each time she heard his breath tremble her shorts were drawn slowly down her body by strong clever hands until she wore nothing but the lacy triangle riding low on her hips with his lips he journeyed down down her body slowly so that the bristle of beard awakened every pore his tongue slid under the lace making her gasp then as abruptly as the storm had broken lee was lost in a morass of sensation too dark too deep to understand he felt her explode and the power sang through him he heard her call his name and the greed to hear it again almost overwhelmed him bracing himself over her hunter held back that final desperate need until she opened her eyes shed look at him when they came together hed promised himself that dazed trembling frenzied lee stared at him he looked invincible what do you want from me his mouth swooped down on hers and for the first time the kiss was hard urgent almost brutal with the force of passion finally unleashed everything he plunged into her catapulting them both closer to the crest everything chapter contents prev next dawn was clear as glass lee woke to it slowly naked warm and for the first time in over a week comfortable and for the first time in over a week she woke not precisely sure where she was her head was pillowed in the curve of hunters shoulder her body turned toward his of its own volition and by the weight of the arm held firmly around her there was a drowsy feeling that was a mix of security and excitement in all of her memory she couldnt recall experiencing anything quite like it before she was fully awake she smelled the lingering fragrance of rain on his skin and remembered in remembering she took a deep drinking breath of the scent it was like a dream like something in some subliminal fantasy or a scene that had come straight from the imagination shed never offered herself to anyone so freely before or so completely never lee knew thered never been anyone whod tempted her to she could still remember the sensation of her lips touching his and all doubt all fear melting away with the gentle contact should she feel so content now that the rain had stopped and dawn was breaking fantasies were for that private hour of the night not for the daylight after all it hadnt been a dream and thered be no pretending it had been perhaps she should be appalled that shed given him exactly what hed demanded everything she couldnt no it was more than that she realized she wouldnt nothing no one would spoil what had happened not even she herself still it might be best if he didnt realize quite yet how completely victorious hed been lee let her eyes close and wrapped the sensation of closeness around her for the next few days there was no desk no typewriter no phone ringing with more demands thered be no selfimposed schedule for the next few days she was alone with her lover maybe the time had come to pick those wildflowers she tilted her head wanting to look at him trying not to wake him over the week theyd spent in such intimate quarters shed never seen him sleep every other morning hed been up already making coffee she wanted the luxury of absorbing him when he was unaware lee knew that most people looked more vulnerable in sleep more innocent perhaps hunter looked just as dangerous just as compelling as ever true those dark intense eyes were hidden but knowing the lids could lift at any moment and the eyes spear you with that peculiar power didnt add innocence to his face only more mystery lee discovered she didnt want it to she was glad he was more dangerous than the other men shed known in an odd way she was glad he was more difficult she hadnt fallen in love with the ordinary the everyday but the unique fallen in love she ran the phrase around in her head taking it apart and putting it back together again with the caution she was prone to it triggered a trickle of unease the phrase itself connoted bruises hadnt hunter himself warned her to test the ground before she started forward even warned she hadnt even seeing the pit she hadnt checked her step the tumble shed taken had a soft fall this time lee knew it was all too possible to stumble and be destroyed she wasnt going to think about it lee allowed herself the luxury of cuddling closer she was going to find those wildflowers and enjoy each individual petal the dream would end soon enough and shed be back to the reality of her life it was of course what she wanted for a while she lay still just listening to the silence the clever thing to do she thought lazily would be to hang their wet clothes out in the sun her boots certainly needed drying out but in the meantime she had her sneakers she yawned thinking she wanted a few moments to write in her journal as well hunters breathing was slow and even a smile curved her lips she could do all that then come back and wake him waking him in whatever way she chose was a lovers privilege lover skimming her gaze over his face again she wondered why she didnt feel any particular surprise at the word was it possible shed recognized it from the beginning foolish she told herself and shook her head slowly she shifted away from him then crawled to the front of the tent to peek out even as she reached for the flap a hand closed around her ankle hunter pillowed his other hand under his head as he watched her if youre going out like that we wont keep everyone away from the campsite for long as she was naked the haughty look she sent him lost something i was just looking out i thought you were asleep he smiled thinking she was the only woman who could make a viable stab at dignity while on her hands and knees in a tent without a stitch on the finger around her ankle stroked absently youre up early i thought id hang these clothes out to dry very practical because he sensed she was feeling awkward hunter sat up and grabbed her arm tugging until she tumbled back sprawled over him content he held her against him and sighed well do it later unsure whether to laugh or complain lee blew the hair out of her eyes as she propped herself on one elbow im not tired you dont have to be tired to lie down then he rolled on top of her its called relaxing as the planes of his body fit against the curves of hers lee felt the warmth seep in a hundred tiny pulse points began to drum i dont think this has a lot to do with relaxing no hed wanted to see her like this in the thin light of dawn with her hair mussed from his hands her skin flushed from sleep her limbs heavy from a night of loving and alert for more he ran a hand down her with a surge of possession that wasnt quite comfortable wasnt quite expected then well relax later too he saw her lips form a gentle smile just before he brushed his over them hunter didnt question that he wanted her just as urgently now as he had all the days and nights before he rarely questioned feelings because he trusted them her arms went around him her lips parted the completeness of her giving shot a shaft of heat through him that turned to a unified warmth lifting his head hunter looked down at her milkmaid skin over a duchesss cheekbones eyes like the sky at dusk and hair like copper shot with gold hunter gave himself the pleasure of looking at all of her slowly she was small and sleek and smooth he ran a fingertip along the curve of her shoulder and studied the contrast of his skin against hers fragile delicate but he remembered how much strength there was inside her you always look at me as if you know everything there is to know about me the intensity in his eyes remained as he caught her hand in his not enough not nearly enough with the lightest of touches he kissed her shoulder her temple then her lips hunter she wanted to tell him that no one had ever made her feel this way before she wanted to tell him that no one had ever made her want so badly to believe in magic and fairy tales and the simplicity of love but as she started to speak courage deserted her she was afraid to risk afraid to fail instead she touched a hand to his cheek kiss me again he understood there was something more something he needed to know but he understood too that when something fragile was handled clumsily it broke he did as she asked and savored the warm dark taste of her mouth soft sweet silky it was how he could make her feel with only a kiss the ground was hard and unyielding under the thin tent mattress but it might have been a luxurious pile of feathers it was so easy to forget where she was when he was with her this way to forget a world existed outside that small space two bodies required he could make her float and shed never known shed wanted to he could make her ache and shed never known there could be pleasure from it he spoke against her mouth words she didnt need to understand she wanted and was wanted needed and was needed she loved with an inarticulate murmur of acceptance for whatever he could give lee drew him closer closer the moment was all that mattered deep intoxicating tender the kiss went on and on and on even an imagination as fluid as his hadnt fantasized anything so sweet anything so soft it was as though she melted into him giving everything before he could ask once only once only briefly it sped through his mind that he was as vulnerable as she the unease came flicking at the corner of his mind then her hands ran over him stroking and he accepted the weakness only one other person had ever had the power to reach inside him and hold his heart now there were two the time to deal with it was tomorrow today was for them alone without hurry he whispered kisses over her face perhaps it was a homage to beauty perhaps it was much much more he didnt question his motives as he traced the slope of her cheek there was an immediacy hed never experienced before but it didnt carry the urgency hed expected she was there for him as long as he needed he understood that without words you smell of spring and rain he murmured against her ear why should that drive me mad the words vibrated through her as arousing as the most intimate caress heavylidded clouded her eyes met his just show me show me again he loved her with such generosity each touch was a separate pleasure each kiss a luxurious taste patience there was more patience in him than in her her body was tossed between utter contentment and urgency until reason was something too vague to grasp here he nibbled lightly at her breast listening to and allured by her unsteady breaths youre small and soft here he took his hand over her hip to her thigh youre taut and lean i cant seem to touch enough taste enough he drew the peak of her breast into his mouth so that she arched against him center to center hunter his name was barely audible but the sound of it was enough to bring him to desperation i need you god had he wanted to hear that so badly struggling to understand what those three simple words had triggered he buried his mouth against her skin but he couldnt think only feel only want you have me with his hands and lips alone he took her spiraling over the first peak her movements beneath him grew wild her murmurs frenzied but she was unaware all lee knew was that they were fleshtoflesh this was the storm hed gentled the night before the power unleashed the demands unsoftened the tenderness became passion so quickly she could only ride with it blind to her own power and her own demands she was spinning too fast in the world theyd created to know how hungrily her mouth sought him how sure were her own hands she drew from him everything he drew from her again and again she took him to the edge and again and again he clung wanting more and still more greed hed never known this degree of greed with the blood pounding in his head singing in his veins he molded his open mouth to hers with his hands gripping her hips he rolled until she lay over him they were still mouthtomouth when they joined and her gasp of pleasure rocketed through him strength seemed to build impossibly she thought she could feel each individual muscle of her body coil and release as they moved together power called to power lee remembered the lightning remembered the thunder and lived it again when the storm broke she was clasped against him as if the heat had fused them minutes hours days lee couldnt have measured the time slowly her body settled gradually her heartbeat leveled with her body pressed close to his she could feel each breath he took and found a foolish satisfaction that the rhythm matched her own a pity we wasted a week finding the effort to open his eyes too great hunter kept them closed as he combed his fingers through her hair she smiled a little because he couldnt see wasted if wed started out this way idve slept a lot better really schooling her features lee lifted her head have you had trouble sleeping his eyelids opened lazily ive rarely found it necessary to get up at dawn unless its to write the surge of pleasure made her voice smug she traced a fingertip over his shoulder is that so you insisted on wearing that perfume to make me crazy to make you crazy folding her arms on his chest she arched a brow its a very subtle scent subtle he ran a casual hand over her bottom like a hammer in the solar plexus the laugh nearly escaped you were the one who insisted we share a tent insisted he gave her a mildly amused glance i told you i had no objection if you chose to sleep outside knowing i wouldnt true but i didnt expect you to resist me for so long her head came up off her folded arms resist you she repeated are you saying you plotted this out like a scene in a book grinning he pillowed his arms behind his head god he couldnt remember a time hed felt so clean so complete it worked typical she said wishing she were insulted and trying her best to act as though she were im surprised there was room in here for the two of us and your inflated ego and your stubbornness she sat up at the word both brows disappearing under her tousled bangs i suppose you thought id just her hand gestured in a quick circle fall at your feet hunter considered this a moment while he gave himself the pleasure of memorizing every curve of her body it mightve been nice but id figured a few detours into the scenario oh had you she wondered if he realized he was steadily digging himself into a hole i bet we can come up with a great many more searching in her pack lee found a fresh tshirt starting now as she started to drag the shirt over her head hunter grabbed the hem and yanked lee tumbled down on top of him again to find her mouth captured when he let her surface she narrowed her eyes you think youre pretty clever dont you yeah he caught her chin in his hand and kissed her again lets have breakfast she swallowed a laugh but her eyes gave her away bastard okay but im still hungry he tugged her shirt down her torso before he started to dress lying back lee struggled into a pair of jeans i dont suppose now that the points been made we could finish out this week at a nice resort hunter dug out a fresh pair of socks a resort dont tell me youre having problems roughing it lenore i wouldnt say problems she stuck a hand in one boot and found the inside damp resigned she hunted for her sneakers but there is the matter of having fantasies about a hot tubbath and a soft bed she pressed a hand to her lower back wonderful fantasies camping does take a certain amount of strength and endurance he said easily i suppose if youve reached your limit and want to quit i didnt say anything about quitting she retorted she set her teeth knowing whichever way she went she lost well finish out the damn two weeks she mumbled and crawled out of the tent lee couldnt deny that the quality of the air was exquisite or the clarity of the sky more perfect than any shed ever seen nor if hed asked would she have told hunter that she wanted to be back in los angeles it was a matter of basic creature comforts she thought like soaking in hot fragrant water or stretching out on a firm linencovered mattress certainly it wasnt more than most people wanted in their daytoday lives but then she reflected hunter brown wasnt most people fabulous isnt it his arms came around her waist drawing her back to his chest he wanted her to see what he saw feel what he felt perhaps he wanted it too much its a beautiful spot it hardly seems real then she sighed not entirely sure why would los angeles seem more real to her when this final week was up at the very least she understood the tall buildings and crowded streets here here she seemed so small and that top rung of the ladder seemed so vague and unimportant abruptly she turned and clung to him i hate to admit it but im glad you brought me she found she wanted to continue clinging continue holding so that there wouldnt be a time when she had to let go pushing away all thoughts of tomorrow lee told herself to remember the wildflowers im starving she said able to smile when she drew away its your turn to cook a small blessing lee gave him a quick jab before they cleaned up the dishes theyd left out in the rain in his quick efficient manner hunter had the camp fire burning and bacon sizzling lee sat back absorbing the scents while she watched him break eggs into the pan weve been through a lot of eggs she commented idly how do you manage to keep them fresh out here because she was watching his hands she missed the quick smile just one of the many mysteries of life youd better pass me a plate yes but oh look the movement that had caught her eye turned out to be two rabbits curious enough to bound to the edge of the clearing and watch the mystery of the eggs was forgotten in the simple fascination of something shed just begun to appreciate every time i see one i want to touch if you managed to get close enough to touch theyd show you they have very sharp teeth shrugging she dropped her chin to her knees and continued to stare back at the visitors the bunnies i think about dont bite hunter reached for a plate himself bunnies fuzzy little squirrels and cute raccoons are nice to look at but foolish to handle i remember having a long heated argument with sarah on the subject a couple of years ago sarah lee accepted the place he offered but her attention was fully on him until that moment hunter hadnt realized how completely hed forgotten who she was and why she was there to have mentioned sarah so casually showed him he needed to keep personal feelings separate from professional agreements someone very special he told her as he scooped the remaining eggs onto his plate he remembered his daughters comment about simmering passion and falling in love the smile couldnt be prevented i imagine shed like to meet you lee felt something cold squeeze her heart and fought to ignore it theyd said nothing about commitment nothing about exclusivity they were adults she was responsible for her own emotions and their consequences would she taking the first bite of eggs she tasted nothing her eyes were drawn to the ring on his finger it wasnt a wedding band but she had to ask she had to know before things went any further the ring you wear she began satisfied her voice was even its very unusual ive never seen another quite like it you shouldnt he ate with the ease of a man completely content my sister made it sister if her name was sarah bonnie raises children and makes jewelry hunter went on im not sure which comes first bonnie nodding she forced herself to continue eating is she your only sister there were just the two of us for some odd reason we got along very well he remembered those early years when he was struggling to learn how to be both father and mother to sarah he smiled we still do how does she feel about what you do bonnies a firm believer that everyone should do exactly what suits them as long as theyre married with a halfdozen children he grinned recognizing the unspoken question in lees eyes in that area ive disappointed her he paused for a moment the grin fading do you think i could make love with you if i had a wife waiting for me at home she dropped her gaze to her plate why could he always read her when she couldnt read him i still dont know very much about you he didnt know if he consciously made the decision at that moment or if hed been ready to make it all along ask he said simply lee looked up at him it no longer mattered if she needed to know for herself or for her job she just need to know youve never been married no is that an outgrowth of your need for privacy no its an outgrowth of not finding anyone who could deal with the way i live and my obligations lee mulled this over thinking it a rather odd way to phrase it your writing yes theres that she started to press further then decided to change directions personal questions could be reciprocated with personal questions you said you hadnt always wanted to be a writer but were born to be one what made you realize it i dont think it was a matter of realizing but of accepting understanding that she wanted something specific he drew out a cigarette studying the tip he was no more certain why he was answering than lee was why she was asking it mustve been in my first year of college id written stories ever since i could remember but i was dead set on a career as an athlete then i wrote something that seemed to trigger it it was nothing fabulous he added thoughtfully a very basic plot simple background but the characters pulled me in i knew them as well as i knew anyone there was nothing else for me to do it mustve been difficult publishing isnt an easy field even when you break in it isnt particularly lucrative unless you write bestsellers with your parents gone you had to support yourself i had experience waiting tables he smiled a bit more easily now and detested it sometimes you have to put it all on the line lenore so i did how did you support yourself from the time you graduated from college until you broke through with the devils due i wrote lee shook her head forgetting the halffull plate on her lap the articles and short stories couldnt have brought in very much and that was your first book no id had a dozen others before it blowing out a stream of smoke he reached for the coffeepot want some she leaned forward a bit her brows drawing together look hunter ive been researching you for months i might not have gotten much but i know every book every article and every short story youve written including the majority of your college work theres no way idve missed a dozen books you know everything hunter browns written he corrected and poured himself coffee thats precisely what i said you didnt research laura miles who he sipped enjoying the coffee and the conversation more than hed anticipated a great many writers use pseudonyms laura miles was mine a womans name confused on one level reporters instincts humming on another she frowned at him you wrote a dozen books before the devils due under a womans name yeah one of the problems with writing is that the name alone can project a certain perception of the author he offered her the last piece of bacon hunter brown wasnt right for what i was doing at the time lee let out a frustrated breath what were you doing writing romance novels he flicked his cigarette into the fire writing you he studied her incredulous face before he leaned back he was used to criticism of genre fiction and more often than not amused by it do you object to the genre in general or to my writing in it i dont confused she broke off to try to gather her thoughts i just cant picture you writing happyeverafter love stories hunter i just finished silent scream i kept my bedroom door locked for a week she dragged a hand through her hair as he quietly watched her romances most novels have some kind of relationship with them a romance simply focuses on it rather than using it as a subplot or a device but didnt you feel you were wasting your talent lee knew his skill in drawing the reader in from the first page from the first sentence i understand there being a matter of putting food on the table but no he cut her off i never wrote for the money lenore any more than the novel youre writing is done for financial gain as far as wasting my talent you shouldnt look down your nose at something you dont understand im sorry i dont mean to be condescending im just helplessly she shrugged im just surprised no im astonished i see those colorful little paperbacks everywhere but you never considered reading one he finished you should theyre good for you i suppose for simple entertainment he liked the way she said it as though it were something to be enjoyed in secret like a childs lollipop if a novel doesnt entertain it isnt a novel and its wasted your time i imagine youve read jane eyre rebecca gone with the wind ivanhoe yes of course romances a lot of the same ingredients are in those colorful little paperbacks he was perfectly serious at that moment lee wouldve given up half the books in her personal library for the chance to read one laura miles story hunter i want to print this go ahead her mouth was already open for the argument shed expected go ahead she repeated you dont care why should i im not ashamed of the work i did as laura miles in fact he smiled thinking back im rather pleased with most of it then why she shook her head as she began to absently nibble on cold bacon damn it hunter why havent you ever said so before laura miles is as much a deep dark secret as everything else about you i never met a reporter i chose to tell before he rose stretching and enjoyed the wide blue expanse of sky just as hed never met a woman hed have chosen to live with before hunter was beginning to wonder if one had very much to do with the other dont complicate the simple lenore he told her thinking aloud it usually manages to complicate itself setting her plate aside she stood in front of him one more question then he brought his gaze back down to hers she hadnt bothered to fuss with her hair or makeup that morning as she had from the first morning of the trip for a moment he wondered if the reporter was too anxious for the story or the woman was too involved with the man he wished he knew all right he agreed one more question why me how did he answer what he didnt know how did he answer what he was hesitant to ask himself framing her face he brought his lips to hers long lingering and very very new i see something in you hunter murmured holding her face still so that he could study it i want something from you i dont know what either one is yet and maybe i never will is that answer enough she put her hands on his wrists and felt his life pump through them it was almost possible to believe hers pumped through them too it has to be chapter contents prev next standing high on the bluff lee could see down the canyon over the peaks and pinnacles beyond the rich red buttes to the sheerfaced walls there were pictures in them people creatures stories they pleased her all the more because she hadnt realized she could find them she hadnt known land could be so demanding or so compelling not knowing that how could she have known she would feel at home so far away from the world she knew or the life shed made perhaps it was the mystery the awesomeness the centuries of work nature had done to form beauty out of rock the centuries it had yet to work weather had landscaped carved and created without pampering it might have been the quiet shed learned to listen to the quiet shed learned to hear more than shed ever heard sound before or it might have been the man shed discovered in the canyon who was slowly inevitably dominating every aspect of her life in much the same way wind water and sun dominated the shape of everything around her he wouldnt pamper either theyd been lovers only a matter of days yet he seemed to know just where her strengths lay and her weaknesses she learned about him step by gradual step always amazed that each new discovery came so naturally as though shed always known perhaps the intensity came from the briefness lee could almost accept that theory but for the timelessness of the hours they spent together in two days shed leave the canyon and the man and go back to being the lee radcliffe shed molded herself into over the years shed step back into the rhythm write her article and go on to the next stage of her career what choice was there lee asked herself as she stood with the afternoon sun beating down on her in la her life had direction it had purpose there she had one goal to succeed that goal didnt seem so important here and now where just being just breathing was enough but this world wasnt the one she would live in day after day even if hunter had asked even if shed wanted to lee couldnt go on indefinitely in this unscheduled unplanned existence purpose she wondered what would her purpose be here she couldnt dream by the camp fire forever but two days she closed her eyes telling herself that everything shed done and everything shed seen would be forever implanted in her memory did the time left have to be so short and the time ahead of her loomed so long here hunter came up alongside her holding out a pair of binoculars you should always see as far as you can she took them with a smile for the way he had of putting things the canyon zoomed closer abruptly becoming more personal she could see the water rushing by in the creek rushing with a sound too distant to be heard why had she never noticed how unique each leaf on a tree could be she could see other campers loitering near their sites or mingling with the day tourists on paths lee let the binoculars drop they brought intrusion too close will you come back next year she wanted to be able to picture him there looking out over the endless space remembering if i can it wont have changed she murmured if she came back five ten years from then the creek would still snake by the buttes would still stand but she couldnt come back with an effort she shook off the mood and smiled at him it must be nearly lunchtime its too hot to eat up here hunter wiped at the sweat on his brow well go down and find some shade all right she could see the dust plume up from his boots as he walked some place near the creek she glanced to the right lets go this way hunter we havent walked down there yet he hesitated only a moment fine holding her hand he took the path shed chosen the walk down was always easier than the walk up that was another invaluable fact lee had filed away during the last couple of weeks and hunter though he held her hand didnt guide or lead he simply walked his own way just as hed walk his own way in fortyeight hours she mused and stretched her stride to keep pace with him will you start on your next book as soon as you get back questions he thought hed never known anyone with such an endless supply of questions yes are you ever afraid youll well dry up always interested she stopped a moment really shed considered him a man without any fear at all id have thought that the more success you achieved the more confident youd become success is a deity thats never satisfied she frowned a bit uncomfortable with his description every time i face that first blank page i wonder how ill ever get through a beginning middle and end how do you he began to walk again so that she had to keep up or be left behind i tell the story its as simple and as miserably complex as that so was he she reflected that simple that complex lee thought over his words as she felt the temperature gradually change with the decrease in elevation it seemed tidier in this section of the canyon once she thought she heard the purr of a cars engine a sound she hadnt heard in days the trees grew thicker the shade more generous how strange she reflected to have those sheer unforgiving walls at her back and a cozy little forest in front of her more unreality then glancing down she saw a patch of small white flowers lee picked three leaving the rest for someone else she hadnt come for them she remembered as she tucked them in her hair but she was glad so very glad to have found them hows this he turned to see her secure the last flower in her hair the need for her the complete her rose inside of him so swiftly it took his breath away lenore he had no trouble understanding why the man in poes verse had mourned the loss of her to the point of madness you grow lovelier impossible hunter touched a fingertip to her cheek would he too grow mad from mourning the loss of her her face lifted to the sun needed nothing more than the luminescence of her skin to make it exquisite but how long he wondered how long would she be content to shun the polish how long would it be before she craved the life shed begun to carve out for herself lee didnt smile because his eyes prevented her he was looking into her again for something something she wasnt certain even if shed known what it was that she could give him the answer he wanted instead she did what hed once done placing her hands on his shoulders she touched her mouth to his with her eyes squeezed shut she dropped her head onto his chest how could she leave how could she not there seemed to be no direction she could go and not lose something essential i dont believe in magic she murmured but if i did id say this was a magic place now in the day its quiet sleeping perhaps but at night the air would be alive with spirits he held her closer as he rested his neck on top of her head did she realize how romantic she was he wondered or just how hard she fought not to be a week ago she might have had such a thought but shed never have said it aloud a week from now hunter bit back a sigh a week from now shed give no more thought to magic i want to make love with you here he said quietly with the sunlight streaming through the leaves and onto your skin in the evening just before the dew falls at dawn when the lights caught somewhere between rose and gray moved ruled by love she smiled up at him and at midnight when the moons high and anythings possible anythings always possible he kissed one cheek then the other you only have to believe it she laughed a bit shakily you almost make me believe it you make my knees weak his grin flashed as he swept her up in his arms better would she ever feel this free again throwing her arms around his neck lee kissed him with all the feeling that welled inside her yes and if you dont put me down ill want you to carry me back to camp the half smile touched his lips decide you arent hungry after all since i doubt youve got anything in that bag but dried fruit and sunflower seeds i dont have any illusions about lunch ive still got a couple pieces of fudge lets eat hunter dropped her unceremoniously on the ground it shows the womans basic lust centers around food just chocolate lee disagreed you can have my share of the sunflower seeds theyre good for you digging into the pack he pulled out some small clearplastic bags i can handle the raisins lee said unenthusiastically but i can do without the seeds shrugging hunter popped two in his mouth youll be hungry before dinner ive been hungry before dinner for two weeks she tossed back and began to root through the pack herself for the fudge no matter how good seeds and nuts and little dried pieces of apricot are for you they dont take the place of red meat she found a small square of fudge or chocolate hunter watched her close her eyes in pure pleasure as she chewed the candy hedonist absolutely her eyes were laughing when she opened them i like silk blouses french champagne and lobster with warm butter sauce she sighed as she sat back wondering if hunter had any emotional attachment to the last piece of fudge i especially enjoy them after ive worked all week to justify having them he understood that perhaps too well she wasnt a woman who wanted to be taken care of nor was he a man who believed anyone should have a free ride but what future was there in a relationship when two people couldnt acclimate to each others lifestyle hed never imposed his on anyone else nor would be permit anyone to sway him from his own and yet now that he felt the clock ticking the hours away the days away he wondered if it would be as simple to go back alone as hed once expected it to be you enjoy living in the city he asked casually of course it wasnt possible to tell him that she hated the thought of going back alone to what shed always thought was perfect for her my apartments twenty minutes from the magazine convenient and practical he mused it seemed she would always choose the practical even if she had a whim for the fanciful he opened the canteen and drank when he passed it to lee she accepted shed learned to make a number of adjustments i suppose you work at home yes she touched a hand absently to one of the flowers in her hair that takes discipline i think most people need the structure of an office away from their living space to accomplish anything you wouldnt she looked over then wishing they could talk about more personal things without bringing on that quiet sense of panic better that they talked of work or the weather or of nothing at all no youd drive yourself harder than any supervisor or time clock he bit into an apple slice if you put your mind to it youd have that manuscript finished within a month restlessly she moved her shoulders if i worked eight hours a day without any other obligations the storys your only obligation she held back a sigh she didnt want to argue or even debate not when they had so little time left together yet if they didnt discuss her work she might not be able to prevent herself from talking about her feelings that was a circle without any meeting point hunter as a writer you can feel that way about a book i suppose you have to i have a job a career that demands blocks of time and a great deal of my attention i cant simply put that into hiatus while i speculate on my chances of getting a manuscript published youre afraid to risk it it was a direct hit to her most sensitive area both of them knew her anger was a defense what if i am ive worked hard for my position at celebrity everything ive done there and every benefit ive received ive earned on my own ive already taken enough risks by not marrying jonathan willoby the fury leaped into her eyes quickly interesting him so it was still a sore point hunter realized a very sore point do you find that amusing lee demanded does the fact that i reneged on an unspoken agreement appeal to your sense of humor not particularly but it intrigues me that youd consider it possible to renege on something unspoken from the meticulous way she recapped the canteen he gauged just how angry she was her voice was cool and detached as he hadnt heard it for days my family and the willobys have been personally and professionally involved for years the marriage was expected of me and i knew it from the time i was sixteen hunter leaned back against the trunk of a tree until he was comfortable and at sixteen you didnt consider that sort of expectation antiquated how could you possibly understand fuming she rose the nerves that had been dormant for days began to jump again hunter could almost see them spring to life you said your father was a dreamer who made his living as a salesman my father was a realist who made his living socializing and delegating he socialized with the willobys he delegated me to complete the social and professional merger with them by marrying jonathan even now the tidy unemotional plans gave her a twinge of distaste jonathan was attractive intelligent already successful my father never considered that id object but you did hunter pointed out why do you continue to insist on paying for something that was your right lee whirled to him it was no longer possible for her to answer coolly to rebuff with aloofness do you know what it cost me not to do what was expected of me everything i did all my life was ultimately for their approval then you did something for yourself without hurry he rose to face her is your career for yourself lenore or are you still trying to win their approval he had no right to ask no right to make her search for the answer pale she turned away from him i dont want to discuss this with you its none of your concern isnt it abruptly as angry as she hunter spun her around again isnt it he repeated her hands curled around his arms whether in protest or for support she wasnt certain now she thought now perhaps shed reached that edge where she had to make a stand no matter how unsteady the ground under her feet my life and the way i live it are my business hunter not anymore youre being ridiculous she threw back her head the better to meet his eyes this argument doesnt even have a point something was building inside him so quickly he didnt have a chance to fight it or reason it through youre wrong she was beginning to tremble without knowing why along with the anger came the quick panic she recognized too well i dont know what you want you she was crushed against him before she understood her own reaction all of you his mouth closed over hers with none of the gentle patience he usually showed lee felt a lick of fear that was almost immediately swallowed by raging need hed made her feel passion before but not so swiftly desire had burst inside her before but not so painfully everything was as it always was whenever he touched her and yet everything was so different was it anger she felt from him frustration passion she only knew that the control he mastered so finely was gone something strained inside him something more primitive than hed let free before this time they both knew it could break loose her blood swam with the panicked excitement of anticipation then they were on the ground with the scent of sunwarmed leaves and cool water she felt his beard scrape over her cheek before he buried his mouth in her throat whatever drove him left her no choice but to race with him to the end that waited for both of them he didnt question his own desperation he couldnt if she held off sharing certain pieces of herself with him she still shared her body willingly he wanted more all though he told himself it wasnt reasonable even now as he felt her body heat and melt for him he knew he wouldnt be satisfied when would she give her feelings to him as freely for the first time in his life he wanted too much he struggled back to the edge of reason resisting the wave after wave of need that raged through him this wasnt the time the place or the way in his mind he knew it but emotion battled to betray him still holding her close he buried his face in her hair and waited for the madness to pass stunned as much by his outburst of passion as by her unquestioning response lee lay still instinctively she stroked a hand down his back to soothe she knew him well enough to understand that his temper was rarely unguarded now she knew why hunter lifted his head to look at her seeing on a surge of selfdisgust that her eyes were wary again the flowers had fallen from her hair taking one he pressed it into her hand youre much too fragile to be handled so clumsily his eyes were so intense so dark it was impossible for her to relax again against his back her fingers curled and uncurled there was a warning somewhere in her brain that he wanted more than shed expected him to want more than she knew how to give play it light lee ordered herself and deliberately stilled the movement of her fingers she smiled though her eyes remained cautious i shouldve waited until we were back in the tent before i made you angry understanding what she was trying to do hunter lifted a brow under his voice and hers was a strain both of them pretended not to hear we can go back now i can toss you around a bit more as the panic subsided she sent him a mild glance im stronger than i look yeah he sent her a smile of his own he had the long hours of night to think about what had happened and what he was going to do about it show me more confident than she shouldve been lee pushed against him intent on rolling him off her he didnt budge the look of calm amusement on his face had her doubling her efforts breathless unsuccessful she lay back and frowned at him youre heavier than you look she complained it must be all those sunflower seeds your muscles are full of chocolate he corrected i only had one piece she began today by my count youve polished off never mind her brow arched elegantly the nerves in her stomach hadnt completely subsided if you want to talk about unhealthy habits youre the one who smokes too much he shrugged accepting the truth everyones entitled to one vice her grin became wicked then sultry is that your only one if shed planned to make her mouth irresistible she succeeded hunter lowered his to nibble at the sweetness ive never been one to consider pleasures vices sighing she linked her arms around his neck they didnt have enough time left to waste it arguing or even thinking why dont we go back to the tent so you can show me what you mean he laughed softly and shifted to kiss the curve of her shoulder her laugh echoed his then lees smile froze when she glanced down the length of his body to what stood at their feet fear ripped through her she couldnt have screamed her short unpainted nails dug into hunters back what he lifted his head her face was icewhite and still though her body was rigid beneath his there was lively fear in the hands that dug into his back muscles tense he turned to look in the direction she was staring damn the word was hardly out of his mouth before a hundred pounds of fur and muscle leaped on him this time lees scream tore free adrenaline born of panic gave her the strength to send the three of them rolling to the edge of the bank as she struck out blindly lee heard hunter issue a sharp command a whimper followed it lenore her shoulders were gripped before she could spring to her feet in her mind the only thought was to find a weapon to defend them its all right without giving her a choice hunter held her close its all right i promise he wont hurt you my god hunter its a wolf every nightmare shed ever read or heard about fangs and claws spun in her mind with her arms wrapped around him to protect as much as for protection lee turned her head silver eyes stared back at her from a silver coat no he felt the fresh fear jump through her and continued to soothe hes only half wolf weve got to do something should they run should they sit perfectly still he attacked greeted hunter corrected trust me lenore hes not vicious annoyed and resigned hunter held out a hand here santanas a bit embarrassed at having lost control of himself the dog crawled forward head down speechless lee watched hunter stroke the thick silvergray fur hes usually better behaved hunter said mildly but he hasnt seen me for nearly two weeks seen you she pressed herself closer to hunter but logic began to seep through her panic as she saw the dog lick hunters extended hand you called him by name she said shakily what did you call him before hunter could answer there was a rustling in the trees behind them lee had nearly mustered the breath to scream again when another voice young and high shouted out santanas you come back here im going to get in trouble damn right hunter mumbled under his breath lee drew back far enough to look into hunters face just what the hells going on a reunion he said simply puzzled with her heart still pounding in her ears lee watched the girl break through the trees the dogs tail began to thump the ground santanas she stopped her dark braids whipping back and forth smiling she uninhibitedly showed her braces whoops the quick exclamation trailed off as lee was treated to a long intense stare that was hauntingly familiar the girl stuck her hands in the pockets of cutoff jeans scuffing the ground with battered sneakers well hi her gaze shifted to hunter briefly before it focused on lee again i guess you wonder what im doing here well get into that later hunter said in a tone both females recognized as basic male annoyance hunter lee drew farther away traces of anger and anxiety working their way through the confusion she couldnt bring herself to look away from the dark dark eyes of the girl who stared at her whats going on here apparently a lesson in manners should be he returned easily lenore the creature currently sniffing at your hand is santanas my dog at the gesture of his hand the large lean animal sat and lifted a friendly paw dazed lee found herself taking it while she turned to watch the dogs master she saw hunters gaze travel beyond her with a smile that held both irony and pride the girl rudely staring at you is sarah my daughter chapter contents prev next daughter sarah lee turned her head to meet the dark direct eyes that were a duplicate of hunters yes they were a duplicate it struck her like a blast of air he had a child this lovely slender girl with a tender mouth and braids secured by mismatched rubber bands was hunters daughter so many opposing emotions moved through her that she said nothing nothing at all sarah hunter spoke into the drumming silence this is ms radcliffe sure i know the reporter hi still sitting on the ground with the dog now sniffing around her shoulder lee felt like a complete fool hello she hoped the word wasnt as ridiculously formal as it sounded to her dad said i shouldnt call you pretty because pretty was like a bowl of fruit sarah didnt tilt her head as one might to study from a new angle but lee had the impression she was being weighed and dissected like a still life i like your hair sarah declared is it a real color a definite lesson in manners hunter put in more amused than annoyed im afraid sarahs a bit of a brat he always says that sarah moved thin expressive shoulders he doesnt mean it though until today he ruffled the dogs fur wondering just how he would handle the situation lee was still silent and sarahs eyes were all curiosity take santanas back to the house i assume bennies there yeah we came back yesterday because i remembered i had a soccer game and she had an inspiration and couldnt do anything with it in phoenix with all the kids running around like monkeys i see and though he did perfectly lee was left floundering in the dark go ahead then well be right along okay come on santanas then she shot lee a quick grin he looks pretty ferocious but he doesnt bite as the girl darted away lee wondered if shed been speaking of the dog or her father when she was once again alone with hunter lee remained still and silent ill apologize for the rudeness of my family if youd like family the word struck her a dose of reality that flung her out of the dream rising lee meticulously dusted off her jeans theres no need her voice was cool almost chill her muscles were wiretaut since the games over id like you to drive me into sedona so i can arrange for transportation back to la game in one long easy motion he came to his feet then took her hand stopping its nervous movement it was a gesture that had become so much of a habit neither of them noticed theres no game lenore oh you played it very well the hurt she wouldnt permit in her voice showed clearly in her eyes her hand remained cold and rigid in his so well in fact i completely forgot we were playing patience deserted him abruptly and without warning anger he could handle with more anger or with amusement but hurt left him with no defense no attack dont be an idiot whatever game there was ended a few nights ago in the tent ended tears sprang to her eyes stunning her furiously she blinked them back filled with selfdisgust but not before hed seen them no it never ended youre an excellent strategist hunter you seemed to be so open with me that i didnt think you were holding anything back she jerked her hand from his longing for the luxury of dissolving into those hot cleansing tears how could you she demanded how could you touch me that way and lie i never lied to you his voice was as calm as hers his eyes as full of passion you have a child something snapped inside her so that she had to grip her hands together to prevent herself from wringing them you have a halfgrown daughter you never mentioned to me you told me youd never been married i havent been he said simply and waited for the inevitable questions they leaped into her mind but lee found she couldnt ask them she didnt want to know if she were to put him out of her life immediately and completely she couldnt ask you said her name once and when i asked you avoided answering who asked he countered you or the reporter she paled and her step away from him said more than a dozen words if that was an unfair question he said feeling his way carefully im sorry lee stifled a bitter answer hed just said it all i want to go back to sedona will you drive me or do i have to arrange for a car stop this he gripped her shoulders before she could back farther away youve been a part of my life for a few days sarahs been my life for ten years i take no risks with her she saw the fury come and go in his eyes as he fought against it shes offtherecord do you understand she stays offtherecord i wont have her childhood disturbed by photographers dogging her at soccer games or hanging from trees at school picnics sarahs not an item for the glossy pages of any magazine is that what you think of me she whispered weve come no further than that she swallowed a mixture of pain and betrayal your daughter wont be mentioned in any article i write you have my word now let me go she wasnt speaking only of the hands that held her there and they both knew it he felt a bubble of panic hed never expected a twist of guilt that left him baffled frustrated he stared down at her hed never realized she could be a complication i cant it was said with such simplicity her skin iced i want you to understand and i need time for that youve had nearly two weeks to make me understand hunter damn it you came here as a reporter he paused as if waiting for her to confirm or deny but she said nothing what happened between us wasnt planned or expected by either one of us i want you to come back with me to my home somehow she met his eyes levelly im still a reporter we have two days left in our agreement his voice softened his hands gentled lenore spend those two days with me at home with my daughter you have no problem asking for everything do you no she was still holding herself away from him no matter how badly he wanted to hunter knew better than to try to draw her closer not yet its important to me that you understand give me two days she wanted to say no she wanted to believe she could deny him even that and turn away go away without regrets but thered be regrets lee realized if she went back to la without taking whatever was left i cant promise to understand but ill stay two more days though she was reluctant he held her hand to his lips thank you its important to me dont thank me she murmured the anger had slipped away so quietly she couldnt recall it things have changed things changed days ago still holding her hand he drew her in the direction sarah had gone ill come back for the gear now that the first shock had passed the second occurred to her but you live here in the canyon thats right you mean to tell me you have a house with hot and cold running water and a normal bed but you chose to spend two weeks in a tent it relaxes me thats just dandy she muttered youve had me showering with lukewarm water and waking up with aching muscles when you knew idve given a weeks pay for one tubbath builds character he claimed more comfortable with her annoyance the hell it does you did it deliberately she stopped turning to him as the sun dappled light through the trees you did it all deliberately to see just how much i could tolerate you were very impressive he smiled infuriatingly i admit i never expected you to last out a week much less two you sonofa dont get cranky now he said easily you can take as many baths as you like over the next couple of days he swung a friendly arm over her shoulder before she could prevent it and hed have time he thought to explain to her about sarah time he hoped to make her understand ill even see to it that you have that red meat youve been craving fury threatened control strained dont you dare patronize me im not youre not a woman a man could patronize though she mistrusted his answer his voice was bland with sincerity and he wasnt smiling im enjoying you and i suppose the foulup of my own plans believe me i hadnt intended for you to find out i lived a couple miles from the campsite in quite this way just how did you intend for me to find out by offering you a quiet candlelight dinner on our last night id hoped youd see the ah humor in the situation youdve been wrong she said precisely then caught sight of the house cocooned in the trees it was smaller than shed expected but with the large areas of glass in the wood it seemed to extend into the land it made her think of dolls houses and fairy tales though she didnt know why dolls houses were tidy and formal and laced with gingerbread hunters house was made up of odd angles and unexpected peaks a porch ran across the front where the roof arched to a high pitch plants spilled over the banister bloodred geraniums in jadegreen pots the roof sloped down again then ran flat over a parallelogram with floortoceiling windows on the patio that jutted from out from it a white wicker chair lay overturned next to a battered soccer ball the trees closed in around it closed it in lee thought protected sheltered hid it was like a house out of a play or stopping she narrowed her eyes and studied it again this is jonas thorpes house in silent scream hunter smiled rather pleased shed seen it so quickly more or less i wanted to put him in isolation miles away from what would normally be considered civilized but in reality the only safe place left is that how you look at it she wondered aloud as the only safe place left often then a shriek which after a heartstopping moment lee identified as laughter ripped through the silence it was followed by an excited bout of barking and a womans frazzled voice then therere other times hunter murmured as he led lee toward the front door even as he opened it sarah came bounding out unsure of her own feelings lee watched the girl throw her arms around her fathers waist she saw hunter stroke a hand over the dark hair at the crown of sarahs head oh dad its so funny aunt bonnie was making a bracelet out of glazed dough and santanas ate it or he chewed on it until he found out it tasted awful im sure bonnie thinks its a riot her eyes so like her fathers lit with a wicked amusement that wouldve made a veteran fifthgrade teacher nervous she said she had to take that sort of thing from art critics but not from halfbreed wolves she said shed make some tea for lenore but there arent any cookies because we ate them yesterday and she said never mind well find out for ourselves he stepped back so that lee could walk into the house ahead of him she hesitated for a moment wondering just what she was walking into and his eyes lit with the same wicked amusement as sarahs they were quite a pair lee decided and stepped forward she hadnt expected anything so well normal in hunter browns home the living room was airy sunny in the afternoon light cheerful yes lee realized that was precisely the word that came to mind no shadowy corners or locked doors there were wildflowers in an enameled vase and plump pillows on the sofa were you expecting witches brooms and a satinlined coffin he murmured in her ear annoyed she stepped away from him of course not i suppose i didnt expect you to have something quite so domesticated he arched a brow at the word i am domesticated lee looked at him at the face that was half rugged half aristocratic on one level perhaps she mused but only on one i guess aunt bonnies got the mess in the kitchen pretty well cleaned up sarah kept one arm around her father as she gave lee another thorough goingover shed like to meet you because dad doesnt see nearly enough women and never talks to reporters so maybe youre special because he decided to talk to you while she spoke she watched lee steadily she was only ten but already shed sensed there was something between her father and this woman with the darkblue eyes and nifty hair what she didnt know was exactly how she felt about it yet in the manner of her father sarah decided to wait and see equally unsure of her own feelings lee went with them into the kitchen she had an impression of sunny walls white trim and confusion hunter if youre going to keep a wolf in the house you should at least teach him to appreciate art hi im bonnie lee saw a tall thin woman with darkbrown shoulderlength hair streaked liberally with blond she wore a purple tshirt with faded pink printing over cutoffs as ragged as her nieces her bare feet were tipped at the toes with hotpink polish studying her thin models face lee couldnt be sure if she were years older than hunter or years younger automatically she held out her hand in response to bonnies outstretched one how do you do id be doing a lot better if santanas hadnt tried to make a snack of my latest creation she held up a goldenbrown half circle with ragged ends just lucky for him it was a dreadful idea anyway sit she gestured to a table piled with bowls and canisters and dusted the flour im making tea you didnt turn the kettle on sarah pointed out and did so herself hunter the childs always picking on details i worry about her with a shrug of acceptance he picked up what looked like a small doughnut and might with imagination have been an earring youre finding gold and silver too traditional to work with these days i thought i might start a trend when bonnie smiled she became abruptly and briefly stunning in any case it was a small failure probably cost you less than three dollars in flour sit she repeated as she began to transfer the mess from the table to the counter behind her so how was the camping trip enlightening wouldnt you say lenore educational she corrected but thought the last half hour had been the most educational of all so you work for celebrity bonnies long twisted gold earrings swung when she walked much like sarahs braids im a faithful reader thats because shes had a couple of embarrassingly flattering writeups writeups lee watched bonnie dust her flourcovered hands on her cutoffs hunter smiled as he watched his sister reach for a tin of tea and send others clattering to the counter professionally shes known as b b smithers the name rang a bell for years b b smithers had been considered the queen of avantgarde jewelry the elite the wealthy and the trendy flocked to her for personal designs they paid and paid well for her talent her creativity and the tiny bs etched into the finished product lee stared at the thin somewhat clumsy woman with something close to wonder ive admired your work but you wouldnt wear it bonnie put in with a smile as she shoved tumbled boxes and tins out of her way no its the classics for you what a fabulous face do you want lemon in your tea do we have any lemons hunter probably not taking this in stride bonnie set the teapot on the table to let the tea steep tell me lenore how did you talk the hermit into coming out of his cave by making him furious i believe that might work she sat down across from lee as sarah walked to her fathers side her eyes were softer than her brothers less intense but not lee thought less perceptive did the two weeks playing pioneer in the canyon give you the insight to write an article on him yes lee smiled because there was humor in bonnies eyes plus i gained a growing affection for box springs and mattresses the quick stunning smile flashed again my husband takes the children camping once a year thats when i go to elizabeth ardens for the works when we come home both of us feel weve accomplished several small miracles campings not so bad sarah commented in her fathers defense is that so he patted her bottom as he drew her closer why is it that you always have this allconsuming desire to visit bonnie in phoenix whenever i start packing gear she giggled and her arm went easily around his shoulder must be coincidence she said in a dry tone that echoed his did he make you go fishing sarah wanted to know and sit around for just hours lee watched hunters brow lift before she answered actually he did ah suggest fishing several days running ugh was sarahs only comment but i caught a bigger fish than he did unimpressed sarah shook her head its awfully boring she sent her father an apologetic glance i guess somebodys got to do it leaning her head against her fathers she smiled at lee mostly hes never boring he just likes some weird stuff like fishing and beer sarah doesnt consider hunters shrunkenhead collection at all unusual bonnie picked up the teapot are you having some she asked her brother ill pass sarah and ill go and break camp take your wolf with you bonnie told him as she poured tea into lees cup hes still on my hit list by the way a couple of calls from new york came in for you yesterday theyll keep as he rose he ran a careless hand down lees hair a gesture not lost on either of the other females in the room ill be back shortly she started to offer her help but it was so comfortable in the sunny cluttered kitchen and the tea smelled like heaven all right she saw the proprietary hand sarah put on her fathers arm and thought it just as well to stay where she was together father and daughter walked to the back door hunter whistled for the dog then they were gone bonnie stirred her tea sarah adores her father yes lee thought of the way theyd looked side by side and so do you lee had started to lift her cup now it only rattled in the saucer i beg your pardon youre in love with hunter bonnie said mildly i thinks its marvelous she couldve denied it vehemently icily laughingly but hearing it said aloud seemed to put her in some kind of trance i dont that is it doesnt lee stopped realizing she was running the spoon handle through her hands im not sure how i feel a definite symptom does being in love worry you i didnt say i was again lee stopped could anyone make evasions with those soft doe eyes watching yes it worries me a lot only natural i used to fall in and out of love like some people change clothes then i met fred bonnie laughed into her tea before she sipped i went around with a queasy stomach for weeks lee pressed a hand to her own before she rose tea wasnt going to help she had to move i have no illusions about hunter and myself she said more firmly than shed expected to we have different priorities different tastes she looked through the kitchen window to the high red walls far beyond the clustering trees different lives i have to get back to la bonnie calmly continued to drink tea of course if lee heard the irony she didnt respond to it there are people who have it fixed in their heads that in order to have a relationship the two parties involved must be on the same wavelength if one adores sixteenthcentury french poetry and the other detests it theres no hope she noticed lees frown but continued lightly freds an accountant who gets a primal thrill out of interest rates she wiped absently at a smudge of flour on the table statistically i suppose we shouldve divorced years ago lee turned back unable to be angry unable to smile youre a great deal like hunter arent you i suppose is your mother adreanne radcliffe though she no longer wanted it lee came back to the table for her tea yes i met her at a party in palm springs two no mustve been three years ago yes three bonnie said decisively because i was still nursing carter my youngest and hes currently terrorizing everyone at nursery school just last week he tried to cook a goldfish in a toy oven youre not at all like your mother are you it took a moment for lee to catch up she set down her tea again untasted arent i do you think you are bonnie tossed her tousled streaked hair behind her shoulder i dont mean any offense but she wouldnt know what to say to anyone not born to the blue so to speak idve considered her a very sheltered woman shes very lovely you certainly appear tove inherited her looks but that seems to be all lee stared down at her tea how could she explain that because of the strong physical resemblance between her and her mother shed always figured there were other resemblances hadnt she spent her childhood and adolescence trying to find them and all of her adult life trying to repress them a sheltered woman she found it a terrifying phrase and too close to what she herself could have become my mother has standards she answered at length she never seems to have any trouble living up to them oh well everyone should do what they do best bonnie propped her elbows on the table lacing her fingers so that the three rings on her right hand gleamed and winked according to hunter the thing you do best is write he mentioned your novel to me the irritation came so quickly lee hadnt the chance to mask it hes the kind of man who cant admit when hes made a mistake im a reporter not a novelist i see still smiling blandly bonnie dropped her chin onto her laced fingers so what are you going to report about hunter was there a challenge under the smile a trace of mockery whatever there was at the edges lee couldnt help but respond to it yes she thought again bonnie smithers was a great deal like her brother that hes a man who considers writing both a sacred duty and a skilled profession that he has a sense of humor thats often so subtle it takes you hours to catch up that he believes in choices and luck with the same stubbornness that he believes in fate pausing she lifted her cup he values the written word whether its in comic books or chaucer and he works desperately hard to do what he considers his job to tell the story i like you cautiously lee smiled thank you i love my brother bonnie went on easily more than that i admire him for personal and professional reasons you understand him not everyone would understand him lee shook her head it seems to me that the more i find out about him the less i understand hes shown me more beauty in a pile of rocks than id ever have found for myself yet he writes about horror and fears and you consider that a contradiction bonnie shrugged as she leaned back in her chair its just that hunter sees both sides of life very clearly he writes about the dark side because its the most intriguing yet he lives lee gestured as she glanced around the kitchen in a cozy little house nestled in the woods the laugh came naturally i wouldnt precisely call it cozy but its certainly not what youd expect from the countrys leading author of horror and occult fiction the countrys leading author of horror and occult fiction has a child to raise yes lees smile faded yes sarah shes lovely will she be in your article no again she lifted her gaze to bonnies no hunter made it clear he objected to that shes the focal point of his life if he seems a bit overprotective in certain ways believe me its a completely unselfish act when lee merely nodded bonnie felt a stirring of sympathy he hasnt told you about her no nothing there were times bonnies love and admiration for hunter became clouded with frustration a great many times this woman was in love with him was one step away from being irrevocably committed to him any fool could see it bonnie mused any fool except hunter as i said there are times hes overly protective he has his reasons lenore and will you tell me what they are she was tempted it was time hunter opened that part of his life and she was certain this was the woman he should open it to the storys hunters bonnie said at length you should hear it from him she glanced around idly as she heard the jeep pull up in the drive theyre back i guess im glad you brought her back sarah commented as they drove the last mile toward home you guess hunter turned his head to see his daughter looking pensively through the windshield shes beautiful like a princess for the first time in months sarah worried her braces with her tongue you like her a lot i can tell yes i like her a lot he knew every nuance of his daughters voice every expression every gesture that doesnt mean i like you any less sarah gave him one long look she needed no other words from him to reaffirm love i guess you have to like me she decided half teasing cause were stuck with each other but i dont think she does why shouldnt lenore like you hunter countered able to follow her winding statement without any trouble she doesnt smile much not enough he silently agreed but more each day when she relaxes she does sarah shrugged unconvinced well she looked at me awful funny your grammars deteriorating she did hunter frowned a bit as he turned into the dirt drive to their house its only that she was surprised i hadnt mentioned you to her sarah stared at him a moment then put her scuffed sneakers on the dash that wasnt very nice of you maybe not youd better apologize he sent his daughter a mild glance really she patted santanass head when he leaned over the back of her seat and dropped it on her shoulder really you always make me apologize when im rude i didnt consider that you were any of her business at first hunter amended silently things changed everything changed you always make me apologize even when i make up excuses sarah pointed out unmercifully when they pulled up by the house she grinned at him and even when i hate apologizing brat he mumbled setting the brake with a squeal of laughter sarah launched herself at him im glad youre home he held her close a moment absorbing her scent youthful sweat grass and flowery shampoo it seemed impossible that ten years had passed since hed first held her then shed smelled of powder and fragility and fresh linen it seemed impossible that she was halfgrown and the time had been so short i love you sarah content she cuddled against him a moment then lifting her head she grinned enough to make pizza for dinner he pinched her subtly pointed chin maybe just enough for that chapter contents prev next when lee thought of family dinners she thought of quiet meals at a glossy mahogany table laid with heavy georgian silver meals where conversation was subdued and polite it had always been that way for her not this dinner the already confused kitchen became chaotic while sarah dashed around half dancing half bobbing as she filled her father in on every detail of the past two weeks oblivious to the noise bonnie used the kitchen phone to call home and check in with her husband and children santanas forgiven lay sprawled on the floor dozing hunter stood at the counter preparing what sarah claimed was the best pizza in the stratosphere somehow he managed to keep up with his daughters disjointed conversation answer the questions bonnie tossed at him and cook at the same time feeling like oil poured heedlessly on a rub of churning water lee began to clear the table if she didnt do something she decided shed end up standing in the middle of the room with her head swiveling back and forth like a fan at tennis match im supposed to do that awkwardly lee set down the teapot shed just lifted and looked at sarah oh stupid she berated herself havent you any conversation for a child you can help i guess sarah said after a moment but if i dont do my chores i dont get my allowance her gaze slid to her father then back again theres this album i want to buy you know the total wrecks i see lee searched her mind for even a wispy knowledge of the group but came up blank theyre actually not as bad as the name makes them sound bonnie commented on her way out to the kitchen anyway hunter wont dock your pay if you take on an assistant sarah its considered good business sense turning his head hunter caught his sisters quick grin before she waltzed out of the room i suppose lee should earn her supper as well he said easily even if it isnt red meat the smile made it difficult for her to casually lift the teapot again youll like the pizza better sarah stated confidently he puts everything on it anytime i have friends over for dinner they always want dads pizza as she continued to clear the table lee tried to imagine hunter competently preparing meals for several young chattering girls she simply couldnt i think he was a cook in another life good lord lee thought did the child already have views on reincarnation the same way you were a gladiator hunter said dryly sarah laughed childlike again aunt bonnie was a slave sold at an arabian auction for thousands and thousands of drachmas bonnie has a very fluid ego with a clatter sarah set the cups in the sink i think lenore mustve been a princess with a damp cloth in her hands lee looked up not certain if she should smile a medieval princess sarah went on like with king arthur hunter seemed to consider the idea a moment while he studied his daughter and the woman under discussion its a possibility one of those delicate jeweled crowns and filmy veils would suit her and dragons obviously enjoying the game sarah leaned back against the counter the better to imagine lee in a flowing pastel gown a knight would have to kill at least one fullgrown male dragon before he could ask for her hand true enough hunter murmured thinking that dragons came in many forms dragons arent easy to kill though she spoke lightly lee wondered why her stomach was quivering it was entirely too easy to imagine herself in a great torchlit hall with jewels winking from her hair and from the bodice of a rich silk gown its the best way to prove valor sarah told her nibbling on a slice of green pepper shed snitched from her father a princess cant marry just anyone you know the king would either giver her to a worthy knight or marry her off to a neighboring prince so he could have more land with peace and prosperity incredibly lee pictured her father staff in hand decreeing that she would marry jonathan of willoby i bet you never had to wear braces cast from one century to another in the blink of an eye lee merely stared sarah was frowning at her with the absorbed absorbing concentration she could have inherited only from hunter it was all so foolish lee thought knights princesses dragons for the first time she was able to smile naturally at the slim dark girl who was a part of the man she loved two years you did interest sprang into sarahs solemn face she stepped forward obviously to get a better look at lees teeth it worked good she decided did you hate them every minute sarah giggled so that the silver flashed i dont mind too much cept i cant chew gum she sent a sulky look over her shoulder in hunters direction not even one stick neither could i ever she thought but didnt add it gum chewing was not permitted in the radcliffe household sarah studied her another moment then nodded i guess you can help me set the table too acceptance lee was to discover was just that simple the sun was streaming into the kitchen while they ate it was rich and golden without those harsh stunning flashes of white she remembered from the cliffs of the canyon she found it peaceful despite all the talk and laughter and arguments swimming around her her fantasies had run to eating a thick rare steak and crisp chefs salad in a dimly lit quiet restaurant where the hovering waiter saw that your glass of bordeaux was never empty she found herself in a bright noisy kitchen eating pizza stringy with cheese chunky with slices of green pepper and mushroom spiced with pepperoni and hot sausage and while she did she found herself agreeing with sarahs accolade the best in the stratosphere if only fred could learn how to make one of these bonnie cut into her second slice with the same dedication shed cut into her first on a good day he makes a superior egg salad but its not the same with a family the size of yours hunter commented youd need to set up an assembly line five hungry children could keep a pizzeria hopping and do bonnie agreed in a bit less than seven months itll be six she grinned as hunters knife paused another another bonnie winked across the table at her niece i always said id have half a dozen kids she said casually to lee people should do what they do best hunter reached over to take her hand lee saw the fingers interlock some might call it overachievement or sibling rivalry she tossed back ill have as many kids as you do bestsellers with a laugh she squeezed her brothers hand it takes us about the same length of time to produce when you bring the baby to visit she should sleep in my room sarah bit off another mouthful of pizza she hunter ruffled her hair before he started to eat again itll be a girl with the confidence of youth sarah nodded aunt bonnie already has three boys so another girl makes it even ill see what i can do bonnie told her anyway ill be heading back in the morning cassandra shes my oldest she put in for lees benefit has decided she wants a tattoo she closed her eyes as she leaned back ah its nice to be needed a tattoo sarah wrinkled her nose thats gross cassies nuts fred and i are forced to agree interested hunter lifted his wine where does she want it on the curve of her right shoulder she insists itll be very tasteful dumb sarah handed out the decree with a shrug cassies thirteen she added rolling her eyes boy is she a case lee choked back a laugh at both the facial and verbal expressions how will you handle it bonnie only smiled oh i think ill take her to the tattoo parlor but you wouldnt lee broke off seeing bonnies liberally streaked hair and shoulderlength earrings perhaps she would with a laugh bonnie patted lees hand no i wouldnt but itll be a lot more effective if cassie makes the decision herself which she will the minute she gets a good look at all those nasty little needles sneaky sarah approved with a grin clever bonnie corrected same thing with her mouth halffull she turned to lee theres always a crisis at aunt bonnies house she said confidentially did you have brothers and sisters no was that wistfulness she saw in the childs eyes shed often had the same wish herself there was only me i think its better to have them even though it gets crowded she slanted her father a guileless smile can i have another piece the rest of the evening passed not quietly but for all the noise peacefully sarah dragged her father outside for soccer practice which bonnie declined grinning her condition she claimed was too delicate lee over her protests found herself drafted she learned though her aim was never very accurate to kick a ball with the side of her foot and bounce it off her head she enjoyed it which surprised her and didnt feel like a fool which surprised her more dusk came quickly then a dark that was flickered with fireflies though her eyes were heavy sarah groaned about going to bed until hunter agreed to carry her up on his back lee didnt have to be told it was a nightly ritual she only had to see them together hed said sarah was his life and though shed only seen them together for a matter of hours lee believed it shed never have expected the man whose books shed read to be a devoted father content to spend his time with a tenyearold girl shed never have imagined him here in a house so far away from the excitement of the city even the man shed grown to know over the past two weeks didnt quite fit the structure of being parent disciplinarian and mentor to a tenyearold yet he was if she superimposed the image of sarahs father over those of her lover and the author of silent scream they all seemed to meld into one the problem was dealing with it righting the overturned chair on the patio lee sat she could hear sarahs sleepy laughter drift through the open window above her hunters voice low and indistinct followed it it was an odd way to spend her last hours with hunter here in his home only a few miles from the campsite where theyd become lovers and yes she realized as she stared up at the stars friends she very much wanted to be his friend now when she wrote the article shed be able to do so with knowledge of both sides of him it was what shed come for lee closed her eyes because the stars were suddenly too bright she was going back with much more and because of it much less tired opening her eyes she looked up at hunter this was how shed always remember him cloaked in shadows coming out of the darkness no is sarah asleep he nodded coming around behind her to put his hands on her shoulders this was where he wanted her here when night was closing in bonnie too youd work now she guessed when the house was quiet and the windows dark yes most of the time i finished my last book on a night like this he hadnt been lonely then but now lets walk the moons full afraid ill give you a talisman he slipped his ring off his pinky sliding it onto her finger im not superstitious she said loftily but curled her fingers into her palm to hold the ring in place of course you are he drew her against his die as they walked i like the night sounds lee listened to them the faintest breeze through the trees the murmur of water the singsong of insects youve lived here a long time as the day had passed it had become less feasible to think of his living anywhere else yes i moved here the year sarah was born its a lovely spot he turned her into his arms moonlight spilled over her silver jewellike in her hair marbling her skin darkening her eyes it suits you he murmured he ran a hand through her hair then watched it fall back into place the princess and the dragon her heart had already begun to flutter like a teenagers lee thought he made her feel like a girl on her first date these days women have to kill their own dragons these days his mouth brushed over hers theres less romance if these were the dark ages and i came upon you in a moonlit wood id take you because it was my right id woo you because id have no choice his voice darkened like the shadows in the trees surrounding them let me love you now lenore as if it were the first time or the last she thought dimly as his lips urged her to soften to yield to demand with his arms around her she could let her consciousness go imagine and feel lovemaking consisted of nothing more even as her head tilted back in submission her arms strengthened around him challenging him to take whatever he wanted to give whatever she asked then his hands were on her face gently as gently as theyd ever been memorizing the slope and angle of her bones the softness of her skin his lips followed tasting drinking in each separate flavor the pleasure that could come so quickly ran liquid through her bonelessly she slid with him to the ground hed wanted to love her like this in the open with the moon silvering the trees and casting purple shadows hed wanted to feel her muscles coil and go fluid under the touch of his hand what she gave to him now was something out of his own dreams and much much more real than anything hed ever had slowly he undressed her while his lips and the tips of his fingers both pleasured and revered her this would be the night when he gave her all of him and when he asked for all of her moonlight and shadows washed over her making his heart pound in his ears he heard the creek bubble nearby to mix with her quiet sighs the woods smelled of night and so as she buried his face against her neck did she she felt the surging excitement in him the growing straining need that swept her up willingly she went into the whirlpool he created there the air was soft to the touch and streaked with color there she would stay endlessly possessed his skin was warm against hers she tasted her head swimming from pleasure power and newly awakened dizzying speed ravenous for more she raced over him acutely aware of every masculine tremble beneath her every drawn breath every murmur of her name silver and shadows lee felt them every bit as tangibly as she saw them flickering around her the silver streak of power the dark shadow of desire with them she could take him to that trembling precipice when he swore breathlessly she laughed their needs were tangled together twining tighter she felt it she celebrated it the air seemed to still the breeze pause every sound that had grown to one long din around them seemed to hush the fingers tangled in her hair tightened desperately in the silence their eyes met and held moment after moment her lips curved as she opened for him she could have slept there effortlessly with the bare ground beneath her the sky overhead and his body pressed to hers she might have slept there endlessly like a princess under a spell if he hadnt drawn her up into his arms you fall asleep like a child he murmured you should be in bed my bed lee sighed content to stay where she was too far with a low laugh he kissed the hollow between her neck and shoulder should i carry you mmm she nestled against him kay not that i object but you might be a bit disconcerted if bonnie happened to walk downstairs while i was carrying you in naked she opened her eyes so that her irises were dusky blue slits under her lashes reality was returning i guess we have to get dressed it might be advisable his gaze skimmed over her then back to her face should i help you she smiled i think that we might have the same result with you dressing me as we do with you undressing me an interesting theory hunter reached over her for the brief strip of ivory lace but this isnt the time to test it out lee plucked her panties out of his and wiggled into them how long have we been out here centuries she shot him a look just before her head disappeared into her shirt she wasnt completely certain he was exaggerating the least i deserve after these past two weeks is a real mattress he took her hand pressing her palm to his lips youre welcome to share mine lee curled her fingers around his briefly then released them i dont think thats wise youre worried about sarah it wasnt a question lee took her time making certain all the clouds of romance were out of her head before she spoke i dont know a great deal about children but i imagine shes unprepared for someone sharing her fathers bed silence lay for a moment like the eye of a storm ive never brought a woman to our home before the statement caused her to look at him quickly then just as quickly look away all the more reason all the more reason for many things he dressed without speaking while lee stared out into the trees so beautiful she thought and more and more distant you wanted to ask me about sarah but you didnt she moistened her lips its not my business her chin was captured quickly not so gently isnt it he demanded hunter this time youll have the answer without asking he dropped his hand but his gaze never faltered she needed nothing else to tell her the calm was over i met a woman almost a dozen years ago i was writing as laura miles by then so that i could afford a few luxuries dinner out occasionally the theater now and then i was still living in la alone enjoying my work and the benefits it brought me she was a student in her last year brains and ambition she had in abundance money she didnt have at all she was on scholarship and determined to be the hottest young attorney on the west coast hunter what happened between you and another woman all those years ago isnt my business not just another woman sarahs mother lee began to pull at the tuft of grass by her side all right if its important for you to tell me ill listen i cared about her he continued she was bright lovely and full of dreams neither of us had ever considered becoming too serious she still had law school to finish the bar to pass i had stories to tell but then no matter who much we plan fate has a way of taking over he drew out a cigarette thinking back remembering each detail his tiny cramped apartment with the leaky plumbing the battered typewriter with its hiccupping carriage the laughter from the couple next door that would often seep through the thin walls she came by one afternoon i knew something was wrong because she had afternoon classes she was much too dedicated to skip classes it was hot one of those sultry breathless days the windows were up and i had a little portable fan that stirred the air around without doing much to cool it shed come to tell me she was pregnant he could remember the way shed looked if he concentrated but he never chose to but whether he chose to or not hed always be able to remember the tone of her voice when shed told him despair laced with fury and accusation i said i cared about her and that was true i didnt love her still our parents values do trickle down i offered to marry her he laughed then not humorously but not lee reflected bitterly it was the laugh of a man whod accepted the joke life had played on him she refused almost as angry with the solution id offered was she was with the pregnancy she had no intention of taking on a husband and a child when she had a career to carve out it might be difficult to understand but she wasnt being cold simply practical when she asked me to pay for the abortion lee felt all of her muscles contract but sarah thats not the end of the story hunter blew out a stream of smoke and watched it fade into darkness we had a memorable fight threats accusations blame casting at the time i couldnt see her end of it only the fact that she had part of me inside her that she wanted to dispose of we parted then both of us furious both of us desperate enough to know we each needed time to think she didnt know what to say or how to say it you were young she began i was twentyfour hunter corrected id long since stopped being a boy i was we were responsible for our own actions i didnt sleep for two days i thought of a dozen answers and rejected them all over and over only one thing stuck with me in that whole sweaty terrified time i wanted the child its not something i can explain because i did enjoy my life the lack of responsibilities the possibility of becoming really successful i simply knew i had to have the child i called her and asked her to come back we were both calmer the second time and both more frightened than either of us had ever been in our lives marriage couldnt be considered so we set it aside she didnt want the child so we dealt with that i did that was something a bit more complex to deal with she needed freedom from the responsibility wed made together and she needed money in the end we resolved it all drymouthed lee turned to him you paid her he saw as hed expected to see the horror in her eyes when he continued his voice was calm but it took a great deal of effort to make it so i paid all the medical expenses her living expenses up until she delivered and i gave her ten thousand dollars for my daughter stunned heartsick lee stared at the ground how could she we each wanted something in the only way open we gave it to each other ive never resented that young law student for what she did it was her choice and she couldve taken another without consulting me yes she tried to understand but all lee could see was that slim dark little girl she chose but she lost it meant everything just to hear her say it sarahs been mine only mine from the first moment she breathed the woman who carried her gave me a priceless gift i only gave her money does sarah know only that her mother had choices to make i see she let out a long breath the reason youre so careful about keeping publicity away from her is to keep speculation away one of them the other is simply that i want her to have the uncomplicated life every childs entitled to you didnt have to tell me she reached a hand for his im glad you did it cant have been easy for you raising a baby by yourself there was nothing but understanding in her eyes now every taut muscle in his body relaxed as if shed stroked them he knew now with utter certainty that she was what hed been waiting for no not easy but always a pleasure his fingers tightened on hers share it with me lenore her thoughts froze i dont know what you mean i want you here with me with sarah i want you here with the other children well have together he looked down at the ring hed put on her hand when his eyes came back to hers she felt them reach inside her marry me marry she could only stare at him blankly while the panic quietly built and built you dont you dont know what youre asking i do he corrected holding her hand more firmly when she tried to draw it away ive asked only one other woman and that out of obligation im asking you because youre the first and only woman ive ever loved i want to share your life i want you to share mine panic steadily turned into fear he was asking her to change everything shed aimed for to risk everything our lives are too far apart she managed i have to go back i have my job a job you know you werent made for urgency slipped into his voice as he took her shoulders you know you were made to write about the images you have in your head not about other peoples social lives and tomorrows trends its what i know trembling she jerked away from him its what ive been working for to prove a point damn it lenore do something for yourself for yourself it is for myself she said desperately you love him a voice shouted inside her why are you pushing away what you need what you want lee shook her head as if to block the voice out love wasnt enough needs werent enough she knew that she had to remember it youre asking me to give it all up every hard inch ive climbed in five years i have a life in la i know who i am where im going i cant live here and risk finding out who you really are he finished he wouldnt allow despair he barely controlled anger if it was only myself id go anywhere you liked live anywhere that suited you even if i knew it was a mistake but theres sarah i cant take her away from the only home shes ever known youre asking for everything again her voice was hardly a whisper but hed never heard anything more clearly youre asking me to risk everything and i cant i wont he rose so that shadows shifted around him im asking you to risk everything he agreed do you love me and by asking hed already risked it all torn by emotions pushed by fear she stared at him yes damn you hunter leave me alone she streaked back toward the house until the darkness closed in between them chapter contents prev next if youre not going to break for lunch at least take this bryan held out one of her inexhaustible supply of candy bars ill eat when ive finished the article lee kept her eyes on the typewriter and continued to pound at the keys lightly rhythmically lee youve been back for two days and i havent seen you so much as nibble on a danish and her photographers eye had seen beneath the subtle use of cosmetics to the pale bruises under lees eyes that mustve been some interview she thought as the brisk even clickityclick of the typewriter keys went on not hungry no she wasnt hungry any more than she was tired shed been working steadily on hunters article for the better part of fortyeight hours it was going to be perfect she promised herself it was going to be polished like a fine piece of glass and oh god when she finished it finished it shed have purged her system of him shed gripped that thought so tightly it often skidded away if shed stayed if she went back the oath came quickly under her breath as her fingers faltered meticulously lee reversed the carriage to make the correction she couldnt go back hadnt she made that clear to hunter she couldnt just toss everything over her shoulder and go but the longer she stayed away the larger the hole in her life became in the life lee was ruthlessly reminded that shed so carefully carved out for herself so shed work in a nervous kind of fury until the article was finished until she told herself it was all finished then it would be time to take the next step when she tried to think of that next step her mind went stunningly desperately blank lee dropped her hands into her lap and stared at the paper in front of her without a word bryan bumped the door with her hip so that it closed and muffled the noise dropping down into the chair across from lee she folded her hands and waited a beat okay now why dont you tell me the story thats not for publication lee wanted to be able to shrug and say she didnt have time to talk she was under a deadline after all the article was under a deadline but then so was her life drawing a breath she turned in her chair she didnt want to see the neat clever little words shed typed not now bryan if youd taken a picture one that required a great deal of your time and all of your skill to set up then once youd developed it it had come out in a completely different way than youd planned what would you do id take a good hard look at the way it had come out she said immediately thered be a good possibility i shouldve planned it that way in the first place but wouldnt you be tempted to go back to your original plans after all youd worked very very hard to set it up in a certain way wanting certain specific results maybe maybe not itd depend on just what id seen when i looked at the picture bryan sat back crossing long jeansclad legs whats in your picture lee hunter her troubled gaze shifted and locked on bryans you know me as well as you let anyone know you with a short laugh lee began to push at a paper clip on her desk am i as difficult as all that yeah bryan smiled a bit to soften the quick answer and ive always thought as interesting apparently hunter brown thinks the same thing he asked me to marry him the words came out in a jolt that left both women staring marry bryan leaned forward as intill death do us part yes oh the word came out like a breath of air as bryan leaned back again fast work then she saw lees unhappy expression just because bryan didnt smell orange blossoms when the word marriage came up was no reason to be flippant well how do you feel about hunter i mean the paper clip twisted in lees fingers im in love with him really then she smiled because it sounded nice when said so simply did all this happen in the canyon yes lees fingers moved restlessly maybe it started to happen before when we were in flagstaff i dont know anymore why arent you happy bryan narrowed her eyes as she did when checking the light and angle when the man you love really love wants to build a life with you you should be ecstatic how do two people build a life together when theyve both already built separate ones completely different ones lee demanded it isnt just a matter of making more room in the closet or shifting furniture around the end of the paper clip broke off in her fingers as she rose bryan he lives in arizona in the canyon i live in la lifting booted feet bryan rested them on lees polished desk crossing her ankles youre not going to tell me its all a matter of geography it just shows how impossible it all is angry lee whirled around we couldnt be more different almost opposites i do things stepbystep hunter goes in leaps and bounds damn it you should see his house its like something out of a sophisticated fairy tale his sisters b b smithers before bryan could fully register that lee was blurting out he has a daughter a daughter her attention fully caught bryan dropped her feet again hunter brown has a child lee pressed her fingers to her eyes and waited for calm true it wouldnt have come out if she hadnt been so agitated and shed never discuss such personal agitations with anyone but bryan but now she had to deal with it yes a tenyearold girl its important that it not be publicized all right lee needed no promises from bryan trying to calm herself she took a quiet breath shes bright lovely and quite obviously the center of his life i saw something in him when they were together something incredibly beautiful it scared the hell out of me why bryan hes capable of so much talent brilliance emotion hes put them together to make a complete success of himself in all ways that bothers you i dont know what im capable of i only know im afraid id never be able to balance it all out make it all work bryan said something short quick and rude you wont marry him because you dont think you can juggle you should know yourself better i thought i did shaking her head she took her seat again its ridiculous in the first place she said more briskly our lives are miles apart bryan glanced out the window at the tall sleek building that was part of lees view of the city so he can move to la and close the distance he wont swallowing lee looked at the pages on her desk the article was finished she knew it just as she knew that if she didnt let it go shed polish it to death he belongs there he wants to raise his daughter there i understand that so you move to the canyon great scenery why did it always sound so simple so plausible when spoken aloud the little trickle of fear returned and her voice finned my jobs here i guess it comes down to priorities doesnt it bryan knew she wasnt being sympathetic just as she knew it wasnt sympathy that lee needed because she cared a great deal she spoke without any compassion you can keep your job and your apartment in la and be miserable or you can take a few chances chances lee ran a finger down the slick surface of her desk but you were supposed to test the ground before you stepped forward even hunter had said that but she looked at the mangled paper clip in the center of her spotless blotter how long did you test it before you took the jump it was barely two weeks later that lee sat in her apartment in the middle of the day she was so rarely there during the day during the week that she somehow expected everything to look different everything looked precisely the same even she was forced to admit herself yet nothing was quit she tried to digest the word as she dealt with the panic shed held off the past few days there was a leafy blooming african violet on the table in front of her it was welltended as every area of her life had been welltended shed always water it when the soil was dry and feed it when it required nourishing as she stared at the plant lee knew she would never be capable of pulling it ruthlessly out by the roots but wasnt that what shed done to herself quit she thought again and the word reverberated in her brain shed actually handed in her resignation served her two weeks notice and summarily turned her back on her steadily thriving career ripped out its roots for what she demanded of herself as panic trickled through to follow some crazy dream that had planted itself in her mind years ago to write a book that would probably never be published to take a ridiculous risk and plunge headlong into the unknown because hunter had said she was good because hed fed that dream just as she fed the violet more than that lee thought hed made it impossible for her to stop thinking about the what ifs in her life and he was one of them the most important one of them now that the step was taken and she was here alone in her impossibly quiet midweek midmorning apartment lee wanted to run out there were people noise distractions here shed have to face those what ifs hunter would be the first he hadnt tried to stop her when she left the morning after hed asked her to marry him hed said nothing when shed made her goodbyes to sarah nothing at all perhaps theyd both known that hed said all there was to say the night before hed looked at her once so that shed nearly wavered then lee had climbed into the car with bonnie whod driven her to the airport that was one step closer to la he hadnt phoned her since shed returned had she expected him to lee wondered maybe she had but shed hoped he wouldnt she didnt know how long it would take before shed be able to hear his voice without going to pieces glancing down she stared at the twisted gold and silver ring on her hand why had she kept it it wasnt hers it shouldve been left behind it was easy to tell herself shed simply forgotten to take it off in the confusion but it wasnt the truth shed known the ring was still on her ringer as shed packed as she walked out of hunters house as she stepped into the car she just hadnt been capable of taking it off she needed time and it was time lee realized that she now had she had to prove something again but not to her parents not to hunter now there was only herself if she could finish the book if she could give it her very best and really finish it rising lee went to her desk sat down at the typewriter and faced the fear of the blank page lee had known pressure in her work on celebrity the minutes ticking away while deadlines drew closer and closer there was the pressure of making notsofascinating seem fascinating in a limited space and of having to do it week after week and yet after nearly a month of being away from it and having only herself and the story to account for lee learned the full meaning of pressure and of delight she hadnt believed not truly believed that it would be possible for her to sit down hour after hour and finish a book shed begun on a whim so long ago and it was true that for the first few days shed met with nothing but frustration and failure thered been a ring of terror in her head why had she left a job where she was respected and knowledgeable to stumble in the dark this way time after time she was tempted to push it all aside and go back even if it would mean starting over at celebrity but each time she could see hunters face lightly mocking challenging and somehow encouraging it takes a certain amount of stamina and endurance if youve reached your limit and want to quit the answer was no just as grimly just as determinedly as it had been in that little tent perhaps shed fail she shut her eyes as she struggled to deal with the thought perhaps shed fail miserably but she wouldnt quit whatever happened shed made her own choice and shed live with it the longer she worked the more of a symbol those typewritten pages became if she could do this and do it well she could do anything the rest of her life balanced on it by the end of the second week lee was so absorbed she rarely noticed the twelve and fourteenhour days she was putting in she plugged in her phone machine and forgot to return the calls as often as she forgot to eat it was as hunter had once said the characters absorbed her drove her frustrated and delighted her as time passed lee discovered she wanted to finish the story not only for her sake but for theirs she wanted as shed never wanted before for these words to be read the excitement of that and the dread kept her going she felt a queer little thrill when the last word was typed a euphoria mixed with an odd depression shed finished shed poured her heart into her story lee wanted to celebrate she wanted to weep it was over as she pressed her fingers against her tired eyes she realized abruptly that she didnt even know what day it was hed never had a book race so frantically so quickly hunter could barely keep up with his own zooming thoughts he knew why and flowed with it because he had no choice the main character of this story was lenore though her name would be changed to jennifer she was lenore physically emotionally from the elegantly groomed redgold hair to the nervously bitten fingernails it was the only way he had of keeping her it had cost him more than shed ever know to let her go when hed watched her climb into the car hed told himself she wouldnt stay away she couldnt if he was wrong about her feelings for him then hed been wrong about everything in his life two women had crashed into his life with importance the first sarahs mother he hadnt loved yet shed changed everything after that shed gone away unable to find it possible to mix her ambition with a life that included children and commitment lee he loved and shed changed everything again she too had gone away would she stay away for the same reasons was he fated to bind himself to women who wouldnt share the tie he wouldnt believe it so hed let her go aches and fury under the calm shed be back but a month had passed and she hadnt come he wondered how long a man could live when he was starving call her go after her you were a fool to ever let her go drag her back if necessary you need her you need his thoughts ran this way like clockwork every day at dusk every day at dusk hunter fought the urge to follow through on them he needed god he needed but if she didnt come to him willingly hed never have what he needed only the shell of it he looked down at his naked finger she hadnt left everything behind it was more much more than a piece of metal that shed taken with her hed given her a talisman and shed kept it as long as she had it she didnt sever the bond hunter was a man who believed in fate omens and magic dinners ready sarah stood in the doorway her hair pulled back in a ponytail her narrow face streaked with a bit of flour he didnt want to eat he wanted to go on writing as long as the story moved through him he had a part of lenore with him just as whenever he stopped the need to have all of her tore him apart but sarah smiled at him nearly ready she amended she came into the room barefoot i made this meat loaf but it looks more like a pancake and the biscuits she grinned shrugging theyre pretty hard but we can put some jam or something on them sensing his mood she wrapped her arms around his neck resting her cheek against his i like it better when you cook who turned her nose up at the broccoli last night it looks like little trees that got sick she wrinkled her nose but she drew back from him her face was serious you really miss her a lot huh he couldve evaded with anyone else but this was sarah she was ten she knew him inside out yeah i miss her a lot thinking sarah fiddled with the hair that fell over his forehead i guess maybe you wanted her to marry you she turned me down her brows lowered not so much from annoyance that anyone could say no to her father but in concentration donnas father hardly had any hair at all she thought touching hunters again and kellys dads stomach bounced over his belt shelleys mother never got jokes she didnt know anybody who was as neat to look at or as neat to be with as her dad anybody would want to marry him when shed been little shed wanted to marry him herself but of course she knew now that was just silly stuff her brows were still drawn together when she brought her gaze to his i guess she didnt like me he heard everything just as clearly as if shed spoken her thoughts aloud he was greatly touched and not a little impressed couldnt stand you her eyes widened then brightened with laughter because im such a brat right i can barely stand you myself well sarah huffed a moment she didnt look stupid but i guess she is if she wouldnt marry you she cuddled against him and knowing it was to comfort hunter warmed with love i liked her sarah murmured she was nice kinda quiet but really nice when she smiled i guess you love her yes i do he didnt offer her any words of reassurance its different from the way i love you youll always be my little girl hunter simply held her and it was enough she loves me too but she has to make her own life sarah didnt understand that and personally thought it was foolish but decided not to say so i guess i wouldnt mind if she decided to marry you after all it might be nice to have somebody whod be like a mother he lifted a brow she never asked about her own mother knowing with a childs intuition he supposed that there was nothing to ask about arent i youre pretty good she told him graciously but you dont know a whole lot about lady stuff sarah sniffed the air then grinned meat loafs done overdone from the smell of it picky picky she jumped off his lap before he could retaliate i hear a car coming you can ask them to dinner so we can get rid of all the biscuits he didnt want company hunter thought as he watched his daughter dash out of the room an evening with sarah was enough then hed go back to work after switching off his machine he rose to go to the door it was probably one of her friends whod talked her parents into dropping by on their way home from town hed brush them off as politely as he could manage then see if anything could be done about sarahs meat loaf when he opened the door she was standing there her hair caught in the light of a late summers evening he was quite literally knocked breathless hello hunter how calm a voice could sound lee thought even when a hearts hammering against ribs idve called but your numbers unlisted when he said nothing lee felt her heart move from her ribs to her throat somehow she managed to speak over it may i come in silently he stepped back perhaps he was dreaming like the character in the raven all he needed was a bust of pallas and a dying fire shed used up nearly all of her courage just coming back if he didnt speak soon theyd end up simply staring at each other like a nervous speaker about to lecture on a subject she hadnt researched lee cleared her throat hunter hey i think wed better just give the biscuits to santanas because sarah stopped her headlong flight into the room well gee sarah hello lee was able to smile now the child looked so comically surprised not cool and distant like her father hi sarah glanced uncertainly from one adult to the other she supposed they were going to make a mess of things aunt bonnie said that people who loved each other usually made a mess of things for at least a little while dinners ready i made meat loaf its probably not too bad understanding the invitation lee grasped at it at least it would give her more time before hunter tossed her out again it smells wonderful okay come on imperiously sarah held out her hand waiting until lee took it it doesnt look very good she went on as she led lee into the kitchen but i did everything i was supposed to lee looked at the flattened meat loaf and smiled better than i could do really sarah digested this with a nod well dad and i take turns and if they got married sarah figured shed only have to cook every third day youd better set another place she said lightly to her father the biscuits didnt work but weve got potatoes the three of them sat down very much as if it were the natural thing to do sarah served carrying on a babbling conversation which alleviated the need for either adult to speak to the other they each answered her smiled ate while their thoughts were in a frenzy he doesnt want me anymore why did she come he hasnt even spoken to me what does she want she looks lovely so lovely what can i do he looks wonderful so wonderful sarah lifted the casserole containing the rest of the meat loaf ill give this to santanas like most children she detested leftovers unless it was spaghetti dad has to do the dishes she explained to lee you can help him if you like after shed dumped santanass dinner in his bowl she danced out of the room see you later then they were alone and lee found she was gripping her hands together so tightly they were numb deliberately she unlaced her fingers he saw the ring still on her finger and felt something twist loosen then tighten again in his chest youre angry she said in that same calm even voice im sorry i shouldnt have come this way hunter rose and began to stack dishes no im not angry anger was possibly the only emotion he hadnt experienced in the last hour why did you i lee looked down helplessly at her hands she should help him with the dishes keep busy stay natural she didnt think her legs would hold her just yet i finished the book she blurted out he stopped and turned for the first time since shed opened the door she saw that hint of a smile around his mouth congratulations i wanted you to read it i know i couldve mailed it i sent a copy on to your editor but she lifted her eyes to his again i didnt want to mail it i wanted to give it to you needed to hunter put the dishes in the sink and came back to the table but he didnt sit he had to stand if this was what shed come for all shed come for he wasnt certain he could face it you know i want to read it i expect you to autograph the first copy for me she managed a smile im not as optimistic as that but you were right i had to finish it i wanted to thank you for showing me her lips remained curved but the smile left her eyes i quit my job he hadnt moved but it seemed that he suddenly became very still why i had to try to finish the book for me if only hed touch her just her hand she wouldnt feel so cold i knew if i could do that i could do anything i needed to prove that to myself before i lee trailed off not able to say it all ive been reading your work your earlier work as laura miles if he could just touch her but once he did hed never let her go again did you enjoy it yes there was enough lingering surprise in her voice to make him smile id never have believed there could be a similarity of styles between a romance novel and a horror story but there was atmosphere tension emotion taking a deep breath she stood so that she could face him it was perhaps the most difficult step shed taken so far you understand how a woman feels it shows in your work writers a word without gender still its a rare gift i think for a man to be able to understand and appreciate the kinds of emotions and insecurities that go on inside a woman her eyes met his again and this time held im hoping you can do the same with me he was looking into her again she could feel it its more difficult when your own emotions are involved she gripped her fingers together tightly are they he didnt touch her not yet but she thought she could almost feel his hand against her cheek do you need me to tell you i love you yes i youve finished your book quit your job youve taken a lot of risks lenore he waited but youve yet to put it all on the line her breath trembled out no hed never make things easy for her thered always be demands expectations hed never pamper you terrified me when you asked me to marry you i thought about it a great deal like the small child thinks about a dark closet i dont know whats in there it might be dream or nightmare you understand that yes though it hadnt been a question i understand that she breathed a bit easier i used what i had in la as an excuse because it was logical but it wasnt the real reason i was just afraid to walk into that closet and are you still a little it took more effort that shed imagined to relax her fingers she wondered if he knew it was the final step she held out her hand but i want to try i want to go there with you his fingers laced with hers and she felt the nerves melt away of course he knew it wont be dream or nightmare lenore every minute of it will be real she laughed then because his hand was in hers now youre really trying to scare me stepping closer she kissed him softly until desire built to a quiet roar it was so easy like sliding into a warm clear stream you wont scare me off she whispered the arms around her were tight but she barely noticed no i wont scare you off he breathed in the scent of her hair wallowed in the texture of it shed come to him completely i wont let you go either ive waited too long for you to come back you knew i would she murmured i had to idve gone mad otherwise she closed her eyes content but with a thrill of excitement underneath hunter if sarah doesnt that is if she isnt able to adjust worried already he drew her back sarah gave me a pep talk just this evening you do i assume know quite a bit about lady stuff lady stuff he drew her back just a bit farther to look her up and down every inch the lady youll do lenore for me and for sarah okay she let out a long breath because as usual she believed him id like to be with you when you tell her lenore framing her face he kissed both cheeks gently with a hint of a laugh beneath she already knows a brow lifted her fathers daughter exactly he grabbed her swinging her around once in a moment of pure irrepressible joy the ladys going to find it interesting living in a house with real and imaginary monsters the lady can handle that she tossed back and anything else you dream up is that so he shot her a wicked look amusement desire knowledge as he released her then lets get these dishes done and ill see what i can do one summer chapter contents prev next he room was dark pitch dark but the man named shade was used to the dark sometimes he preferred it it wasnt always necessary to see with your eyes his fingers were both clever and competent his inner eye as keen as a knife blade there were times even when he wasnt working when hed sit in a dark room and simply let images form in his mind shapes textures colors sometimes they came clearer when you shut your eyes and just let your thoughts flow he courted darkness shadows just as relentlessly as he courted the light it was all part of life and life its images was his profession he didnt always see life as others did at times it was harsher colder than the naked eye could see or wanted to other times it was softer more lovely than the busy world imagined shade observed it grouped the elements manipulated time and shape then recorded it his way always his way now with the room dark and the sound of recorded jazz coming quiet and disembodied from the corner he worked with his hands and his mind care and timing he used them both in every aspect of his work slowly smoothly he opened the capsule and transferred the undeveloped film onto the reel when the lighttight lid was on the developing tank he set the timer with his free hand then pulled the chain that added the amber light to the room shade enjoyed developing the negative and making the print as much as sometimes more than he enjoyed taking the photograph darkroom work required precision and accuracy he needed both in his life making the print allowed for creativity and experimentation he needed those as well what he saw what he felt about what he saw could be translated exactly or left as an enigma above all he needed the satisfaction of creating something himself alone he always worked alone now as he went through each precise step of developing temperature chemicals agitation timing the amber light cast his face into shadows if shade had been looking to create the image of photographer at work hed never have found a clearer statement than himself his eyes were dark intense now as he added the stop bath to the tank his hair was dark as well too long for the convention he cared nothing about it brushed over his ears the back of his tshirt and fell over his forehead nearly to his eyebrows he never gave much thought to style his was cool almost cold and rough around the edges his face was deeply tanned lean and hard with strong bones dominating his mouth was taut as he concentrated there were lines spreading out finely from his eyes etched there by what hed seen and what hed felt about it some would say thered already been too much of both the nose was out of alignment a result of a professional hazard not everyone liked to have his picture taken the cambodian soldier had broken shades nose but shade had gotten a telling picture of the citys devastation of the waste he still considered it an even exchange in the amber light his movements were brisk he had a rangy athletic body the result of years in the field often a foreign unfriendly field miles of legwork and missed meals even now years after his last staff assignment for international view shade remained lean and agile his work wasnt as grueling as it had been in his early years in lebanon laos central america but his pattern hadnt changed he worked long hours sometimes waiting endlessly for just the right shot sometimes using a roll of film within minutes if his style and manner were aggressive it could be said that theyd kept him alive and whole during the wars hed recorded the awards hed won the fee he now commanded remained secondary to the picture if no one had paid him or recognized his work shade would still have been in the darkroom developing his film he was respected successful and rich yet he had no assistant and continued to work out of the same darkroom hed set up ten years before when shade hung his negatives up to dry he already had an idea which ones hed print still he barely glanced at them leaving them hanging as he unlocked the darkroom door and stepped out tomorrow his outlook would be fresher waiting was an advantage he hadnt always had right now he wanted a beer he had some thinking to do he headed straight for the kitchen and grabbed a cold bottle popping off the lid he tossed it into the can his onceaweek housekeeper lined with plastic the room was clean not particularly cheerful with the hard whites and blacks but then it wasnt dull after he tilted the bottle back he chugged the beer down draining half he lit a cigarette then took the beer to the kitchen table where he leaned back in a chair and propped his feet on the scrubbed wood surface the view out the kitchen window was of a not so glamorous la it was a little seamy rough sturdy and tough the early evening light couldnt make it pretty he couldve moved to a glossier part of town or out to the hills where the lights of the city at night looked like a fairy tale shade preferred the small apartment that looked out over the unpampered streets of a city known for glitz he didnt have much patience with glitz bryan mitchell she specialized in it he couldnt deny that her portraits of the rich famous and beautiful were well done even excellent ones of their kind there was compassion in her photographs humor and a smooth sensuality he wouldnt even deny that there was a place for her kind of work in the field it just wasnt his angle she reflected culture he went straight for life her work for celebrity magazine had been professional slick and often searing in its way the largerthanlife people shed photographed had often been cut down to size in a way that made them human and approachable since shed decided to freelance the stars near stars and star makers shed photographed for the glossy came to her over the years shed developed a reputation and style that had made her one of them part of the inner select circle it could happen to a photographer he knew they could come to resemble their own themes their own studies sometimes what they tried to project became a part of them too much a part no he didnt begrudge bryan mitchell her state of the art shade simply had doubts about working with her he didnt care for partnerships yet those were the terms when hed been approached by lifestyle to do a pictorial study of america hed been intrigued photo essays could make a strong lasting statement that could rock and jar or soothe and amuse as a photographer he had sought to do that lifestyle wanted him wanted the strong sometimes concise sometimes ambiguous emotions his pictures could portray but they also wanted a counterbalance a womans view he wasnt so stubborn that he didnt see the point and the possibilities yet it irked him to think that the assignment hinged on his willingness to share the summer his van and the credit with a celebrity photographer and with a woman at that three months on the road with a female who spent her time perfecting snapshots of rock stars and personalities for a man whod cut his professional teeth in wartorn lebanon it didnt sound like a picnic but he wanted to do it he wanted the chance to capture an american summer from la to new york showing the joy the pathos the sweat the cheers and disappointments he wanted to show the heart even while he stripped it to the bone all he had to do was say yes and share the summer with bryan mitchell dont think about the camera maria dance bryan lined up the fortyyearold ballet superstar in her viewfinder she liked what she saw age touches of it but years meant nothing grit style elegance endurance most of all endurance bryan knew how to catch them all and meld them maria natravidova had been photographed countless times over her phenomenal twentyfiveyear career but never with sweat running down her arms and dampening her leotard never with the strain showing bryan wasnt looking for the illusions dancers live with but the exhaustion the aches that were the price of triumph she caught maria in a leap legs stretched parallel to the floor arms flung wide in perfect alignment drops of moisture danced from her face and shoulders muscles bunched and held bryan pressed the shutter then moved the camera slightly to blur the motion that would be the one she knew it even as she finished off the roll of film you make me work the dancer complained as she slid into a chair blotting her streaming face with a towel bryan took two more shots then lowered her camera i couldve dressed you in costume backlit you and had you hold an arabesque that would show that youre beautiful graceful instead im going to show that youre a strong woman and youre a clever one maria sighed as she let the towel drop why else do i come to you for the pictures for my book because im the best bryan crossed the studio and disappeared into a back room maria systematically worked a cramp out of her calf because i understand you admire you and she brought out a tray two glasses and a pitcher clinking with ice because i squeeze oranges for you darling with a laugh maria reached for the first glass for a moment she held it to her high forehead then drank deeply her dark hair was pulled back severely in a style only good bones and flawless skin could tolerate stretching out her long thin body in the chair she studied bryan over the rim of her glass maria had known bryan for seven years since the photographer had started at celebrity with the assignment to take pictures of the dancer backstage the dancer had been a star but bryan hadnt shown awe maria could still remember the young woman with the thick honeycolored braid and bib overalls the elegant prima ballerina had found herself confronted with candid eyes the color of pewter an elegant face with slanting cheekbones and a full mouth the tall athletic body had nearly been lost inside the baggy clothes shed worn ragged sneakers and long dangling earrings maria glanced down at the dingy nikes bryan wore some things didnt change at first glance youd categorize the tall tanned blonde in sneakers and shorts as typically california looks could be deceiving there was nothing typical about bryan mitchell bryan accepted the stare as she drank what do you see maria it interested her to know conceptions and preconceptions were part of her trade a strong smart woman with talent and ambition maria smiled as she leaned back in the chair myself nearly bryan smiled a tremendous compliment maria acknowledged this with a sweeping gesture there arent many women i like myself i like and so you i hear rumors my love about you and that pretty young actor matt perkins bryan didnt believe in evading or pretending she lived by choice in a town fueled by rumors fed by gossip i took his picture had a few dinners nothing serious as you said hes pretty bryan smiled and chewed on a piece of ice but theres barely room enough for his ego and mine in his mercedes men maria leaned forward to pour herself a second glass now youre going to be profound who better maria countered men she said the word again savoring it i find them tedious childish foolish and indispensable being loved sexually you understand bryan managed to keep her lips from curving i understand being loved is exhilarating exhausting like christmas sometimes i feel like the child who doesnt understand why christmas ends but it does and you wait for the next time it always fascinated bryan how people felt about love how they dealt with it groped for it and avoided it is that why you never married maria youre waiting for the next time i married dance to marry a man i would have to divorce dance theres no room for two for a woman like me and you bryan stared into her drink no longer amused she understood the words too well no room for two she murmured but i dont wait for the next time youre young if you could have christmas every day would you turn away from it bryan moved her shoulders im too lazy for christmas every day still its a pretty fantasy maria rose and stretched youve made me work long enough i have to shower and change dinner with my choreographer alone bryan absently ran a finger over the back of her camera she didnt often think about love and marriage shed been there already once a fantasy was exposed to reality it faded like a photo improperly fixed permanent relationships rarely worked and still more rarely worked well she thought of lee radcliffe married to hunter brown for nearly a year helping to raise his daughter and pregnant with her first child lee was happy but then shed found an extraordinary man one who wanted her to be what she was even encouraged her to explore herself bryans own experience had taught her that whats said and whats felt can be two opposing things your careers as important to me as it is to you how many times had rob said that before theyd been married get your degree go for it so theyd gotten married young eager idealistic within six months hed been unhappy with the time shed put into her classes and her job at a local studio hed wanted his dinner hot and his socks washed not so much to ask bryan mused to be fair she had to say that rob had asked for little of her just too much at the time theyd cared for each other and both had tried to make adjustments both had discovered theyd wanted different things for themselves different things from each other things neither could be neither could give it wouldve been called an amicable divorce no fury no bitterness no passion a signature on a legal document and the dream had been over it had hurt more than anything bryan had ever known the taint of failure had stayed with her a long long time she knew rob had remarried he was living in the suburbs with his wife and their two children hed gotten what hed wanted and so bryan told herself as she looked around her studio had she she didnt just want to be a photographer she was a photographer the hours she spent in the field in her studio in the darkroom were as essential to her as sleep and what shed done in the six years since the end of her marriage shed done on her own she didnt have to share it she didnt have to share her time perhaps she was a great deal like maria she was a woman who ran her own life made her own decisions personally and professionally some people werent made for partnerships shade colby bryan propped her feet on marias chair she might just have to make a concession there she admired his work so much so in fact that shed plunked down a heady amount for his print of an la street scene at a time when money had been a large concern shed studied it trying to analyze and guess at the techniques hed used for setting the shot and making the print it was a moody piece so much gray so little light and yet bryan had sensed a certain grit in it not hopelessness but ruthlessness still admiring his work and working with him were two different things they were based in the same town but they moved in different circles for the most part shade colby didnt move in any circles he kept to himself shed seen him at a handful of photography functions but theyd never met hed be an interesting subject she reflected given enough time she could capture that air of aloofness and earthiness on film perhaps if they agreed to take the assignment shed have the chance three months of travel there was so much of the country she hadnt seen so many pictures she hadnt taken thoughtfully she pulled a candy bar out of her back pocket and unwrapped it she liked the idea of taking a slice of america a season and pulling the images together so much could be said bryan enjoyed doing her portraits taking a face a personality especially a wellknown one and finding out what lay behind it was fascinating some might find it limited but she found it endlessly varied she could take the tough female rock star and show her vulnerabilities or pull the humor from the cool regal megastar capturing the unexpected the fresh that was the purpose of photography to her now she was being offered the opportunity to do the same thing with a country the people she thought so many people she wanted to do it if it meant sharing the work the discoveries the fun with shade colby she still wanted to do it she bit into the chocolate so what if he had a reputation for being cranky and remote she could get along with anyone for three months chocolate makes you fat and ugly bryan glanced up as maria swirled back into the room the sweat was gone she looked now as people expected a prima ballerina to look draped in silk studded with diamonds cool composed beautiful it makes me happy bryan countered you look fantastic maria yes maria brushed a hand down the draping silk at her hip but then its my job to do so will you work late i want to develop the film ill send you some test proofs tomorrow and thats your dinner just a start bryan took a huge bite of chocolate im sending out for pizza with pepperoni bryan grinned with everything maria pressed a hand to her stomach and i eat with my choreographer the tyrant which means i eat next to nothing and ill have a soda instead of a glass of taittinger we all have our price to pay if i like your proofs ill send you a case of taittinger of soda with a laugh maria swept out an hour later bryan hung her negatives up to dry shed need to make the proofs to be certain but out of more than forty shots shed probably print no more than five when her stomach rumbled she checked her watch shed ordered the pizza for seventhirty well timed she decided as she left the darkroom shed eat and go over the prints of matt shed shot for a layout in a glossy then she could work on the one she chose until the negatives of maria were dry she began rummaging through the two dozen folders on her desk her personal method of filing when someone knocked at the studio door pizza she breathed greedy come on in im starving plopping her enormous canvas bag on the desk bryan began to hunt for her wallet this is great timing another five minutes and i mightve just faded away shouldnt miss lunch she dropped a fat ragged notebook a clear plastic bag filled with cosmetics a key ring and five candy bars on the desk just set it down anyway ill find the money in a minute she dug deeper into the bag how much do you need as much as i can get dont we all bryan pulled out a worn mans billfold and im desperate enough to clean out the safe for you but she trailed off as she looked up and saw shade colby he gave her face a quick glance then concentrated on her eyes what would you like to pay me for pizza bryan dropped the wallet onto the desk with half the contents of her purse a case of starvation and mistaken identity shade colby she held out her hand curious and to her surprise nervous he looked more formidable when he wasnt in a crowd i recognize you she continued but i dont think weve met no we havent he took her hand and held it while he studied her face a second time stronger than hed expected he always looked for the strength first then the weaknesses and younger though he knew she was only twentyeight shade had expected her to look harder more aggressive glossier instead she looked like someone whod just come in from the beach her tshirt was snug but she was slim enough to warrant it the braid came nearly to her waist and made him speculate on how her hair would look loose and free her eyes interested him gray edging toward silver and almond shaped they were eyes hed like to photograph with the rest of her face in shadow she might carry a bag of cosmetics but it didnt look as if she used any of them not vain about her appearance he decided that would make things simpler if he decided to work with her he didnt have the patience to wait while a woman painted and groomed and fussed this one wouldnt and she was assessing him even as he assessed her shade accepted mat a photographer like any artist looked for angles am i interrupting your work no i was just taking a break sit down they were both cautious hed come on impulse she wasnt certain how to handle him each decided to bide their time before they went beyond the polite impersonal stage bryan remained behind her desk her turf his move she decided shade didnt sit immediately instead he tucked his hands in his pockets and looked around her studio it was wide well lit from the ribbon of windows there were baby spots and a blue backdrop still set up from an earlier session in one section reflectors and umbrellas stood in another with a camera still on a tripod he didnt have to look closely to see that the equipment was firstclass but then firstclass equipment didnt make a firstclass photographer she liked the way he stood not quite at ease but ready remote if she had to choose now shed have photographed him in shadows alone but bryan insisted on knowing the person before she made a portrait how old was he she wondered thirtythree thirtyfive hed already been nominated for a pulitzer when shed still been in college it didnt occur to her to be intimidated nice place he commented before he dropped into the chair opposite the desk thanks she tilted her chair so that she could study him from another angle you dont use a studio of your own do you i work in the field he drew out a cigarette on the rare occasion i need a studio i can borrow or rent one easily enough automatically she hunted for an ashtray under the chaos on her desk you make all your own prints thats right bryan nodded on the few occasions at celebrity when shed been forced to entrust her film to someone else she hadnt been satisfied that had been one of the major reasons shed decided to open her own business i love darkroom work she smiled for the first time causing him to narrow his eyes and focus on her face what kind of power was that he wondered a curving of lips easy and relaxed it packed one hell of a punch bryan sprang up at the knock on the door at last shade watched her cross the room he hadnt known she was so tall fiveten he estimated and most of it leg long slender bronzed leg it wasnt easy to ignore the smile but it was next to impossible to ignore those legs nor had he noticed her scent until she moved by him lazy sex he couldnt think of another way to describe it it wasnt floral it wasnt sophisticated it was basic shade drew on his cigarette and watched her laugh with the delivery boy photographers were known for their preconceptions it was part of the trade hed expected her to be sleek and cool that was what hed nearly resigned himself to work with now it was a matter of rearranging his thinking did he want to work with a woman who smelled like twilight and looked like a beach bunny turning away from her shade opened a folder at random he recognized the subject a boxoffice queen with two oscars and three husbands under her belt bryan had dressed her in glitters and sparkles royal trappings for royalty but she hadnt shot the traditional picture the actress was sitting at a table jumbled with pots and tubes of lotions and creams looking at her own reflection in a mirror and laughing not the poised careful smile that didnt make wrinkles but a full robust laugh that could nearly be heard it was up to the viewer to speculate whether she laughed at her reflection or an image shed created over the years like it carrying the cardboard box bryan stopped beside him yeah did she too hungry for formalities bryan opened the lid and dug out the first piece she ordered a sixteen by twentyfour for her fiancé want a piece shade looked inside the box they miss putting anything on here nope bryan searched in a drawer of her desk for napkins and came up with a box of tissues im a firm believer in overindulgence so with the box opened on the desk between them bryan leaned back in her chair and propped up her feet it was time she decided to get beyond the fencing stage you want to talk about the assignment shade took a piece of pizza and a handful of tissues got a beer soda diet or regular bryan took a huge satisfying bite i dont keep liquor in the studio you end up having buzzed clients well skip it for now they ate in silence a moment still weighing each other ive been giving a lot of thought to doing this photo essay itd be a change for you when he only lifted a brow bryan wadded a tissue and tossed it into the trash can your stuff overseas it hit hard there was sensitivity and compassion but for the most part it was grim it was a grim time everything i shoot doesnt have to be pretty this time she lifted a brow obviously he didnt think much of the path shed taken in her career everything i shoot doesnt have to be raw theres room for fun in art he acknowledged this with a shrug wed see different things if we looked through the same lens thats what makes each picture unique bryan leaned forward and took another piece i like working alone she ate thoughtfully if he was trying to annoy her he was right on target if it was just an overflow of his personality it still wouldnt make things any easier either way she wanted the assignment and he was part of it i prefer it that way myself she said slowly sometimes there has to be compromise youve heard of compromise shade you give i give we meet somewhere close to the middle she wasnt as laidback as she looked good the last thing he needed was to go on the road with someone so mellow she threatened to mold three months he thought again maybe once the ground rules were set i map out the route he began briskly we start here in la in two weeks each of us is responsible for their own equipment once were on the road each of us goes our own way you shoot your pictures i shoot mine no questions bryan licked sauce from her finger anyone ever question you colby its more to the point whether i answer it was said simply as it was meant the publisher wants both views so hell have them well be stopping off and on to rent a darkroom ill look over your negatives bryan wadded more tissue no you wont lazily she crossed one ankle over the other her eyes had gone to slate the only outward show of a steadily growing anger im not interested in having my name attached to a series of pop culture shots to keep herself in control bryan continued to eat there were things so many clear concise things shed like to say to him temper took a great deal of energy she reminded herself it usually accomplished nothing the first thing ill want written into the contract is that each of our pictures carries our own bylines that way neither of us will be embarrassed by the others work im not interested in having the public think i have no sense of humor want another piece no she wasnt soft the skin on the inside of her elbow might look soft as butter but the lady wasnt it might annoy him to be so casually insulted but he preferred it to spineless agreement well be gone from june fifteenth until after labor day he watched her scoop up a third piece of pizza since ive seen you eat well each keep track of our own expenses fine now in case you have any odd ideas i dont cook and i wont pick up after you ill drive my share but i wont drive with you if youve been drinking when we rent a darkroom we trade off as to who uses it first from june fifteenth to after labor day were partners fiftyfifty if you have any problems with that well hash it out now before we sign on the dotted line he thought about it she had a good voice smooth quiet nearly soothing they might handle the close quarters well enough as long as she didnt smile at him too often and he kept his mind off her legs at the moment he considered that the least of his problems the assignment came first and what he wanted for it and from it do you have a lover bryan managed not to choke on her pizza if thats an offer she began smoothly ill have to decline rude brooding men just arent my type inwardly he acknowledged another hit outwardly his face remained expressionless were going to be living in each others pockets for three months shed challenged him whether she realized it or not whether he realized it or not shade had accepted he leaned closer i dont want to hassle with a jealous lover chasing along after us or constantly calling while im trying to work just who did he think she was some bimbo who couldnt handle her personal life she made herself pause a moment perhaps hed had some uncomfortable experiences in his relationships his problem bryan decided ill worry about my lovers shade bryan bit into her crust with a vengeance you worry about yours she wiped her fingers on the last of the tissue and smiled sorry to break up the party but ive got to get back to work he rose letting his gaze skim up her legs before he met her eyes he was going to take the assignment and hed have three months to figure out just how he felt about bryan mitchell ill be in touch do that bryan waited until hed crossed the room and shut the studio door behind him with uncommon energy and a speed she usually reserved for work she jumped up and tossed the empty cardboard box at the door it promised to be a long three months chapter contents prev next she knew exactly what she wanted bryan mightve been a bit ahead of the scheduled starting date for the american summer project for lifestyle but she enjoyed the idea of being a step ahead of shade colby petty perhaps but she did enjoy it in any case she doubted a man like him would appreciate the timeless joy of the last day of school when else did summer really start but with that one wild burst of freedom she chose an elementary school because she wanted innocence she chose an inner city school because she wanted realism children who would step out the door and into a limo werent the image she wanted to project this school couldve been in any city across the country the kids whod bolt out the door would be all kids people who looked at the photograph no matter what their age would see something of themselves bryan gave herself plenty of time to set up choosing and rejecting a half a dozen vantage points before she settled on one it wasnt possible or even advisable to stage the shoot only random shots would give her what she wanted the spontaneity and the rush when the bell rang and the doors burst open she got exactly that it was well worth nearly being trampled under flying sneakers with shouts and yells and whistles kids poured out into the sunshine stampede that was the thought that went through her mind crouching quickly bryan shot up catching the first rush of children at an angle that would convey speed mass and total confusion lets go lets go its summer and every days saturday september was years away she could read it on the face of every child turning she shot the next group of children headon in the finished spot theyd appear to be charging right out of the page of the magazine on impulse she shifted her camera for a vertical shot and she got it a boy of eight or nine leaped down the flight of steps hands flung high a grin splitting his face bryan shot him in midair while he hung head and shoulders above the scattering children shed captured the boy filled with the triumph of that magic golden road of freedom spreading out in all directions though she was dead sure which shot shed print for the assignment bryan continued to work within ten minutes it was over satisfied she changed lenses and angles the school was empty now and she wanted to record it that way she didnt want the feel of bright sunlight here she decided as she added a low contrast filter when she developed the print bryan would dodge the light in the sky by holding something over that section of the paper to keep it from being overexposed she wanted the sense of emptiness of waiting as a contrast to the life and energy that had just poured out of the building shed exhausted a roll of film before she straightened and let the camera hang by its strap schools out she thought with a grin she felt that charismatic pull of freedom herself summer was just beginning since resigning from the staff of celebrity bryan found her work load hadnt eased if anything shed found herself to be a tougher employer than the magazine she loved her work and was likely to give it all of her day and most of her evenings her exhusband had once accused her of being obsessed not with her camera but by it it was something shed neither been able to deny nor defend after two days of working with shade bryan discovered she wasnt alone shed always considered herself a meticulous craftsman compared to shade she was lackadaisical he had a patience in his work she admired even as it set her teeth on edge they worked from entirely different perspectives bryan shot a scene and conveyed her personal viewpoint her emotions her feelings about the image shade deliberately courted ambiguity while his photographs might spark off a dozen varied reactions his personal view almost always remained his secret just as everything about him remained half shadowed he didnt chat but bryan didnt mind working in silence it was nearly like working alone his long quiet looks could be unnerving however she didnt care to be dissected as though she were in a viewfinder theyd met twice since their first encounter in her studio both times to argue out their basic route and the themes for the assignment she hadnt found him any easier but she had found him sharp the project meant enough to both of them to make it possible for them to do as shed suggested meet somewhere in the middle after her initial annoyance with him had worn off bryan had decided they could become friends over the next months professional friends in any case then after two days of working with him she knew it would never happen shade didnt induce simple emotions like friendship hed either dazzle or infuriate she didnt choose to be dazzled bryan had researched him thoroughly telling herself her reason was routine you didnt go on the road with a man you knew virtually nothing about yet the more shed found out rather the more she hadnt found out the deeper her curiosity had become hed been married and divorced in his early twenties that was it no anecdotes no gossip no right and wrong he covered his tracks well as a photographer for international view shade had spent a total of five years overseas not in pretty paris london and madrid but in laos lebanon cambodia his work there had earned him a pulitzer nomination and the overseas press club award his photographs were available for study and dissection but his personal life remained obscure he socialized rarely what friends he had were unswervingly loyal and frustratingly closemouthed if she wanted to learn more about him bryan would have to do it on the job bryan considered the fact that theyd agreed to spend their last day in la working at the beach a good sign theyd decided on the location without any argument beach scenes would be an ongoing theme throughout the essay california to cape cod at first they walked along the sand together like friends or lovers not touching but in step with each other they didnt talk but bryan had already learned that shade didnt make idle conversation unless he was in the mood it was barely ten but the sun was bright and hot because it was a weekday morning most of the sun and water seekers were the young or the old when bryan stopped shade kept walking without either of them saying a word it was the contrast that had caught her eye the old woman was bundled in a wide floppy sun hat a long beach dress and a crocheted shawl she sat under an umbrella and watched her granddaughter dressed only in frilly pink panties dig a hole in the sand beside her sun poured over the little girl shade blanketed the old woman shed need the woman to sign a release form invariably asking someone if you could take her picture stiffened her up and bryan avoided it whenever it was possible in this case it wasnt so she was patient enough to chat and wait until the woman had relaxed again her name was sadie and so was her granddaughters before shed clicked the shutter the first time bryan knew shed title the print two sadies all she had to do was get that dreamy faraway look back in the womans eyes it took twenty minutes bryan forgot she was uncomfortably warm as she listened thought and reasoned out the angles she knew what she wanted the old womans careful selfpreservation the little girls total lack of it and the bond between them that came with blood and time lost in reminiscence sadie forgot about the camera not noticing when bryan began to release the shutter she wanted the poignancy thats what shed seen when she printed it bryan would be merciless with the lines and creases in the grandmothers face just as shed highlight the flawlessness of the toddlers skin grateful bryan chatted a few more minutes then noted the womans address with the promise of a print she walked on waiting for the next scene to unfold shade had his first subject as well but he didnt chat the man lay facedown on a faded beach towel he was red flabby and anonymous a businessman taking the morning off a salesman from iowa it didnt matter unlike bryan he wasnt looking for personality but for the sameness of those who grilled their bodies under the sun there was a plastic bottle of tanning lotion stuck in the sand beside him and a pair of rubber beach thongs shade chose two angles and shot six times without exchanging a word with the snoring sunbather satisfied he scanned the beach three yards away bryan was casually stripping out of her shorts and shirt the sleek red maillot rose tantalizing high at the thighs her profile was to him as she stepped out of her shorts it was sharp well defined like something sculpted with a meticulous hand shade didnt hesitate he focused her in his viewfinder set the aperture adjusted the angle no more than a fraction and waited at the moment when she reached down for the hem of her tshirt he began to shoot she was so easy so unaffected hed forgotten anyone could be so totally unselfconscious in a world where selfabsorption had become a religion her body was one long lean line with more and more exposed as she drew the shirt over her head for a moment she tilted her face up to the sun inviting the heat something crawled into his stomach and began to twist slowly desire he recognized it he didnt care for it it was he could tell himself what was known in the trade as a decisive moment the photographer thinks then shoots while watching the unfolding scene when the visual and the emotional elements come together as they had in this case with a punch there was success there were no replays here no reshooting decisive moment meant exactly that all or nothing if hed been shaken for a instant it only proved hed been successful in capturing that easy lazy sexuality years before hed trained himself not to become overly emotional about his subjects they could eat you alive bryan mitchell might not look as though shed take a bite out of a man but shade didnt take chances he turned away from her and forgot her almost it was more than four hours later before their paths crossed again bryan sat in the sun near a concession stand eating a hot dog buried under mounds of mustard and relish on one side of her shed set her camera bag on the other a can of soda her narrow red sunglasses shot his reflection back at him howd it go she asked with her mouth full all right is there a hot dog under that mmm she swallowed and gestured toward the stand terrific ill pass reaching down shade picked up her warming soda and took a long pull it was orange and sweet how the hell do you drink this stuff i need a lot of sugar i got some shots im pretty pleased with she held out a hand for the can i want to make prints before we leave tomorrow as long as youre ready at seven bryan wrinkled her nose as she finished off her hot dog shed rather work until am than get up that early one of the first things theyd have to iron out on the road was the difference in their biological schedules she understood the beauty and power of a sunrise shot she just happened to prefer the mystery and color of sunset ill be ready rising she brushed sand off her bottom then pulled her tshirt over her suit shade couldve told her she was more modest without it the way the hem skimmed along her thighs and drew the eyes to them was nearly criminal as long as you drive the first shift she continued by ten ill be functional he didnt know why he did it shade was a man who analyzed each movement every texture shape color he cut everything into patterns then reassembled them that was his way impulse wasnt yet he reached out and curled his fingers around her braid without thinking of the act or the consequences he just wanted to touch she was surprised he could see but she didnt pull away nor did she give him that small half smile women used when a man couldnt resist touching what attracted him her hair was soft his eyes had told him that but now his fingers confirmed it still it was frustrating not to feel it loose and free not to be able to let it play between his fingers he didnt understand her yet she made her living recording the elite the glamorous the ostentatious yet she seemed to have no pretensions her only jewelry was a thin gold chain that fell to her breasts on the end was a tiny ankh again she wore no makeup but her scent was there to tantalize she could with a few basic female touches have turned herself into something breathtaking but she seemed to ignore the possibilities and rely on simplicity that in itself was stunning hours before bryan had decided she didnt want to be dazzled shade was deciding at that moment he didnt care to be stunned without a word he let her braid fall back to her shoulder do you want me to take you back to your apartment or your studio so that was it hed managed to tie her up in knots in a matter of seconds and now he only wanted to know where to dump her off the studio bryan reached down and picked up her camera bag her throat was dry but she tossed the halffull can of soda into the trash she wasnt certain she could swallow before theyd reached shades car she was certain shed explode if she didnt say something do you enjoy that cool remote image youve perfected shade he didnt look at her but he nearly smiled its comfortable except for the people who get within five feet of you damned if she wouldnt get a rise out of him maybe you take your own press too seriously she suggested shade colby as mysterious and intriguing as his name as dangerous and as compelling as his photographs this time he did smile surprising her abruptly he looked like someone shed want to link hands with laugh with where in hell did you read that celebrity she muttered april five years ago they did an article on the photo sales in new york one of your prints sold for seventyfive hundred at sothebys did it his gaze slid over her profile youve a better memory than i stopping she turned to face him damn it i bought it its a moody depressing fascinating street scene that i wouldnt have given ten cents for if id met you first and if i wasnt so hooked on it id pitch it out the minute i get home as it is ill probably have to turn it to face the wall for six months until i forget that the artist behind it is a jerk shade watched her soberly then nodded you make quite a speech once youre rolling with one short rude word bryan turned and started toward the car again as she reached the passenger side and yanked open the door shade stopped her since were essentially going to be living together for the next three months you might want to get the rest of it out now though she tried to speak casually it came out between her teeth the rest of what whatever griping you have to do she took a deep breath first she hated to be angry invariably it exhausted her resigned to it bryan curled her hands around the top of the door and leaned toward him i dont like you id say its just that simple but i cant think of anyone else i dont like no one no one for some reason he believed her he nodded then dropped his hands over hers on top of the door id rather not be lumped in a group in any case why should we have to like each other itd make the assignment easier he considered this while holding her hands beneath his the tops of hers were soft the palms of his hard he liked the contrast perhaps too much you like things easy he made it sound like an insult and she straightened her eyes were on a level with his mouth and she shifted slightly yes complications are just that they get in the way and muck things up id rather shovel them aside and deal with whats important weve had a major complication before we started she mightve concentrated on keeping her eyes on his but that didnt prevent her from feeling the light firm pressure of his hands it didnt prevent her from understanding his meaning since it was something theyd meticulously avoided mentioning from the beginning bryan lunged at it straight on youre a man and im a woman he couldnt help but enjoy the way she snarled it at him exactly we can say were both photographers and thats a sexless term he gave her the barest hint of a smile its also bullshit that may be she said evenly but i intend to handle it because the assignment comes first it helps a great deal that i dont like you liking doesnt have anything to do with chemistry she gave him an easy smile because her pulse was beginning to pound is that a polite word for lust she wasnt one to dance around an issue once shed opened it up fair enough he decided whatever you call it it goes right back to your complication wed better take a good look at it then shove it aside when his fingers tightened on hers she dropped her gaze to them she understood his meaning but not his reason wondering what it would be likes going to distract both of us shade continued she looked up again wary he could feel her pulse throb where his fingers brushed her wrist yet shed made no move to pull back if she had there was no use speculating it was better to move ahead well find out then well file it forget it and get on with our job it sounded logical bryan had a basic distrust of anything that sounded quite so logical still hed been right on target when hed said that wondering would be distracting shed been wondering for days his mouth seemed to be the softest thing about him yet even that looked hard firm and unyielding how would it feel how would it taste she let her gaze wander back to it and the lips curved she wasnt certain if it was amusement or sarcasm but it made up her mind all right how intimate could a kiss be when a car door separated them they leaned toward each other slowly as if each waited for the other to draw back at the last moment their lips met lightly passionlessly it couldve ended then with each of them shrugging the other off in disinterest it was the basic definition of a kiss two pairs of lips meeting nothing more neither one would be able to say who changed it whether it was calculated or accidental they were both curious people and curiosity might have been the factor or it might have been inevitable the texture of the kiss changed so slowly that it wasnt possible to stop it until it was too late for regrets lips opened invited accepted their fingers clung his head tilted and hers so that the kiss deepened bryan found herself pressing against the hard unyielding door searching for more demanding it as her teeth nipped at his bottom lip shed been right his mouth was the softest thing about him impossibly soft unreasonably luxurious as it heated on hers she wasnt used to wild swings of mood shed never experienced anything like it it wasnt possible to lie back and enjoy wasnt that what kisses were for up to now shed believed so this one demanded all her strength all her energy even as it went on she knew when it ended shed be drained wonderfully totally drained while she reveled in the excitement she could anticipate the glory of the aftermath he shouldve known damn it he shouldve known she wasnt as easy and uncomplicated as she looked hadnt he looked at her and ached tasting her wasnt going to alleviate any of it only heighten it she could undermine his control and control was essential to his art his life his sanity hed developed and perfected it over years of sweat fear and expectations shade had learned that the same calculated control he used in the darkroom the same careful logic he used to set a shot could be applied to a woman successfully painlessly one taste of bryan and he realized just how tenuous control could be to prove to himself perhaps to her that he could deal with it he allowed the kiss to deepen grow darker moister danger hovered and perhaps he courted it he might lose himself in the kiss but when it was over it would be over and nothing would be changed she tasted hot sweet strong she made him burn he had to hold back or the burn would leave a scar he had enough of them life wasnt as lovely as a first kiss on a hot afternoon he knew better than most shade drew away satisfying himself that his control was still in place perhaps his pulse wasnt steady his mind not perfectly clear but he had control bryan was reeling if hed asked her a question any question shed have had no answer bracing herself against the car door she waited for her equilibrium to return shed known the kiss would drain her even now she could feel her energy flag he saw the look in her eyes the soft look any man would have to struggle to resist shade turned away from it ill drop you at the studio as he walked around the car to his side bryan dropped down on the seat file it and forget it she thought fat chance she tried bryan put so much effort into forgetting what shade had made her feel that she worked until am by the time shed dragged herself back to her apartment shed developed the film from the school and the beach chosen the negatives she wanted to print and had perfected two of them into what she considered some of her best work now she had four hours to eat pack and sleep after building herself an enormous sandwich bryan took out the one suitcase shed been allotted for the trip and tossed in the essentials groggy with fatigue she washed down bread meat and cheese with a great gulp of milk none of it felt too steady on her stomach so she left her partially eaten dinner on the bedside table and went back to her packing she rummaged in the top of her closet for the box with the prim mantailored pajamas her mother had given her for christmas definitely essential she decided as she dropped them in among the disordered pile of lingerie and jeans they were sexless bryan mused she could only hope she felt sexless in them that afternoon shed been forcibly reminded that she was a woman and a woman had some vulnerabilities that couldnt always be defended she didnt want to feel like a woman around shade again it was too perilous and she avoided perilous situations since she wasnt the type to make a point of her femininity there should be no problem she told herself once they were started on the assignment theyd be so wound up in it that they wouldnt notice if the other had two heads and four thumbs she told herself what had happened that afternoon was simply one of those fleeting moments the photographer sometimes came across when the moment dictated the scene it wouldnt happen again because the circumstances would never be the same she told herself and then she was finished thinking of shade colby it was nearly four and the next three hours were all hers the last she had left to herself for a long time shed spend them the way she liked best asleep stripping bryan let her clothes fall in a heap then crawled into bed without remembering to turn off the light across town shade lay in the dark he hadnt slept although hed been packed for hours his bag and his equipment were neatly stacked at the door he was organized prepared and wideawake hed lost sleep before the fact didnt concern him but the reason did bryan mitchell though hed managed to push her to the side to the back to the corner of his mind throughout the evening he couldnt quite get her out he could dissect what had happened between them that afternoon point by point but it didnt change one essential thing hed been vulnerable perhaps only for an instant only a heartbeat but hed been vulnerable that was something he couldnt afford it was something he wouldnt allow to happen a second time bryan mitchell was one of the complications she claimed she liked to avoid he on the other hand was used to them hed never had any problem dealing with complications shed be no different he told himself for the next three months theyd be deep into a project that should totally involve all their time and energy when he worked he was well able to channel his concentration on one point and ignore everything else that was no problem he told himself what had happened had happened he still believed it was best done away with before they started out best that they did away with the speculation and the tension it could cause theyd eliminated the tension he told himself but he couldnt sleep the ache in his stomach had nothing to do with the dinner that had grown cold on his plate untouched he had three hours to himself then hed have three months of bryan closing his eyes shade did what he was always capable of doing under stress he willed himself to sleep chapter contents prev next bryan was up and dressed by seven but she wasnt ready to talk to anyone she had her suitcase and tripod in one hand with two camera bags and her purse slung crosswise over her shoulders as shade pulled up to the curb she was walking down the stairs and onto the sidewalk she believed in being prompt but not necessarily cheerful she grunted to shade it was as close to a greeting as she could manage at that hour in silence she loaded her gear into his van then kicked back in the passenger seat stretched out her legs and closed her eyes shade looked at what he could see of her face behind round amberlensed sunglasses and under a battered straw hat rough night he asked but she was already asleep shaking his head he released the brake and pulled out into the street they were on their way shade didnt mind long drives it gave him a chance to think or not think as he chose in less than an hour he was out of la traffic and heading northeast on the interstate he liked riding into the rising sun with a clear road ahead light bounced off the chrome on the van shimmered on the hood and sliced down on the road signs he planned to cover five or six hundred miles that day leading up toward utah unless something interesting caught his eye and they stopped for a shoot after this first day he saw no reason for them to be mileage crazy it would hamper the point of the assignment theyd drive as they needed to working toward and around the definite destinations theyd ultimately agreed on he had a route that could easily be altered and no itinerary their only time frame was to be on the east coast by labor day he turned the radio on low and found some gritty country music as he drove at a steady mileeating pace beside him bryan slept if this was her routine he mused they wouldnt have any problems as long as she was asleep they couldnt grate on each others nerves or stir each others passion even now he wondered why thoughts of her had kept him restless throughout the night what was it about her that had worried him he didnt know and that was a worry in itself shade liked to be able to put his finger on things and pick a problem apart until the pieces were small enough to rearrange to his preference even though she was quiet almost unobtrusive at the moment he didnt believe hed be able to do that with bryan mitchell after his decision to take the assignment hed made it his business to find out more about her shade might guard his personal life and snarl over his privacy but he wasnt at a loss for contacts hed known of her work for celebrity and her more inventive and personalized work for magazines like vanity and in touch shed developed into something of a cult artist over the years with her offbeat often radical photographs of the famous what he hadnt known was that she was the daughter of a painter and a poet both eccentric and semisuccessful residents of carmel shed been married to an accountant before shed been twenty and had divorced him three years later she dated with an almost studied casualness and she had vague plans about buying a beach house at malibu she was well liked respected and by all accounts dependable she was often slow in doing things a combination of her need for perfection and her belief that rushing was a waste of energy hed found nothing surprising in his research nor any clue as to his attraction to her but a photographer a successful one was patient sometimes it was necessary to come back to a subject again and again until you understood your own emotion toward it as they crossed the border into nevada shade lit a cigarette and rolled down his window bryan stirred grumbled then groped for her bag morning shade sent her a brief sidelong look mmmhmm bryan rooted through the bag then gripped the chocolate bar in relief with two quick rips she unwrapped it and tossed the trash in her purse she usually cleaned it out before it overflowed you always eat candy for breakfast caffeine she took a huge bite and sighed i prefer mine this way slowly she stretched torso shoulders arms in one long sinuous move that was completely unplanned it was shade thought ironically one definitive clue as to the attraction so where are we nevada he blew out a stream of smoke that whipped out the open window just bryan folded her legs under her as she nibbled on the candy bar it must be about my shift ill let you know okay she was content to ride as long as he was content to drive she did however give a meaningful glance at the radio country music wasnt her style driver picks the tunes he shrugged his acceptance if you want to wash that candy down with something theres some juice in a jug in the back yeah always interested in putting something into her stomach bryan unfolded herself and worked her way into the back of the van she hadnt paid any attention to the van that morning except for a bleary scan that told her it was black and well cared for there were padded benches along each side that could if you werent too choosy be suitable for beds bryan thought the pewter carpet might be the better choice shades equipment was neatly secured and hers was loaded haphazardly into a corner above glossy ebony cabinets held some essentials coffee a hot plate a small teakettle theyd come in handy she thought if they stopped in any campgrounds with electric hookups in the meantime she settled for the insulated jug of juice want some he glanced in the rearview mirror to see her standing legs spread for balance one hand resting on the cabinet yeah bryan took two jumbo styrofoam cups and the jug back to her seat all the comforts of home she commented with a jerk of her head toward the back do you travel in this much when its necessary he heard the ice thump against the styrofoam and held out his hand i dont like to fly you lose any chance youd have at getting a shot at something on the way after flipping his cigarette out the window he drank his juice if its an assignment within five hundred miles or so i drive i hate to fly bryan propped herself in the v between the seat and the door it seems im forever having to fly to new york to photograph someone who cant or wont come to me i take a bottle of dramamine a supply of chocolate bars a rabbits foot and a socially significant educational book it covers all the bases the dramamine and the rabbits foot maybe the chocolates for my nerves i like to eat when im tense the books a bargaining point she shook her glass so the ice clinked i feel like im saying see im doing something worthwhile here lets not mess it up by crashing the plane then too the book usually puts me to sleep within twenty minutes the corner of shades mouth lifted something bryan took as a hopeful sign for the several thousand miles they had to go that explains it i have a phobia about flying at thirty thousand feet in a heavy tube of metal with two hundred strangers many of whom like to tell the intimate details of their lives to the person next to them propping her feet on the dash she grinned id rather drive across country with one cranky photographer who makes it a point to tell me as little as possible shade sent her a sidelong look and decided there was no harm in playing the game as long as they both knew the rules you havent asked me anything okay well start with something basic whered shade come from the name i mean he slowed down veering off toward a rest stop shadrach her eyes widened in appreciation as in meshach and abednego in the book of daniel thats right my mother decided to give each of her offspring a name that would roll around a bit ive a sister named cassiopeia why bryan my parents wanted to show they werent sexist the minute the van stopped in a parking space bryan hopped out bent from the waist and touched her palms to the asphalt much to the interest of the man climbing in the pontiac next to her with the view fuddling his concentration it took him a full thirty seconds to fit his key in the ignition god i get so stiff she stretched up standing on her toes then dropped down again look theres a snack bar over there im going to get some fries want some its ten oclock in the morning almost tenthirty she corrected besides people eat hash browns for breakfast whats the difference he was certain there was one but didnt feel like a debate you go ahead i want to buy a paper fine as an afterthought bryan climbed back inside and grabbed her camera ill meet you back here in ten minutes her intentions were good but she took nearly twenty even as shed approached the snack bar the formation of the line of people waiting for fast food caught her imagination there were perhaps ten people wound out like a snake in front of a sign that read eat qwik they were dressed in baggy bermudas wrinkled sundresses and cotton pants a curvy teenager had on a pair of leather shorts that looked as though theyd been painted on a woman six back from the stand fanned herself with a widebrimmed hat banded with a floaty ribbon they were all going somewhere all waiting to get there and none of them paid any attention to anyone else bryan couldnt resist she walked up the line one way down it another until she found her angle she shot them from the back so that the line seemed elongated and disjointed and the sign loomed promisingly the man behind the counter serving food was nothing more than a vague shadow that might or might not have been there shed taken more than her allotted ten minutes before she joined the line herself shade was leaning against the van reading the paper when she returned hed already taken three calculated shots of the parking lot focusing on a line of cars with license plates from five different states when he glanced up bryan had her camera slung over her shoulder a giant chocolate shake in one hand and a jumbo order of fries smothered in ketchup in the other sorry she dipped into the box of fries as she walked i got a couple of good shots of the line at the snack bar half of summers hurry up and wait isnt it can you drive with all that sure she swung into the drivers side im used to it she balanced the shake between her thighs settled the fries just ahead of it and reached out a hand for the keys shade glanced down at the breakfast snuggled between very smooth very brown legs still willing to share bryan turned her head to check the rearview as she backed out nope she gave the wheel a quick turn and headed toward the exit you had your chance with one competent hand steering she dug into the fries again you eat like that you should have acne down to your navel myths she announced and zoomed past a slowermoving sedan with a few quick adjustments she had an old simon and garfunkel tune pouring out of the radio thats music she told him i like songs that give me a visual country musics usually about hurting and cheating and drinking and life bryan picked up her shake and drew on the straw maybe i guess i get tired of too much reality your work depends on it and yours often skirts around it her brows knit then she deliberately relaxed in his way he was right mine gives options whyd you take this assignment shade she asked suddenly summer in america exemplifies fun thats not your style it also equals sweat crops dying from too much sun and frazzled nerves he lit another cigarette more my style you said it i didnt she swirled the chocolate in her mouth you smoke like that youre going to die sooner or later shade opened the paper again and ended the conversation who the hell was he bryan asked herself as she leveled the speed at sixty what factors in his life had brought out the cynicism as well as the genius there was humor in him shed seen it once or twice but he seemed to allow himself only a certain degree and no more passion she could attest firsthand that there was a powder keg inside him what might set it off if she was certain of one thing about shade colby it was that he held himself in rigid control the passion the power the fury whatever label you gave it escaped into his work but not she was certain into his personal life not often in any case she knew she should be careful and distant it would be the smartest way to come out of this longterm assignment without scars yet she wanted to dig into his character and she knew shed have to give in to the temptation shed have to press the buttons and watch the results probably because she didnt like him and was attracted to him at the same time shed told him the truth when shed said that she couldnt think of anyone else she didnt like it went hand in hand with her approach to her art she looked into a person and found qualities not all of them admirable not all of them likable but something always something that she could understand she needed to do that with shade for herself and because though shed bide her time telling him she wanted very badly to photograph him shade i want to ask you something else he didnt glance up from the paper hmm whats your favorite movie half annoyed at the interruption half puzzled at the question he looked up and found himself wondering yet again what her hair would look like out of that thick untidy braid what your favorite movie she repeated i need a clue a starting point for what to find out why i find you interesting attractive and unlikable youre an odd woman bryan no not really though i have every right to be she stopped speaking a moment as she switched lanes come on shade its going to be a long trip lets humor each other on the small points give me a movie to have and have not bogart and bacalls first together it made her smile at him in the way hed already decided was dangerous good if youd named some obscure french film id have had to find something else why that one he set the paper aside so she wanted to play games it was harmless he decided and they still had a long day ahead of them onscreen chemistry tight plotting and camera work that made bogart look like the consummate hero and bacall the only woman who could stand up to him she nodded pleased he wasnt above enjoying heroes fantasies and bubbling relationships it mightve been a small point but she could like him for it movies fascinate me and the people who make them i suppose that was one of the reasons i jumped at the chance to work for celebrity ive lost count of the number of actors ive shot but when i see them up on the screen im still fascinated he knew it was dangerous to ask questions not because of the answers but the questions youd be asked in return still he wanted to know is that why you photograph the beautiful people because you want to get close to the glamour because she considered it a fair question bryan decided not to be annoyed besides it made her think about something that had simply seemed to evolve almost unplanned i mightve started out with something like that in mind before long you come to see them as ordinary people with extraordinary jobs i like finding that spark thats made them the chosen few yet for the next three months youre going to be photographing the everyday why because theres a spark in all of us id like to find it in a farmer in iowa too so he had his answer youre an idealist bryan yes she gave him a frankly interested look should i be ashamed of it he didnt like the way the calm reasonable question affected him hed had ideals of his own once and he knew how much it hurt to have them rudely taken away not ashamed he said after a moment careful they drove for hours in midafternoon they switched positions and bryan skimmed through shades discarded paper by mutual consent they left the freeway and began to travel over back roads the pattern became sporadic conversations and long silences it was early evening when they crossed the border into idaho skiing and potatoes bryan commented thats all i can think of when i think of idaho with a shiver she rolled up her window summer came slower in the north especially when the sun was low she gazed out the glass at the deepening twilight sheep hundreds of them in what seemed like miles of gray or white bundles were grazing lazily on the tough grass that bordered the road she was a woman of the city of freeways and office buildings it mightve surprised shade to know shed never been this far north nor this far east except by plane the acres of placid sheep fascinated her she was reaching for her camera when shade swore and hit the brakes bryan landed on the floor with a plop what was that for he saw at a glance that she wasnt hurt not even annoyed but simply curious he didnt bother to apologize damn sheep in the road bryan hauled herself up and looked out the windshield there were three of them lined unconcernedly across the road nearly head to tail one of them turned its head and glanced up at the van then looked away again they look like theyre waiting for a bus she decided then grabbed shades wrist before he could lean on the horn no wait a minute ive never touched one before shade could comment she was out of the van and walking toward them one of them shied a few inches away as she approached but for the most part the sheep couldnt have cared less shades annoyance began to fade as she leaned over and touched one he thought another woman might look the same as she stroked a sable at a furrier pleased tentative and oddly sexual and the light was good taking his camera he selected a filter how do they feel soft not as soft as id thought alive nothing like a lambswool coat still bent over one hand on the sheep bryan looked up it surprised her to be facing a camera whats that for discovery hed already taken two shots but wanted more discovery has a lot to do with summer how do they smell intrigued bryan leaned closer to the sheep he framed her when her face was all but buried in the wool like sheep she said with a laugh and straightened want to play with the sheep and ill take your picture maybe next time she looked as if she belonged there on the long deserted road surrounded by stretches of empty land and it puzzled him hed thought she set well in la in the center of the glitz and illusions something wrong she knew he was thinking of her only of her when he looked at her like that she wished she couldve taken it a step further yet was oddly relieved that she couldnt you acclimate well her smile was hesitant its simpler that way i told you i dont like complications he turned back to the truck deciding he was thinking about her too much lets see if we can get these sheep to move but shade you cant just leave them on the side of the road she jogged back to the van theyll wander right back out they might get run over he gave her a look that said he clearly wasnt interested what do you expect me to do round em up the least we can do is get them back over the fence as if hed agreed wholeheartedly bryan turned around and started back to the sheep as he watched she reached down hauled one up and nearly toppled over the other two bleated and scattered heavier than they look she managed and began to stagger toward the fence strung along the shoulder of the road while the sheep she carried bleated kicked and struggled it wasnt easy but after a test of wills and brute strength she dropped the sheep over the fence with one hand she swiped at the sweat on her forehead as she turned to scowl at shade well are you going to help or not hed enjoyed the show but he didnt smile as he leaned against the van theyll probably find the hole in the fence again and be back on the road in ten minutes maybe they will bryan said between her teeth as she headed for the second sheep but ill have done what should be done idealist he said again with her hands on her hips she whirled around cynic as long as we understand each other shade straightened ill give you a hand the others werent as easily duped as the first it took shade several exhausting minutes to catch number two with bryan running herd twice he lost his concentration and his quarry because her sudden husky laughter distracted him two down and one to go he announced as he set the sheep free in pasture but this one looks stubborn from opposite sides of the road the rescuers and the rescuee studied each other shifty eyes bryan murmured i think hes the leader she whatever look just be nonchalant you walk around that side ill walk around this side when we have her in the middle wham shade sent her a cautious look wham just follow my lead tucking her thumbs in her back pockets she strolled across the road whistling bryan youre trying to outthink a sheep she sent him a bland look over her shoulder maybe between the two of us we can manage to he wasnt at all sure she was joking his first urge was to simply get back in the van and wait until shed finished making a fool of herself then again theyd already wasted enough time shade circled around to the left as bryan moved to the right the sheep eyed them both swiveling her head from side to side now bryan shouted and dived without giving himself the chance to consider the absurdity shade lunged from the other side the sheep danced delicately away momentum carrying them both shade and bryan collided then rolled together onto the soft shoulder of the road shade felt the rush of air as they slammed into each other and the soft give of her body as they tumbled together with the breath knocked out of her bryan lay on her back half under shade his body was very hard and very male she might not have had her wind but bryan had her wit she knew if they stayed like this things were going to get complicated drawing in air she stared up into his face just above her his look was contemplative considering and not altogether friendly he wouldnt be a friendly lover that she knew instinctively it was in his eyes those dark deepset eyes he was definitely a man to avoid having a personal involvement with hed overwhelm quickly completely and thered be no turning back she had to remind herself that she preferred easy relationships as her heart started a strong steady rhythm missed she managed to say but didnt try to move away yeah she had a stunning face all sharp angles and soft skin shade could nearly convince himself that his interest in it was purely professional shed photograph wonderfully from any angle in any light he could make her look like a queen or a peasant but shed always look like a woman a man would want the lazy sexuality he could sense in her would come across in the photograph just looking at her he could plot half a dozen settings hed like to shoot her in and he could think of dozens of ways hed like to make love to her here was first on the cool grass along the roadside with the sun setting behind them and no sound she saw the decision in his eyes saw it in time to avoid the outcome but she didnt she had only to shift away only to protest with one word or a negative movement but she didnt her mind told her to arguing with an urge that was unarguably physical later bryan would wonder why she hadnt listened now with the air growing cool and the sky darkening she wanted the experience she couldnt admit that she wanted him when he lowered his mouth to hers there wasnt any of the light experimentation of the first time now he knew her and wanted the full impact of her passion their mouths met greedily as if each one were racing the other to delirium her body heated so quickly that the grass seemed to shimmer like ice beneath her she wondered it didnt melt it was a jolt that left her bewildered with a small sound in her throat bryan reached for more his fingers were in her hair tangled in the restriction of her braid as if he didnt choose or didnt dare to touch her yet she moved under him not in retreat but in advance hold me she seemed to demand give me more but he continued to make love only to her mouth devastatingly she could hear the breeze it tickled through the grass beside her ear and taunted her hed give sparingly of himself she could feel it in the tenseness of his body hed hold back while his mouth stripped away her defenses one by one he held himself apart frustrated bryan ran her hands up his back shed seduce shade wasnt used to the pressure to give to the desire to she drew from him a need for merging hed thought hed beaten down years before there seemed to be no pretenses in her her mouth was warm and eager tasting of generosity her body was soft and agile tempting her scent drifted around him sexual uncomplicated when she said his name there seemed to be no hidden meaning for the first time in too long for him to remember he wanted to give unheedingly boundlessly he held himself back pretenses he knew could be well hidden but he was losing to her even though shade was fully aware of it he couldnt stop it she drew and drew from him with a simplicity that couldnt be blocked he mightve sworn against it cursed her cursed himself but his mind was beginning to swim his body was throbbing they both felt the ground tremble but it didnt occur to either of them that it was anything but their own passion they heard the noise the rumble growing louder and louder and each thought it was inside his or her own head then the wind rocketed by them and the truck driver gave one long rude blast of the horn it was enough to jolt them back to sanity feeling real panic for the first time bryan scrambled to her feet wed better take care of that sheep and get going she swore at the breathiness of her own voice and wrapped her arms protectively around herself there was a chill in the air she thought desperately that was all its nearly dark shade hadnt realized how deep the twilight had become hed lost track of his surroundings something he never allowed to happen hed forgotten that they were on the side of the road rolling in the grass like a couple of brainless teenagers he felt the lick of anger but stemmed it hed nearly lost control once he wouldnt lose it now she caught the sheep on the other side of the road where it grazed certain that both humans had lost interest it bleated in surprised protest as she scooped it up swearing under his breath shade stalked over and grabbed the sheep from her before bryan could take another tumble he dumped it unceremoniously into pasture satisfied now he demanded she could see the anger in him no matter how tightly he reined it in her own bubbled shed had her share of frustrations as well her body was pulsing her legs unsteady temper helped her to forget them no she tossed back and neither are you it seems to me that should prove to both of us that wed better keep a nice clean distance he grabbed her arm as she started to swing past i didnt force you into anything bryan nor i you she reminded him im responsible for my own actions shade she glanced down at the hand that was curled around her arm and my own mistakes if you like to shift blame its your prerogative his fingers tightened on her arm briefly but long enough for her eyes to widen in surprise at the strength and the depth of his anger no she wasnt used to wild swings of mood in herself or causing them in others slowly and with obvious effort shade loosened his grip shed hit it right on the mark he couldnt argue with honesty no he said a great deal more calmly ill take my share bryan itll be easier on both of us if we agree to that nice clean distance she nodded steadier her lips curved into a slight smile okay lighten up she warned herself for everyones sake itd been easier from the beginning if youd been fat and ugly hed grinned before hed realized it you too well since i dont suppose either of us is willing to do anything about that particular problem we just have to work around it agreed she held out her hand agreed their hands joined a mistake neither of them had recovered from the jolt to their systems the contact however casual only served to accentuate it bryan linked her hands behind her back shade dipped his into his pockets well bryan began with no idea where to go lets find a diner before we head into camp tomorrows going to start early she wrinkled her nose at that but started toward her side of the truck im starving she announced and pretended she was in control by propping her feet on the dash think well find something decent to eat soon or should i fortify myself with a candy bar theres a town about ten miles down this road shade turned on the ignition his hand was steady he told himself or nearly bound to be a restaurant of some kind probably serve great lamb chops bryan looked at the sheep grazing beside them then sent shade a narrowedeyed glance thats disgusting yeah and itll keep your mind off your stomach until we eat they bumped back onto the road and drove in silence theyd made it over a hump but each of them knew thered be mountains yet to struggle over steep rocky mountains chapter contents prev next bryan recorded vacationers floating like corks in the great salt lake when the shot called for it she used a long or a wide angle lens to bring in some unusual part of the landscape but for the most part bryan concentrated on the people in the salt flats to the west shade framed race car enthusiasts he angled for the speed the dust the grit more often than not the people included in his pictures would be anonymous blurred shadowy he wanted only the essence trips to large cities and through tidy suburbs used up rolls of film there were summer gardens hot sweaty traffic jams young girls in thin dresses shirtless men and babies in strollers being pushed along sidewalks and in shopping malls their route through idaho and utah had been winding but steady neither was displeased with the pace or the subjects for a time after the turbulent detour on the country road in idaho bryan and shade worked side by side in relative harmony they concentrated on their own subjects but they did little as a team theyd already taken hundreds of pictures a fraction of which would be printed and still a smaller fraction published once it occurred to bryan that the pictures theyd taken far outnumbered the words theyd spoken to each other they drove together up to eight hours a day stopping along the way whenever it was necessary or desirable to work and they worked as much as they drove out of each twentyfour hours they were together an average of twenty but they grew no closer it was something either of them might have accomplished with the ease of a friendly gesture or a few casual words it was something both of them avoided bryan learned it was possible to keep an almost obsessive emotional distance from someone while sharing a limited space she also learned a limited space made it very difficult to ignore what shade had once termed chemistry to balance the two bryan kept her conversations light and brief and almost exclusively centered on the assignment she asked no more questions shade volunteered no more information by the time they crossed the border into arizona at the end of the first week she was already finding it an uncomfortable way to work it was hot the sun was merciless the vans airconditioning helped but just looking out at the endless desert and faded sage made the mouth dry bryan had an enormous paper cup filled with soda and ice shade drank bottled iced tea as he drove she estimated that they hadnt exchanged a word for fiftyseven miles nor had they spoken much that morning when theyd set up to shoot each in separate territory at glen canyon in utah bryan might be pleased with the study shed done on the cars lined up at the parks entrance but she was growing weary of their unspoken agreement of segregation the magazine had hired them as a team she reminded herself each of them would take individual pictures naturally but there had to be some communication if the photo essay were to have any cohesion there had to be some blending if the final result was the success both of them wanted compromise she remembered with a sigh theyd forgotten the operative word bryan thought she knew shade well enough at this point to be certain hed never make the first move he was perfectly capable of driving thousands of miles around the country without saying her name more than once a day as in pass the salt bryan she could be stubborn bryan thought about it as she brooded out the window at the wide stretches of arizona she could be just as aloof as he and she admitted with a grimace she could bore herself to death within another twentyfour hours contact she decided she simply couldnt survive without some kind of contact even if it was with a hardedged casually rude cynic her only choice was to swallow her pride and make the first move herself she gritted her teeth gnawed on ice and thought about it for another ten minutes ever been to arizona shade tossed his empty bottle into the plastic can they used for trash no bryan pried off one sneaker with the toe of the other if at first you dont succeed she told herself they filmed outcast in sedona now that was a tough thinkingmans western she mused and received no response i spent three days there covering the filming for celebrity after adjusting her sun visor she sat back again i was lucky enough to miss my plane and get another day i spent it in oak creek canyon ive never forgotten it the colors the rock formations it was the longest speech shed made in days shade negotiated the van around a curve and waited for the rest okay she thought shed get more than one word out of him if she had to use a crowbar a friend of mine settled there lee used to work for celebrity now shes a novelist with her first book due out in the fall she married hunter brown last year the writer two words she thought smug yes have you read his stuff this time shade merely nodded and pulled a cigarette out of his pocket bryan began to sympathize with dentists who had to coax a patient to open wide ive read everything hes written then i hate myself for letting his books give me nightmares good horror fictions supposed to make you wake up at am and wonder if youve locked your doors this time she grinned that sounds like something hunter would say youll like him shade merely moved his shoulders hed agreed to the stop in sedona already but he wasnt interested in taking flattering commercial pictures of the occult king and his family it would however give shade the break he needed if he could dump bryan off for a day or two with her friends he could take the time to get his system back to normal he hadnt had an easy moment since the day theyd started out of la every day that went by only tightened his nerves and played havoc with his libido hed tried but it wasnt possible to forget she was there within arms reach at night separated from him only by the width of the van and the dark yes he could use a day away from her and that natural easy sexuality she didnt even seem aware of you havent seen them for a while he asked her not in months bryan relaxed more at ease now that theyd actually begun a twoway conversation lees a good friend ive missed her shell have a baby about the same time her book comes out the change in her voice had him glancing over there was something softer about her now almost wistful a year ago we were both still with celebrity and now she turned to him but the shaded glasses hid her eyes its odd thinking of lee settled down with a family she was always more ambitious than me it used to drive her crazy that i took everything with such a lack of intensity do you just about everything she murmured not you she thought to herself i dont seem to be able to take you easily its simpler to relax and live she went on than to worry about how youll be living next month some people have to worry if theyll be living next month do you think the fact they worry about it changes things bryan forgot her plan to make contact forgot the fact that shed been groping for some sort of compromise from him hed seen more than shed seen of the world of life she had to admit that hed seen more than she wanted to see but how did he feel about it being aware can change things looking out for yourselfs a priority some of us havent a choice about some of us she noted the phrase but decided not to pounce on it if he had scars he was entitled to keep them covered until theyd faded a bit more everyone worries from time to time she decided im just not very good at it i suppose it comes from my parents theyre she trailed off and laughed it occurred to him he hadnt heard her laugh in days and that hed missed it i guess theyre whats termed bohemians we lived in this little house in carmel that was always in varying states of disrepair my father would get a notion to take out a wall or put in a window then in the middle of the project hed get an inspiration go back to his canvases and leave the mess where it lay she settled back no longer aware that she was doing all the talking and shade all the listening my mother liked to cook trouble was youd never know what mood shed be in you might have grilled rattlesnake one day cheeseburgers the next then when you least expected it thered be goose neck stew goose neck stew i ate at the neighbors a lot the memory brought on her appetite taking out two candy bars she offered one to shade how about your parents he unwrapped the candy absently while he paced his speed to the state police car in the next lane they retired to florida my father fishes and my mother runs a craft shop not as colorful as yours im afraid colorful she thought about it and approved i never knew they were unusual until id gone away to college and realized that most kids parents were grown up and sensible i guess i never realized how much id been influenced by them until rob pointed out things like most people preferring to eat dinner at six rather than scrounging for popcorn or peanut butter at ten oclock at night rob she glanced over quickly then straight ahead shade listened too well she decided it made it too easy to say more than you intended my exhusband she knew she shouldnt still see the ex as a stigma these days it was nearly a status symbol for bryan it was the symbol that proved she hadnt done what was necessary to keep a promise still sore hed asked before he could stop himself she made him want to offer comfort when hed schooled himself not to become involved in anyones life anyones problem no it was years ago after a quick shrug she nibbled on her candy bar sore she thought again no not sore but perhaps shed always be just a little tender just sorry it didnt work out i suppose regrets are more a waste of time than worrying maybe you were married once too thats right his tone couldnt have been more dismissive bryan gave him a long steady look sacred territory i dont believe in rehashing the past this wound was covered with scar tissue she mused she wondered if it troubled him much or if hed truly filed it away in either case it wasnt her business nor was it the way to keep the ball rolling between them when did you decide to become a photographer that was a safe topic she reflected there shouldnt be any tender points when i was five and got my hands on my fathers new millimeter when he had the film developed he discovered three closeups of the family dog im told he didnt know whether to congratulate me or give me solitary confinement when they turned out to be better than any of his shots bryan grinned whatd he do he bought me a camera of my own you were way ahead of me she commented i didnt have any interest in cameras until high school just sort of fell into it up until then id wanted to be a star an actress no she grinned again a star any kind of a star as long as i had a rolls a gold lame dress and a big tacky diamond he had to grin she seemed to have the talent for forcing it out of him an unassuming child no materialistic she offered him her drink but he shook his head that stage coincided with my parents returntotheearth period i guess it was my way of rebelling against people who were almost impossible to rebel against he glanced down at her ringless hands and her faded jeans guess you got over it i wasnt made to be a star anyway they needed someone to take pictures of the football team bryan finished off the candy bar and wondered how soon they could stop for lunch i volunteered because i had a crush on one of the players draining her soda she dumped the cup in with shades bottle after the first day i fell in love with the camera and forgot all about the defensive lineman his loss bryan glanced over surprised by the offhand compliment that was a nice thing to say colby i didnt think you had it in you he didnt quite defeat the smile dont get used to it heaven forbid but she was a great deal more pleased than his casual words warranted anyway my parents were thrilled when i became an obsessive photographer theyd lived with this deadly fear that i had no creative drives and would end up being a smashing business success instead of an artist so now youre both she thought about it a moment odd how easy it was to forget about one aspect of her work when she concentrated so hard on the other i suppose youre right just dont mention it to mom and dad they wont hear it from me they both saw the construction sign at the same time whether either of them realized it their minds followed the same path bryan was already reaching for her camera when shade slowed and eased off the road ahead of them a road crew patched graded and sweat under the high arizona sun shade walked off to consider the angle that would show the team and machinery battling against the erosion of the road a battle that would be waged on roads across the country each summer as long as roads existed bryan homed in on one man he was bald and had a yellow bandanna tied around his head to protect the vulnerable dome of his scalp his face and neck were reddened and damp his belly sagging over the belt of his work pants he wore a plain white tshirt pristine compared to the colorful ones slashed with sayings and pictures the workmen around him chose to get in close she had to talk to him and deal with the comments and grins from the rest of the crew she did so with an aplomb and charm that wouldve caused a public relations expert to rub his hands together bryan was a firm believer that the relationship between the photographer and the subject showed through in the final print so first in her own way she had to develop one shade kept his distance he saw the men as a team the sunburned faceless team that worked roads across the country and had done so for decades he wanted no relationship with any of them nothing that would color the way he saw them as they stood bent and dug he took a telling shot of the grime dust and sweat bryan learned that the foremans name was al and hed worked for the road commission for twentytwo years it took her a while to ease her way around his selfconsciousness but once she got him talking about what the miserable winter had done to his road everything clicked sweat dribbled down his temple when he reached up with one beefy arm to swipe at it bryan had her picture the impulsive detour took them thirty minutes by the time they piled back in the van they were sweating as freely as the laborers are you always so personal with strangers shade asked her as he switched on the engine and the airconditioning when i want their picture sure bryan opened the cooler and pulled out one of the cold cans shed stocked and another bottle of iced tea for shade you get what you wanted yeah hed watched her at work normally they separated but this time hed been close enough to see just how she went about her job shed treated the road man with more respect and good humor than many photographers treated their hundreddollaranhour models and she hadnt done it just for the picture though shade wasnt sure she realized it shed been interested in the man who he was what he was and why once a long time before shade had had that kind of curiosity now he strapped it down knowing involved you but it wasnt easy he was discovering to strap down his curiosity about bryan already shed told him more than hed have asked not more than he wanted to know but more than hed have asked it still wasnt enough for nearly a week hed backed off from her just as far as it was possible under the circumstances he hadnt stopped wanting her he might not like to rehash the past but it wasnt possible to forget that last molten encounter on the roadside hed closed himself off but now she was opening him up again he wondered if it was foolish to try to fight it and the attraction they had for each other it might be better simpler more logical to just let things progress to the only possible conclusion theyd sleep together burn the passion out and get back to the assignment cold calculated perhaps but hed do nothing except follow the already routed course he knew it was important to keep the emotions cool and the mind sharp hed let his emotions fuddle his logic and his perception before in cambodia a sweet face and a generous smile had blinded him to treachery shades fingers tightened on the wheel without his realizing it hed learned a lesson about trust then it was only the flip side of betrayal whereve you gone bryan asked quietly a look had come into his eyes she didnt understand and wasnt certain she wanted to he turned his head for an instant she was caught in the turmoil in the dark place he remembered too well and she knew nothing about then it was over his eyes were remote and calm his fingers eased on the wheel well stop in page he said briefly get some shots of the boats and tourists on lake powell before we go down to the canyon all right he hadnt been thinking of her bryan could comfort herself with that she hoped the look that had come into his eyes would never be applied to her even so she was determined that sooner or later shed discover the reason for it she couldve gotten some good technical shots of the dam but as they passed through the tiny town of page heading for the lake bryan saw the high golden arches shimmering behind waves of heat it made her grin cheeseburgers and fries werent just summer pastimes theyd become a way of life food for all seasons but she couldnt resist the sight of the familiar building settled low below the town almost isolated like a mirage in the middle of the desert she rolled down her window and waited for the right angle gotta eat she said as she framed the building just gotta she clicked the shutter resigned shade pulled into the lot get it to go he ordered as bryan started to hop out i want to get to the marina swinging her purse over her shoulder she disappeared inside shade didnt have the chance to become impatient before she bounded back out again with two white bags cheap fast and wonderful she told him as she slid back into her seat i dont know how id make it through life if i couldnt get a cheeseburger on demand she pulled out a wrapped burger and handed it to him i got extra salt she said over her first taste of fries mmm im starving you wouldnt be if youd eat something besides a candy bar for breakfast id rather be awake when i eat she mumbled involved in unwrapping her burger shade unwrapped his own he hadnt asked her to bring him anything hed already learned it was typical of her to be carelessly considerate perhaps the better word was naturally but it wasnt typical of him to be moved by the simple offer of a piece of meat in a bun he reached in a bag and brought out a paper napkin youre going to need this bryan grinned took it folded her legs under her and dug in amused shade drove leisurely to the marina they rented a boat what bryan termed a putput it was narrow open and about the size of a canoe it would however carry them and what equipment they chose out on the lake she liked the little marina with its food stands and general stores with displays of suntan oil and bathing suits the season was in full swing people strolled by dressed in shorts and coverups in hats and sunglasses she spotted a teenage couple brown and gleaming on a bench licking at dripping icecream cones because they were so involved with each other bryan was able to take some candid shots before the paperwork on the rental was completed ice cream and suntans it was a simple cheerful way to look at summer satisfied she secured her camera in its bag and went back to shade do you know how to drive a boat he sent her a mild look as they walked down the dock ill manage a woman in a neat white shirt and shorts gave them a rundown pointing out the life jackets and explaining the engine before she handed them a glossy map of the lake bryan settled herself in the bow and prepared to enjoy herself the nice thing about this she called over the engine is its so unexpected she swept one arm out to indicate the wide expanse of blue redhued mesas and sheer rock walls rose up steeply to cradle the lake settled placidly where man had put it the combination was fascinating to her another time she mightve done a study on the harmony and power that could result in a working relationship between human imagination and nature it wasnt necessary to know all the technical details of the dam of the labor force that built it it was enough that it was that they were here cutting through water that had once been desert sending up a spray that had once been sand shade spotted a tidy cabin cruiser and veered in its direction for the moment hed navigate and leave the camera work to bryan itd been a long time since hed spent a hot afternoon on the water his muscles began to relax even as his perception sharpened before he was done hed have to take some pictures of the rocks the texture in them was incredible even in their reflection on the water their colors slashed against the blue lake made them look surreal hed make the prints sharp and crisp to accent the incongruity he edged a bit closer to the cabin cruiser as he planned the shot for later bryan took out her camera without any definite plan she hoped thered be a party of people perhaps greased up against the sun children maybe giddy with the wind and water as shade steered she glanced toward the stern and lifted the camera quickly it was too good to be true poised at the stern of the cruiser was a hound bryan couldnt think of any other description for the floppy dog his big ears were blowing back his tongue lolling as he stared down at the water over his chestnut fur was a bright orange life vest go around again she yelled to shade she waited impatiently for the angle to come to her again there were people on the boat at least five of them but they no longer interested her just the dog she thought as she gnawed on her lip and waited she wanted nothing but the dog in the life jacket leaning out and staring down at the water there were towering mesas just behind the boat bryan had to decide quickly whether to work them in or frame them out if shed had more time to think she opted against the drama and settled on the fun shade had circled the trim little cruiser three times before she was satisfied wonderful with a laugh bryan lowered her camera that one prints going to be worth the whole trip he veered off to the right why dont we see what else we can dig up anyway they worked for two hours shifting positions after the first stripped to the waist as defense against the heat shade knelt at the bow and focused in on a tour boat the rock wall rose in the background the water shimmered cool and blue along the rail the people were no more than a blur of color thats what he wanted the anonymity of tours and the power of what drew the masses to them while shade worked bryan kept the speed low and looked at everything shed decided after one glimpse of his lean tanned torso that itd be wiser for her to concentrate on the scenery if she hadnt been she mightve missed the cove and the rock island that curved over it look without hesitating she steered toward it then cut the engines until the boat drifted in its own wake come on lets take a swim before he could comment shed hopped out in the ankledeep water and was securing the lines with rocks wearing a snug tank top and drawstring shorts bryan dashed down to the cove and sank in over her head when she surfaced laughing shade was standing on the island above her fabulous she called out come on shade we havent taken an hour to play since we started she was right about that hed seen to it not that he hadnt needed to relax but hed thought it best not to around her he knew even as he watched her smoothly treading in the rockshadowed water that it was a mistake yet hed told himself it was logical to stop fighting what would happen between them following the logic he walked down to the water its like opening a present she decided shifting onto her back to float briefly i had no idea i was being slowly boiled until i stepped in here with a sigh she dipped under the water and rose again so that it flowed from her face there was a pond a few miles away from home when i was a kid i practically lived there in the summer the water was seductive almost painfully so as shade lowered himself into it he felt the heat drain but not the tension sooner or later he knew hed have to find an outlet for it we did a lot better here than i expected to lazily she let the water play through her fingers i cant wait to get to sedona and start developing she tossed her dripping braid behind her back and sleep in a real bed you dont seem to have any trouble sleeping one of the first things hed noticed was that she could fall asleep anywhere anytime and within seconds of shutting her eyes oh its not the sleeping its the waking up and waking up only a few feet away from him morning after morning seeing his face shadowed by a nights growth of beard dangerously attractive seeing his muscles ripple as he stretched dangerously strong no she couldnt deny that the accommodations occasionally gave her a few twinges you know she began casually the budget could handle a couple of motel rooms every week or so nothing outrageous a real mattress and a private shower you know some of those campgrounds weve stopped in advertise hot water with their tongues in their cheeks he had to smile it hadnt given him much pleasure to settle for tepid water after a long day on the road but there was no reason to make it too easy on her cant handle roughing it bryan she stretched out on her back again deliberately kicking water up and over him oh i dont mind roughing it she said blandly i just like to do it on my own time and im not ashamed to say id rather spend the weekend at the beverly wilshire than rubbing two sticks together in the wilderness she closed her eyes and let her body drift wouldnt you yeah with the admission he reached out grabbed her braid and tugged her head under the move surprised her but it pleased her as well even as she came up sputtering so he was capable of a frivolous move from time to time it was something else she could like him for im an expert on water games she warned him as she began to tread again water suits you when had he relaxed he couldnt pinpoint the moment when the tension began to ease from him there was something about her laziness no that wasnt true she worked every bit as hard as he though in her own fashion easiness was a better word he decided she was an easy woman comfortable with herself and whatever surroundings she found herself in it looks pretty good on you too narrowing her eyes bryan focused on him something shed avoided for several days if she didnt allow herself a clear look it helped bank down on the feelings he brought out in her many of them werent comfortable and shade had been right she was a woman who liked to be comfortable but now with the water lapping cool around her and the only sound that of boats putting in the distance she wanted to enjoy him his hair was damp and tangled around his face which was as relaxed as shed ever seen it there didnt seem to be any secrets in his eyes just now he was nearly too lean but there were muscles in his forearms in his back she already knew just how strong his hands were she smiled at him because she wasnt sure just how many quiet moments theyd share you dont let up on yourself enough shade no no you know she floated again because treading took too much effort i think deep down really deep down theres a nice person in you no there isnt but she heard the humor in his voice oh its buried in there somewhere if you let me do your portrait id find it he liked the way she floated in the water there was absolutely no energy expended she lay there trusting buoyancy he was nearly certain that if she lay quietly for five minutes shed be asleep would you he murmured i think we can both do without that she opened her eyes again but had to squint against the sun to see him it was at his back glaring maybe you can but ive already decided to do it once i know you better he circled her ankle with his finger lightly you have to have my cooperation to do both ill get it the contact was more potent than she could handle shed tensed before she could stop it and so she realized after a long ten seconds had he casually she let her legs drop the waters getting cold she swam toward the boat with smooth strokes and a racing heart shade waited a moment no matter what direction he took with her he always ended up in the same place he wanted her but wasnt certain he could handle the consequences of acting on that desire worse now she was perilously close to becoming his friend that wouldnt make things any easier on either of them slowly he swam out of the cove and toward the boat but she wasnt there puzzled he looked around and started to call when he saw her perched high on the rock shed unbraided her hair and was brushing it dry in the sun her legs were folded under her her face tilted up the thin summer clothes she wore were drenched and clung to every curve she obviously didnt care it was the sun she sought the heat just as shed sought the cool water only moments before shade reached in his camera bag and attached his long lens he wanted her to fill the viewfinder he focused and framed her for the second time her careless sexuality gave him a staggering roundhouse punch he was a professional shade reminded himself as he set the depth of field he was shooting a subject that was all but when she turned her head and her eyes met his through the lens he felt the passion sizzle from himself and from her they held each other there a moment separated yet irrevocably joined he took the picture and as he did shade knew he was recording a great deal more than a subject a bit steadier bryan rose and worked her way down the curve of the rock she had to remind herself to play it lightly something that had always come easily to her you didnt get a release form colby she reminded nun as she dropped her brush into her oversize bag reaching out he touched her hair it was damp hanging rich and heavy to her waist his fingers curled into it his eyes locked on hers i want you she felt her legs liquefy and heat started somewhere in the pit of her stomach and spread out to her fingertips he was a hard man bryan reminded herself he wouldnt give but take in the end shed need him to do both thats not good enough for me she said steadily people want all the time a new car a color tv i have to have more than that she stepped around him and into the boat without a word shade joined her and they drifted away from the cove as the boat picked up speed both of them wondered if shade could give any more than what hed offered chapter contents prev next bryan had romanticized oak creek canyon over the years since shed been there when she saw it again she wasnt disappointed it had all the rich strength all the colors shed remembered campers would be pocketed through it she knew theyd be worth some time and some film amateur and serious fishermen by the creek she mused with their intense expressions and colorful lures evening campfires with roasting marshmallows coffee in tin cups yes it would be well worth the stop they planned to stay for three days working developing and printing bryan was itching to begin but before they drove into town to handle the details theyd agreed to stop in the canyon where bryan could see lee and her family according to the directions there should be a little dirt road leading off to the right just beyond a trading post shade watched for it he too was anxious to begin some of the shots hed taken were pulling at him to bring them to life he needed the concentration and quiet of the darkroom the solitude of it he needed to let his creativity flow and hold in his hands the results the picture of bryan sitting on the island of rock he didnt like to dwell on that one but he knew it would be the first roll he developed the important thing was that hed have the time and the distance hed promised himself once he dropped her at her friends and he was certain theyd want her to stay with them he could go into sedona rent the darkroom and a motel room for himself after living with her for twentyfour hours a day he was counting on a few days apart to steady his system theyd each work on whatever they chose the town the canyon the landscape that gave him room hed work out a schedule for the darkroom with luck they wouldnt so much as see each other for the next three days there it is bryan told him though hed already seen the narrow road and slowed for it she looked at the steep treelined road and shook her head god id never have pictured lee here its so wild and rough and shes well elegant hed known a few elegant women in his life hed lived with one shade glanced at the terrain whats she doing here then she fell in love bryan said simply and leaned forward theres the house fabulous glass and style thats what she thought of it it wasnt the distinguished town house she would have imagined for lee but bryan could see how it would suit her friend there were flowers blooming bright redorange blossoms she couldnt identify the grass was thick the trees leafy in the driveway were two vehicles a dusty latemodel jeep and a shiny creamcolored sedan as they pulled up behind the jeep a huge silvergray form bounded around the side of the house shade swore in sheer astonishment that must be santanas bryan laughed but gave the dog a wary goingover with her door firmly closed fascinated shade watched the muscles bunch as the dog moved but the tail was wagging the tongue lolling some pet he decided it looks like a wolf yeah she continued to look out the window as the dog paced up and down the side of the van lee tells me hes friendly fine you go first bryan shot him a look that he returned with a casual smile letting out a deep breath bryan opened the door nice dog she told him as she stepped out keeping one hand on the handle of the door nice santanas i read somewhere that brown raised wolves shade said carelessly as he stepped out of the opposite side cute bryan mumbled and cautiously offered her hand for the dog to sniff he did so and obviously liked her because he knocked her to the ground in one bounding leap shade was around the van before bryan had a chance to draw a breath fear and fury had carried him but whatever he mightve done was stopped by the sound of a high whistle santanas a young girl darted around the house braids flying cut it out right now youre not supposed to knock people down caught in the act the huge dog plopped down on his belly and somehow managed to look innocent hes sorry the girl looked at the tense man looming over the dog and the breathless woman sprawled beside him he just gets excited when company comes are you bryan bryan managed a nod as the dog dropped his head on her arm and looked up at her its a funny name i thought youd look funny too but you dont im sarah hello sarah catching her wind bryan looked up at shade this is shade colby is that a real name sarah demanded yeah shade looked down as the girl frowned up at him he wanted to scold her for not handling her dog but found he couldnt she had dark serious eyes that made him want to crouch down and look into them from her level a heartbreaker he decided give her ten years and shell break them all sounds like something from one of my dads books i guess its okay she grinned down at bryan and shuffled her sneakers in the dirt both she and her dog looked embarrassed im really sorry santanas knocked you down youre not hurt or anything are you since it was the first time anyone had bothered to ask bryan thought about it no well maybe you wont say anything to my dad sarah flashed a quick smile and showed her braces he gets mad when santanas forgets his manners santanas swiped an enormous pink tongue over bryans shoulder no harm done she decided great well go tell them youre here she was off in a bound the dog clambered up and raced after her without giving bryan a backward look well it doesnt look like lees settled for a dull life bryan commented shade reached down and hauled her to her feet hed been frightened he realized seriously frightened for the first time in years and all because a little girls pet had knocked down his partner you okay yeah with quick swipes she began to brush the dirt off her jeans shade ran his hands up her arms stopping her cold sure yes i she trailed off as her thoughts twisted into something incoherent he wasnt supposed to look at her like that she thought as though he really cared she wished hed look at her like that again and again his fingers were barely touching her arms she wished hed touch her like this again and again im fine she managed finally but it was hardly more than a whisper and her eyes never left his he kept his hands on her arms that dog had to weigh a hundred and twenty he didnt mean any harm why she wondered vaguely were they talking about a dog when there really wasnt anything important but him and her im sorry his thumb skimmed over the inside of her elbow where the skin was as soft as hed once imagined her pulse beat like an engine i shouldve gotten out first instead of playing around if shed been hurt he wanted to kiss her now right now when he was thinking only of her and not the reasons that he shouldnt it doesnt matter she murmured and found that her hands were resting on his shoulders their bodies were close just brushing who had moved it doesnt matter she said again half to herself as she leaned closer their lips hovered hesitated then barely touched from the house came the deep frantic sound of barking they drew back from each other with something close to a jerk bryan lee let the door slam behind her as she came onto the porch it wasnt until shed already called out that she noticed how intent the two people in her driveway were on each other with a quick shudder bryan took another step back before she turned too many feelings was all she could think too many feelings too quickly lee she ran over or ran away she wasnt certain all she knew was at that moment she needed someone grateful she felt herself closed in lees arms oh god its so good to see you the greeting was just a little desperate lee took a long look over bryans shoulder at the man who remained several paces back her first impression was that he wanted to stay that way separate what had bryan gotten herself into she wondered and gave her friend a fierce hug ive got to look at you bryan insisted laughing now as the tension drained the elegant face the carefully styled hair they were the same but the woman wasnt bryan could feel it before she glanced down to the rounded swell beneath lees crisp summer dress youre happy bryan gripped lees hands it shows no regrets no regrets lee took a long hard study bryan looked the same she decided healthy easy lovely in a way that seemed exclusively her own the same she thought but for the slightest hint of trouble in her eyes and you things are good ive missed you but i feel better about it after seeing you here with a laugh lee slipped her arm around bryans waist if there was trouble shed find the source bryan was hopeless at hiding anything for long come inside sarah and hunter are making iced tea she sent a significant look in shades direction and felt bryan tense just a little but lee felt it and knew shed already found the source bryan cleared her throat shade he moved forward lee thought like a man who was used to testing the way lee radcliffe lee radcliffe brown she corrected and relaxed a bit shade colby you remember when i spent the money id saved for a new car on one of his prints yes i told you you were crazy lee extended her hand and smiled but her voice was cool its nice to meet you bryans always admired your work but you havent he returned with more interest and respect than hed intended to feel i often find it harsh but always compelling lee said simply bryans the expert not me then shed tell you that we dont take pictures for experts lee nodded his handshake had been firm not gentle but far from cruel his eyes were precisely the same shed have to reserve judgment for now come inside mr colby hed intended to simply drop bryan off and move along but he found himself accepting it wouldnt hurt he rationalized to cool off a bit before he drove into town he followed the women inside dad if you dont put more sugar in it it tastes terrible as they walked into the kitchen they saw sarah with her hands on her hips watching her father mop up around a pitcher of tea not everyone wants to pour sugar into their system the way you do i do bryan grinned when hunter turned she thought his work brilliant often cursing him for it in the middle of the night when it kept her awake she thought he looked like a man one of the bronte sisters would have written about strong dark brooding but more he was the man who loved her closest friend bryan opened her arms to him its good to see you again hunter held her close chuckling when he felt her reach behind him to the plate of cookies sarah had set out why dont you gain weight i keep trying bryan claimed and bit into the chocolate chip cookie mmm still warm hunter this is shade colby hunter put down his dishcloth ive followed your work he told shade as they shook hands its powerful thats the word id use to describe yours your latest had me too paranoid to go down to the basement laundry room for weeks bryan accused hunter i nearly ran out of clothes hunter grinned pleased thanks she glanced around the sunlit kitchen i guess i expected your house to have cobwebs and creaking boards disappointed lee asked relieved with a laugh lee settled at the kitchen table with sarah on her left and bryan across from her so hows the project going good but lee noticed she didnt look at shade as she spoke maybe terrific well know more once we develop the film weve made arrangements with one of the local papers for the use of a darkroom all we have to do is drive into sedona check in and get a couple of rooms tomorrow we work rooms lee set down the glass hunter handed her but youre staying here lee bryan gave hunter a quick smile as he offered the plate of cookies i wanted to see you not drop in bag and baggage i know both you and hunter are working on new books shade and ill be up to our ears in developing fluid how are we supposed to visit if youre in sedona lee countered damn it bryan ive missed you youre staying here she laid a hand on her rounded stomach pregnant women have to be pampered you should stay shade put in before bryan could comment it might be the last chance for quite a while for a little free time weve a lot of work to do bryan reminded him its a short drive into town from here that wont make any difference were going to need to rent a car in any case so we can both be mobile hunter studied the man across the room tense he thought intense not the sort of man hed have picked for the freerolling slowmoving bryan but it wasnt his place to judge it was his place and his talent to observe what was between them was obvious to see their reluctance to accept it was just as obvious calmly he picked up his tea and drank the invitation applies to both of you shade glanced over with an automatic polite refusal on the tip of his tongue his eyes met hunters they were both intense internalized men perhaps thats why they understood each other so quickly ive been there before hunter seemed to say to him with a hint of a smile you can run fast but only so far shade sensed something of the understanding and something of the challenge he glanced down to see bryan giving him a long cool look id love to stay he heard himself say shade crossed to the table and sat lee looked over the prints in her precise deliberate way bryan paced up and down the terrace ready to explode well she demanded what do you think i havent finished looking through them yet bryan opened her mouth then shut it again it wasnt like her to be nervous over her work she knew the prints were good hadnt she put her sweat and her heart into each of them more than good she told herself as she yanked a chocolate bar out of her pocket these prints ranked with her best work it mightve been the competition with shade that had pushed her to produce them it mightve been the need to feel a bit smug after some of the comments hed made on her particular style of work bryan didnt like to think she was base enough to resort to petty rivalry but she had to admit that now she was and she wanted to win she and shade had lived in the same house worked in the same darkroom for days but had managed to see almost nothing of each other a neat trick bryan thought ruefully perhaps it had worked so well because theyd both played the same game hide and dont seek tomorrow theyd be back on the road bryan found that she was anxious to go even while she dreaded it and she wasnt a contrary person bryan reminded herself almost fiercely she was basically straightforward and well yes she was amiable it was simply her nature to be so why wasnt she with shade well bryan whirled around as lee spoke well she echoed waiting ive always admired your work bryan you know that in her tidy way lee folded her hands on the wroughtiron table but bryan prompted but these are the best lee smiled the very best youve ever done bryan let out the breath shed been holding and crossed to the table nerves yes she had them she didnt care for them why im sure therere a lot of technical reasons the light and the shading the cropping impatiently bryan shook her head why understanding lee chose a print this one of the old woman and the little girl on the beach maybe its my condition she said slowly as she studied it again but it makes me think of the child ill have it also makes me remember ill grow old but not too old to dream this pictures powerful because its so basically simple so straightforward and so incredibly full of emotion and this one she shuffled the prints until she came to the one of the road worker sweat determination honesty you know when you look at this face that the man believes in hard work and paying his bills on time and here these teenagers i see youth just before those inevitable changes of adulthood and this dog lee laughed as she looked at it the first time i looked it just struck me as cute and funny but he looks so proud so well human you could almost believe the boat was his while bryan remained silent lee tidied the prints again i could go over each one of them with you but the point is each one of them tells a story its only one scene one instant of time yet the storys there the feelings are there isnt that the purpose yes bryan smiled as her shoulders relaxed thats the purpose if shades pictures are half as good youll have a wonderful essay they will be bryan murmured i saw some of his negatives in the darkroom theyre incredible lee lifted a brow and watched bryan devour chocolate does that bother you what oh no no of course not his work is his work and in this case itll be part of mine id never have agreed to work with him if i hadnt admired him but this time lee prompted with a raised brow and half smile i dont know lee hes just so so perfect really he never fumbles bryan complained he always knows exactly what he wants when he wakes up in the morning hes perfectly coherent he never misses a turn on the road he even makes decent coffee anyone would detest him for that lee said dryly its frustrating thats all love often is you are in love with him arent you no genuinely surprised bryan stared over at lee good god i hope ive more sense than that i have to work hard at even liking him bryan youre my friend otherwise what im calling concern would be called prying which means youre going to pry bryan put in exactly ive seen the way the two of you tiptoe around each other as if youre terrified that if you happened to brush up against each other thered be spontaneous combustion something like that lee reached out and touched her hand bryan tell me evasions werent possible bryan looked down at the joined hands and sighed im attracted she admitted slowly hes different from anyone ive known mostly because hes just not the type of man id normally socialize with hes very remote very serious i like to have fun just fun relationships have to be made up of more than just fun im not looking for a relationship on this point she was perfectly clear i date so i can go dancing go to a party listen to music or see a movie thats it the last thing i want is all the tension and work that goes into a relationship if someone didnt know you theyd say that was a pretty shallow sentiment maybe it is bryan tossed back maybe i am lee said nothing just tapped a finger on the prints thats my work bryan began then gave up a lot of people might believe what she said on face value not lee i dont want a relationship she repeated but in a quieter tone lee ive been there before and im lousy at it relationship equals two lee pointed out are you still taking the blame most of the blame was mine i was no good at being a wife at being a certain kind of wife lee corrected i imagine theres only a handful of definitions in the dictionary lee only raised a brow sarah has a friend whose mother is wonderful she keeps not just a clean house but an interesting one she makes jelly takes the minutes at the pta and runs a girl scout troop the woman can take a colored paper and some glue and create a work of art shes lovely and helps herself stay that way with exercise classes three times a week i admire her a great deal but if hunter had wanted those things from me i wouldnt have his ring on my finger hunters special bryan murmured i cant argue with that and you know why i nearly ruined it with him because i was afraid id fail at building and maintaining a relationship its not a matter of being afraid bryan shrugged her shoulders its more a matter of not having the energy for it remember who youre talking to lee said mildly with a half laugh bryan shook her head all right maybe its a matter of being cautious relationships a very weighty word affairs lighter she said consideringly but an affair with a man like shades bound to have tremendous repercussions that sounded so cool bryan mused when had she started to think in such logical terms hes not an easy man lee he has his own demons and his own way of dealing with them i dont know whether hed share them with me or if id want him to he works at being cold lee commented but ive seen him with sarah i admit the basic kindness in him surprised me but its there its there bryan agreed its just hard to get to dinners ready sarah yanked open the screen door and let it hit the wall with a bang shade and i made spaghetti and its terrific it was during the meal bryan watched shade like lee shed noticed his easy relationship with sarah it was more than tolerance she decided as she watched him laugh with the girl it was affection it hadnt occurred to her that shade could give his affection so quickly or with so few restrictions maybe i should be a twelveyearold with braces she decided then shook her head at her own thought pattern she didnt want shades affection his respect yes it wasnt until after dinner that she realized she was wrong she wanted a great deal more it was the last leisurely evening before the group separated on the front porch they watched the first stars come out and listened to the first night sounds begin by that time the next evening shade and bryan would be in colorado lee and hunter sat on the porch swing with sarah nestled between them shade stretched out in a chair just to the side relaxed a little tired and mentally satisfied after his long hours in the darkroom still as he sat talking easily to the browns he realized that hed needed this visit as much as perhaps more than bryan hed had a simple childhood until these past days hed nearly forgotten just how simple and just how solid the things that had happened to him as an adult had blocked a great deal of it out now without consciously realizing it shade was drawing some of it back bryan sat on the first step leaning back against a post she joined in the conversation or distanced herself from it as she chose there was nothing important being said and the easiness of the conversation made the scene that much more appealing a moth battered itself against the porch light crickets called and the breeze rippled through the full leaves of the surrounding trees the sounds made a soothing conversation of their own she liked the way hunter had his arm across the back of the swing though he spoke to shade his fingers ran lightly over his wifes hair his daughters head rested against his chest but once in a while shed reach a hand over to lees stomach as if to test for movement though she hadnt been consciously setting the scene it grew in front of her eyes unable to resist bryan slipped inside when she returned a few moments later she had her camera tripod and light stand oh boy sarah took one look and straightened primly bryans going to take our picture no posing bryan told her with a grin just keep talking she continued before anyone could protest pretend im not even here its so perfect she began to mutter to herself as she set up i dont know why i didnt see it before let me give you a hand bryan glanced up at shade in surprise and had nearly refused before she stopped the words it was the first time hed made any attempt to work with her whether it was a gesture to her or to the affection hed come to feel for her friends she wouldnt toss it back at him instead she smiled and handed him her light meter give me a reading will you they worked together as though theyd been doing so for years another surprise for both of them she adjusted her light already calculating her exposure as shade gave her the readings satisfied bryan checked the angle and framing through the viewfinder then stepped back and let shade take her place perfect if she was looking for a lazy summer evening and a family content with it and one another she couldve done no better stepping back shade leaned against the wall of the house without thinking about it he continued to help by distracting the trio on the swing what do you want sarah he began as bryan moved behind the camera again a baby brother or a sister as she considered sarah forgot her enchantment with being photographed well her hand moved to lees stomach again lees hand closed over it spontaneously bryan clicked the shutter maybe a brother she decided my cousin says a little sister can be a real pain as sarah spoke lee leaned her head back just slightly until it rested on hunters arm his fingers brushed her hair again bryan felt the emotion well up in her and blur her vision she took the next shot blindly had she always wanted that she wondered as she continued to shoot the closeness the contentment that came with commitment and intimacy why had it waited to slam into her now when her feelings toward shade were already tangled and much too complicated she blinked her eyes clear and opened the shutter just as lee turned her head to laugh at something hunter said relationship she thought as the longing rose up in her not the easy careless friendships shed permitted herself but a solid demanding sharing relationship that was what she saw through the viewfinder that was what she discovered she needed for herself when she straightened from the camera shade was beside her something wrong she shook her head and reached over to switch off the light perfect she announced with a casualness that cost her she gave the family on the swing a smile ill send you a print as soon as we stop and develop again she was trembling shade was close enough to see it he turned and dealt with the camera and tripod himself ill take this up for you she turned to tell him no but he was already carrying it inside id better pack my gear she said to hunter and lee shade likes to leave at uncivilized hours when she went inside lee leaned her head against hunters arm again theyll be fine he told her shell be fine lee glanced toward the doorway maybe shade carried bryans equipment up to the bedroom shed been using and waited the moment she came in with the light he turned to her whats wrong bryan opened the case and packed her stand and light nothing why you were trembling impatient shade took her arm and turned her around youre still trembling im tired in its way it was true she was tired of having her emotions sneak up on her dont play games with me bryan im better at it than you god could he have any idea just how much she wanted to be held at that moment would he have any way of understanding how much shed give if only hed hold her now dont push it shade she shouldve known he wouldnt listen with one hand he cupped her chin and held her face steady the eyes that saw a great deal more than he was entitled to looked into hers tell me no she said it quietly if shed been angry insulted cold hed have dug until hed had it all he couldnt fight her this way all right he backed off dipping his hands into his pockets hed felt something out on the porch something that had pulled at him offered itself to him if shed made one move the slightest move he might have given her more at that moment than either of them could imagine maybe you should get some sleep well leave at seven okay deliberately she turned away to pack up the rest of her gear ill be ready he was at the door before he felt compelled to turn around again bryan i saw your prints theyre exceptional she felt the first tears stream down her face and was appalled since when did she cry because someone acknowledged her talent since when did she tremble because a picture she was taking spoke to her personally she pressed her lips together for a moment and continued to pack without turning around thanks shade didnt linger any longer he closed the door soundlessly on his way out chapter contents prev next by the time theyd passed through new mexico and into colorado bryan felt more in tune with herself in part she thought that the break in oak creek canyon had given her too much time for introspection though she often relied heavily on just that in her work there were times when it could be selfdefeating at least thats what shed been able to convince herself of after she and shade had picked up the routine of drive and shoot and drive some more they werent looking for cities and major events on this leg they sought out small unrecognizable towns and struggling ranches families that worked with the land and one another to make ends meet for them summer was a time of hard endless work to prepare for the rigors of winter it wasnt all fun all games all sun and sand it was migrant workers waiting to pick august peaches and gardens being weeded and tended to offset the expense of winter vegetables they didnt consider denver but chose instead places like antonito they didnt go after the big sprawling cattle spreads but the smaller more personal operations bryan had her first contact with a cattle branding on a dusty little ranch called the bar t her preconception of sweaty looselimbed cowboys rounding em up and heading em out wasnt completely wrong it just hadnt included the more basic aspects of branding such as the smell of burned flesh and the splash of blood as potential bulls were turned into little steers she was shed discovered as her stomach heaved a city girl at heart but they got their pictures cowboys with bandannas over their faces and spurs on their boots some of them laughed some of them swore all of them worked she learned the true meaning of work horse as she watched the men push their mounts through their paces the sweat of a horse was a heavy rich smell it hung thickly in the air with the sweat of men bryan considered her best shot a near classic study of a man taking hold of his leisure time with both hands the young cowboy was rangy and ruddy which made him perfect for what she was after his chambray shirt was dark with patches of sweat down the front down the back and spreading from under the arms more sweat mixed with dust ran down his face his work boots were creased and caked with grime the back pocket of his jeans was worn from the constant rub against a round can of chewing tobacco with his hat tilted back and his bandanna tied loosely around his throat he straddled the fence and lifted an icy can of beer to his lips bryan thought when the picture was printed youd almost be able to see his adams apple move as he swallowed and every woman who looked at it she was certain would be half in love he was the mystic the swashbuckler the last of the knights having that picture in her camera nearly made up for almost losing her lunch over the branding shed seen shade hone right in on it and knew his pictures would be gritty hard and detailed yet shed also seen him focusing in on a young boy of eleven or twelve as hed ridden in his first roundup with all the joy and innocence peculiar to a boy of that age his choice had surprised her because he rarely went for the lighter touch it was also unfortunately for her state of mind something else she could like him for there were others he hadnt made any comment when shed turned green and had distanced herself for a time from what was going on in the small enclosed corral where calves bawled for their mothers and let out long surprised wails when knife and iron were applied he hadnt said a word when shed sat down in the shade until shed been certain her stomach would stay calm nor had he said a word when hed handed her a cold drink neither had she that night they camped on bar t land shade had given her space since theyd left arizona because she suddenly seemed to need it oddly he found he didnt in the beginning it had always been bryan whod all but forced him into conversations when hed have been content to drive in silence for hours now he wanted to talk to her to hear her laugh to watch the way her hands moved when she became enthusiastic about a certain point or to watch the way she stretched easily degree by inching degree as her voice slowed something undefinable had shifted in both of them during their time in oak creek bryan had become remote when shed always been almost too open for his comfort he found he wanted her company when hed always been solitary he wanted though he didnt fully comprehend why her friendship it was a shift he wasnt certain he cared for or even understood in any case because the opposing shifts had happened in both of them simultaneously it brought them no closer shade had chosen the open space near a fastrunning creek for a campsite for no reason other than it appealed to him bryan immediately saw other possibilities look im going down to wash off she was as dusty as the cowboys shed focused on all afternoon it occurred to her not altogether pleasantly that she might smell a bit too much like the horses shed watched its probably freezing so ill make it fast and you can have a turn shade pried the top off a beer perhaps they hadnt rounded up cattle but theyd been on their feet and in the sun for almost eight hours take your time bryan grabbed a towel and a cake of soap and dashed off the sun was steadily dropping behind the mountains to the west she knew enough of camping by now to know how quickly the air would cool once the sun went down she didnt want to be wet and naked when it did she didnt bother to glance around before she stripped off her shirt they were far enough away from the ranch house that none of the men would wander out that way at sunset shade and she had already established the sanctity of privacy without exchanging a word on the subject right now she thought as she wiggled out of her jeans the cowboys theyd come to shoot were probably sitting down to an enormous meal red meat and potatoes she mused hot biscuits with plenty of butter lord knows they deserved it after the day theyd put in and me too she decided though she and shade were making do with cold sandwiches and a bag of chips slim tall and naked bryan took a deep breath of the pinescented air even a city girl she thought as she paused a moment to watch the sunset could appreciate all this gingerly she stepped into the cold kneehigh water and began to rinse off the dust strange she didnt mind the chill as much as she once had the drive across america was bound to leave its mark she was glad of it no one really wanted to stay exactly the same throughout life if her outlook changed and shifted as they traveled she was fortunate the assignment was giving her more than the chance for professional exposure and creative expression it was giving her experiences why else had she become a photographer but to see things and understand them yet she didnt understand shade any better now than when theyd started out had she tried in some ways she thought as she glided the soap over her arms until what she saw and understood began to affect her too deeply and too personally then shed backed off fast she didnt like to admit it bryan shivered and began to wash more swiftly the sun was nearly set selfpreservation she reminded herself perhaps her image was one of take what comes and make the best of it but she had her phobias as well and she was entitled to them it had been a long time since shed been hurt and that was because of her own deceptively simple maneuvering if she stood at a crossroads and had two routes one smooth the other rocky with a few pits shed take the smooth one maybe it was less admirable but shed always felt you ended up in the same place with less energy expended shade colby was a rocky road in any case it wasnt just a matter of her choice they could have an affair a physically satisfying emotionally shallow affair it worked well for a great many people but he didnt want to be involved with her any more than she did with him he was attracted just as she was but he wasnt offering her any more than that if he ever did she dropped that line of thought like a stone speculation wasnt always healthy the important thing was that she felt more like herself again she was pleased with the work shed done since theyd left arizona and was looking forward to crossing over into kansas the next day the assignment as theyd both agreed from the outset was the first priority wheat fields and tornados she thought with a grin follow the yellow brick road that was what kansas brought to her mind she knew better now and looked forward to finding the reality bryan was beginning to enjoy having her preconceptions both confirmed and blown to bits that was for tomorrow right now it was dusk and she was freezing agile she scrambled up the small bank and reached for the towel shade could wash up while she stuffed herself with whatever was handy in the cupboards she pulled on a longsleeved oversize shirt and reached up to button it thats when she saw the eyes for a moment she only stared with her hands poised at the top button then she saw there was more to it than a pair of narrow yellow eyes peering out of the lowering light there was a sleek muscled body and a set of sharp white teeth only a narrow creek bed away bryan took two steps back tripped over her own tangled jeans and let out a scream that mightve been heard in the next county shade was stretched out in a folding chair beside the small campfire hed built on impulse hed enjoyed himself that day the rough and ready atmosphere the baking sun and cold beer hed always admired the camaraderie that went hand in hand with people who work outdoors he needed the city it was in his blood for the most part he preferred the impersonal aspects of people rushing to their own places in their own time but it helped to touch base with other aspects of life from time to time he could see now even after only a few weeks on the road that hed been getting stale he hadnt had the challenge of his early years that gettheshotandstayalive sort of challenge he didnt want it but hed let himself become too complacent with what hed been doing this assignment had given him the chance to explore himself as well as his country he thought of his partner with varying degrees of puzzlement and interest she wasnt nearly as simple or laidback as hed originally believed still she was nearly degrees removed from him he was beginning to understand her slowly but he was beginning to she was sensitive emotional and inherently kind he was rarely kind because he was careful not to be she was comfortable with herself easily amused and candid hed learned long ago that candor can jump back on you with teeth but he wanted her because she was different or in spite of it he wanted her forcing himself to keep his hands off her in all the days and nights that had passed since that light interrupted kiss in hunter browns driveway was beginning to wear on him he had his control to thank for the fact that hed been able to the control that he honed so well that it was nearly a prison shade tossed his cigarette into the fire and leaned back he wouldnt lose that control or break out of that prison but that didnt mean that sooner or later he and bryan wouldnt be lovers he meant it to happen he would simply bide his time until it happened his way as long as he was holding the reins he wouldnt steer himself into the mire when he heard her scream a dozen agonizing images rushed into his head images that hed seen and lived through images that only someone who had could conjure up he was out of the chair and running before hed fully realized they were only memories when he got to her bryan was scrambling up from the tumble shed taken the last thing she expected was to be hauled up and crushed against shade the last thing she expected was exactly what she needed gasping for air she clung to him what happened her own panic muffled her ears to the thread of panic in his voice bryan are you hurt no no it scared me but it ran away she pushed her face against his shoulder and just breathed oh god shade what gripping her by the elbows he pulled her back far enough to see her face what scared you a cat he wasnt amused his fear turned to fury tangibly enough that bryan could see the latter even before he cursed her damn it what kind of fool are you he demanded letting out a scream like that over a cat she drew air in and out in and out and concentrated on her anger genuine fear was something she didnt care for not a house cat she snapped she was still shaken but not enough to sit back and be called a fool it was one of those i dont know she lifted a hand to push at her hair and dropped it again when it trembled i have to sit down she did so with a plop on the grass a bobcat calmer shade crouched down beside her i dont know bobcat cougar i wouldnt know the difference it was a hell of a lot bigger than any tabby she lowered her head to her knees maybe shed been frightened before in her life but she couldnt remember anything to compare with this he just stood over there staring at me i thought i thought he was going to jump over the creek his teeth she shuddered and shut her eyes big she managed no longer caring if she sounded like a simpleminded fool real big hes gone now his fury turned inward he shouldve known she wasnt the kind of woman who jumped at shadows he knew what it was to be afraid and to feel helpless with it this time he cursed himself as he slipped an arm around her the way you screamed hes ten miles away and still running bryan nodded but kept her face buried against her knees i guess he wasnt that big but they look different out of the zoo i just need a minute to pull myself together take your time he found he didnt mind offering comfort though it was something he hadnt done in a long time the air was cool the night still he could hear the sound of the water rushing by in the creek for a moment he had a quick flash of the brownss porch of the easy family portrait on the swing he felt a touch of the same contentment here with his arm around bryan and night closing in overhead a hawk screeched out for its first flight of the night bryan jolted easy shade murmured he didnt laugh at her reaction or even smile he soothed i guess im a little jumpy with a nervous laugh she lifted her hand to push at her hair again it wasnt until then that shade realized she was naked beneath the open billowing shirt the sight of her slim supple body beneath the thin fluttering material sent the contentment hed felt skyrocketing into need a need he discovered only in that instant that was somehow exclusively for her not just for a woman with a lovely face a desirable body but for bryan maybe we should get back and she turned her head and found her eyes only inches from his in his she saw everything he felt when she started to speak again he shook his head no words no words now only needs only feelings he wanted that with her as his mouth closed over hers he gave her no choice but to want it as well sweetness where had it come from and how could she possibly turn away from it theyd been together nearly a month but shed never suspected he had sweetness in him nor had she known just how badly shed needed to find it there his mouth demanded but so slowly so subtly that she was giving before she was aware of it once shed given she couldnt take away again she felt his hand warm and firm on her bare skin but she sighed in pleasure not in protest shed wanted him to touch her had waited for it had denied her waiting now she leaned closer thered be no denying hed known shed feel like this slim strong smooth a hundred times hed imagined it he hadnt forgotten that shed taste like this warm tempting generous a hundred times hed tried not to remember this time she smelled of the creek fresh and cool he could bury his face in her throat and smell the summer night on her he kissed her slowly leaving her lips for her throat her throat for her shoulder as he lingered there he gave himself the pleasure of discovering her body with his fingertips it was torture exquisite agonizing irresistible bryan wanted it to go on and on and on she drew him closer loving the hard lean feel of his body against hers the brush of his clothes against her skin the whisper of his breath across it and through it all the quick steady beat of his heart near hers she could smell the work of the day on him the faint tang of healthy sweat the traces of dust he hadnt yet washed off it excited her with memories of the way his muscles had bunched beneath his shirt when hed climbed onto a fence for a better angle she could remember exactly how hed looked then though shed pretended to herself that she hadnt seen hadnt needed to she wanted his strength not the muscles but the inner strength shed sensed in him from the start the strength that had carried him through what hed seen what hed lived with yet wasnt it that strength that helped to harden him to separate him emotionally from the people around him with her mind whirling her body pulsing she struggled to find the answer she needed wants werent enough hadnt she told him so herself god she wanted him her bones were melting from the desire for him but it wasnt enough she only wished she knew what was shade even when she tried to speak he cut her off with another long draining kiss she wanted him to drain her mind body soul if he did thered be no question and no need for answers but the questions were there even as she held him to her they were there shade she began again i want to make love with you he lifted his head and his eyes were so dark so intense it was almost impossible to believe his hands were so gentle i want to feel your skin under my hand feel your heart race watch your eyes the words were quiet incredibly calm when his eyes were so passionate more than the passion and demand in his eyes the words frightened her im not ready for this she barely managed the words as she drew away from him he felt the needs rise and the anger begin it took all his skill to control both are you saying you dont want me no she shook her head as she drew her shirt together when had it become so cold she wondered no lyings foolish sos backing away from something we both want to happen im not sure i do i cant be logical about this shade she gathered her clothes quickly and hugged them against her as she stood i cant think something like this through step by step the way you do if i could itd be different but i can only go with my feelings my instincts there was a deadly calm around him when he rose the control hed nearly forfeited to her was back in place once more he accepted the prison hed built himself and she shivered without knowing if it was from the cold without or the cold within and my feelings tell me i need more time when she looked up at him again her face was honest her eyes eloquent maybe i do want this to happen maybe im just a little afraid of how much i want you he didnt like her use of the word afraid she made him feel responsible obliged defensive ive no intention of hurting you she gave herself a moment her breathing was easier even if her pulse was still unsteady whether he knew it or not shade had already given her the distance she needed to resist him now she could look at him calmer now she could think more clearly no i dont think you do but you could and i have a basic fear of bruises maybe im an emotional coward its not a pretty thought but it might be true with a sigh she lifted both hands to her hair and pushed it back shade weve a bit more than two months left on the road i cant afford to spend it being torn up inside because of you my instincts tell me you could very easily do that to me whether you planned on it or not she knew how to back a man into a corner he thought in frustration he could press relieve the knot shed tightened in his stomach and by doing so hed run the risk of having her words echo back at him for a long tune to come itd only taken a few words from her to remind him what it felt like to be responsible for someone else go back to the van he told her turning away to strip off this shut i have to clean up she started to speak then realized there was nothing more she could say instead she left him to follow the thin moonlit trail back to the van chapter contents prev next wheat fields bryan didnt see her preconception slashed as they drove through the midwest but reinforced kansas was wheat fields whatever else bryan saw as they crossed the state it was the endless rippling gold grass that captivated her first and last color texture shape form emotion there were towns of course cities with modern buildings and plush homes but in seeing basic americana grain against sky bryan saw it all some might have found the continuous spread of sunripened grain waving acre after acre monotonous not bryan this was a new experience for a woman of the city there were no jutting mountains no glossy towering buildings no looping freeways to break the lines here was space just as awesome as the terrain of arizona but lusher and somehow calmer she could look at it and wonder in the fields of wheat and acres of corn bryan saw the heart and the sweat of the country it wasnt always an idyllic scene there were insects dirt grimy machinery people worked here with their hands with their backs in the cities she saw the pace and energy on the farms she saw a schedule that would have made a corporate executive wilt year after year the farmer gave himself to the land and waited for the land to give back with the right angle the proper light she could photograph a wheat field and make it seem endless powerful with evening shadows she could give a sense of serenity and continuity it was only grass after all only stalks growing to be cut down processed used but the grain had a life and a beauty of its own she wanted to show it as she saw it shade saw the tenuous inescapable dependence of man on nature the planter keeper and harvester of the wheat was irrevocably tied to the land it was both his freedom and his prison the man riding the tractor in the kansas sunlight damp with healthy sweat lean from years of labor was as dependent on the land as the land was on him without man the wheat might grow wild it might flourish but then it would wither and die it was the tie shade sensed and the tie he meant to record still perhaps for the first time since theyd left la he and bryan werent shooting as separate entities they might not have realized it yet but their feelings perceptions and needs were drawing them closer to the same mark they made each other think how did she see this scene how did he feel about this setting where before each of them had considered their photographs separately now subtly unconsciously they began to do two things that would improve the final result compete and consult theyd spent a day and a night in dodge city for the fourth of july celebrations in what had once been a wild west town bryan thought of wyatt earp of doc holliday and the desperadoes who had once ridden through town but shed been drawn to the street parade that mightve been in anytown usa it was here caught up in the pageantry and the flavor that shed asked shade his opinion of the right angle for shooting a horse and rider and he in turn had taken her advice on capturing a tiny bespangled majorette the step theyd taken had been lost in the moment to both of them but theyd stood side by side on the curb as the parade had passed music blaring batons flying their pictures had been different shade had looked for the overview of holiday parades while bryan had wanted individual reactions but theyd stood side by side bryans feelings for shade had become more complex more personal when the change had begun or how she couldnt say but because her work was most often a direct result of her emotions the pictures she took began to reflect both the complexity and the intimacy their view of the same wheat field might be radically different but bryan was determined that when their prints were set side by side hers would have equal impact shed never been an aggressive person it just wasnt her style but shade had tapped a need in her to compete as a photographer and as a woman if she had to travel in close quarters for weeks with a man who ruffled her professional feathers and stirred her feminine needs she had to deal with him directly on both counts directly she decided but in her own fashion and her own time as the days went on bryan wondered if it would be possible to have both success and shade without losing something vital she was so damn calm it drove him crazy every day every hour they spent together pushed shade closer to the edge he wasnt used to wanting anyone so badly he didnt enjoy finding out he could and that there was nothing he could do about it bryan put him in the position of needing then having to deny himself there were times he nearly believed she did so purposely but hed never known anyone less likely to scheme than bryan she wouldnt think of it and if she did shed consider it too much bother even now as they drove through the kansas twilight she was stretched out in the seat beside him sound asleep it was one of the rare times shed left her hair loose full wavy and lush it was muted to a dull gold in the lowering light the sun had given her skin all the color it needed her body was relaxed loose like her hair shade wondered if hed ever had the capability to let his mind and body go so enviably limp was it that that tempted him that drove at him was he simply pushed to find that spark of energy she could turn on and off at will he wanted to set it to life for himself temptation the longer he held himself back the more intense it became to have her to explore her to absorb her when he did he no longer used the word if what cost would there be nothing was free once he thought as she sighed in sleep just once his way perhaps the cost would be high but he wouldnt be the one to pay it his emotions were trained and disciplined they wouldnt be touched there wasnt a woman alive who could make him hurt his body and his mind tensed as bryan slowly woke groggy and content to be so she yawned the scent of smoke and tobacco stung the air on the radio was low mellow jazz the windows were half open so that when she shifted the slap of wind woke her more quickly than shed have liked it was fully dark now surprised bryan stretched and stared out the window at a moon half covered by clouds its late she said on another yawn the first thing she remembered as her mind cleared of sleep was that they hadnt eaten she pressed a hand to her stomach dinner he glanced at her just long enough to see her shake back her hair it rippled off her shoulders and down her back as he watched he had to fight back the urge to touch it i want to get over the border tonight she heard it in his voice the tension the annoyance bryan didnt know what had prompted it nor at the moment did she want to instead she lifted a brow if he was in a hurry to get to oklahoma and was willing to drive into the night to get there it was his business shed stocked a cabinet in the back of the van with a few essentials just for moments like this bryan started to haul herself out of her seat when she heard the long blare of a horn and the rev of an engine the scarred old pontiac had a hole in the muffler you couldve tossed a baseball through the sound of the engine clattered like a badly tuned plane it swerved around the van at a dangerous speed fishtailed then bolted ahead radio blaring as shade swore bryan got a glimpse that revealed the dilapidated car was packed with kids saturday night in july she commented idiots he said between his teeth as he watched the taillights weave yeah she frowned as she watched the car barrel ahead smoke streaming they were just kids i hope they dont even as she thought it it happened the driver decided to press his luck by passing another car over the double yellow lines the truck coming toward him laid on the horn and swerved bryan felt her blood freeze shade was already hitting the brakes as the pontiac screeched back in its own lane but it was out of control skidding sideways the pontiac kissed the fender of the car it had tried to pass then flipped into a telephone pole the sound of screaming tires breaking glass and smashing metal whirled in her head bryan was up and out of the van before shade had brought it to a complete stop she could hear a girl screaming others weeping even as the sounds shuddered through her she told herself it meant they were alive the door on the passengers side was crushed against the telephone pole bryan rushed to the drivers side and wrenched at the handle she smelled the blood before she saw it good god she whispered as she managed to yank the door open on the second try then shade was beside her shoving her aside get some blankets out of the van he ordered without looking at her it had only taken him one glance at the driver to tell him it wasnt going to be pretty he shifted enough to block bryans view then reached in to check the pulse in the drivers throat as he heard her run back to the van alive he thought then blocked out everything but what had to be done he worked quickly the driver was unconscious the gash on his head was serious but it didnt worry shade as much as the probability of internal injuries and nothing worried him as much as the smell of gas that was beginning to sweeten the air under other circumstances shade wouldve been reluctant to move the boy now there was no choice locking his arms under the boys arms shade hauled him out even as shade began to drag him the driver of the truck ran over and took the boys legs got a cb in the truck he told shade breathlessly called for an ambulance with a nod shade laid the boy down bryan was already there with the first blanket stay here the cars going to go up he said it calmly without a backward glance he went back to the crippled pontiac terror jolted through her within seconds bryan was at the car beside him helping to pull the others out of the wreck get back to the van shade shouted at her as bryan half carried a sobbing girl stay there bryan spoke soothingly covered the girl with a blanket then rushed back to the car the last passenger was also unconscious a boy bryan saw of no more than sixteen she had to half crawl into the car to reach him by the time shed dragged him to the open door she was drenched and exhausted both shade and the truck driver carried the other injured passengers shade had just set a young girl on the grass when he turned and saw bryan struggling with the last victim fear was instant and staggering even as he started to run his imagination worked on him in his mind shade could see the flash of explosion hear the sound of bursting metal and shattering flying glass he knew exactly what it would smell like the moment the gas ignited when he reached bryan shade scooped up the unconscious boy as though he were weightless run he shouted at her together they raced away from the pontiac bryan didnt see the explosion she heard it but more she felt it the whoosh of hot air slammed into her back and sent her sprawling onto the grassy shoulder of the road there was a whistle of metal as something hot and twisted and lethal flew overhead one of the teenagers screamed and buried her face in her hands stunned bryan lay prone a moment waiting to catch her breath over the sound of fire she could hear the whine of sirens are you hurt shade half dragged her up to her knees hed seen the flying slice of metal whiz by her head hands that had been rock steady moments before trembled as they gripped her no bryan shook her head and finding her balance turned to the whimpering girl beside her a broken arm she realized as she tucked the blanket under the girls chin and the cut on her temple would need stitches take it easy bryan murmured pulling out a piece of gauze from the firstaid box shed brought from the van youre going to be fine the ambulance is coming can you hear it as she spoke she pressed the gauze against the wound to stop the bleeding her voice was calm her fingers trembled bobby tears ran down the girls face as she clung to bryan is bobby all right he was driving bryan glanced over and looked directly at shade before she lowered her gaze to the unconscious boy hes going to be fine she said and felt helpless six young careless children she thought as she scanned those sitting or lying on the grass the driver of the other car sat dazedly across from them holding a rag to the cut on his own head for a moment a long still moment the night was quiet warm almost balmy stars were brilliant overhead moonlight was strong and lovely thirty feet away what was left of the pontiac crackled with flame bryan slipped her arm around the shoulders of the girl and watched the lights of the ambulance speed up the road as the paramedics began to work another ambulance and the fire department were called for twenty minutes bryan sat by the young girl talking to her holding her hand while her injuries were examined and tended to her name was robin she was seventeen of the six teenagers in the car her boyfriend bobby was the oldest at nineteen theyd only been celebrating summer vacation as bryan listened and soothed she glanced up to see shade calmly setting his camera astonished she watched as he carefully focused and framed in the injured dispassionately he recorded the scene of the accident the victims and what was left of the car as astonishment faded bryan felt the fury bubble inside her when robin was carried to the second ambulance bryan sprang up what the hell are you doing she grabbed his shoulder spoiling a shot still calm shade turned to her and gave her one quick study she was pale her eyes showed both strain and fury and he thought a dull sheen of shock for the first time since hed known her shade saw how tense her body could be im doing my job he said simply and lifted the camera again those kids are bleeding bryan grabbed his shoulder again swinging herself around until she was facetoface with him theyve got broken bones theyre hurt and theyre frightened since when is your job taking pictures of their pain since i picked up a camera for pay shade let the camera swing by its strap hed gotten enough in any case he didnt like the feeling in his own stomach the tension behind his eyes most of all he didnt like the look in bryans as she stared at him disgust he shrugged it off youre only willing to take pictures of fun in the sun for this assignment bryan you saw the car those kids thats part of it too part of life if you cant handle it youd better stick to your celebrity shots and leave the real world alone hed taken two steps toward the van when bryan was on him again she might avoid confrontations as a matter of habit take the line of least resistance as often as possible but there were times when shed fight when she did she used everything i can handle it she wasnt pale any longer her face glowed with anger her eyes gleamed with it what i cant handle are the vultures who love picking at bones making a profit off misery in the name of art there were six people in that car people she repeated hissing at him maybe they were foolish maybe they deserved what happened but ill be damned if im going to judge do you think it makes you a better photographer a better artist because youre cold enough youre professional enough to freeze their pain on printing paper is this the way you look for another pulitzer nomination she was crying now too angry too churned up by what shed seen to be aware of the tears streaming down her cheeks yet somehow the tears made her look stronger they thickened her voice and gave it impact ill tell you what it makes you she went on when shade remained silent it makes you empty whatever compassion you were born with died somewhere along the way shade im sorry for you she left him standing in the middle of the road by the shell of the car it was nearly am shade had learned that the mind was at its most helpless in those early hours of the morning the van was dark and quiet parked in a small campground just over the oklahoma border he and bryan hadnt exchanged a word since the accident each had prepared for bed in silence and though both of them had lain awake for some time neither had spoken now they slept but only bryan slept dreamlessly thered been a time during the first months after his return from cambodia that shade had had the dream regularly over the years it had come to him less and less often he could force himself awake and fight the dream off before it really took hold but now in the tiny oklahoma campground he was powerless he knew he was dreaming the moment the figures and shapes began to form in his mind shade understood it wasnt real that it wasnt real any longer it didnt stop the panic or the pain the shade colby in the dream would go through the same motions hed gone through all those years ago leading to the same end and in the dream there were no soft lines no mists to lessen the impact he saw it as it had happened in strong sunlight shade came out of the hotel and onto the street with dave his assistant between them they carried all their luggage and equipment they were going home after four months of hard often dangerous work in a city torn ravaged and smoldering they were going home it had occurred to shade that they were calling it close but hed called it close before every day they stayed on added to the risk of getting out at all but thered always been one more picture to take one more statement to make and thered been sung lee shed been so young so eager so wise as a contact in the city shed been invaluable shed been just as invaluable to shade personally after a bumpy unpleasant divorce from a wife whod wanted more glamour and less reality shade had needed the long demanding assignment and hed needed sung lee she was devoted sweet undemanding when hed taken her to bed shade had finally been able to block out the rest of the world and relax his only regret in going back home was that she wouldnt leave her country as theyd stepped out on the street shade had been thinking of her theyd said their goodbyes the night before but he was thinking of her perhaps if he hadnt been hed have sensed something hed asked himself that hundreds of times in the months that followed the city was quiet but it wasnt peaceful the tension in the air could erupt at any time those who were getting out were doing so in a hurry tomorrow the next day the doors might be closed shade took one last look around as they started toward their car one last picture hed thought of the calm before the storm a few careless words to dave and he was alone standing on the curb pulling his camera out of its case he laughed as dave swore and struggled with the luggage on his way to the car just one last picture the next time he lifted his camera to shoot it would be on american soil hey colby young grinning dave stood beside the car he looked like a college student on spring break how about taking one of a future awardwinning photographer on his way out of cambodia with a laugh shade lifted his camera and framed in his assistant he remembered exactly the way hed looked blond tanned a bit gangly with a crooked front tooth and a faded usc tshirt he took the shot dave turned the key in the lock lets go home his assistant yelled the instant before the car exploded shade shade heart pounding bryan shook him shade wake up its a dream he grabbed her hard enough to make bruises but she kept talking its bryan shade youre having a dream just a dream were in oklahoma in your van shade she took his face in her hands and felt the skin cold and damp just a dream she said quietly try to relax im right here he was breathing too quickly shade felt himself straining for air and forced himself to calm god he was cold he felt the warmth of bryans skin under his hands heard her voice calm low soothing with an oath he dropped back down again and waited for the shuddering to stop ill get you some water scotch all right the moonlight was bright enough she found the plastic cup and the bottle and poured behind her she heard the flare of his lighter and the hiss as it caught paper and tobacco when bryan turned he was sitting up on the bunk resting back against the side of the van she had no experience with whatever trauma haunted shade but she did know how to soothe nerves she handed him the drink then without asking sat beside him she waited until hed taken the first sip better he took another sip a deeper one yeah she touched his arm lightly but the contact was made tell me he didnt want to speak of it not to anyone not to her even as the refusal formed on his lips she increased the grip on his arm well both feel better if you do shade she had to wait again this time for him to turn and look at her her heartbeat was steadier now and so as her fingers lay over his wrist was his but there was still a thin sheen of sweat drying on his skin nothing gets better and goes away if you hold it in hed held it in for years itd never gone away perhaps it never would maybe it was the quiet understanding in her voice or the late hour but he found himself talking he told her of cambodia and though his voice was flat she could see it as he had ripe for explosion crumbling angry long monotonous days punctuated by moments of terror he told her how hed reluctantly taken on an assistant and then learned to appreciate and enjoy the young man fresh out of college and sung lee we ran across her in a bar where most of the journalists hung out it wasnt until a long time later that i put together just how convenient the meeting was she was twenty beautiful sad for nearly three months she gave us leads she supposedly learned from a cousin who worked at the embassy were you in love with her no he drew on his cigarette until there was nothing left but filter but i cared i wanted to help her and i trusted her he dropped his cigarette into an ashtray and concentrated on his drink the panic was gone hed never realized he could talk about it calmly think about it calmly things were heating up and the magazine decided to pull its people out we were going home we were coming out of the hotel and i stopped to take a couple of shots like a tourist he swore and drained the rest of the scotch dave got to the car first itd been boobytrapped oh my god without realizing it she moved closer to him he was twentythree carried a picture of the girl he was going to marry im sorry she laid her head against his shoulder wound her arm around him im so sorry he braced himself against the flood of sympathy he wasnt ready for it i tried to find sung lee she was gone her apartment was empty it turned out that id been her assignment the group shed worked for had let things leak through so id relax and trust her theyd intended to make a statement by blowing away an important american reporter theyd missed me an assistant photographer on his first overseas assignment didnt make any impact the kid died for nothing and hed watched the car explode she thought just as hed watched the car explode tonight what had it done to him then and now was that why she wondered hed coolly taken out his camera and recorded it all he was so determined not to feel you blame yourself she murmured you cant he was a kid i shouldve looked out for him how she shifted so that they were facetoface again his eyes were dark full of cold anger and frustration shed never forget just how they looked at that moment how she repeated if you hadnt stopped to take those pictures youd have gotten into the car with him hed still be dead yeah suddenly weary shade ran his hands over his face the tension was gone but not the bitterness perhaps thats what he was weary of shade after the accident forget it no this time she had his hand caught in hers you were doing what you had to for your own reasons i said i wouldnt judge those kids but i was judging you im sorry he didnt want her apology but she gave it he didnt want her to cleanse him but she was washing away the guilt hed seen so much too much of the dark side of human nature she was offering him the light it tempted him and it terrified him ill never see things as you do he murmured after a moments hesitation he laced his fingers with hers ill never be as tolerant puzzled she frowned as they stared at each other no i dont think you will i dont think you have to you were right earlier when you said my compassion was dead i havent any she started to speak but he shook his head i havent any patience very little sympathy did he look at his own pictures she wondered didnt he see the carefully harnessed emotion in them but she said nothing letting him make whatever point he needed to i stopped believing in intimacy genuine intimacy permanency between two people a long time ago but i do believe in honesty she mightve drawn away from him there was something in his voice that warned her but she stayed where she was their bodies were close she could feel his heartbeat steady as hers began to race i think permanency works for some people was that her voice she wondered so calm so practical i stopped looking for it for myself isnt that what hed wanted to hear shade looked down at their joined hands and wondered why her words left him dissatisfied then its understood that neither of us wants or needs promises bryan opened her mouth amazed that she wanted to object she swallowed no promises she managed she had to think had to have the distance to manage it deliberately she smiled i think we both could use some sleep though he tightened his grip on her hand as she started to move honesty hed said though the words werent easy for him hed say what he meant he looked at her a long time what was left of the moonlight showered her face and shadowed her eyes caught in his her hand was steady her pulse wasnt i need you bryan there were so many things he could have said and to any of them shed have had an answer wants no wants werent enough shed already told him demands could be refused or shrugged off needs needs were deeper warmer stronger a need was enough he didnt move he waited watching him bryan knew hed let her take the step toward or away choices he was a man who demanded them for himself yet he was also capable of giving them how could he know shed had none the moment hed spoken slowly she drew her hand from his just as slowly she lifted both hands to his face and brought her mouth to his with their eyes open they shared a long quiet kiss it was a move that both offered and took she offered with her hands light on his skin she took with her mouth warm and certain he accepted he gave and then in the same instant they both forgot the rules her lashes fluttered down her lips parted mindlessly he pulled her against him until their bodies were crushed close she didnt resist but went with him as they slid from the bunk and onto the rug shed wanted this the triumph and the weakness of being touched by him shed wanted the glory of letting herself go of allowing her longings freedom with his mouth hungry on hers there was no need to think no need to hold back what shed wanted so desperately to give him only to him take more her mind was reeling from the demands of her body take all she could feel him tug at the wide neck of her sleep shut until her shoulder was bare and vulnerable to his mouth still more she skimmed her hands up his back naked and warm from the night breeze flowing in the windows he wasnt easy as a lover hadnt she known it there was no patience in him hadnt he told her shed known it before but she was already aware that shed never know relaxation with shade he drove her quickly thoroughly while she experienced all she had no time to luxuriate in separate sensations masses of them swirled around inside her tastes his lips his skin dark flavor scents flowers flesh sweet and pungent textures the nap of the rug rubbing against her legs the hard brush of his palm the soft warmth of his mouth sounds her heartbeat pounding in her head the murmur of her name in his whisper she could see shadows moonlight the gleam of his eyes before his mouth took hers again everything merged and mixed together until they were one overpowering sensation passion he pulled the shirt lower until her arms were pinned for a moment she was helpless as he trailed his lips down her breast pausing to taste taste thoroughly with lips tongue teeth some women wouldve found him merciless perhaps it was the sound of her moan that made him linger when he was driven to hurry on she was so slender so smooth the moonlight filtered in so that he could see where her tan gave way to paler more vulnerable skin once hed have turned away from vulnerability knowing the dangers of it now it drew him the softness of it her scent was there clinging to the underside of her breast where he could taste as well as smell it sexy tempting subtle it was as she was and he was lost he felt his control slip skid away from him ruthlessly he brought it back they would make love once a hundred times that night but hed stay in control as he was now he thought as she arched under him as hed promised himself he would be always he would drive her but he would not could not be driven by her pulling the material down he explored every inch of her mercilessly he would show no mercy to either of them already she was beyond thought and he knew it her skin was hot and somehow softer with the heat her scent intensified with it he could run those hungry openmouthed kisses wherever he chose her hands were free energy and passion raced together inside her she tumbled over the first peak breathless and strong now she could touch now she could enrage him entice him weaken him she moved quickly demanding when hed expected surrender it was too sudden too frantic to allow him to brace himself against it even as she raced to the next peak she felt the change in him he couldnt stop it she wouldnt permit him to take without giving his mind swam though he tried to clear it fought to hold himself back she seduced not his body hed have given that freely she seduced his mind until it reeled with her emotion raged through him clean hot strong tangled together body and mind they drove each other higher they took each other over chapter contents prev next hey were both very careful neither bryan nor shade wanted to say anything the other could misunderstand theyd made love and for each of them it had been more intense more vital than anything theyd ever experienced theyd set rules and for each of them the need to abide by them was paramount what had happened between them had left them both more than a little stunned and more wary than ever for a woman like bryan who was used to saying what she wanted doing as she pleased it wasnt easy to walk on eggs twentyfour hours a day but theyd made themselves clear before making love she reminded herself no complications no commitments no promises theyd both failed once at the most important of relationships marriage why should either of them risk failure again they traveled in oklahoma giving an entire day to a smalltown rodeo bryan hadnt enjoyed anything as much since the fourth of july celebrations theyd seen in kansas she enjoyed watching the heat of competition the pitting of man against animal and man against man and the clock every man whod lowered himself onto a bronc or a bull had been determined to make it to the bell some had been young others had been seasoned but all had one goal to win and then to go on to the next round shed liked seeing that a game could be turned into a way of life unable to resist she bought a pair of boots with fancy stitching and a stubby heel since the van was too small to permit indiscriminate souvenir buying shed restrained herself this far but there wasnt any point in being a martyr about it the boots made her happy but she resisted buying a leather belt with an oversize silver buckle for shade it was just the sort of gesture he might misunderstand no they wouldnt give each other flowers or trinkets or pretty words she drove south toward texas while shade read the paper in the seat beside her on the radio was a raspy tina turner number that was unapologetically sexy summer had reached the point when the heat began to simmer bryan didnt need the radio announcer to tell her it was ninetyseven and climbing but both she and shade had agreed to use the airconditioning sparingly on the long trips on the open highway the breeze was almost enough in defense she was wearing a skimpy tank top and shorts while she drove in her bare feet she thought of dallas and an airconditioned hotel room with cool sheets on a soft mattress ive never been to texas she said idly i cant imagine any place that has cities fifty and sixty miles across a cab ride across town could cost you a weeks pay the paper crackled as he flipped the page you live in dallas or houston you own a car it was like him to give a brief practical answer and shed come to accept it im glad were taking a couple of days in dallas to print ever spent any time there a little he shrugged as he turned the next section of the paper dallas houston those cities are texas big sprawling wealthy plenty of texmex restaurants luxury hotels and a freeway system that leaves the outoftowner reeling thats why i routed in san antonio as well its something apart from the rest of texas its elegant serene more european she nodded glancing out at the road signs did you have an assignment in texas i tried living in dallas for a couple of years in between the overseas work it surprised her she just couldnt picture him anywhere but la howd you like it not my style he said simply my exwife stayed on and married oil it was the first time hed made any sort of reference to his marriage bryan wiped her damp hands on her shorts and wondered how to handle it you dont mind going back no does it she trailed off wondering if she were getting in deeper than she should shade tossed the paper aside what well does it bother you that shes remarried and settled dont you ever think back and try to figure out what messed things up i know what messed things up theres no use dwelling on it after you admit youve made a mistake youve got to go on i know she pushed at her sunglasses i just sometimes wonder why some people can be so happy together and others so miserable some people dont belong with each other and yet it often seems like they do before they walk up the aisle marriage doesnt work for certain kinds of people like us bryan wondered after all theyd both failed at it perhaps he was right and it was as simple as that i made a mess out of mine she commented all by yourself seems that way then you screwed up and married mr perfect well i she glanced over and saw him looking at her one brow raised and a bland look of anticipation on his face shed forgotten he could make her laugh as well as ache mr nearly perfect anyway she grinned id have been smarter to look for someone with flaws after lighting a cigarette he rested his feet on the dash as bryan was prone to do why didnt you i was too young to realize flaws were easier to deal with and i loved him she hadnt realized it would be so painless to say it to put it in the past tense i really did she murmured in a naive rosetinted way at the time i didnt realize id have to make a choice between his conception of marriage and my work he understood exactly his wife hadnt been cruel she hadnt been vindictive shed simply wanted things he couldnt give so you married mr nearly perfect and i married ms socially ambitious i wanted to take important pictures and she wanted to join the country club nothing wrong with either goal they just dont mesh but sometimes dont you regret that you couldnt make it fit yeah it came out unexpectedly surprising him a great deal more than it surprised her he hadnt realized he had regrets he hadnt allowed himself to youre getting low on gas he said abruptly well stop in the next town and fill up bryan had heard of onehorse towns but nothing fitted the phrase more perfectly than the huddle of houses just over the oklahomatexas border everything seemed to be dusty and faded by the heat even the buildings looked tired perhaps the state was enriched by oil and growth but this little corner had slept through it as a matter of habit bryan took her camera as she stepped from the van to stretch her legs as she walked around the side of the van the skinny young attendant goggled at her shade saw the boy gape and bryan smile before he walked into the little fancooled store behind the pumps bryan found a small fenced yard just across the street a woman in a cotton housedress and a faded apron watered the one colorful spot a splash of pansies along the edge of the house the grass was yellow burned by the sun but the flowers were lush and thriving perhaps they were all the woman needed to keep her content the fence needed painting badly and the screen door to the house had several small holes but the flowers were a bright cheerful slash the woman smiled as she watered them grateful shed picked up the camera shed loaded with color film bryan tried several angles she wanted to catch the tired sunfaded wood of the house and the parched lawn both a contrast to that bouquet of hope dissatisfied she shifted again the light was good the colors perfect but the picture was wrong why stepping back she took it all in again and asked herself the allimportant question what do i feel then she had it the woman wasnt necessary just the illusion of her her hand holding the watering can no more she could be any woman anywhere who needed flowers to complete her home it was the flowers and the hope they symbolized that were important and that was what bryan finally recorded shade came out of the store with a paper bag he saw bryan across the street experimenting with angles content to wait he set the bag in the van drawing out the first cold can before he turned to pay the attendant for the gas the attendant shade noticed who was so busy watching bryan he could hardly screw on the gas cap nice van he commented but shade didnt think hed even looked at it thanks he allowed his own gaze to follow the boys until it rested on bryans he had to smile she was a very distracting sight in the swatch of material she called shorts those legs he mused they seemed to start at the waist and just kept going now he knew just how sensitive they could be on the inside of the knee just above the ankle on the warm smooth skin high on the thigh you and your wife going far hmm shade lost track of the attendant as he became just as fascinated by bryan you and the missus the boy repeated sighing a little as he counted out shades change going far dallas he murmured shes not he started to correct the boys mistake about their relationship then found himself stopping the missus it was a quaint word and somehow appealing it hardly mattered if a boy in a border town thought bryan belonged to him thanks he said absently and stuffing the change in his pocket walked to her good timing she told him as she crossed toward him they met in the middle of the road find something flowers she smiled forgetting the unmerciful sun if she breathed deeply enough she could just smell them over the dust flowers where they didnt belong i think its she felt the rest of the words slide back down her throat as he reached out and touched her hair he never touched her not in the most casual of ways unless they were making love and then it was never casual there was never any easy brush of hands no gentle squeeze nothing until now in the center of the road between a parched yard and a grimy gas station youre beautiful sometimes it stuns me what could she say he never spoke soft words now they flowed over her as his fingers trailed to her cheek his eyes were so dark she had no idea what he saw when he looked at her what he felt shed never have asked perhaps for the first time he was giving her the opportunity but she couldnt speak only stare he might have told her that he saw honesty kindness strength he might have told her he felt needs that were growing far beyond the borders hed set up between him and the rest of the world if shed asked he might have told her that she was making a difference in his life he hadnt foreseen but could no longer prevent for the first time he bent toward her and kissed her with an uncharacteristic gentleness the moment demanded it though he wasnt sure why the sun was hot and hard the road dusty and the smell of gasoline was strong but the moment demanded tenderness from him he gave it surprised that it was in him to offer ill drive he murmured as he slipped her hand into his its a long way to dallas his feelings had changed not for the city they drove into but for the woman beside him dallas had changed since hed lived there but shade knew from experience that it seemed to change constantly even though hed only lived there briefly it had seemed as though a new building would grow up overnight hotels office buildings popped up wherever they could find room and there seemed to be an endless supply of room in dallas the architecture leaned toward the futuristic glass spirals pinnacles but you never had to look far to find that unique southwestern flavor men wore cowboy hats as easily as they wore threepiece suits theyd agreed on a midtown hotel because it was within walking distance of the darkroom theyd rented for two days while one worked in the field the other would have use of the equipment to develop and print then theyd switch bryan looked up at the hotel with something like reverence as they pulled up in front of it hot running water feather pillows room service stepping out she began to unload her share of the luggage and gear i cant wait she said as she hauled out another case and felt sweat bead down her back im going to wallow in the bathtub i might even sleep there shade pulled out his tripod then hers do you want your own my own she swung the first camera bag strap over her shoulder tub she looked up and met his calm questioning glance he wouldnt assume she realized that theyd share a hotel room as they shared the van they might be lovers but the lack of strings was still very very clear yes theyd agreed thered be no promises but maybe it was time she took the first step tilting her head she smiled that depends on whether you agree to wash my back he gave her one of his rare spontaneous smiles as he lifted the rest of the luggage sounds reasonable fifteen minutes later bryan dropped her cases inside their hotel room with equal negligence she tossed down her shoes she didnt bother to go to the window and check out the view thered be time for that later there was one vital aspect of the room that demanded immediate attention she flopped lengthwise on the bed heaven she decided and closed her eyes on a sigh absolute heaven something wrong with your bunk in the van shade stacked his gear in a corner before pulling open the drapes not a thing but theres a world of difference between bunk and bed rolling onto her back she stretched across the spread diagonally see its just not possible to do this on a bunk he gave her a mild look as he opened his suitcase you wont be able to do that on a bed either when youre sharing it with me true enough she thought as she watched him methodically unpack she gave her own suitcase an absent glance it could wait with the same enthusiasm as shed had when shed plopped down bryan sprang up hot bath she said and disappeared into the bathroom shade dropped his shaving kit onto the dresser as he heard the water begin to run he stopped for a moment listening already bryan was beginning to hum the combination of sounds was oddly intimate a womans low voice the splash of water strange that something so simple could make him burn perhaps itd been a mistake to take only one room in the hotel it wasnt quite like sharing the van in a campground here theyd had a choice a chance for privacy and distance before the day was over he mused her things would be spread around the room tossed here flung there it wasnt like him to freely invite disorder and yet he had glancing up he saw himself in the mirror a dark man with a lean body and a lean face eyes a bit too hard mouth a bit too sensitive he was too used to his own reflection to wonder what bryan saw when she looked at him he saw a man who looked a bit weary and needed a shave and he didnt want to wonder though he stared at himself as an artist stares at his subject if he saw a man whod already taken one irrevocable step toward change shade looked at his face reflected against the hotel room behind him just inside the door were bryans cases and the shoes shed carried into the room fleetingly he wondered if he took his camera and set the shot to take in his reflection and that of the room and cases behind just what kind of picture hed have he wondered if hed be able to understand it shaking off the mood he crossed the room and walked into the bath her head moved but that was all though her breath caught when he strolled into the room bryan kept her body still and submerged this kind of intimacy was new and left her vulnerable foolishly she wished shed poured in a layer of bubbles so that shed have some mystique shade leaned against the sink and watched her if she had plans to wash she was taking her time about it the little cake of soap sat wrapped in its dish while she lay naked in the tub it struck him that it was the first time hed seen her really seen her in the light her body was one long alluring line the room was small and steamy he wanted her shade wondered if a man could die from wanting hows the water he asked her hot bryan told herself to relax be natural the water that had soothed her now began to arouse good calmly he began to strip bryan opened her mouth but shut it again shed never seen him undress always theyd held to their own unspoken strict code of ethics when they camped each of them changed in the showers since theyd become lovers theyd fallen into a sense of urgency at the end of the day undressing themselves and each other in the dark van while they made love now for the first time she could watch her lover casually reveal his body to her she knew how it looked her hands had shown her but it was a far different experience to see the slopes the contours athletic she thought in the way of a runner or a hurdler she supposed it was apt enough shade would always expect the next hurdle and be prepared to leap over it he left his clothes on the sink but made no comment when he had to step over hers where shed dropped them you said something about washing your back he commented as he eased in behind her then he swore lightly at the temperature of the water you like to take off a couple layers of skin when you bathe she laughed relaxed and shifted to accommodate him when his body rubbed and slid against hers she decided there was something to be said for small tubs content she snuggled back against him a move that at first surprised him then pleased were both a little long she said as she adjusted her legs but it helps that were on the slim side keep eating he gave in to the urge to kiss the top of her head its bound to stick sooner or later never has she ran her hand along his thigh trailing from the knee it was a light casual stroke that made his insides churn i like to believe i burn up calories just thinking but you me on a quiet sigh bryan closed her eyes he was so complex so driven how could she explain it she knew so little of what hed seen and been through just one isolated incident she thought just one scar she didnt have to be told there were others youre very physical she said at length even your thought pattern has a kind of physical force to it you dont relax its like she hesitated for another moment then plunged its like youre a boxer in the ring even between rounds youre tensed and waiting for the bell to ring thats life isnt it but he found himself tracing the line of her neck with his finger one long match a quick breather then youre up and dancing ive never looked at it that way its an adventure she said slowly sometimes i dont have the energy for it so i can sit back and watch everyone else go through the moves maybe thats why i wanted to be a photographer so i could pull in little pieces of life and keep them think of it shade shifting slightly she turned her head so that she could look at him think of the people weve met the places weve been and seen and were only halfway done those rodeo cowboys she began eyes brightening all they wanted was a plug of tobacco a badtempered horse and a handful of sky the farmer in kansas riding his tractor in the heat of the day sweating and aching and looking out over acres of his own land children playing hopscotch old men weeding kitchen gardens or playing checkers in the park thats what life is its women with babies on their hips young girls sunning at the beach and kids splashing in little rubber swimming pools in the side yard he touched her cheek do you believe that did she it sounded so simplistic idealistic she wondered frowning she watched the steam rise from the water i believe that you have to take what good there is what beauty there is and go with it the rest has to be dealt with but not every minute of every day that woman today bryan settled back again not sure why it was so important for her to tell him the one in the house just across from where we stopped for gas her yard was burning up in the sun the paint was peeling on the fence i saw arthritis in her hands but she was watering her pansies maybe shes lived in that tiny little house all her life maybe shell never know what its like to sit in a new car and smell the leather or fly first class or shop at saks but she was watering her pansies shed planted weeded and tended them because they gave her pleasure something of value one bright foolish spot she can look at smile at maybe its enough flowers cant grow everywhere yes they can you only have to want them to it sounded true when she said it it sounded like something hed like to believe unconsciously he rested his cheek against her hair it was damp from the steam warm soft she made him relax just being with her listening to her uncurled something in him but he remembered the rules those theyd both agreed on keep it easy he reminded himself keep it light do you always have philosophical discussions in the tub her lips curved it was so rare and so rewarding to hear that touch of humor in his voice i figure if youre going to have one you might as well be comfortable now about my back shade picked up the soap and unwrapped it do you want the first shift in the darkroom tomorrow mmm she leaned forward stretching as he rubbed the dampened soap over her back tomorrow was too far away to worry about okay you can have it from eight to twelve she started to object to the early hour then subsided some things didnt change whatre you the question trailed off into a sigh as he skimmed the soap around her waist and up to her throat i like being pampered her voice was sleepy but he traced a soapy finger over her nipple and felt the quick shudder he ran the soap over her in steady circles lower still lower until all thought of relaxation was over abruptly she twisted until he was trapped beneath her her mouth fixed on his her hands raced over him taking him to the edge before he had a chance to brace himself bryan i love to touch you she slid down until her mouth could skim over his chest tasting flesh and water she nibbled listening to the thunder of his heart then rubbed her cheek against his damp flesh just to feel just to experience she felt him tremble and lie still a moment when was the last time hed let himself be made love to she wondered perhaps this time shed give him no choice shade she let her hands roam where they pleased come to bed with me before he could answer she rose while the water streamed from her she smiled down at him and slowly pulled the pins from her hair as it fell she shook it back then reached for a towel it seemed they were through with words she waited until he stepped from the tub then took another towel and rubbed it over him herself he made no objection but she could sense him building up the emotional defense not this time she thought this time it would be different as she dried him she watched his eyes she couldnt read his thoughts she couldnt see beneath the desire for now it was enough taking his hand she walked toward the bed she would love him this time no matter how strong how urgent the need she would show him what he made her feel slowly her arms already around him she lowered herself to the bed as the mattress gave her mouth found his the need was no less it tore through him but this time shade found himself unable to demand unable to pull her to his pace she was satiating him with the luxury of being enjoyed her lips took him deep deeper but lazily he learned that with her passion could be built layer by finite layer until there was nothing else they smelled of the bath theyd shared of the soap that had rubbed from his skin to hers she seemed content to breathe it in to breathe it out while slowly driving him mad it was pleasure enough to see him in the lateafternoon sunlight no darkness now no shadows to make love in the light freely and without barriers was something she hadnt even known she craved his shoulders were still damp she could see the sheen of water on them taste it when their mouths met she could watch his eyes and see the desire there that echoed what pulsed inside her in this they were the same she told herself in this if nothing else they understood each other and when he touched her when she saw his gaze follow the trail of his hand she trembled needs his and hers collided shuddered then merged together there was more here than theyd allowed themselves or each other before at last this was intimacy shared knowledge shared pleasure no one led no one held back for the first time shade dropped all pretenses of keeping that thin emotional barrier between them she filled him completed him this time he wanted her all of her more than hed ever wanted anything he wanted the fun of her the joy the kindness he wanted to believe it could make a difference the sun slanted in across the deep vivid gray of her eyes highlighting them as hed once imagined her mouth was soft yielding above him her hair flowed down wild free the lowering sun seemed trapped in her skin making it gleam gold she might have been something hed only imagined woman lean agile and primitive woman without restraints accepting her own passions if he photographed her this way would he recognize her would he be able to recapture the emotions she could push into him then she tossed back her head and she was young vibrant reachable this woman hed know this feeling hed recognize if he went away alone for decades hed need no photograph to remind him of that one astonishing instant of give and of take shade drew her closer needing her you he thought dizzily as their bodies merged and their thoughts twined only you he watched her eyes slowly close as she gave herself to him chapter contents prev next i could get used to this with her camera settled comfortably in her lap bryan stretched back in the pirogue the trim little dugout canoe theyd borrowed from a family who lived in the bayou a few miles away was the bustling city of lafayette louisiana but here was a more slumberous view of summer bees humming shade spreading birds trilling dragonflies one whisked by too fast for her camera but slow enough to appreciate spanish moss hung overhead shading and dipping toward the river as the water moved slowly why hurry it was summer fish were there for catching flowers were there for picking cypress knees thrust their way out of the water and an occasional frog stirred himself enough to plop from his pad and take a swim why hurry indeed life was there to be enjoyed as shade had once pointed out bryan was adaptable in the rush of dallas shed worked long hours in the darkroom and on the street all business when the moment called for it she could be efficient quick and energetic but here where the air was heavy and the living slow she was content to lie back cross her ankles and wait for whatever came were supposed to be working he pointed out she smiled arent we while she swung one foot in lazy circles she wished theyd thought to borrow a fishing pole as well what did it feel like to catch a catfish we took dozens of pictures before we got in the boat she reminded him itd been her idea to detour into the bayou though she was all but certain shade had topped her with his pictures of the family whod welcomed them she mightve charmed them into the use of their boat but shade had won hands down with camera work the one you took of mrs bienville shelling beans has to be fabulous her hands bryan shook her head and relaxed ive never seen such hands on a woman i imagine she could make the most elegant of soufflés right before she went out and cut down a tree cajuns have their own way of life their own rules she tilted her head as she studied him you like that yeah he rowed not because they needed to get anywhere but because it felt so good it warmed his muscles and relaxed his mind he nearly smiled thinking that being with bryan accomplished almost the same thing i like the independence and the fact that it works bryan lay back listening to the buzz and hum of insects sounds of the river theyd walked along another river in san antonio but the sounds had been different there soft spanish music from musicians the clink of silver on china from the outdoor cafes it had been fabulous at night she remembered the lights had glowed on the water the water had rippled from the river taxis the taxis had been full of people content with the texas version of a gondola shed taken a picture of two young lovers newlyweds perhaps huddled together on one of the arched stone bridges above the water when theyd driven into galveston shed seen yet another kind of texas one with white sand beaches ferries and bicycle surreys itd been easier to talk shade into renting one than shed imagined with a smile she thought of just how far theyd come not only in miles they were working together and when he could be distracted they played in malibu theyd gone their separate ways on the beach in galveston after two hours of work theyd walked hand in hand along the shore a small thing for many people bryan mused but not for either of them each time they made love there seemed to be something more she didnt know what it was but she didnt question it it was shade she wanted to be with laugh with talk with every day she discovered something new something different about the country and the people she discovered it with shade perhaps that was all the answer she needed what was it about him whether she chose to or not there were times she wondered what was it about shade colby that made her happy he wasnt always patient one moment he might be generous and something close to sweet and the next he could be as cool and aloof as a stranger being with him wasnt without its frustrations for a woman accustomed to less fluctuating moods but being with him was exactly what she wanted at the moment he was relaxed he wasnt often she knew but the mood of the river seemed to have seeped into him still he was watching someone else might have floated down the river glancing at the scenery appreciating the overall effect shade dissected it this she understood because it was her way as well a tree might be studied for the texture of its leaves the grain in the wood the pattern of shade and light it allowed to fall on the ground a layman might take a perfectly competent picture of the tree but it would be only that when bryan took the picture she wanted it to pull feelings out of the viewer she specialized in people bryan remembered as she watched shade draw the oars through the water landscapes still lifes she considered a change of pace it was the human element that had and would always fascinate her if she wanted to understand her feelings about shade maybe it was time to treat him as she would any other subject under halflowered lashes she studied and dissected he had very dominating physical looks she mused being dominated was definitely not her ambition in life perhaps that was why she was so often drawn to his mouth because it was sensitive vulnerable she knew his image cool distant pragmatic part of it was true she thought but part of it was illusion once shed thought to photograph him in shadows now she wondered what sort of study shed get if she photographed him in quiet sunlight without giving herself a chance to think she lifted her camera framed him in and shot just testing she said lightly when he arched a brow and after all youve already taken a couple of me so i have he remembered the picture hed taken of her brushing her hair on the rock in arizona he hadnt told her that hed sent the print back to the magazine nor did he doubt it would be used in the final essay nor had he told her it was a print he intended to keep in his private collection hold it a minute with brisk professional movements she changed her lens adjusted for distance and depth and focused on a heron perched on top of a cypress knee a place like this she murmured as she took two more insurance shots makes you think summer just goes on and on maybe we should take another three months traveling back and do autumn its tempting she stretched back again very tempting a study on all seasons your clients might get testy unfortunately true still she let her fingers dip into the water we miss the seasons in la id like to see spring in virginia and winter in montana tossing her braid back she sat up have you ever thought of chucking it shade just packing up and moving to oh say nebraska and setting up a little studio wedding and graduation pictures you know he gave her a long steady look no with a laugh she flopped back me either you wouldnt find many megastars in nebraska she narrowed her eyes but spoke mildly is that another subtle shot at my work your work he began as he gently turned the boat back is uniformly excellent otherwise we wouldnt be working together thank you very much i think and because of the quality of your work he continued i wonder why you limit yourself to the pretty people its my specialty she saw a clump of wild flowers on the mossy muddy edge of the river carefully she adjusted her camera again and a great many of my subjects are far from pretty physically or emotionally they interest me she said before he could comment i like to find out whats under the image and give a glimpse of it and she was well skilled at it he decided in truth hed discovered he admired her for it not only for her skill but for her perception he simply couldnt rationalize her following the glitz trail culture art if hed meant it as an insult however mild it missed its mark yes and if you asked id say shakespeare wrote culture art are you hungry no fascinating woman he thought as reluctant as ever to be fascinated he craved her it was true her body her company but he couldnt resolve the constant fascination she held for him mind to mind you had a bowl of shrimp and rice big enough to feed a family of four before we started out that was hours ago two to be exact picky she mumbled and stared up at the sky so peaceful she mused so simple moments like this were meant to be savored lowering her gaze she smiled at him ever made love in a pirogue he had to grin she made it impossible to do otherwise no but i dont think we should ever refuse a new experience bryan touched her tongue to her top lip come here they left the lazy insecthumming air of the bayou behind and landed in bustling raucous new orleans sweating trumpet players on bourbon street merchants fanning themselves in the farmers market artists and tourists around jackson square it was a taste of the south they both agreed that was as far apart from the south as san antonio had been apart from texas from there they traveled north to mississippi for a touch of july in the deep south heat and humidity tall cool drinks and precious shade life was different here in the cities men sweated in white shirts and loosened ties in the rural districts farmers worked under the sweltering sun but they moved more slowly than their counterparts to the north and west perhaps temperatures soaring to a hundred and more caused it or perhaps it was just a way of life children exercised the privilege of youth and wore next to nothing their bodies were browned and damp and dusty in a city park bryan took a closeup of a grinning boy with mahogany skin cooling himself in a fountain the camera hadnt intimidated him as she homed in hed laughed at her squealing as the water cascaded over him white and cool until hed looked encased in glass in a small town just northwest of jackson they stumbled across a little league game it wasnt much of a field and the bleachers looked as if theyd object to more than fifty people at a time but they pulled off and parked between a pickup and a rustedout sedan this is great bryan grabbed her camera bag you just smell hot dogs that too she agreed easily but this is summer we might get to a yankee game in new york but well get better pictures here today she hooked her arm through his before he could get too far away ill reserve judgment on the hot dogs shade took a long sweeping view the crowd was spread out on the grass in folding chairs on the bleachers they cheered complained gossiped and gulped iced drinks he was all but certain everyone there knew one another by name or by sight he watched an old man in a baseball cap casually spit out a plug of tobacco before he berated the umpire im going to wander around a bit he decided considering a seat on the bleachers too limiting for the moment okay bryan had taken her own scan and considered the bleachers the focal point for what she wanted they separated shade moving toward the old man whod already captured his attention bryan walked to the bleachers where she and the onlookers would have a solid view of the game the players wore white pants already grass stained and dusty with bright red or blue shirts emblazoned with team names a good many of them were too small for the uniforms and the mitts looked enormous on the ends of gangling arms some wore spikes some wore sneakers a few had batting gloves hung professionally from their back pocket it was the hats she decided that told of the individuals personality one might wear it snug or tipped back another tilted rakishly over the eyes she wanted an action shot something that would bring the color and the personalities together with the sport itself until something formed for her bryan contented herself with taking a shot of the second baseman who passed the time until the batter stepped into the box by kicking his spikes against the bag and blowing bubbles with his wad of gum scooting up another step she tried her long lens better she decided and was pleased to see that her second baseman had a face full of freckles above her someone snapped gum and whistled when the umpire called a strike bryan lowered her camera and allowed herself to become involved in the game if she wanted to portray the atmosphere she had to let herself feel it it was more than the game she thought it was the feeling of community as the batters came up people in the crowd called them by name tossing out casual remarks that indicated a personal knowledge but the sides were definitely drawn parents had come to the game from work grandparents had pushed away from an early dinner and neighbors had chosen the game against an evening by the tv they had their favorites and they werent shy about rooting for them the next batter interested bryan mainly because she was a strikingly pretty girl of about twelve at a glance bryan wouldve set her more easily at a ballet bar than home plate but when she watched the way the girl gripped the bat and bent into her stance bryan lifted her camera this was one to watch bryan caught her in the first swing on a strike though the crowd moaned bryan was thrilled with the flow of movement she might be shooting a little league game in a halfforgotten town in mississippi but she thought of her studio work with the prima ballerina the batter poised for the pitch and bryan poised for the next shot she had to wait growing impatient through two balls low and outside she heard someone mumble beside her all she could think was if the girl walked shed lose the picture she wanted then it came over too fast for bryan to judge the placement of the ball but the girl connected with a solid swing the batter took off and using the motor drive bryan followed her around the bases when she rounded second bryan homed in on her face yes maria would understand that look bryan thought strain determination and just plain guts bryan had her as she slid into third with a storm of dust and a swing of body wonderful she lowered the camera so thrilled that she didnt even realize shed spoken out loud just wonderful thats our girl distracted bryan glanced over to the couple beside her the woman was her own age perhaps a year or two older she was beaming the man beside her was grinning over a wad of gum perhaps she hadnt heard properly they were so young shes your daughter our oldest the woman slipped a hand into her husbands bryan saw the plain twin wedding bands weve got three others running around here but theyre more interested in the concession stand than the game not our carey the father looked out to where his daughter took a short lead on third shes all business i hope you dont mind my taking her picture no the woman smiled again do you live in town it was a polite way to find out who she was bryan hadnt a doubt the woman knew everyone within ten miles no im traveling she paused as the next batter blooped to right field and brought carey home actually im a freelance photographer on assignment for lifestyle perhaps youve heard of it sure the man jerked a head at his wife as he kept his eyes on the game she picks it up every month pulling a release form out of her bag she explained her interest in using careys picture though she kept it short and her voice low word spread throughout the bleachers bryan found herself answering questions and dealing with curiosity in order to handle it all in the simplest fashion she climbed down from the bleachers changed to a wide angle lens and took a group shot not a bad study she decided but she didnt want to spend the next hour having people pose for her to give the baseball fans time to shift their attention back to the game she wandered to the concession stand any luck she swiveled her head around to see shade fall into step beside her yeah you he nodded then leaned on the counter of the stand there was no relief from the heat though the sun was lowering it promised to be as sweltering a night as it had a day he ordered two large drinks and two hot dogs know what id love she asked as she began to bury her hot dog under relish a shovel ignoring him she piled on mustard a long cool dip in an enormous pool followed closely by an iced margarita for now youll have to settle for the drivers seat of the van its your turn she shrugged a job was a job did you see the girl who hit the triple they walked over the uneven grass toward the van kid that ran like a bullet yes i sat next to her parents in the stands they have four kids so four kids she repeated and id swear she wasnt more than thirty how do people do it ask me later and ill show you with a laugh she jabbed him with her elbow thats not what i meant though i like the idea what i mean is heres this couple young attractive you could tell they even liked each other amazing dont be cynical she ordered as she pulled open the door to the van a great many couples dont especially when theyve got four kids a mortgage and ten or twelve years of marriage under their belts now whos being cynical she started to speak and frowned instead i guess i am she mused as she turned on the engine maybe ive picked a world thats tilted my outlook but when i see a happily married couple with a track record im impressed it is impressive carefully he stored his camera bag under the dash before he sat back when it really works yeah she fell silent remembering the jolt of envy and longing shed felt when shed framed the browns in her viewfinder now weeks and miles later it was another jolt for bryan to realize she hadnt brushed off that peculiar feeling she had managed to put it aside somewhere to the back of her mind but it popped out again now as she thought of the couple in the bleachers of a smalltown park family cohesion bonding did some people just keep promises better than others she wondered or were some people simply unable to blend their lives with someone elses make those adjustments the compromises when she looked back she believed both she and rob had tried but in their own ways thered been no meeting of the minds but two separate thought patterns making decisions that never melded with the others did that mean that a successful marriage depended on the mating of two people who thought along the same lines with a sigh she turned onto the highway that would lead them into tennessee if it were true she decided she was much better off single though shed met a great many people she liked and could have fun with shed never met anyone who thought the way she did especially the man seated next to her with his nose already buried in the newspaper there alone they were radically different hed read that paper and every paper in every town they stopped in from cover to cover devouring the words shed skim the headlines glance over the style or society pages and go straight for the comics if she wanted news shed rather have it in spurts on the radio or blurbs on televisions reading was for relaxation and relaxation was not an analysis of detente relationships she thought back on the discussion shed had with lee just weeks before no she simply wasnt cut out for relationships on a longterm basis shade himself had pointed out that some people just werent capable of permanency shed agreed hadnt she why should the truth suddenly depress her whatever her feelings were for shade and shed yet to define them satisfactorily she wasnt going to start smelling orange blossoms maybe she had a few twinges when she saw couples together who seemed to complete each other rather than compete but that was only natural after all she didnt want to start making adjustments in her lifestyle to accommodate someone else at this stage she was perfectly content the way things were if she were in love bryan felt the twinge again and ignored it if she were it would complicate things the fact was she was very happy with a successful career her freedom and an attractive interesting lover shed be crazy if she wasnt happy shed be insane to change one single thing and it doesnt have anything to do with being afraid she said aloud what she turned to shade and to his astonishment and hers blushed nothing she muttered thinking out loud he gave her a long quiet look her expression came very close to a baffled sort of pout giving in to the urge he leaned over and touched a hand to her cheek youre not eating your hot dog she could have wept for some absurd reason she wanted to stop the van drop her head on the steering wheel and drown herself in hot violent tears not hungry she managed bryan he watched her snatch her sunglasses from the dash and push them on though the sun was riding low are you all right fine she took a deep breath and kept her eyes straight ahead im fine no she wasnt though strain in her voice was rare he recognized it only a few weeks before hed have shrugged and turned back to his reading deliberately he dropped the paper on the floor at his feet what is it nothing she cursed herself and turned up the radio shade simply switched it off pull over what for just pull over with more violence than necessary bryan swung the van toward the shoulder slowed and stopped we wont make very good time if we stop ten minutes after we start we wont be making any time at all until you tell me whats wrong nothings wrong then she gritted her teeth and sat back it wasnt any use saying nothing was wrong if you snarled at the same time i dont know she evaded im edgy thats all you she turned on him with a vengeance ive a right to foul moods colby you dont have a patent on them you certainly have he said mildly since its the first one ive witnessed im interested dont be so damn patronizing wanna fight she stared through the windshield maybe okay willing to oblige he made himself comfortable about anything in particular she swung her head around ready to pounce on anything do you have to bury your face in a paper every time i get behind the wheel he smiled maddeningly yes dear a low sound came from her throat as she stared through the windshield again never mind i could point out that you have a habit of falling asleep when you sit in this seat i said never mind she reached for the key just never mind you make me sound like a fool he put his hand over hers before she could turn the key you sound foolish skirting around whatevers bothering you he wanted to reach her without being aware when hed passed the point where he could tell himself not to get involved and follow the advice whether he wanted it or not whether she accepted it or not he was involved slowly he lifted her hand to his lips bryan i care she sat there stunned that a simple statement could spin through her with such force care hed used the same phrase when hed spoken about the woman whod caused his nightmare along with the pleasure his words brought her came an inescapable sense of responsibility he wouldnt allow himself to care indiscriminately glancing up she met his eyes patient puzzled as they studied her face i care too she said quietly she twined her fingers with his only briefly but it unsettled them both shade took the next step carefully not certain of her or himself is that whats bothering you she let out a long breath as wary as he now some im not used to it not like this neither am i she nodded watching the cars breeze by i guess wed both better take it easy then sounds logical and next to impossible he thought right now he wanted to gather her close forget where they were just hold her he realized it was all he wanted to do with an effort he drew back no complications she managed to smile rule number one was the most important after all no complications she agreed again she reached for the key read your paper colby she said lightly ill drive until dark chapter contents prev next they took a slice out of tennessee nashville chattanooga caught the eastern corner of arkansas mountains and legends and headed up through twains missouri to kentucky there they found tobacco leaves mountain laurel fort knox and mammoth cave but when bryan thought of kentucky she thought of horses kentucky was sleek glossy thoroughbreds grazing on rich grass it made her think of longlegged foals running in wide pastures and widechested colts pounding the track at churchill downs as they crossed the state toward louisville she saw much more tidy suburban homes bordered the larger cities and smaller towns as they did in every state across the country farms spread acre after acre tobacco horses grain cities rose with their busy office buildings and harried streets so much was the same as it had been to the west and to the south and yet so much was different daniel boone and the cherokees bryan murmured as they traveled down another long monotonous highway what slade glanced up from the map hed been checking when bryan was driving it didnt hurt to keep an eye on the navigation daniel boone and the cherokees bryan repeated she increased the speed to pass a camper loaded down with bikes on the back bumper and fishing poles on the front and where were they going she wondered where had they come from i was thinking maybe its the history of a place that makes it different from another maybe its the climate the topography shade glanced back down at the map idly figuring the time and mileage he didnt give the camper rolling along behind them more than a passing thought yes bryan shot him an exasperated smile one and one always added up to two for shade but people are basically the same dont you think i imagine if you took a cross section of the country and polled youd find out that most people want the same things a roof over their heads a good job a couple weeks off a year to play flowers in the garden all right yes she gave a careless little shrug and refused to believe it sounded foolish i think most peoples wants are fairly simple italian shoes and a trip to barbados might add in but its the basic things that touch everyone healthy children a nest egg a steak on the grill youve a way of simplifying things bryan maybe but i dont see any reason to complicate them interested he set down the map and turned to her perhaps hed avoided digging too deeply into her leery of what he might find but now behind his sunglasses his eyes were direct so was his question what do you want i she faltered a moment frowning as she took the van around a long curve i dont know what you mean he thought she did but they always seemed to end up fencing a roof over your head a good job are those the most important things to you two months before she mightve shrugged and agreed her job came first and gave her whatever she needed that was the way shed planned it the way shed wanted it she wasnt sure any longer since shed left la shed seen too much felt too much i have those things she said evasively of course i want them and uncomfortable she shifted she hadnt meant to have her idle speculation turned back on her i wouldnt turn down a trip to barbados he didnt smile as shed hoped he would but continued to watch her from behind the protection of tinted glasses youre still simplifying im a simple person her hands were light and competent on the wheel her hair scooped back in its habitual braid she wore no makeup a pair of faded cutoffs and a tshirt two sizes too large for her no he decided after a moment youre not you only pretend to be abruptly wary she shook her head since her outburst in mississippi bryan had managed to keep herself level and to keep herself she admitted from thinking too deeply youre a complicated person shade and you see complications where there arent any she wished she could see his eyes she wished she could see the thoughts behind them i know what i see when i look at you and it isnt simple she shrugged carelessly but her body had begun to tense im easily read he corrected her with a short concise word calmly spoken bryan blinked once then gave her attention to the road well im certainly not full of mysteries wasnt she shade watched the thin gold loops sway at her ears i wonder what youre thinking when you lie beside me after weve made love in those minutes after passion and before sleep i often wonder she wondered too after weve made love she said in a tolerably steady voice i have a hard time thinking at all this time he did smile youre always soft and sleepy he murmured making her tremble and i wonder what you might say what i might hear if you spoke your thoughts aloud that i might be falling in love with you that every day we have together takes us a day closer to the end that i cant imagine what my life will be like when i dont have you there to touch to talk to those were her thoughts but she said nothing she had her secrets shade thought just as he did one day before were finished youll tell me he was easing her into a corner bryan felt it but she didnt know why havent i told you enough already no giving in to the urge that came over him more and more often he touched her cheek not nearly she tried to smile but she had to clear her throat to speak this is a dangerous conversation to have when im driving on an interstate at sixty miles an hour its a dangerous conversation in any case slowly he drew his hand away i want you bryan i cant look at you and not want you she fell silent not because he was saying things she didnt want to hear but because she no longer knew how to deal with them and with him if she spoke she might say too much and break whatever bond had begun to form she couldnt tell him so but it was a bond she wanted he waited for her to speak needing her to say something after hed all but crossed over the line theyd drawn in the beginning risk hed taken one couldnt she see it needs he needed her couldnt she feel it but she remained silent and the step forward became a step back your exits coming up he told her picking up the map he folded it carefully bryan switched lanes slowed down and left the highway kentucky had made her think of horses horses led them to louisville and louisville to churchill downs the derby was long over but there were races and there were crowds if they were going to include in their glimpse of summer those who spent an afternoon watching races and betting where else would they go the moment bryan saw it she thought of a dozen angles there were cathedrallike domes and clean white buildings that gave a quiet elegance to the frenzy the track was the focal point a long oval of packed dirt stands rose around it bryan walked about wondering just what kind of person would come there or to any track to plop down two dollars or two hundred on a race that would take only minutes again she saw the variety there was the man with reddened arms and a sweaty tshirt who pored over a racing form and another in casually elegant slacks who sipped something long and cool she saw women in quietly expensive dresses holding field glasses and families treating their children to the sport of kings there was a man in a gray hat with tattoos snaking up both arms and a boy laughing on top of his fathers shoulders theyd been to baseball games tennis matches drag races across the country always she saw faces in the crowd that seemed to have nothing in common except the game the games had been invented bryan mused and turned into industries it was an interesting aspect of human nature but people kept the games alive they wanted to be amused they wanted to compete she spotted one man leaning against the rail watching a race as though his life depended on the outcome his body was coiled his face damp she caught him in profile a quick scan showed her a woman in a pale rose dress and summer hat she watched the race idly distanced from it the way an empress mightve been from a contest in a coliseum bryan framed her as the crowd roared the horses down the stretch shade rested a hip on the rail and shot the horses in varying positions around the track ending with the final lunge across the finish line before hed framed in the odds board where numbers flashed and tempted now he waited until the results were posted and focused on it again before the races were over shade saw bryan standing at the twodollar window with her camera hanging around her neck and her ticket in her hand she walked back toward the stands havent you got any willpower he asked her no shed found a vending machine and offered shade a candy bar that was already softening in the heat besides theres a horse in the next race called made in the shade when his eyebrow lifted up she grinned how could i resist he wanted to tell her she was foolish he wanted to tell her she was unbearably sweet instead he drew her sunglasses down her nose until he could see her eyes whats his number seven shade glanced over at the odds board and shook his head thirtyfive to one howd you bet to win of course taking her arm he led her down to the rail again you can kiss your two bucks goodbye hotshot or i can win seventy bryan pushed her glasses back in place then ill take you out to dinner if i lose she continued as the horses were led to the starting gate ive always got plastic i can still take you out to dinner deal shade told her as the bell rang bryan watched the horses lunge forward they were nearly to the first turn before she managed to find number seven third from the back she glanced up to see shade shake his head dont give up on him yet when you bet on a long shot love youve got to be ready to lose a bit flustered by his absent use of the endearment she turned back to the race shade rarely called her by name much less one of those sweetly intimate terms a long shot she agreed silently but she wasnt altogether sure she was as prepared to lose as she mightve been hes moving up she said quickly as number seven passed three horses with long harddriving strides forgetting herself she leaned on the rail and laughed look at him hes moving up lifting her camera she used the telephoto lens like a field glass god hes beautiful she murmured i didnt know he was so beautiful watching the horse she forgot the race the competition he was beautiful she could see the jockey riding low in a blur of color that had a style of its own but it was the horse muscles bunching legs pounding that held her fascinated he wanted to win she could feel it no matter how many races hed lost how many times hed been led back to the stables sweating he wanted to win hope she sensed it but she no longer heard the call of the crowd around her the horse straining to overtake the leaders hadnt lost hope he believed he could win and if you believed hard enough with a last burst of speed he nipped by the leader and crossed the wire like a champion ill be damned shade murmured he found he had his arm around bryans shoulders as they watched the winner take his victory lap in long steady strides beautiful her voice was low and thick hey shade tipped up her chin when he heard the tears it was only a twodollar bet she shook her head he did it he wanted to win and he just didnt give up until he did shade ran a finger down her nose ever hear of luck yeah more composed she took his hand in hers and this had nothing to do with it for a moment he studied her then with a shake of his head he lowered his mouth to hers lightly sweetly and this from a woman who claims to be simple and happy she thought as her fingers laced with his ridiculously happy lets go collect my winnings there was a rumor he began as they worked their way through the stands about you buying dinner yeah i heard something about it myself she was a woman of her word that evening as the sky flashed with lightning and echoed with the thunder of a summer storm they stepped into a quiet lowlighted restaurant linen napkins bryan murmured to shade as they were led to a table he laughed in her ear as he pulled out her chair youre easily impressed true enough she agreed but i havent seen a linen napkin since june picking it off her plate she ran it through her hands it was smooth and rich there isnt a vinyl seat or a plastic light in this place there wont be any little plastic containers of ketchup either with a wink she knocked a finger against a plate and let it ring try that with paper and all you get is a thump shade watched her experiment with the water glass next all this from the queen of fast food a steady diet of hamburgers is all right but i like a change of pace lets have champagne she decided as their waiter came over she glanced at the list made her choice and turned back to shade again you just blew your winnings on a bottle of wine easy come easy go cupping her chin on her hands she smiled at him did i mention you look wonderful by candlelight no amused he leaned forward as well shouldnt that be my line maybe but you didnt seem in a rush to come out with it besides im buying however she sent him a slow simmering look if youd like to say something flattering i wouldnt be offended lazily she ran a finger along the back of his hand making him wonder why any man would object to the benefits of womens liberation it wasnt a hardship to be wined and dined nor would it be a hardship to relax and be seduced all the same shade decided as he lifted her hand to his lips there was something to be said for partnership i might say that you always look lovely but tonight he let his gaze wander over her face tonight you take my breath away momentarily flustered she allowed her hand to stay in his how was it he could say such things so calmly so unexpectedly and how could she when she was used to casual inconsequential compliments from men deal with one that seemed so serious carefully she warned herself very carefully in that case ill have to remember to use lipstick more often with a quick smile he kissed her fingers again you forgot to put any on oh stuck bryan stared at him madam the wine steward held out the bottle of champagne label up yes she let out a quiet breath yes thats fine still watching shade she heard the cork give into pressure and the wine bubble into her glass she sipped closing her eyes to enjoy it then with a nod she waited until the steward filled both glasses steadier bryan lifted her glass and smiled at shade to one summer he said and touched his rim to hers one fascinating summer it made her lips curve again so that her eyes reflected the smile as she sipped i expected you to be a terrible bore to work with really shade let the champagne rest on his tongue a moment like bryan it was smooth and quiet with energy bubbling underneath i expected you to be a pain in the however she interrupted dryly ive been pleased that my preconception didnt hold true she waited a moment and yours did he said easily then laughed when she narrowed her eyes at him but i wouldnt have enjoyed you nearly as much if itd been otherwise i liked your other compliment better she mumbled and picked up her menu but i suppose since youre stingy with them i have to take what i get i only say what i mean i know she pushed back her hair as she skimmed the menu but i oh look theyve got chocolate mousse most people start at the appetizers id rather work backward then i can gauge how much i want to eat and still have room for dessert i cant imagine you turning down anything chocolate right you are what i cant understand is how you can shovel it in the way you do and not be fat just lucky i guess with the menu open over her plate she smiled at him dont you have any weaknesses shade yeah he looked at her until she was baffled and flustered again a few and one of them he thought as he watched her eyes was becoming more and more acute are you ready to order distracted bryan looked up at the wellmannered waiter what are you ready to order he repeated or would you like more time the ladyll have the chocolate mousse shade said smoothly yes sir unflappable the waiter marked it down will that be all not by a long shot shade told him and picked up his wine again with a laugh bryan worked her way through the menu stuffed bryan decided over an hour later as they drove through a hard driving rain absolutely stuffed shade cruised through an amber light watching you eat is an amazing way to pass the time were here to entertain she said lightly snuggled back in her seat with champagne swimming in her head and thunder grumbling in a badtempered sky she was content to ride along wherever he chose to go it was sweet of you to let me have a bite of your cheesecake half shade corrected her deliberately he turned away from the campground theyd decided on that afternoon the wipers made quick swishing sounds against the windshield but youre welcome it was lovely she let out a sigh quiet and sleepy i like being pampered tonight should get me through another month of fastfood chains and diners with stale doughnuts content she glanced around at the dark wet streets the puddles at the curbs she liked the rain especially at night when it made everything glisten watching it she fell to dreaming rousing herself only when he turned into the lot of a small motel no campground tonight he said before she could question wait here while i get a room she didnt have time to comment before he was out of the van and dashing through the rain no campground she thought looking over her shoulder at the narrow twin bunks on either side of the van no skinny makeshift beds and trickling showers with a grin she jumped up and began to gather his equipment and hers she never gave the suitcases a thought champagne linen napkins and now a bed she laughed as he climbed back into the van soaking wet im going to get spoiled he wanted to spoil her there was no logic to it only fact tonight if only for tonight he wanted to spoil her rooms around the back when bryan dragged the equipment forward he drove slowly around checking numbers on the lines of doors here he strapped camera bags over his shoulder wait a minute shed grabbed another bag and her purse by the time hed pulled open her door from the outside to her astonishment she found herself lifted into his arms shade but the rain slapped into her face making her gasp as he dashed across the lot to an outside door least i could do after you sprang for dinner he told her as he maneuvered the oversize key into the lock bryan was laughing as he struggled to open the door holding her the camera bags and tripods kicking the door closed with his foot he fastened his mouth on hers still laughing bryan clung to him now were both wet she murmured running a hand through his hair well dry off in bed before she knew his intention bryan was falling through the air and landing with two bounces full length onto the mattress so romantic she said dryly but her body stayed limp she lay there smiling because hed made a rare frivolous gesture and she intended to enjoy it her dress clung to her her hair fanned out hed seen her change for dinner and knew she wore a thin teddy cut high at the thigh low over her breasts and sheer sheer stockings he could love her now love her for hours it wouldnt be enough he knew how relaxed how pliant her body could be how full of fire strength vibrancy he could want all of it have all of it it wouldnt be enough he was an expert at capturing the moment the emotions the message letting his own feelings hum he reached for his camera bag whatre you doing when she started to sit up shade turned back stay there a minute intrigued and wary she watched him set his camera i dont just lie back like you were he interrupted relaxed and rather pleased with yourself his intention was obvious enough now bryan lifted a brow an obsession she thought amused the camera was an obsession for both of them shade im a photographer not a model humor me gently he pushed her back on the bed ive too much champagne in my system to argue with you she smiled up at him as he held the camera over his face you can play if you like or take serious pictures if you must as long as i dont have to do anything she did nothing but smile and he began to throb so often hed used the camera as a barrier between himself and his subject other times as a conductor for his emotion emotion he refused to let loose any other way now it was neither the emotion was already in him and barriers werent possible he framed her quickly and shot but was unsatisfied thats not what i want he was so businesslike that bryan didnt see it as a defense only as his manner but when he came over pulled her into a sitting position and unzipped her dress her mouth fell open shade its that lazy sex he murmured as he slipped the dress down over one shoulder those incredible waves of sensuality that take no effort at all but just are its the way your eyes look but when his came back to hers she forgot the joke shed been about to make the way they look when i touch you like this slowly he ran a hand over her naked shoulder the way they look just after i kiss you like this he kissed her lingering over it while her mind emptied of thought and her body filled with sensation like this he whispered more determined than ever to capture that moment make it tangible so that he could hold it in his hands and see it just like this he said again backing off one step then two the way you look just before we make love the way you look just after helplessly aroused bryan stared into the lens of the camera as he lifted it he caught her there like a quarry in the cross hairs of a scope empty of thoughts jumbled with feeling at the same time he caught himself for an instant her heart was in her eyes the shutter opened closed and captured it when he printed the photograph he thought as he carefully set down his camera would he see what she felt would he be certain of his own feelings now she sat on the bed her dress disarrayed her hair tumbled her eyes clouded secrets shade thought again they both had them was it possible hed locked a share of each of their secrets on film inside his camera when he looked at her now he saw a woman aroused a woman who aroused he could see passion and pliancy and acceptance he could see a woman whom hed come to know better than anyone else yet he saw a woman hed yet to reach one hed avoided reaching he went to her in silence her skin was damp but warm as hed known it would be raindrops clung to her hair he touched one then it was gone her arms lifted while the storm raged outside he took her and himself where there was no need for answers chapter contents prev next if they had more time as august began to slip by that was the thought that continued to run through bryans mind with more time they could have stayed longer at each stop with more time they might have passed through more states more towns more communities there was so much to see so much to record but time was running out in less than a month the school shed photographed empty and waiting in the afternoon light would be filled again leaves that were full and green would take on those vibrant colors before they fell she would be back in la back in her studio back to the routine shed established for the first time in years the word alone had a hollow ring how had it happened shade colby had become her partner her lover her friend hed become though it was frightening to admit the most important person in her life somehow shed become dependent on him for his opinion his company for the nights they spent involved only with each other she could imagine how it would be when they returned to la and went their separate ways separate parts of the city she thought separate lives separate outlooks the closeness that had so slowly almost painfully developed between them would dissolve wasnt that what theyd both intended from the start theyd made a bargain with each other just as theyd made the bargain to work together if her feelings had changed she was responsible for them for dealing with them as the odometer turned over on the next mile as the next state was left behind she wondered how to begin shade had his own thoughts to deal with when theyd crossed into maryland theyd crossed into the east the atlantic was close as close as the end of summer it was the end that disturbed him the word no longer seemed to mean finished but over he began to realize he was far from ready to draw that last line there were ways to rationalize it he tried them all theyd missed too much if they took their time driving back rather than sticking to their plan of going straight across the country they could detour into so many places theyd eliminated on the way out it made sense they could stay in new england a week two weeks after labor day after long days in the van and the intense work theyd both put in they deserved some time off it was reasonable they should work their way back rather than rush if they werent preoccupied with making time making miles how many pictures would come out of it if one of them were special it would be worth it that was professional when they returned to la perhaps bryan could move in with him share his apartment as theyd shared the van it was impossible wasnt it she didnt want to complicate their relationship hadnt she said so he didnt want the responsibility of committing himself to one person hadnt he made himself clear perhaps hed come to need her companionship on some level and it was true hed learned to appreciate the way she could look at anything and see the fun and the beauty of it that didnt equal promises commitments or complications with a little time a little distance the need was bound to fade the only thing he was sure of was that he wanted to put off that point for as long as possible bryan spotted a convertible red flashy its driver had one arm thrown over the white leather seat while her short blond hair flew in the wind grabbing her camera bryan leaned out the open window half kneeling half crouching on the seat she adjusted for depth she wanted to catch it from the rear elongating the car into a blur of color but she didnt want to lose the arrogant angle of the drivers arm or the negligent way her hair streamed back already she knew she would dodge the plain gray highway and the other cars in the darkroom just the red convertible she thought as she set her camera try to keep just this distance she called to shade she took one shot and dissatisfied leaned out farther for the next though shade swore at her bryan got her shot before she laughed and flopped back on her seat he was guilty of the same thing he knew once the camera was in place you tended to think of it as a shield nothing could happen to you you simply werent part of what was happening though hed known better it had happened to him often enough even after his first stint overseas perhaps it was the understanding that made his voice mild though he was annoyed dont you have more sense than to climb out the window of a moving car couldnt resist theres nothing like a convertible on an open highway in august im always toying with the idea of getting one myself why dont you buying a new car is hard work she looked at the green and white road signs as shed looked at so many others that summer there were cities roads and routes shed never heard of i can hardly believe were in maryland weve come so far and yet i dont know it doesnt seem like two months two years she laughed sometimes other times it seems like days not enough time she said half to herself never enough shade didnt give himself the chance to think before he took the opening weve had to leave out a lot i know we went through kansas but not nebraska mississippi and not the carolinas we didnt go to michigan or wisconsin or florida washington state the dakotas she shrugged trying not to think of what was left behind just today bryan told herself just take today ive been thinking about tying them in on the way back on the way back bryan turned to him as he reached for a cigarette wed be on our own time the vans lighter glowed red against the tip but i think we could both take a month or so and finish the job more time bryan felt the quick surge of hope then ruthlessly toned it down he wanted to finish the job his way it was his way she reminded herself to do things thoroughly but did the reason really matter theyd have more time yes she realized as she stared out the side window the reason mattered a great deal too much the jobs finished in new england she said lightly summers over and its back to business my work at the studio will be backed up for a month still she felt herself weakening though he said nothing did nothing to persuade her i wouldnt mind a few detours on the trip back shade kept his hands easy on the wheel his voice casual well think about it he said and let the subject they both wanted to pursue drop weary of the highway they took to the back roads bryan took her pictures of kids squirting each other with garden hoses of laundry drying in the breeze of an elderly couple sitting on a porch glider shade took his of sweating construction workers spreading tar on roofs of laborers harvesting peaches and surprisingly of two tenyearold businessmen hawking lemonade in their front yard touched bryan accepted the paper cup shade handed her that was sweet you havent tasted it yet he commented and climbed into the passengers seat to keep down the overhead they used a light hand on the sugar i meant you on impulse she leaned over and kissed him lightly comfortably you can be a very sweet man as always she moved him and he couldnt stop it i can give you a list of people whod disagree what do they know with a smile she touched her lips to his again she drove down the neat shady street appreciating the trim lawns flower gardens and dogs barking in the yards i like the suburbs she said idly to look at anyway ive never lived in one theyre so orderly with a sigh she turned right at the corner if i had a house here id probably forget to fertilize the lawn and end up with crab grass and dandelions my neighbors would take up a petition id end up selling my house and moving into a condo so ends bryan mitchells career as a suburbanite she made a face at him some people arent cut out for picket fences true enough she waited but he said nothing that made her feel inadequate nothing that made her feel as though she should be she laughed delightedly then grabbed his hand and squeezed youre good for me shade you really are he didnt want to let her hand go and released it reluctantly good for her she said it so easily laughing because she did he knew she had no idea just what it meant to him to hear it maybe it was time he told her bryan whats that she said abruptly and swung toward the curb excited she inched the car forward until she could read the colorful cardboard poster tacked to a telephone pole nightingales traveling carnival pulling on the brake she nearly climbed over shade to see it more clearly voltara the electric woman with a half whoop she nudged closer to shade terrific just terrific sampson the dancing elephant madam zoltar mystic shade look its their last night in town we cant miss it whats summer without a carny thrilling rides games of skill and chance and dr wren the fire eater it was easy to ignore the dry tone fate she scrambled back to her own seat it has to be fate that we turned down this road otherwise we mightve missed it shade glanced back at the sign as bryan pulled away from the curb think of it he murmured we mightve gotten all the way to the coast without seeing a dancing elephant a half hour later shade leaned back in his seat calmly smoking his feet on the dash frazzled bryan swung the van around the next turn im not lost shade blew out a lazy stream of smoke i didnt say a word i know what youre thinking thats madam zoltars line and you can stop looking so smug was i you always look smug when i get lost you said you werent bryan gritted her teeth and sent him a killing look why dont you just pick up that map and tell me where we are i started to pick it up ten minutes ago and you snarled at me bryan let out a long breath it was the way you picked it up you were smirking and i could hear you thinking youre stepping into madam zoltars territory again damn it shade but she had to choke back a laugh as she drove down the long unlit country road i dont mind making a fool of myself but i hate it when someone lifts an eyebrow over it did i you know you did now if youd just then she caught the first glimmer of red blue green lights flickering a ferris wheel she thought it had to be the sound of tinny music came faintly through the summer dusk a calliope this time it was bryan who looked smug i knew id find it i never had a doubt she mightve had something withering to say to that but the lights glowing in the early evening dusk and the foolish piping music held her attention its been years she murmured just years since ive seen anything like this ive got to watch the fire eater and your wallet she shook her head as she turned off the road onto the bumpy field where cars were parked cynic realist he waited until she maneuvered the van next to a latemodel pickup lock the van shade gathered his bag and waited outside the van until bryan had hers where first she thought of pink cotton candy but restrained herself why dont we just wander around a bit we might want some shots now but at night theyd have more punch without the dark without the bright glow of colored lights the carnival looked too much like what it was a little weary more than a little tawdry its illusions were too easily unmasked now and that wasnt why bryan had come carnivals like santa claus had a right to their mystique in another hour when the sun had completely set behind those rolling bluetinted hills to the west the carnival would come into its own peeling paint wouldnt be noticed look theres voltara bryan grabbed shades arm and swung him around to see a lifesize poster that gave her lavish curves and scant cover as she was being strapped into what looked like a homemade electric chair shade looked at the painted spangles over generous cleavage might be worth watching after all with a quick snort bryan pulled him toward the ferris wheel lets take a ride from the top well be able to see the whole layout shade pulled a bill out of his wallet thats the only reason you want to ride dont be ridiculous they walked over waiting while the attendant let a couple off its a good way of covering ground and sitting down at the same time she began as she took the vacated seat its sure to be an excellent angle for some aerial pictures and she slipped a hand into his as they started the slow swing up its the very best place to neck at a carnival when he laughed she wrapped her arms around him and silenced his lips with hers they reached the top where the evening breeze flowed clean and hung there one moment two aware only of each other on the descent the speed picked up and the drop had her stomach shivering her mind swimming it was no different from the sensation of being held by him loved by him they held tight and close through two revolutions gathering her against his shoulder shade watched the carnival rush up toward them itd been years since hed held someone soft and feminine on a ferris wheel high school he wondered he could hardly remember now he realized hed let his youth slip by him because so many other things had seemed important at the time hed let it go freely and though he wouldnt couldnt ask for the whole of it back perhaps bryan was showing him how to recapture pieces of it i love the way this feels she murmured she could watch the sun go down in a last splashy explosion of arrogance hear the music the voices ebb and fade as the wheel spun around she could look down and be just removed enough from the scene to enjoy it just separate enough to understand it a ride on a ferris wheel should be required once a year like a routine physical with her head against shades shoulder she examined the scene below the midway the concessions the booths set up for games of skill she wanted to see it all close up she could smell popcorn grilling meat sweat the heavyhanded aftershave of the attendant as their car swung by him it gave her the overall view this was life a sidelong glance at it this was the little corner of life where children could see wonders and adults could pretend for just a little while taking her camera she angled down through the cars and wires to focus in on the attendant he looked a bit bored as he lifted the safety bar for one couple and lowered it for the next a job for him bryan thought a small thrill for the rest she sat back content to ride when it was dark they went to work there were people gathered around the wheel of fortune plopping down a dollar for a chance at more teenagers showed off for their girls or their peers by hurling softballs at stacked bottles toddlers hung over the rope and tossed pingpong balls at fishbowls hoping to win a goldfish whose life expectancy was short at best young girls squealed on the fastspinning octopus while young boys goggled at the posters along the midway bryan took one telling shot of a woman carrying a baby on one hip while a threeyearold dragged her mercilessly along shade took another of a trio of boys in muscle shirts standing apart and doing their best to look tough and aloof they ate slices of pizza with rubber crusts as they watched with the rest of the crowd as dr wren fire eater came out of his tent to give a quick teasing demonstration of his art like the tenyearold boy who watched beside her bryan was sold with an agreement to meet back at the entrance to the midway in thirty minutes they separated caught up bryan wandered she wasnt able to resist voltara and slipped into part of the show to see the somewhat weary glossyfaced woman strapped into a chair that promised to zap her with two thousand volts she pulled it off well enough bryan thought closing her eyes and giving a regal nod before the lever was pulled the special effects werent topnotch but they worked blue light shimmered up the chair and around voltaras head it turned her skin to the color of summer lightning at fifty cents a shot bryan decided as she stepped back out the audience got their moneys worth intrigued she wandered around in back of the midway to where the carnival workers parked their trailers no colorful lights here she mused as she glanced over the small caravan no pretty illusions tonight theyd pack up the equipment take down the posters and drive on the moonlight hit the metal of a trailer and showed the scratches and dents the shades were drawn at the little windows but there was faded lettering on the side nightingales bryan found it touching and crouched to shoot lost little lady surprised bryan sprang up and nearly collided with a short husky man in tshirt and work pants if he worked for the carnival bryan thought quickly hed been taking a long break if hed come to watch the lights and sideshows hadnt held his interest the smell of beer warm and stale clung to him no she gave him a careful smile and kept a careful distance fear hadnt entered into it the move had been automatic and mild there were lights and people only a few yards away and she thought he might give her another angle for his photographs do you work here woman shouldnt wander around in the dark alone less shes looking for something no fear hadnt been her first reaction nor did it come now annoyance did it was that that showed in her eyes before she turned away excuse me then he had her arm and it occurred to her that the lights were a great deal farther away than shed have liked brazen it out she told herself look ive people waiting for me youre a tall one aint you his fingers were very firm if his stance wasnt he weaved slightly as he looked bryan over dont mind looking eye to eye with a woman lets have a drink some other time bryan put her hand on his arm to push it away and found it solid as a concrete block thats when the fear began i came back here to take some pictures she said as calmly as she could my partners waiting for me she pushed at his arm again youre hurting me got some more beer in my truck he mumbled as he began to drag her farther away from the lights no her voice rose on the first wave of panic i dont want any beer he stopped a moment swaying as bryan took a good look in his eyes she realized he was as drunk as a man could get and still stand fear bubbled hot in her throat maybe you want something else he skimmed down her thin summer top and brief shorts woman usually wants something when she wanders around half naked her fear ebbed as cold fury rushed in bryan glared he grinned you ignorant ass she hissed just before she brought her knee up hard his breath came out in a whoosh as he dropped his hand bryan didnt wait to see him crouch over she ran she was still running when she rammed straight into shade youre ten minutes late he began but ive never seen you move that fast i was just i had to she trailed off breathless and leaned against him solid dependable safe she could have stayed just like that until the sun rose again what is it he could feel the tension before he drew her away and saw it on her face what happened nothing really disgusted with herself bryan dragged her hair back from her face i just ran into some jerk who wanted to buy me a drink whether i was thirsty or not his fingers tightened on her arms and she winced as they covered the same area that was already tender where it was nothing she said again furious with herself that she hadnt taken the time to regain her composure before she ran into him i went around back to get a look at the trailers alone he shook her once quickly what kind of idiot are you dont you know carnivals arent just cotton candy and colored lights did he hurt you it wasnt concern she heard in his voice but anger her spine straightened no but you are ignoring her shade began to drag her through the crowds toward the parking section if youd stop looking at everything through rosecolored glasses youd see a lot more clearly do you have any idea what mightve happened i can take care of myself i did take care of myself when they reached the van she swung away from him ill look at life any way i like i dont need you to lecture me shade you need something grabbing the keys from her he unlocked the van its brainless to go wandering around alone in the dark in a place like this looking for trouble he muttered as he climbed into the drivers seat you sound remarkably like the idiot i left sprawled on the grass with his hands between his legs he shot her a look later when he was calm he might admire the way shed dealt with an obnoxious drunk but now he couldnt see beyond her carelessness independence aside a woman was vulnerable i shouldve known better than to let you go off alone now just a minute she whirled around in her seat you dont let me do anything colby if youve got it in your head that youre my keeper or anything of the sort then youd better get it right out again i answer to myself only myself for the next few weeks you answer to me as well she tried to control the temper that pushed at her but it wasnt possible i may work with you she said pacing her words i may sleep with you but i dont answer to you not now not ever shade punched in the vans lighter well see about that just remember the contract shaking with fury she turned away again were partners on this job fiftyfifty he gave his opinion of what to do with the contract bryan folded her arms shut her eyes and willed herself to sleep he drove for hours she might sleep but there was too much churning inside him to allow him the same release so he drove east toward the atlantic shed been right when shed said she didnt answer to him that was one of the first rules theyd laid down he was damned sick of rules she was her own woman his strings werent on her any more than hers were on him they were two intelligent independent people who wanted it that way but hed wanted to protect her when everything else was stripped away hed wanted to protect her was she so dense that she couldnt see hed been furious not with her but with himself for not being there when shed needed him shed tossed that back in his face shade thought grimly as he ran a hand over his gritty eyes shed put him very clearly very concisely in his place and his place he reminded himself no matter how intimate theyd become was still at arms length it was best for both of them with his window open he could just smell the tang of the ocean theyd crossed the country theyd crossed more lines than hed bargained for but they were a long way from crossing the final one how did he feel about her hed asked himself that question time after time but hed always managed to block out the answer did he really want to hear it but it was three oclock in the morning that hour he knew well defenses crumbled easily at three oclock in the morning truth had a way of easing its way in he was in love with her it was too late to take a step back and say no thanks he was in love with her in a way that was completely foreign to him unselfishly unlimitedly looking back he could almost pinpoint the moment when it had happened to him though hed called it something else when hed stood on the rock island in the arizona lake hed desired her desired her more intensely than hed desired anything or anyone when hed woken from the nightmare and had found her warm and solid beside him hed needed her again more than anything or anyone but when hed looked across the dusty road on the oklahoma border and seen her standing in front of a sad little house with a plot of pansies hed fallen in love they were a long way from oklahoma now a long way from that moment love had grown overwhelming him he hadnt known how to deal with it then he hadnt a clue what to do about it now he drove toward the ocean where the air was moist when he pulled the van between two lowrising dunes he could just see the water a shadow with sound in the distance watching it listening to it he slept bryan woke when she heard the gulls stiff disoriented she opened her eyes she saw the ocean blue and quiet in the early light that wasnt quite dawn at the horizon the sky was pink and serene misty waking slowly she watched gulls swoop over the shoreline and soar to sea again shade slept in the seat beside her turned slightly in his seat his head resting against the door hed driven for hours she realized but what had driven him she thought of their argument with a kind of weary tolerance quietly she slipped from the van she wanted the scent of the sea had it only been two months since theyd stood on the shore of the pacific was this really so different she wondered as she stepped out of her shoes and felt the sand cool and rough under her feet hed driven through the night to get here she mused to get here one step closer to the end they had only to drive up the coast now winding their way through new england a quick step in new york for pictures and darkroom work then on to cape cod where summer would end for both of them it might be best she thought if they broke there completely driving back together touching off on some of the places theyd discovered as a team might be too much to handle perhaps when the time came shed make some excuse and fly back to la it might be best she reflected to start back to those separate lives when summer ended theyd come full circle through the tension and annoyance of the beginning into the cautious friendship the frenzied passion and right back to the tension again bending bryan picked up a shell small enough to fit into the palm of her hand but whole tension broke things didnt it cracked the whole until pressure crumbled it into pieces then whatever youd had was lost she didnt want that for shade with a sigh she looked out over the ocean where the water was green then blue the mist was rising no she didnt want that for him when they turned from each other they should do so as theyd turned to each other as whole separate people standing independently she kept the shell in her hand as she walked back toward the van the weariness was gone when she saw him standing beside the van watching her with his hair ruffled by the wind his face shadowed eyes heavy her heart turned over the break would come soon enough she told herself for now there should be no pressure smiling she went to him she took his hand and pressed the shell into it you can hear the ocean if you listen for it he said nothing but put his arm around her and held her together they watched the sun rise over the east chapter contents prev next on a street corner in chelsea five enterprising kids loosened the bolts on a fire hydrant and sent water swooshing bryan liked the way they dived through the stream soaking their sneakers plastering their hair it wasnt necessary to think long about her feelings toward the scene as she lifted her camera and focused her one predominant emotion was envy pure and simple not only were they cool and delightfully wet while she was limp from the heat but they hadnt a care in the world they didnt have to worry if their lives were heading in the right direction or any direction at all it was their privilege in these last breathless weeks of summer to enjoy their youth their freedom and a cool splash in city water if she were envious there were others who felt the same way as it happened bryans best shot came from incorporating one passerby in the scene the middleaged delivery man in the sweaty blue shirt and dusty work shoes looked over his shoulder as one of the children lifted his arms up to catch a stream on one face was pleasure pure and giddy on the other was amusement laced with regret for something that couldnt be recaptured bryan walked on down streets packed with badtempered traffic over sidewalks that tossed up heat like insults new york didnt always weather summer with a smile and a wave shade was in the darkroom theyd rented while shed opted to take the field first she was putting it off she admitted as she skirted around a sidewalk salesman and his array of plastic brightlensed sunglasses putting off coping with the last darkroom session shed have before they returned to california after this brief stop in new york theyd head north for the final weekend of summer in cape cod and she and shade had gone back to being almost unbearably careful with each other since that morning when theyd woken at the beach bryan had taken a step back deliberately she admitted shed discovered all too forcibly that he could hurt her perhaps it was true that shed left herself wide open bryan wouldnt deny that somewhere along the way shed lost her determination to maintain a certain distance but it wasnt too late to pull back just enough to keep from getting battered she had to accept that the season was nearly over and when it was her relationship with shade ended with it with this in mind she took a slow meandering route back toward midtown and the rented darkroom shade already had ten rows of proofs sliding a strip under the enlarger he methodically began to select and eliminate as always he was more ruthless more critical with his own work than hed have been with anyone elses he knew bryan would be back shortly so that any printing he did would have to wait until the following day still he wanted to see one now for himself he remembered the little motel room theyd taken that rainy night just outside of louisville he remembered the way hed felt then involved a little reckless that night had been preying on his mind more and more often as he and bryan seemed to put up fences again thered been no boundaries between them that night finding the print he was looking for he brought the magnifier closer she was sitting on the bed her dress falling off her shoulders raindrops clinging to her hair soft passionate hesitant all those things were there in the way she held herself in the way she looked at the camera but her eyes frustrated he narrowed his own what was in her eyes he wanted to enlarge the proof now to blow it up so that he could see and study and understand she was holding back now every day he could feel it sense it just a little bit more distance every day but what had been in her eyes on that rainy night he had to know until he did he couldnt take a step either toward her or away when the knock came on the door he cursed it he wanted another hour with another hour he could have the print and perhaps his answer he found it a simple matter to ignore the knock shade come on time for the next shift come back in an hour an hour on the other side of the door bryan pounded again look im melting out there besides ive already given you twenty minutes more than your share the moment he yanked open the door bryan felt the waves of impatience because she wasnt in the mood to wrestle with it she merely lifted a brow and skirted around him if he wanted to be in a foul mood fine as long as he took it outside with him casually she set down her camera and a paper cup filled with soft drink and ice so howd it go im not finished with a shrug she began to set out the capsules of undeveloped film shed stored in her bag youve tomorrow for that he didnt want to wait until tomorrow not he discovered for another minute if youd give me the rest of the time i want i wouldnt need tomorrow bryan began to run water in a shallow plastic tub sorry shade ive run out of steam outside if i dont get started in here the best ill do is go back to the hotel and sleep the rest of the afternoon then ill be behind whats so important he stuffed his hands in his pockets nothing i just want to finish and ive got to start she murmured absently as she checked the temperature of the water he watched her a moment the competent way she set up arranging bottles of chemicals to her preference little tendrils of her hair curled damply around her face from the humidity even as she set up to work she slipped out of her shoes he felt a wave of love of need of confusion and reached out to touch her shoulder bryan hmm he started to move closer then stopped himself what time will you be finished there were touches of amusement and annoyance in her voice shade will you stop trying to push me out i want to come back for you she stopped long enough to look over her shoulder why because i dont want you walking around outside after its dark for heavens sake exasperated she turned completely around do you have any idea how many times ive been to new york alone do i look stupid no something in the way he said it had her narrowing her eyes look i want to come back for you he repeated and this time touched her cheek humor me she let out a long breath tried to be annoyed and ended by lifting her hand to his eight eightthirty okay we can grab something to eat on the way back theres something we can agree on she smiled and lowered her hand before she could give in to the urge to move closer now go take some pictures will you ive got to get to work he lifted his camera bag and started out any longer than eightthirty and you buy dinner bryan locked the door behind him with a decisive click she didnt lose track of time while she worked time was too essential in the dark she worked briskly in the amber light her movements flowed with the same rhythm as one set of negatives was developed and hung to dry she went on to the next then the next when at length she could switch on the overhead light bryan arched her back stretched her shoulders and relaxed an idle glance around showed her that shed forgotten the carryout drink shed picked up on the way unconcerned she took a long gulp of lukewarm watereddown soda the work satisfied her the precision it required now her thoughts were skipping ahead to the prints only then would the creativity be fully satisfied she had time she noticed as she took a quick glance at her watch to fuss with the negatives a bit before he came back but then shed end up putting herself in the same position shed put him in leaving something half done instead mildly curious she walked over to study his proofs impressive she decided but then shed expected no less she might just be inclined to beg for a blowup of the old man in the baseball cap not shades usual style she mused as she bent over the strip it was so rare that he focused in on one person and let the emotions flow the man whod taken it had once told her he had no compassion bryan shook her head as she skimmed over other proofs did shade believe that or did he simply want the rest of the world to then she saw herself and stopped with a kind of dazed wonder of course she remembered shade setting up that picture amusing then arousing her while he changed angles and fstops the way hed touched her it wasnt something shed forget so it shouldnt surprise her to see the proof yet it did more than surprise her not quite steady bryan picked up a magnifying glass and held it over one tiny square she looked pliant she heard her own nervous swallow as she looked deeper she looked soft it could be her imagination or more likely the skill of the photographer she looked in love slowly bryan set down the glass and straightened the skill of the photographer she repeated fighting to believe it a trick of the angle of the light and shadows what a photographer captured on film wasnt always the truth it was often illusion often that vague blur between truth and illusion a woman knew when she loved thats what bryan told herself a woman knew when shed given her heart it wasnt something that could happen and not be felt she closed her eyes a moment and listened to the quiet was there anything she hadnt felt when it came to shade how much longer was she going to pretend that passion needs longings stood on their own love had bound them together love had cemented them into something solid and strong and undeniable she turned to where her negatives hung there was one shed managed to ignore there was one tiny slice of film shed taken on impulse and then buried because shed come to be afraid of the answer shed find now when she had the answer already bryan stared at it it was reversed so that his hair was light his face dark the little sliver of river in the corner was white like the oars in his hands but she saw him clearly his eyes were too intense though his body seemed relaxed would he ever allow his mind true rest his face was hard lean with the only tangible sensitivity around his mouth he was a man bryan knew whod have little patience with mistakes his own or others he was a man with a rigid sense of what was important and he was a man who was capable of harnessing his own emotions and denying them to another what he gave when he gave would be on his terms she knew and understood and loved regardless shed loved before and love had made more sense then at least it had seemed to still in the end love hadnt been enough what did she know about making love work could she possibly believe that when shed failed once she could succeed with a man like shade she loved now and told herself she was wise enough strong enough to let him go rule number one bryan reminded herself as she put the darkroom in order no complications it was a litany she had running through her head until shade knocked on the door when she opened it for him she nearly believed it theyd reached the last stop the last day summer was not as some would wish it endless perhaps the weather would stay balmy for weeks longer flowers might still bloom defiantly but just as bryan had considered the last day of school summers conception so did she consider the labor day weekend its demise clambakes beach parties bonfires hot beaches and cool water that was cape cod there were volleyball games in the sand and blasting portable radios teenagers perfected the tans theyd show off during those first few weeks of school families took to the water in a last frantic rush before autumn signaled the end backyard barbecues smoked baseball hung on gamely before football could push its way through as if it knew its time was limited summer poured on the heat bryan didnt mind she wanted this last weekend to be everything summer could be hot hazy torrid she wanted her last weekend with shade to reflect it love could be disguised with passion she could let herself flow with it long steamy days led to long steamy nights and bryan held on to them if her lovemaking was a little frantic her desires a little desperate she could blame it on the heat while bryan became more aggressive shade became more gentle hed noticed the change though hed said nothing shade had noticed it the night hed come back to meet her at the darkroom perhaps because she rarely had nerves bryan thought she hid them well shade could almost see them jump every time he looked at her bryan had made a decision in the darkroom a decision she felt would be best for both herself and for shade shade had made a decision in the darkroom as well the day after when hed watched the print of bryan slowly come to life on the ride west to east theyd become lovers now he had to find a way on the ride east to court her as a man does the woman he wants to spend his life with gentleness came first though he wasnt an expert at it pressure if it came to that could be applied later he was more experienced there what a day after long hours walking watching and shooting bryan dropped down on the back of the van where the doors were open wide to let in the breeze i cant believe how many halfnaked people ive seen grinning at shade she arched her back she wore nothing but her sleek red bathing suit and a loose white coverup that drooped over one shoulder you seem to fit right in lazily she lifted one leg and examined it well its nice to know that this assignment hasnt ruined my tan yawning she stretched weve got a couple more hours of sun why dont you put on something indecent and walk down to the beach with me she rose lifting her arms so they could wind easily around his neck we could cool off in the water she touched her lips to his teasing taunting then we could come back and heat up again i like the second part he turned the kiss into something staggering with an increase of pressure and change of angle beneath his hands he felt her sigh why dont you go ahead down do the cooling off ive got some things to do with her head resting against his shoulder bryan struggled not to ask again she wanted him to go with her be with her every second they had left tomorrow shed have to tell him that shed made arrangements to fly back to the coast this was their last night but only she knew it all right she managed to smile as she drew away i cant resist the beach when were camped so close ill be back in a couple hours have fun he gave her a quick absent kiss and didnt watch as she walked away if he had he mightve seen her hesitate and start back once only to turn around again and walk on the air had cooled by the time bryan started back to the van it chilled her skin a sure sign that summer was on its last legs bonfires were set and ready to light down on the beach in the distance bryan heard a few hesitant amateur guitar chords it wouldnt be a quiet night she decided as she passed two other campsites on the way to the van she paused a moment to look toward the water tossing her hair back it was loose from its braid and slightly damp from her dip in the atlantic idly she considered grabbing her shampoo out of the van and taking a quick trip to the showers she could do that before she threw together a cold sandwich in an hour or two when the bonfires were going steadily and the music was at its peak she and shade would go back down and work for the last time she thought as she reached for the door of the van at first she stood blinking confused by the low flickering light candles she saw baffled candles and white linen there on the little collapsible table they sometimes set between the bunks was a fresh snowy cloth and two red tapers in glass holders there were red linen napkins folded at angles a rosebud stood in a narrow clear glass vase on the little radio in the back was low soft music at the narrow makeshift counter was shade legs spread as he added a sprinkling of alfalfa to a salad have a nice swim he said casually as if shed climbed into the van every evening to just such a scene yeah i shade where did you get all this took a quick trip into town hope you like your shrimp spicy i made it to my taste she could smell it over the scent of candle wax under the fragrance of the single rose was the rich ripe aroma of spiced shrimp with a laugh bryan moved to the table and ran a finger down one of the tapers how did you manage all this ive been called adept occasionally she looked up from the candle to him her face was lovely clean lined in the soft light her eyes were dark mysterious but above all he saw her lips curve hesitantly as she reached out for him you did this for me he touched her lightly just a hand to her hair both of them felt something shimmer i intend to eat too i dont know what to say she felt her eyes fill and didnt bother to blink the tears back i really dont he lifted her hand and with a simplicity hed never shown kissed her fingers one by one try thanks she swallowed and whispered thanks hungry always but in a gesture that always moved him she lifted her hands to his face some things are more important bryan brought her lips to his it was a taste he could drown in a taste he could now admit he wanted to drown in moving slowly gently he brought her into his arms their bodies fit bryan knew it was so and ached from the knowledge even their breathing seemed to merge until she was certain their hearts beat at precisely the same rhythm he ran his hands under her shirt along her back where the skin was still damp from the sea touch me she drew him closer as if her body could shout the words to him savor me her mouth was suddenly avid hot and open as if with lips alone she could draw what she needed from him love me her hands moved over him as if she could touch the emotion she wanted touch it hold it keep it if only for one night he could smell the sea on her and the summer and the evening he could feel the passion as her body pressed against his needs demands desires they could be tasted as his mouth drew from hers but tonight he found he needed to hear the words too soon his mind warned as he began to lose himself it was too soon to ask too soon to tell shed need time he thought time and more finesse than he was accustomed to employing but even when he drew her away he wasnt able to let go looking down at her he saw his own beginning whatever hed seen and done in the past whatever memories he had were unimportant there was only one vital thing in his life and he held it in his arms i want to make love with you her breath was already unsteady her body trembling yes his hands tightened on her as he tried to be logical rooms at a premium this time she smiled and drew him closer we have the floor she pulled him down with her later when her mind was clearer and her blood cooler bryan would remember only the tumult of feeling only the flood of sensation she wouldnt be able to separate the dizzying feel of his mouth on her skin from the heady taste of his under hers shed know that his passion had never been more intense more relentless but she wouldnt be able to say how shed known had it been the frantic way hed said her name had it been the desperate way hed pulled the snug suit down her body exploiting ravishing as he went she understood her own feelings had reached an apex she could never express with words words were inadequate she could only show him love regrets desires wishes had all culminated to whirl inside her until shed clung to him and when theyd given each other all they could she clung still holding the moment to her as she might a photograph faded after years of looking as she lay against him her head on his chest she smiled they had given each other all they could what more could anyone ask with her eyes still closed she pressed her lips against his chest nothing would spoil the night tonight theyd have candlelight and laughter shed never forget it i hope you bought plenty of shrimp she murmured im starving i bought enough to feed an average person and a greedy one grinning she sat up good with a rare show of energy she struggled back into the bulky coverup and sprang up bending over the pot of shrimp she breathed deep wonderful i didnt know you were so talented i decided it was time i let you in on some of my more admirable qualities with a half smile she looked back to see him slipping on his shorts oh yeah after all weve got to travel a long way together yet he sent her a quiet enigmatic look a long way i dont she stopped herself and turned to toy with the salad this looks good she began too brightly bryan he stopped her before she could reach in the cupboard above for bowls what is it nothing did he always have to see she demanded couldnt she hide anything from him he stepped over took her arms and held her face to face what lets talk about it tomorrow all right the brightness was still there straining im really hungry the shrimps cool by now so now with a quick shake he reminded both of them that his patience only stretched so far ive decided to fly back she blurted out i can get a flight out tomorrow afternoon he went very still but she was too busy working out her explanation to notice just how dangerously still why ive had to reschedule like crazy to fit in this assignment the extra time id get would ease things it sounded weak it was weak why she opened her mouth prepared to give him a variation on the same theme one look from him stopped her i just want to get back she managed i know youd like company on the drive but the assignments finished odds are youll make better time without me he fought back the anger anger wasnt the way if hed given in to it hed have shouted raged threatened that wasnt the way no he said simply and left it at that no youre not flying back tomorrow his voice was calm but his eyes said a great deal more we go together bryan she braced herself an argument she decided would be easy now look sit down haughtiness came to her rarely but when it did it was exceptional i beg your pardon for an answer shade gave her a quick shove onto the bench without speaking he pulled open a drawer and took out the manila envelope that held his most recently developed prints tossing them onto the table he pulled out the one of bryan what do you see he demanded myself she cleared her throat i see myself of course not good enough thats what i see she tossed back but she didnt look down at the print again thats all there is perhaps fear played a part in his actions he didnt want to admit it but it was fear fear that hed imagined something that wasnt there you see yourself yes a beautiful woman a desirable woman a woman he continued slowly looking at the man she loves hed stripped her bryan felt it as though hed actually peeled off layer after layer of pretense defense disguise shed seen the same thing in the image hed frozen on film shed seen it but what gave him the right to strip her you take too much she said in a quiet voice rising she turned away from him too damned much relief poured through him he had to close his eyes on it for a moment not imagination not illusion but truth love was there and with it his beginning youve already given it no bryan turned back holding on to what she had left i havent given it what i feel is my responsibility i havent asked you for anything and i wont she took a deep breath we agreed shade no complications then it looks like we both reneged doesnt it he grabbed her hand before she could move out of reach look at me his face was close candlelight flickering over it somehow the soft light illuminated what hed seen what hed lived through what hed overcome dont you see anything when you look at me can you see more in a stranger on the beach a woman in a crowd a kid on a street corner than you do when you look at me dont she began only to be cut off what do you see i see a man she said speaking quickly passionately a man whos had to see more than he should i see a man whos learned to keep his feelings carefully controlled because he isnt quite sure what would happen if he let loose i see a cynic who hasnt been able to completely stamp out his own sensitivity his own empathy true enough he returned evenly though it was both more and less than hed wanted to hear what else nothing she told him close to panic nothing it wasnt enough the frustration came through she could feel it in his hands wheres your perception now wheres the insight that takes you under the glitter of some temperamental leading man to the core i want you to see into me bryan i cant the words came out on a shudder im afraid to afraid hed never considered it she took emotions in stride sought them dug for them he loosened his grip on her and said the words that were the most difficult for him to speak i love you she felt the words slam into her knocking her breathless if he said them he meant them of that she could be sure had she been so caught up in her own feelings that she hadnt seen his it was tempting it would be easy to simply go into his arms and take the risk but she remembered that theyd both risked before and failed shade she tried to think calmly but his words of love still rang in her head i dont you cant i want to hear you say it he held her close again there was no place to go i want you to look at me knowing everything youve said about me is true and tell me it couldnt work she began quickly because her knees were shaking it couldnt dont you see id want it all because im just idiot enough to think maybe this time with you marriage children thats not what you want and i understand i didnt think i wanted them either until everything got so out of control he was calmer now as she became more frazzled you havent told me yet all right she nearly shouted it all right then i love you but i he closed his mouth over hers so there could be no excuses for now he could simply drink in the words and all they meant to him salvation he could believe in it youve a hell of a nerve he said against her mouth telling me what i want shade please giving in to the weakness she dropped her head on his shoulder i didnt want to complicate things i dont want to now if i fly back itll give us both time to put things back in perspective my work your work are important he finished but not as important as this he waited until her eyes slowly lifted to his now his voice was calm again his grip eased still holding her but without the desperation nothing is bryan you didnt want it maybe i thought i didnt but i know better now everything started with you everything important you make me clean he ran a hand through her hair god you make me hope again believe again do you think im going to let you take all that away from me the doubts began to fade quietly slowly second chances hadnt she always believed in them long shots she remembered you only had to want to win badly enough no she murmured but i need a promise i need the promise shade and then i think we could do anything so did he i promise to love you to respect you to care for you whether you like it or not and i promise that what i am is yours reaching up he flipped open the cupboard door speechless bryan watched him draw out a tiny cardboard pot of pansies their scent was light and sweet and lasting plant them with me bryan her hands closed over his hadnt she always believed life was as simple as you made it as soon as were home epilogue contents prev cooperate will you no amused but not altogether pleased shade watched bryan adjust the umbrellas beside and behind him it seemed to him shed been fiddling with the lighting a great deal longer than necessary you said i could have anything i wanted for christmas she reminded him as she held the light meter up to his face i want this picture it was a weak moment he mumbled tough unsympathetic bryan stepped back to study the angles there the lighting was perfect the shadows just where they should be but a longsuffering sigh came out shade stop glowering will you i said you could take the picture i didnt say itd be pretty no chance of that she said under her breath exasperated she brushed at her hair and the thin gold band on her left hand caught the light shade watched it glimmer with the same sort of odd pleasure he always felt when it hit him that they were a team in every way with a grin he joined his left hand with hers so that the twin rings they wore touched lightly sure you want this picture for christmas id thought of buying you ten pounds of french chocolate she narrowed her eyes but her fingers laced with his a low blow colby dead low refusing to be distracted she backed off ill have my picture she told him and if you want to be nasty ill buy my own chocolate some husbands she continued as she walked back to the camera set on a tripod would cater to their wifes every whim when shes in my delicate condition he glanced down at the flat stomach under baggy overalls it still dazed him that there was life growing there their life when summer came again theyd hold their first child it wouldnt do to let her know he had to fight the urge to pamper her to coddle her every moment instead shade shrugged and dipped his hands in his pockets not this one he said lightly you knew what you were getting when you married me she looked at him through the viewfinder his hands were in his pockets but he wasnt relaxed as always his body was ready to move his mind moving already but in his eyes she saw the pleasure the kindness and the love together they were making it work he didnt smile but bryan did as she clicked the shutter so i did she murmured
