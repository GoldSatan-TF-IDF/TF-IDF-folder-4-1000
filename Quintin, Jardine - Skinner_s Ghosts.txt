follow was inspired by my wife catherine campbell irene jardine kate my lovely kate the woman walked at a steady unhurried pace down the middle of the village road she was wearing the wig and gown of one of her majestys counsel a formal enveloping uniform which served to emphasise rather than mask her advanced years she was small and birdlike in her features with a few grey whiskers sprouting among her wrinkles clearly she was very old yet for all that she walked straightbacked and steadily in front of the hearse and its burden as she led it down the main street down the short distance from the great grey castellated house toaberladys churchyard and to the grave which awaited as she approached in the doorway of the church a lone piper played a lament who is she asked pamela masters beside her at the wheel of the white bmw as they sat at the head of the queue of waiting traffic deputy chief constable bob skinner smiled dont you know sergeant he paused but then i dont suppose you would its been a long time since even ive seen her in action she is christabel innes dawson qc in her heyday the only woman silk in scotland and one of the very finest too and whos whos in the chest that is lord orlach senator of the college of justice and lord justice clerk for what seemed like about a hundred years old orlach was the last of the supreme court judges not to be subject to compulsory retirement he finally did step down though last year and christabels his widow skinner drew in his breath and shook his head christ no orlachs wife died donkeys years ago but he and she never married he had his town house in heriot row and latterly his country seat out here while she had her establishment in india street with the brass plate on the door saying miss dawson advocate they had a relationship though that lasted fifty years until the old boy died last week when he was plain john stevenson kc kc pamela interrupted aye kings counsel it was that far back and she was a junior admitted to the faculty of advocates almost over the dead body of the dean of the time he took her on to assist him in a capital murder trial their affair began back then he glanced across at the pretty darkhaired woman in the passenger seat it was never admitted or discussed though he smiled at a memory they really did think they were being discreet too theres a story about orlach that once in the new club an outer house judge asked him how christabel was as innocently as that orlach froze him with a look and afterwards every time one of that judges decisions came before him on appeal the old boy would reverse it why didnt they marry she asked him skinner laughed again softly well at first mrs stevenson wouldnt have approved then by the time of her death orlach was on the bench it was never said of course but the feeling was that if they had got hitched christabel would have had to leave the bar the rules were such that you could never have been sure that she wouldnt have wound up pleading a case before her husband and that wouldnt have done at all he smiled at the blackgowned figure as she drew nearer then suddenly and spontaneously stepped out of the car and stood beside it as she turned to lead the hearse into the churchyard christabel innes dawson qc glanced sideways and gave him the briefest nod of recognition of course he said as he folded himself back into the drivers seat the fact that they didnt marry meant that she could and did appear before him without restraint he laughed again out loud this time i remember she crossexamined me once in a criminal trial with orlach as presiding judge andy martin too he was raw at the time and she knew it at the end she was screaming at him like a banshee and old orlach let her get on with it did she try it on with you too pamela asked no fortunately she had a degree of respect for di rank and above but detective constables and sergeants she chewed em up and spat out the bits he looked at her mischievously she still appears you know a few times a year shell take on the defence in a high court trial more often than not she gets an acquittal maybe we can fix it for you to be a police witness in one of them she snorted and flounced her dark hair no thank you as the hearse passed through the churchyard gates the uniformed police officer who had stopped the traffic turned to skinner saluted and waved him on the dcc nodded an acknowledgement and slipped the car into gear he glanced to his left as he passed the church as the old lady moved to join the congregation inside all these years maintaining their discreet front he murmured yet when the time comes she leads him to the grave theres a nobility about that though pam is there not she looked at him as the bmw snaked though the chicane exit from aberlady heading for gullane maybe there is what i can see though is a situation thats a bit close to home im as big a secret as old christabel there or so you think what dyou mean so i think i havent told anyone not even andy so who would know ruth mcconnell your secretary for a start dyou think she hasnt guessed dci rose for another god her eyebrows went up when you made me your exec six months ago skinner shrugged his shoulders but i replaced you with neil mcllhenney after two months sure and dcs martin was delighted to have me added to his personal staff wasnt he she said ironically he raised his eyebrows he never said a word to me i told him that we had agreed youd be better working for him and he accepted that at face value she twisted in her seat to look at him okay so tell me why when she called into the office two days ago to see mr martin your daughter his fiancee froze me like a block of ice with a single look not i suggest because she thinks i fancy andy skinner frowned at her you dont think ruths been talking do you he sounded genuinely shocked of course not she said at once dcs martins figured it out and told alex hed do that wouldnt he her companion sighed well they live together so i guess so those two have no secrets from each other but hold on even if andy and alex have guessed they wouldnt let on to anyone else mmm said pamela demurely but are you as confident of sergeant boyd from the haddington nick who stopped the traffic back there in aberlady and recognised both you and me in casual clothes heading towards gullane where you have a cottage and on a friday afternoon to boot even a plonker like him will have put two and two together from that jesus hes probably been on the radio to hq already he nodded touche youve got me there he fell silent as he swung the car round a long lefthanded bend and drove them past the small stone cairn marking the entrance to luffness golf club settling deep into brooding thought until long after he had closed the door of the cottage behind them finally as they sat on wooden chairs in the secluded garden enjoying the warm summer sun he turned to her so he said with the beginning of a frown are you giving me the message pam love do you want me to put us on an official footing or do you just want out she shook her head no out is certainly not what i want unless youve decided you want your wife back if thats the case then im off like a shot to tell you the truth when you went off to the states in may for your wee boys first birthday i was more than half expecting you to bring them back with you bob frowned more heavily and fell silent once more to be as honest with you he said at last i thought that might have happened too despite what you and i have together coming home and leaving the wee fella behind was one of the toughest things ive ever had to do but theres a wall between sarah and me that we couldnt break down i guess shes gone native again gone back to being an american somehow she isnt the woman i met and married pamela laughed suddenly and with a trace of mockery nonsense she said of course she is its just that youve never seen her in her native environment before also for the first time in your lives youre seeing her take up a position which isnt exactly in support of yours you can add to that the fact that shes probably never seen you on the defensive before well okay he said wearily so weve both seen each other in a new light and neither of us could handle it whatever the case i wont get back together with her just for the babys sake that wouldnt be right for any of us anyway shes made it clear where she wants to be remember what she said in her goodbye note about not wanting to be stuck in edinburgh for the rest of her life she has a hospital job in the states now and shes doing sceneofcrime work for the local police is she seeing anyone do you think she asked softly the question took him by surprise so much that he was unable to keep the hurt from showing in his eyes possibly he said quietly im not sure but i think she could be but you didnt tell her about us no like i said i didnt i thought it was maybe too soon for that you mean you thought youd keep your options open no i didnt want to kick her in the teeth thats all he drew a deep breath or maybe i was just chicken she raised an eyebrow a gesture denoting scepticism chicken the great bob skinner was chicken he shrugged his shoulders we all run from something he said quietly come on what are you saying to me pamela like i asked you before is all this too heavy for you do you want us to chuck it she pushed herself out of her chair knelt on the concrete paving at his feet and laid her head in his lap for a few seconds rubbing her face from side to side against his thighs finally she looked up at him still shaking her head no i dont want that although god knows i should youre the dcc im a sergeant youre married even if you are legally separated madness sheer madness but no what i am saying is that you and i dont have the option of being like old christabel and lord so and so we cant keep that sort of secret he frowned at her again knitting his brows heavily accentuating the deep vertical line above the bridge of his nose and the scar which ran alongside it why not i always tell my troops that their private lives are their own as long as its consistent with duty and discipline were not working together any more so why are we different she squeezed his thighs hard because we are man look are you or are you not the secretary of states security adviser were you or were you not a candidate for the top job in the met until sir derrick raymond agreed to do another two years do you or do you not want chief constable rank somewhere three yess dont you tell me differently bob youve got that ambition and that potential and here you are sleeping with a detective sergeant under your command not in the office i aint he said doggedly he almost added besides maybe i care more about you than about all that stuff but something held him back she shrugged her shoulders fine so why havent you told your daughter about me or andy martin or the chief or am i wrong have you briefed the command corridor off the record he threw up his hands okay okay okay well she sighed and paused look im not asking for a public declaration of undying love i like it the way it is as long as youre completely and genuinely separated from sarah i love being with you you excite me more than anyone ive ever known but your companionship and great sex of course for now thats enough for me as long as it doesnt do you harm and as long as it doesnt compromise your future career so think about it eh skinner sighed okay sweetheart i know youre right and ill do something about it ill tell the chief andy andalex probably in reverse order but in my own time he pointed a finger at her suddenly and mind i wont be seeking their advice or approval what if andy martin wants me off his staff once youve told him she asked him ill deal with that if it happensabruptly he stood up gathering her in his arms meantime what was that you were saying about great sex the telephone rang four times before the automatic answering machine picked up the call as she heard bobs recorded voice giving the response pamela sat up in bed a sheen of perspiration glistening lightly on her back a few seconds later the caller left the invited message neither she nor bob could hear what was said but both recognised the inflections of detective chief superintendent andy martins even steady baritone she nodded in the direction of the bedside telephone go on pick it up she urged him he grinned at her tugging at her arm to draw her back down beside him later chances are its work if it is im not letting it in here she pulled herself free from his light grasp shaking her head no its as if hes in the house with us if you dont answer it i will as the muffled voice continued to float through to them from the living room she twisted and threw herself across the recumbent skinner reaching out with her left hand she was smiling but he took her threat seriously enough to grab her and pull her neat little body back down towards him holding her away from the phone all right he said but you keep quiet ive said ill tell him but in my own time he reached behind him with his free hand and picked up the telephone ill try the mobile he heard andy martin say but if you get this first call me andy sorry mate i was in the garden what can i do for you did you get any of that involuntarily skinner shook his head no not a bit of it the coiledspring tension in martins voice grasped him at once releasing pam from his grasp he swung his legs from beneath the duvet and sat on the edge of the bed whats up he growled bob youre going to hate this im at leona mcgraths place down in trinity there was a pause leonas dead shes been raped battered and strangled jesus skinner shuddered so suddenly and violently that to pamela the bed seemed to shake he ran his fingers through his tousled steelgrey hair grasping a clump as he fought to control his shock behind him the mattress squeaked as pam sat up once more he waved her to silence over his shoulder when he asked hoarsely she was found about an hour ago shed been due to attend a constituency event when she didnt turn up the local party chairwoman called round to ask why there was no reply to the bell but the back door had been forced the woman had a look around and found mrs mcgrath upstairs skinner sat stunned as she looked at him wondering and fearful pamela saw that the battle scars on his back and thigh were standing out vivid purple and realised that he had gone pale she gripped his arm again squeezing and her son the dcc asked at last wee mark what about him theres noone else here bob neil mcllhenney sammy pye and i have been over the place ourselves weve been everywhere theres no sign of the kid mark said skinner sharply his name is mark he squeezed his eyes tight shut partly to stem the hot tears which he felt springing up and partly to try to stop himself shaking with tension after what that womans endured and done he murmured when he had calmed himself for it to end like this he stood up still holding the phone and turned to face pam his back to the muslindraped window you say neil and sammy are there thats right sammy was with me when the call came in and i thought youd want the big fella here i tried to raise sergeant masters but shes on day off skinner searched for an undertone in his friends remark but found none forget pam he said she doesnt need to be there ill be with you in edinburgh inside an hour meantime i suggest you contact the grandparents marks very close to rolands father lets pray that hes with him he replaced the phone in its cradle and looked down at pamela what she began before skinner forestalled her question a very good friend he said leona mcgrath the mp for edinburgh dean you must remember her her husband was killed in the plane crash last year she fought the seat and won it pam nodded well now its her time to die shes been murdered he stood there before her naked and heaved a huge sigh oh my girl she said when you live with me you find that some terrible things force their way into your life even in the quietest moments youre never safe from them think you can cope with it he reached for his clothes and began to dress the house was so familiar to him he walked past the uniformed officers who stood guard at the head of the driveway his sandals crunching their way up the narrow gravel path which led from the gate the front door was open he stepped into the hall pulling on a white sceneofcrime tunic and overshoes before venturing further properly clad now and knowing exactly where he was going he strode into the drawing room then through to the wooden conservatory around him specialist technicians were bent over their work dusting down doors windows and furniture for fingerprints in the hope that one even a fragment of one would have been left by the intruder rather than by leona or her son skinner nodded approval of the teams tenacity even though experience told him that the chances of their work being rewarded were around one in five as he stepped back into the hall he collided with another white suited figure three or four inches shorter in height than his own six foot two but distinctive with his shock of red hair hello inspector he said grimly hows it going all the mess is upstairs sir it looks clean as a whistle down here said arthur dorward confirming skinners pessimism the back doors been jemmied but other than that nothings disturbed mrs mcgraths in the front bedroom top of the stairs thats where youll find mr martin the dcc nodded come with me then ill welcome your insight me still here is he inspector dorward nodded aye sir dr banks as usual he paused hes not a patch on his predecessor if you dont mind my saying so he did mind very much but he let it pass there was no point in taking his bitterness out on an honest soldier like the sceneofcrime inspector especially when he knew that he was speaking no more than the truth dr sarah grace skinner was the best murderscene examiner he had ever encountered gifted with an uncanny ability to paint compelling pictures of events from the very slightest of clues as he and dorward climbed the stair a huge pang of regret shot through him detective chief superintendent andy martin head of cid was standing in the doorway of the bedroom as they reached the upper landing leaning against its upright his broad back to them in its white suit skinner stepped up behind him and placed a hand on his shoulder drawing him out into the hall hi son he said quietly is banks nearly finished martin nodded you know him hes taken forever but hes just about done now mmm said the dcc i suppose id better take a look then he made a conscious effort to brace himself as he stepped into the room skinner believed deeply that every good police officer had a tolerance limit when it came to viewing the bodies of murder victims he knew that he had passed his own a long time before one of the benefits of chief officer rank was the ability to delegate to opt out personally from the messy end where once he would have attended automatically yet some circumstances like the murder of a public figure and this the murder of a woman who had come to be a very close friend still demanded his presence and of course once there on view himself he could show no weakness he thought that he had prepared himself mentally for what he would see but a moan still escaped his lips as he looked at the body of leona mcgrath oh no said bob skinner out loud for all to hear you poor wee lass what bastard did that to you and then the rage cold blind savage rage took over when i lay hands on you whoever you may be he hissed i think we all feel like that sir said martin his green eyes narrowed slightly and his shoulders bunched skinner knelt beside the body the little woman she had been not much over five feet tall lay on her back her arms were twisted under her and the policeman knew without looking that the wrists were bound together she was naked save for a brassiere still fastened but forced up above her breasts she was covered in blood from her vagina it was matted in her thick growth of pubic hair and smeared across her thighs and belly from her nose and mouth it was spread across her face shoulders and chest staining the white bra from her left ear ran a single crimson line before her heart had stopped pumping it had flowed into a puddle congealed now on the fawncoloured carpet great vivid bruises and welts showed all over her pallid yellowish skin the most vivid were on her face and on her side just below her left breast as if a fist had pounded on her time and time again her face was swollen grotesquely from the beating and from the white garments panties he guessed possibly more than one pair which had been stuffed into her mouth a single black nylon stocking had been wound around her neck more than once as a strangling ligature then tied off ferociously tight the flesh around it was blue and puffed finally when he could avoid them no longer skinner looked at her eyes they were bulging staring up at him and so full of anger and remonstration that he winced and looked away for a second before closing them almost reverently with his right hand gently he turned her on to her side her wrists were indeed bound with the electric cord of a black hairdryer just above the blood which was caked on her buttocks there were vivid red marks where its plug had been crushed into her flesh he leaned closer to look at her hands her fingernails were long and appeared to be painted with a hard clear varnish on the tips of three on her right hand he could see what appeared to be blood he glanced up at martin andy he said untie her hands while i hold her would you without a word the grimfaced head ofcid did as he was asked plastic bags on the hands please doctor said skinner to the medical examiner who stood a few feet away theres blood on her nails and it might not be hers he rolled the body over and laid her face down partly to help banks cover her fingers and partly to hide her poor battered features from the others in the room almost without thinking he unfastened the bra the doctor set the clear plastic covers in place over the dead fingers securing them with elastic bands snapped into place around the weals left in the wrists by the binding cable he stood up beside the dcc well asked skinner whoever did this wasnt messing about said banks she was raped and sodomised pretty savagely thumped around a bit then strangled dont worry about fingernail scrapings he said dismissively youll find all the dna you need in other places astonishingly he smiled at the detectives from one to the other the press have a field day with this i expect ill be all over the telly when i come to give evidence at the trial skinner felt himself come to boiling point but it was the normally unflappable andy martin who exploded first are you enjoying this banks he shouted the dcc stared at him in surprise unable to remember ever having heard his friend raise his voice in anger you know something you little shit barked the head of cid ive never liked you nor has anyone else on our team you turn up late at crime scenes then you give us halfarsed reports which dont usually help us one bit but the worst thing about you is your total lack of respect we knew that lady lying there mr skinner and i this is a personal tragedy for us she was worth a dozen of you and in death she will be treated with honour not as a vehicle to advance your personal reputation he stepped close to the doctor and prodded him in the chest with his broad right index finger you can bet on this banks you will not be called as a witness in the trial of leonas killer the pathologists evidence will be enough and you can bet on this also youre at your last crime scene in this city and with this force first thing tomorrow i will see to it personally that your name is removed from our list of medical examiners now i think youd better leave before you make me lose my temper doctor banks face went from white to red in a couple of seconds you cant do that he spluttered skinner leaned forward took him by the arm and led him towards the door past an astonished inspector dorward too fucking right he can mate he said too fucking right he eased the doctor out on to the landing send the mortuary people up as you leave he ordered and closed the door in his face his mouth was set tight and grim as he turned back to martin good for you son he said softly couldnt have done better myself he glanced across at the redhaired inspector right arthur lets have your observations a sudden thought struck him no before that where are mcllhenney and pye i sent them off to see the grandparents said martin to check whether marks with them skinner nodded good you could hardly have telephoned right enough okay arthur sorry carry on dorward coughed clearing his throat as he did so the door opened and two darkuniformed mortuary workers a man and a woman entered carrying a brown plastic coffin the three policemen stood aside as the bloody naked body of leona mcgrath was lifted and placed gently in its makeshift container skinner turned away and looked out of the bedroom window into the street lit by the summer evening sun which shone on a small crowd of around a dozen onlookers and on a larger number of reporters photographers and television cameramen their number had doubled since his arrival he guessed that the tipoff industry had done its stuff once again as he watched them he saw a camera raised and trained upon him quickly he reached across and pulled the curtains closed when he turned back the coffin was gone arthur he said at last yes sir said dorward he paused for a few seconds then went on the only relevant comment i have to make is that mrs mcgrath must have been surprised in this room look over there he pointed to a wardrobe door which lay open and there he pointed to a dressingtable drawer from which items of underwear hung and there he pointed to a chair across which denim jeans and a white blouse had been laid neatly there are no signs of a struggle downstairs said dorward and precious few in here no torn clothes nothing like that if you look in the en suite bathroom youll find a damp towel id guess that mrs mcgrath was getting ready to go out when she was attacked her assailant burst in on her and found her virtually naked maybe rape wasnt on his mind till then or their minds martin interrupted thats true sir dorward agreed but semen testing will tell us whether there was more than one rapist so what was on the killers mind singular or plural asked skinner robbery dorward shrugged it doesnt look like it boss theres a handbag downstairs in plain view on the kitchen table so that the intruder must have walked past it theres about a hundred and fifty quid in there in cash theres an antique clock on the mantelpiece in the living room thats worth a couple of grand there was a diamond engagement ring still on her finger and more jewellery on the dressing table theres a briefcase in her study but no papers seem to have been disturbed no sir not robbery thats pretty certain then what skinner barked the question not at dorward but at the ceiling feeling an uncomfortable nagging knot forming in the pit of his stomach as one possible answer grew larger in his mind he glanced across at martin who was it found her her constituency chair a woman called marks she was just babbling nonsense when i got here banks gave her a sedative and i had her taken home with luck well get sense out of her tomorrow lets hope so weve got people interviewing neighbours yes yes clan pringles people are doing that skinner nodded approval detective superintendent clan pringle was divisional head of cid for the greater part of the city of edinburgh with him in charge there would be no chance of sloppiness where will you base the investigation the dcs shrugged headquarters i thought rather than the divisional office weve got everything we need at fettes plus we have more room to handle the press with the political involvement this will be no ordinary murder enquiry i cant argue with that said skinner when are you going to see the press ive told alan royston to set up a briefing for seven thirty do you want to take it the older man shook his head no youre head of cid thats your job theyll expect you said martin doubtfully well theyre not fucking having me and thats an end of it you take the first press conference then leave the later briefings to royston thats what hes paid for okaythe dcs paused here he asked casually dyou know if roystons still involved with pam masters i know he was for a while did she mention anything when she worked for you inwardly skinner gulped he stared at martin looking for anything devious in his eyes yet seeing nothing that finished a long time ago he said at last what made you bring that up martin smiled plain oldfashioned curiosity thats all ive never known an officer who keeps her private life as private as she does so much for pam s notions about alex and andys shared conclusion he thought he might have told his friend the truth there and then had not neil mcllhenneys shout drifted up from the hallway sir you still up there yes skinner called out in reply suddenly relieved by the interruption were on our way down though leaving dorward to carry on his painstaking work in the bedroom the two senior officers descended the staircase detective sergeant mcllhenney skinners personal assistant stood waiting in the hall with detective constable sammy pye one of martins staff officers the two flanked a tall man in his seventies silver hair pale and shaking hello mr mcgrath said the dcc advancing on him with hand outstretched the two had met for the first time at the scene of the death of the old mans son on that occasion he had been dignified and purposeful skinner guessed that this would prove one bereavement too many harold mcgrath seemed overwhelmed gently the tall policeman slid an arm around his shoulders and led him into the living room neil he said quietly over his shoulder whisky over there on the sideboard as the heavily built sergeant picked up decanter and glass the dead womans fatherinlaw lowered himself carefully into an armchair sergeant mcllhenney has obviously told you what happened said skinner glancing across at his assistant as he spoke and noticing for the first time the strain in his normally jolly eyes yes the old man whispered theres nothing i can say to lessen the shock or the horror of it said the detective we all knew your daughterinlaw we admired her tremendously were stunned too but believe me we will catch whoever did this and we will put him away for the rest of his miserable life it was a man then asked old mcgrath bewildered seeming to age before their very eyes skinner guessed that mcllhenney had spared much of the detail beyond a doubt he replied gently wheres my grandson said the old man suddenly urgently a sudden desperation hit the dcc the earlier pang of concern gripping him now with a fierce certainty hes not with you then the silver head shook no leona said she would bring him over before she went to her constituency meeting when she didnt turn up my wife and i assumed that she had taken him with her after all she did sometimes like a sort of mascot so where is he thats just the thing mr mcgrath we dont know the old man looked up at him his mouth slightly open look said skinner does he have any pals around here could leona have taken him somewhere else before she was attacked no said the grandfather i dont think so all marks friends are away on holiday just now we were supposed to be going too on sunday now that the house of commons has risen youre sure theres noone still at home no pal where he could have gone quite sure leona remarked on the fact just last night on the telephone how about leonas parents asked martin are they still alive mr mcgrath looked round at him over his shoulder clutching the whisky which mcllhenney had pressed into his shaking hand her mother is her names mrs baillie mary baillie she lives in broughty ferry but shes on holiday as well in greece with a friend they left last sunday from glasgow airport skinner turned to his assistant neil he said fast as you can get on to the tour operators and trace mrs baillie this is going to break very fast through satellite television i dont want the poor woman to hear of her daughters death from a sky newscaster andy he said quickly to martin youd better postpone your briefing till weve contacted the mother meantime wed better mobilise every available officer cid and uniformed i want an inch byinch search of the surrounding area if mark escaped from the house he could be hiding out somewhere whatever if hes anywhere around here weve got to find him he stabbed the air with a finger every available officer remember whether theyre off duty or not ill even call the chief and acc elder you turn out all your team he paused then added as a seeming afterthought try and raise pam masters again you never know she might be home by now at this moment said andy martin surveying a hushed gathering of reporters and cameramen in the main briefing room of the police headquarters building in fettes avenue every available police officer in the city of edinburgh is involved in an intensive search of an area within a threemile radius of mrs mcgraths home that amounts to over a thousand officers including chief constable sir james proud deputy chief constable bob skinner and assistant chief constable jim elder were searching public parks railway embankments unoccupied houses and other properties everywhere are you asking for volunteers to help widen the search area chief superintendent the question came from a reporter in the front row of the audience representing the citys cable television channel no he told the woman because we have to keep things under control but you and all the other broadcast media can help us by asking your viewing and listening audiences to search their own premises right away just in case a very frightened wee boy might be hiding there what can you tell us about mark andy asked john hunter a freelance and the senior member of the scottish capitals media corps well for a start you can all collect his photograph on the way out although i suspect that most of you will have him on file from the time of his fathers funeral he paused mark is six years old and beyond doubt hes the most remarkable wee boy i have ever met as you all know undoubtedly by a miracle he survived the plane crash in which his father was killed not only that he was instrumental in helping us catch the man whose bomb brought the aircraft down roger quick of radio forth raised a hand mr martin do you suspect any link between the murder of mrs mcgrath and her husbands death the detective chief superintendent looked at the reporter for a moment then shook his blond head no none at all we said at the time that we were satisfied that the bomber had acted alone and that we knew what his motive was as the man was shot dead at the scene of his subsequent crime we have to regard the fact that both of marks parents were murdered as no more than a particularly brutal coincidence so asked hunter once more do you see any motive for mrs mcgraths killing martin shrugged his shoulders rippling the cloth of his navy blue blazer john he said slowly speaking clearly for the microphones massed around him ive told you all we know for sure at this moment im not going to speculate on anything else nor would you expect me to motive if there is one is anyones guess i have to deal with established fact our thinking might crystallise once we trace mark but until then were throwing everything into the search dyou think the boys been kidnapped asked the old reporter bluntly possibly but i dont know snapped the detective what i do know is that we are involved in the biggest search this city has ever seen if it proves fruitless then that possibility would harden into a probability he picked up the notes on the table before him now lets get on with it shall we as martin stood up a hand was raised at the back of the room the policemans eyes narrowed as he recognised noel salmon a tabloid journalist recently declared persona non grata by skinner chief superintendent the head ofcid turned toalan royston the forces civilian media relations manager who was seated at the table beside him how did he get in here he growled with unaccustomed menace i had to let him in royston whispered hes been accredited by that sleazy new sunday the spotlight you know the rag they sell through supermarkets chief superintendent salmon called out once more a shout this time on behalf of the spotlight i have a personal question about dcc skinner is it true that his wife has filed for divorce every head in the room turned towards the untidy little journalist then most swivelled back towards martin waiting for his reaction the detectives green eyes were like ice as he stared at the reporter not to my knowledge he said loudly and clearly congratulations mr salmon he went on youve just been barred from this building yet again you and your paper do you expect her to the man shouted across the room no martin barked losing his temper for the second time that day just as a photographer rose from the seat next to salmon and snapped off a series of motordriven shots now get out of here before i run you through the door myself royston did whatt skinner roared his incredulous rhetorical question across the floor of the chief constables office in the fettes command corridor ill have the stupid bastards balls for paperweights i personally banned that little shite salmon from this office for life i said yet our press officer lets him back in and to represent that bloody downmarket rag at that he turned from martin to neil mcllhenney sergeant first thing tomorrow morning i want you to find out for me all about the procedure for firing a civilian employee meantime roystons suspended by the time im done with him hell be glad of a job on the fucking spotlight himself it was fifteen minutes after midnight skinner chief constable sir james proud acc jim elder martin and mcllhenney had gathered in the chiefs room to review progress or lack of it in the fruitless search for any trace of mark mcgrath or of his mothers murderer there had been no easy way for martin to break the news of salmons intervention in the press briefing even so he had anticipated his friends reaction and with the chiefs support had told royston to stay away from the office until further notice bob said sir james as martin had guessed he would dont you think you should pause for thought before taking action skinner looked at him a thick vein standing out on his right temple jimmy royston reports directly to me right the chief nodded waiting as his deputy took a deep breath okay skinner said at last in deference to you ill think about it once i have chances are ill still sack him but at least i wont have done it in the heat of the moment proud jimmy grunted thatll be some consolation to him he paused bob why would that bloody man salmon ask such a question you and sarah arent skinner shook his head emphatically sarah hasnt raised the subject of divorce with me nor i with her now can we please talk about police business of course said the chief as keen as skinner to change the sr subject and ushering his colleagues to chairs you too sergeant he said to mcllhenney will i sort out some coffee first sir good idea neil good idea the big man left the room leaving the door slightly ajar well said sir james no luck with our search skinner shook his head not that i expected it i know that wee boy too well chances are hed have defended his mother if not and hed escaped from the house mark wouldnt have hidden in fright hed have raised the street dyou think the kids dead then asked acc elder andy martin answered for skinner reading his mind as he had done a thousand times before no sir its likely that hes alive still if hed been killed hed have been left at the scene why should the murderer take him away to kill him later theres a better than even chance that hes been kidnapped why would anyone in his right mind elder began who says he is skinner growled andys right we have to look at this as a kidnapping how did he get away with it then in broad daylight asked proud shifting uncomfortably in his uniform and running his fingers through his silver hair did none of the neighbours see or hear anything no chief martin replied the fact is that with the time of the day and the holidays there were damn few neighbours about there were none on either side of the mcgrath house or across the street and only a few at the end of the road one of them thought he saw a silver or grey car in leonas driveway but thats the only lead we have leonas cars grey so when he drove past the man thought nothing of it only the mcgrath car was locked in the garage at the time the dcs paused as i see it the killer drove right up the path unlike the footpath to the front door its tarmac so he wouldnt have made much noise in any event mrs mcgrath was in the shower getting ready for her afternoon meeting once hedjemmied the back door i suspect that the intruder made sure of mark right away when the first officers arrived they found the television on in the living room it was tuned to the cartoon network on cable the sort of stuff that kids watch all day when theyre not at school after he had secured the boy tied and gagged him maybe i guess the man went upstairs for the mother as arthur dorward pointed out she must have been taken completely by surprise in her bedroom still barely dry from the shower wearing her bra and nothing else sir james proud frowned if kidnap was his motive why would he do that if he could have got away quietly why attack the mother as well skinner sighed theres a difference between purpose and motive chief this bastard may have gone there with the purpose of kidnapping the child or he may have gone there with the rape and murder of the mother on his mind in either case the kidnap or the killing may have been spurof the moment action alternatively there could have been a single game plan from the start but none of that takes us any nearer the killers actual motive it still doesnt tell us why what do you think then bob asked the chief do you have any notion of whats behind this the dcc looked at his only superior officer the closer he had come in rank to james proud the more he had come to value the man and to appreciate his humanity he knew how much the brutal death of a woman and the disappearance of her child would be affecting him and the effort he would be making to keep his emotions in check he knew also and made allowances for the fact that the chief constables career path had been one of administration rather than investigation and that as good a leader as he was he lacked the detectives instincts maybe we coppers place too much stress on motive sometimes skinner replied eventually genuine evil doesnt need reasons to be sometimes it just is thats a difficult concept for normal balanced people to grasp and so its easy to discount it but it could be that all this man sought was gratification from the rape torture and murder of a vulnerable defenceless woman and from the taking and terrorising of a child if thats the case its awful his voice rose suddenly and he slammed his right fist into his cupped left palm not just for what happened to leona but for what could be happening to that poor wee boy right now and presumably continued proud jimmy in an ominous tone because he could do it again skinner shot him a quick glance not could jimmy he said quietly id say will he paused and of course he may have done it before at the moment our best hope is that dna sampling will give us a match to a known offender a sociopathic rapist perhaps with a previous conviction whos done his time but hasnt exhausted his urges the chief shook his head its a nightmare right enough but theres something else that we mustnt forget broke in andy martin as mcllhenney returned with a tray of steaming mugs this was no ordinary single parent but a very highprofile lady a tory mr that gives us the possibility also that this crime could have political involvement terrorism said acc elder who can say at this stage growled skinner the only certainty just now is that here we all are as weve been a hundred times before in the middle of the night without a bloody clue pamela stirred and looked at the bedside alarm its red digits told her that it was am as skinner slid into her bed sorry pet he whispered i didnt mean to wake you she kissed him feeling the harsh stubble on his chin thats all right i wasnt sure whether youd come here i almost didnt i thought of going to fairyhouse avenue i even thought of crashing out in the office but then i thought of you and i realised that i needed to be with you in the dark she stroked his cheek was it bad in the house i mean she felt him shiver although the summer night was hot ive never been good at a murder scene he muttered but this one someone i knew someone i admired someone whos had enough tragedy in her life she felt the touch of his forehead on hers and his arm slip around her i tell you lover when we catch this guy i hope im there and i hope he resists arrest because i want the privilege of personally tearing out his heart shh shh she whispered quickly dont say that i hope you never get near him in that case youre too good a man to have anyones blood on your hands even his she was shocked even a touch frightened by his sudden ironic laugh in the darkness you think that do you pammy god lass but you dont know me as well as you think andy now hes shot someone dead and its broken his heart brian mackie hes had to do it and never given an emotional twitch but me now ive had to kill in the course of my career more than once and each time when ive looked at the body at my feet this person inside me this voice has said clear as you like quite fucking right too believe this if youve ever believed anything whoever killed poor wee leona had better never give me a clear shot and legal justification or ill shoot him like a dog and say got you you bastard she leaned away from him trying to see his face in the faint light which crept into her bedroom from the city outside bob she said with surprise in her voice id never have put you down for a supporter of capital punishment she saw the gleam of his white teeth as he smiled thats the thing he muttered more gently now im not in the judicial sense i couldnt hurt a fly in cold blood but in the heat of action theres something in me that takes over between you and me it scares me shitless im just glad im on the right side of the fence he drew her to him once more but enough of this black talk let me feel the warmth of your body and lets both get some sleep for at six thirty were both off out again in the vain hope of finding wee mark i saved his life once before you know i pray that i or one of skinners finest gets the chance to do so again ive sent pamela to be an observer at the postmortem said martin casually the search for mark mcgrath had just been declared exhausted and the head of cid and skinner were sharing an early lunch in the senior officers dining room the dcc felt his stomach churn involuntarily but all that his colleague saw was the raising of his eyebrows its part of the job bob she has to take her turn young pyes gone with her fair enough said skinner shes on your team he took a deep breath listen andy he began will you andalex be free this evening martin looked at him aye sure are you fed up eating alone is that it the dcc shook his head no theres something ive got excuse me sir the voice came from the doorway both detectives glanced across to see a tall thin man in a sergeants uniform you told me to let you know mr martin when the media were ready said william rowland alan roystons deputy the dcs stood up at once yes thanks bill he looked down at skinner im going to carry on taking the briefings sir until youve resolved the royston situation it wouldnt be fair to leave it to sergeant rowland fair enough listen will you get someone to tell royston to be in my office at ten on monday morning id better have it out with the guy martin nodded i think thats best he headed towards the door where rowland still waited come to dinner tonight why dont you he paused and said our place make it around halfseven thatll give us time to get ready to tell you the truth i think alex has been working herself up to talk to you about well everything i know shes not happy about the situation between you and sarah those two are like sisters you know skinner grunted tell me about it thats part of the problem but my daughters right i havent been talking to her nearly enough he picked up his coffee okay ill see you then what are the chances of finding the child alive chief superintendent the radio reporter looked barely more than a child himself looking at him andy martin wondered whether he might be on a workexperience placement used by the station as a cheap way of providing saturday news cover theres every chance mr his voice tailed off braden sir mr braden in fact were very hopeful of finding mark alive our ground search has run its course and so far weve had plenty of support from the public sooner or later well get a lead what i am doing today is renewing my request to propertyowners to check garages and outbuildings anywhere that a frightened child might be hiding also im asking everyone who was in the trinity area of edinburgh on friday afternoon to think hard just in case they saw anything unusual particularly if it involved a child and a grey car the boy looked eagerly at the detective is that your most positive lead so far a grey car to be unusually frank with you its our only lead so far john hunter waved a hand so kidnaps now becoming a probability is it andy martin nodded with every passing minute were being as positive as we can in our search of course if youre an innocent motorist in a grey car i apologise in advance for the inconvenience of being stopped by the police but im sure youll realise that were only doing whats necessary he looked at the assembled media thats all i have for you today folks same time tomorrow unless anything breaks if that happens youll be contacted john hunter fell into step with the detective as he left the room wheres royston he muttered dont ask martin whispered in return oh i see the old journalist paused listen andy i saw that wee shite salmon in the bar of the bank hotel last night after you had flung him out of here he wasnt letting on why but he looked as happy as a twococked dog in a stand of trees hes up to something and whatever it is i have a feeling that your lot arent going to like it joseph hutchison professor of pathology at edinburgh university knew deputy chief constable skinner well enough to know of his loathing of postmortem examinations so while he recognised the big policeman despite his surgical gown and cap as soon as he stepped into the theatre it was natural for him to look up in surprise hello bob said the twinklingeyed little scientist this is a rare honour having you visit my workshop skinner grunted a response as he strode over to stand between pamela masters and sammy pye who seemed to be positioned as far as possible from the postmortem table clearly the examination had been under way for some time he glanced down at pamela she was slightly pale and her cheekbones stood out a little more than usual but otherwise she was impassive any surprises for me joe skinner asked or havent you got that far yet oh yes said professor hutchison ive got that far as even the good doctor banks could work out death was due to strangulation by ligature the hyoid bone was crushed the ligature was so tight that the blood supply to the brain would have been cut off at once causing unconsciousness prior to death he paused coughing suddenly ive examined the major internal organs all healthy and undamaged im just looking at the brain now he held it up so that the police observers could see its swirling surface patterns slicked with blood and fluid in spite of himself skinner looked away as you can see continued the professor no obvious damage here either other than that consistent with a sudden stoppage of the blood supply he paused again there were other injuries of course four broken ribs all left side ruptured left eardrum left zygotic bone fractured all indicative of a severe beating by a righthanded attacker pounding on her face and body repeatedly with his fist however none of these would have contributed to death they were either gratuitous or they were an attempt to subdue the victim prior to the sexual assaults id say they were simply sadistic actually because the first thing the man did was to tie up the victim theres a big bruise to the small of her back consistent with the attacker having thrown her to the ground knelt on her really hard as he bound her wrists securely with the electrical cord your people say was used how about the blood on her fingernails joe skinner asked will we get any joy there hah said the professor my first piece of bad news im afraid the lab will have to confirm this but i surmise that those samples were from the victim herself there are marks on her back near those made by the electrical plug which conform to her nails having been crushed into her own tissue damn it said the policeman still therell be other traces there was a long silence that is the really bad news my friend there arent eh but what about the sexual injuries surely to christ he the little pathologist shrugged his shoulders its frustrating i know the woman was sexually attacked by a fairly large man and repeated penetration took place she was sodomised first id say very painfully much but not all of the blood came from the rupturing of vessels around the anus the rest from tearing around the vagina the muscles in these areas were all cramped and constricted indicating that the victim resisted throughout every attack even at the cost of added suffering and even if ultimately unsuccessfully yet there are no traces of semen the little pathologist looked up and across at skinner thats the trouble with the information superhighway im afraid bob theres far too much information about even the stupidest criminals know about dna tracing and can work out some fairly obvious ways of avoiding it this one probably used a condom skinner slapped the wall behind him in sudden fury causing both pam masters and sammy pye to start in surprise bastard he shouted ripping off his mask the coldblooded bastard you sure joe not a single smear hutchison shook his head sorry chum i understand your anger but there it is when you catch the guy you may find that he has sexual injuries this was a sadistic attack extremely vicious and the perpetrator is likely to show the effects upon his er person for some time even then of course it would be virtually impossible to link such injuries to this attack sshitt hissed the dcc is there nothing at all you can do detective constable pye asked the professor breaking if not clearing the tension in the room it was skinner who answered him suddenly and forcefully yes he said there is and youre going to do it joe arent you the pathologist sighed yes you know we are we will search the victims body minutely constable looking for just one hair that doesnt belong to her we will go though the areas in which it could be lodged with literally a finetooth comb and we will examine everything that isnt actually rooted that will be a lot but there is the real possibility that we will not find a single hair out of place to be literal about it he paused to look up at skinner mind you this is knock for knock bob youll have to send dorwards team back to the murder scene to do exactly the same thing to collect every loose hair for testing then youll have to eliminate her son her housekeeper her late husband of whom traces will undoubtedly remain in the room and any casual callers mrs mcgath may have had sorry to be so blunt before and after her widowhood the big detective nodded well do all that joe and any more thats necessary dont you worry just you go and get out your fine tooth comb can i ask you something bob skinner turned to pamela and smiled when couldnt you oh come on when i went to work for you at first i couldnt then and now when i see shadows cross your face when you dont know im looking at you that happens a lot does it yes it does for example every time i find you looking at your sons photograph your eyes are thousands of miles away he grimaced allow me that pammy please i miss wee jazz every moment of every day missing hims become a part of me but it doesnt affect our relationship come on what did you want to ask me she looked around the kitchen of skinners bungalow in fairyhouse avenue not far from the police headquarters building why have you never brought me here before he looked her straight in the eye as he replied because this is the home i made with sarah the furniture in it we bought together the swing on the tree outside i made for our son gullanes different thats the home i made with myra years ago you know about her all about her life and death it seems natural for you and i to be together there or for that matter at your place but i havent felt right about bringing you here not until now thats the truth of it she looked at him solemnly and nodded yes i thought youd say that and i understand it so why have you brought me here this afternoon he smiled back at her because this evening im going to begin to do what i promised you im going to have dinner with alex and andy and im going to tell them that you and i are seeing each other then tomorrow im going to have lunch with the chief in the new club and tell him the same thing finally tomorrow night im going to phone sarah and talk things through with her im going to ask her if she wants a divorce what if she says no at that point ill tell her about us im sorry if that seems devious or even cowardly but id sooner that sarah and i divorce because shes thought it through and wants to than because im putting a gun to her head he saw her eyes narrow youre guilty about me arent you he shook his head at once i have a clear conscience my mother might not have seen it that way but i do sarah and i had parted before you came on the scene but i do care for her and i want to be as gentle on her as i can what if she tells you she has another man ill say fair enough but youll hurt inside if i do love thats where itll stay now lets talk about something else to his surprise she frowned and a different shadow crossed her face remember when i dropped my car off at my place i went up to check the flat bob nodded there was a message on the answering machine from alan royston he snorted royston your ex did he want you to ask me to let him off the hook she shook her head vigorously dont be daft he doesnt know about us any more than anyone else does no he didnt leave any message other than for me to call him as soon as possible he sounded funny though anxious i mean what should i do nothing said skinner vehemently dont call him back under any circumstances im interviewing him on monday morning to give him a chance to explain himself im still undecided what to do about him if you speak to him at all theres a danger that you could compromise both of us in fact till i have dealt with him dont even mention the buggers name to me for now roystons another subject thats off limits the saturday evening traffic in leith was unusually heavy a result in part at least skinner guessed of the police flagging down and questioning the driver of every grey car in sight having dropped pamela at her home after promising to return to tell her of his confession to his daughter and her fiance he was fifteen minutes behind schedule when he arrived at the flat near haymarket which andy martin and alexis skinner now shared as he reached for the bell the heavy front door swung open and alex appeared she was wearing light cotton jeans a yellow teeshirt and a very serious expression hello darlin said bob holding out a bottle of red wine wrapped in green tissue sorry im late the traffic was murder did you see me arrive then from your perch over the street she nodded kissed him on the cheek as he entered the hall then put a hand on his chest to stop him pops she said theres someone here to see you he wouldnt say what its about till you got here but i think its a problem skinner frowned who is it come on through youll see she led her father into the living room of the secondfloor flat with its bay window overlooking the street andy martin was standing at the fireplace looking down in silence at a man seated on the couch his back to the door even from that angle hunched nervously in his seat skinner recognised alan royston he glared across the room what is this andy he asked with an edge of menace search me bob said martin as royston rose to his feet alan phoned about threequarters of an hour ago to ask if i knew where you were he said that it was very important that he saw you at once so i told him that if he was prepared to risk being chucked out of the window hed better come here the media relations manager turned nervously to face skinner he was clutching a document case fashioned of supple black leather im sorry about this sir i had no choice even allowing for my situation theres no way i could have referred this to bill dowling or anyone other than you he paused look could we speak in private the dcc shook his head he had no idea what the man wanted but all of a sudden he felt as if a black cloud was gathering above him and preparing itself to rain very hard no way alan if youve got bad news for me it wont be anything my family cant hear but if it is about your situation as you call it my daughter will show you the door royston shook his head and began to unzip the document case instinct as much as anything else made skinner hold up a hand wait just a minute please he looked across at alex standing now by andys side before we hear anything theres something that i have to say i came here this evening to tell you something that i should have told you both before for the last couple of months since just after sarah and i separated formally ive been having a relationship with pam masters as he looked at his daughter she gazed at the floor and nodded i know pops she said as though they were the only people in the room i drove out to gullane one friday night about three weeks ago to surprise you to cheer you up i was just turning into the green when i saw pamela jump out other car and run into the cottage carrying what looked like an overnight bag och love im sorry skinner blurted out glancing at martin he saw that his friend was stunned so why didnt you tell andy for i can see you didnt because i knew that youd tell us both if and when you were ready he grinned but without humour you knew better than me then abruptly he turned to royston rightalan now thats said please carry on the man nodded and finished unzipping his case thats why im here sir im afraid noel salmon came to see me at six oclock the little bastard was almost chortling with glee he gave me this and asked if you would care to comment on the story for his next edition slowly he withdrew from the document case a copy of the sunday spotlight this will be on sale in all of its supermarket outlets around britain tomorrow morning theyve labelled it exclusive but theyll release copies to television and radio at nine this evening to promote their sales his hand shook as he handed skinner the newspaper and he winced as the policemen unfolded it and saw the front page top cop and sexy sarge the headline blared naked romps shock police force exclusive by spotlights top reporter noel salmon skinner felt his spine stiffen as he stared at the tabloid his eyes widening beneath the headline most of the front page was taken up by a colour photograph it had been shot with a long lens and through a muslindraped window but it was clear enough it showed a tall naked man standing with his back to the window and the camera beyond sitting up in bed and staring at him as if in awe the head and shoulders of a woman recognisable clearly as pam masters holy shit skinner whispered at last as he stared at the picture it took a while before he was able to shift his gaze to the story beneath he began to read aloud in a strained voice top detective bob skinner edinburgh s famous deputy chief of police has been enjoying a steamy affair with his quote personal assistant unquote sergeant pamela masters while his beautiful doctor wife sarah has been staying in the us with her parents and yearold baby son james only last year mrs skinner spent a weeklong vigil at her husbands bedside as he lay critically wounded in an edinburgh hospital after being stabbed by a young girl the twotiming detective thought to be a serious candidate for the post of commissioner of the metropolitan police and the stunning sarge have been enjoying raunchy romps at skinner s luxury seaside cottage in gullane scotland one of his three homes and at yearold masters penthouse pad in edinburghs trendy leith district this week detective chief superintendent andy martin refused to answer spotlight questions on his boss s indiscretion or on the likely reaction of mrs skinner angrily ordering that your reporter be thrown out of an open press conference at which he tried to raise the issue martin is engaged to skinners lawyer daughter alexis and is known throughout scottish police circles as his personal protege the high hopes that masters a onetime marketing whizz kid clearly entertained for a similarly rapid rise through the ranks look like disappearing even more rapidly as skinners own career is thrown into doubt spotlight readers must ask whether the twotiming tec can be trusted in one of the country s top police positions and whether he can continue in his other post as security adviser to bruce anderson the new secretary of state for scotland read next weeks spotlight for sarah skinners reaction to her husbands betrayal more exclusive pies on pages and would you credit that said skinner hoarsely as he looked up from the newspaper the miserable snooping duplicitous little creep photographed me through my bedroom window and the storys a fucking travesty sarah and i are formally legally separated both here and in the states holidaying with her parents for christs sake she has a job over there she took my son over there without my agreement at that what the hell else have they done lets see he lifted the paper again and tore it open at pages four and five as he did so alex and andy came to stand with him scanning the pages from either side the spread showed an array of photographs one showed sarah whitetunicclad at an openair crime scene frowning at her husband last year at witches hill i guess said skinner others showed martin at the press conference pointing to the door as he ordered salmon from the room then glaring angrily at alan royston a fourth taken in the street below showed alex andandy leaving home casually dressed finally there was a series of three photographs in colour like the rest they had been taken from a high vantagepoint looking down into the garden of the gullane cottage the first showed bob and pam kissing in the second she was kneeling before him her face buried in his lap in the third he had gathered her up in his arms and was carrying her towards the house the dirty little sod alex cried out imagine photographing us in the street like that and those in gullane how could they have taken them icily calm now skinner shrugged the window shot thats obvious they waited outside and they got lucky the others they could only have been taken from one place the big house at the top of the green the one that belongs to our chum hes in the seychelles just now and the place is empty they must have climbed on to the roof he crumpled the tabloid in his hands twisting it in his fury and tearing it to pieces throwing it into a corner he turned to his daughter putting his hands on her shoulders and looking her in the eye i am so sorry my love that you and andy have been mixed up in this its not right its not fair and its all down to me she looked at him solemnly dad she began ive only got one thing to say to you he waited looking at her anxiously go on if the spotlights done nothing else its proved to the world that youve got a nice bum for a fortysixyearold she smiled at him suddenly and brightly and hugged him pops if you think for one second that i wont stand by you in this you sarah and pam youre all grownup people just do whats best for my wee brother thats all i ask but i know you will bob heaved a great sigh of relief he turned to andy martin who was smiling also right people he barked what am i going to do about this martin answered him at once we bob what are we going to do i for one am going to have that little bastard salmon arrested and charged with breach of the peace i reckon we might be able to make that stick on the basis of that bedroom shot id love to let you andy skinner replied you know that id love to use all my power to have this little man broken like a butterfly on a wheel for pams sake id like personally to knock ten bells out of him in a quiet room somewhere but none of that is going to happen he turned to his daughter alex right now you get on the phone to the chairman of this new law firm of yours my footballdaft chum in north berwick i know youre only a raw new apprentice there but in this youre acting for me i want an opinion from him on whether we can go to court to secure an injunction stopping publication of this crap if its possible do it if he says it isnt i want him to issue through the firm a statement on my behalf saying that my relationship with miss masters is an entirely private matter setting out the legal position between sarah and me and saying if he thinks that we have a case that writs for defamation will be issued on monday morning by both pamela and by me any press statement from me should issue through your firm not the force got all that alex nodded ive got mr laidlaws number too i was given a list of senior partners contact numbers ill call him now from the bedroom she rushed off to make the call skinner turned back to royston alan i should crucify you for letting salmon back into fettes against my orders but im not going to for the chiefs sake you need to be back on the job now and anyway i was only going to chew you out on monday nothing worse unless an injunction sticks sir james will be asked tonight for a response to the story hell need your objective guidance and support i want you to come with me now to see him i have to tell him about this personally once ive done that ill withdraw so that he cant be accused of acting under pressure from me royston nodded i agree with all of that sir but theres someone else involved what about pam skinner could see his anxiety look alan he said i know that you and she were close once but dont worry ill look out for her in this he turned away from the press officer took out his mobile and k dialled pamela masters number she answered sounding hesitant and a little afraid listen love said bob to what i have to say weve got a media problem and it could be messy stay where you are for now dont answer the phone and dont answer the door until i get there ill give four quick buzzes so you know its me before then i have to see the chief and i have to go to back fairyhouse avenue why do you have to go there her tone was one of bewilderment because i have to phone sarah and it just seems right to me that i do it from there bob this problem involves me yes she sounded completely scared now im afraid so honey you and i will be all over the scandal sheets tomorrow thanks to a wee man with a grudge but dont you worry things are under control and hopefully we can nip it in the bud ill be with you as soon as i can he ended the call just as alex reappeared in the doorway dad she said ive got mr laidlaw on the line he wants to speak with you skinner nodded and followed his daughter through to the flats main bedroom the telephone was lying off its cradle on a bedside table he sat down and picked it up mitch hello sorry to break into your saturday evening but this fucking scandal sheets left me no option skinner had known mitchell laidlaw socially for twenty years as a fellow member of an informal group who gathered together on thursday evening in north berwick sports centre to play enthusiastic if largely unskilled indoor fiveaside football however this was the first time the two had ever spoken on a professional footing laidlaws career had paralleled that of skinner as he had risen through the legal ranks to become scotlands leading litigation solicitor and finally head of its largest law firm curie anthony and jarvis which alex had joined a month earlier on leaving university so i gather from your daughter bob skinner was struck at once by his friends tone there was no hint of the normal thursdayevening banter mitch laidlaw sounded solemn and totally professional alex has read the article to me and described the photographs i admit that charging the people involved with breach of the peace is a nice idea but even if the sheriff convicted hed be overturned at appeal for sure and your force would be open to an action for malicious prosecution so you were right to veto that as for an injunction im afraid that we just dont have time to injunct successfully by the time we had drafted it and rounded up a judge the article would be in the hands of the broadcast media and i suspect in the hands of the spotlights sister publications skinner growled you mean there are more of these damn things oh yes this isnt the first time ive had to deal with this magazine on behalf of angry clients theres an american version one in australasia and issues in french german spanish and japanese the chain is usowned and each version is marketed purely through supermarkets at checkouts and at inhouse newsstands okay if we cant stop them can we sue the bastards on the other end of the line he heard laidlaw take a deep breath can i ask a very delicate question bob if you have to i do are you completely confident of miss masters integrity one hundred per cent the policeman replied without hesitation good in that case id say that she has a very strong case in an action for defamation the paper implies beyond challenge that her relationship with you is motivated by a hope of personal advantage tell me bob what was the sequence of events here how did the relationship which alex says you dont deny how did it develop skinner reflected for a few moments lets see the first time i ever met pam was when i chaired a promotion board for prospective sergeants it was a twentyminute interview and she passed unanimously a few months later my executive assistant was promoted and i was looking for a successor i remembered pam interviewed her and gave her the job my marriage was in trouble before that in fact her appointment virtually coincided with my moving out we worked together well and amicably for a while we had a few late shifts which led to a few meals together i realised early on that i was attracted to her but our physical relationship didnt develop until after sarah had taken our son to the states we spent two nights under the same roof once at her place when i was snowed in and once in gullane but we didnt actually sleep together until my separation from sarah had been legally recognised i can give you dates later mitch but thats the sequence of events thats good said the lawyer now what about miss masters post as your assistant as soon as i saw how things would develop i moved her out of my office i transferred her to andy martins personal staff and took sergeant neil mcllhenney as her replacement ah said laidlaw so because you and she were entering a physical relationship miss masters actually lost her important fast track job as your executive officer absolutely then all she has to do to pursue a defamation action is to decide on the quantum of the claim that is how much the accusation that she was prepared to sell herself for advancement is worth to her or at least how much a court is likely to think it worth what do you think hmm mitch laidlaw contemplated she has good career prospects yes yes she was a late entrant but she can expect to make chief inspector as a minimum well in that case i think theyd settle out of court for at least a hundred and fifty thou maybe two hundred plus costs of course the solicitor paused again shell need to instruct me personally if she wants to proceed but that can be done tomorrow now about your own case thats not so clearcut im afraid why not skinner protested for a couple of reasons first you are a very senior officer even if miss masters sues successfully the defence against an action by you could be that you used your position a glamorous and powerful position to turn the ladys head or to pull her if you want a thursday night term second you may be separated legally but you are still married hold on mitch skinner protested the article says that sarah went to the states on holiday and that ive been having it off behind her back no bob you read it that way but it didnt actually say so the phrase used was staying in the us with her parents in any event their defence would be that an action for adultery would succeed and if one was lodged and decree granted before your case reached the court of session we wouldnt have a chance to sum up if you instruct me ill lodge a writ for defamation on monday but with no great expectation of success in that case any shortterm benefit which may accrue to you would be lost when you were forced to drop your action and meet defence costs the big policeman sighed so what do you recommend i will issue a statement on your behalf saying that your relationship with miss masters is private and personal with no professional overtones and that it began after you and your wife entered a formal separation agreement i will say also that i have advised you of the potential for an action for defamation and that you will consult with me on monday to determine the course of proceedings thatll put the spotlight thing into some sort of perspective and itll make the rest of the media think carefully about carrying on the story skinner grunted agreement okay i know i couldnt be in better hands mitch so you do as you advise how will you go about it ill give the statement to our marketing officer and tell her to issue it in an hour well say that you have nothing to add to the statement but youd better make sure anyway that your force press people are briefed to refer to us all callers who come on looking for you or pamela if alex has my home number shell have the marketing ladys as well okay said skinner ill alert everyone look thanks again mitch well speak on monday earlier if necessary said laidlaw incidentally bob he added im very impressed with that daughter of yours we havent allocated her to a department as yet so i think ill take her into mine skinner smiled across at alex who stood by the window watching him be careful about that mate she could wind up ruling your life too my goodness bob what a position to find yourself in mind you i have to say as im sure noone else will have that youve only got yourself to blame what for jimmy not pulling the bedroom curtains skinner and the chief constable were alone in the proud sitting room lady proud at her husbands suggestion had taken alan royston to the kitchen to make coffee the dcc had watched his commanders face grow increasingly red as he had studied the spotlight exclusive dont be flip with me man you have to know that public figures are always in the spotlight no pun intended the big detective growled but not to that extent surely obviously they are bob said the chief waving the newspaper much as i regret it this sort of media behaviour is still legal in this and in most free countries however much i might deprecate this man salmon and his rag you were there for him to see and to photograph i have nothing against sergeant masters bob but i am very fond of sarah as you know and i am heart sorry to think of her on the other end of this situation so am i jimmy but at least ive got time to warn her confession rather than warning i think said proud sadly now tell me bob why what did you see in this lass skinner sat in one of the chiefs big armchairs have you ever been lonely jimmy he asked then continued without waiting for an answer well i have for about fifteen years after myra was killed i had this big cold streak inside me i brought up my daughter i did my job as hard and as best i could i socialised with the lads but always it was there that big cold lump that set me apart from the rest i know now what it was its called bereavement and all widowed people carry it around inside them some have faith that helps them to handle it that even lets them draw strength from it but i lost my wife young and i never came to terms with the fact at least not until sarah came along when i met her that coldness began to disappear until at last it was gone altogether and i was really happy again after half a lifetime he leaned back in the chair then out of the blue it seemed things went pearshaped between the two of us very suddenly and completely unexpectedly id just assumed that wed be happy ever after it doesnt matter whose fault it was whether i was wrong or whether she was or whether as is most likely we both were we had just lost the way we were broken asunder and with that and no doubt with my uncovering the circumstances ofmyras death as well that big cold beast of bereavement was back with me he looked up at proud loneliness is the only thing in life that really scares me jimmy the prospect of it makes me crazy fortuitous or whatever pam was there for me when i needed her most to help me fight off my fear i believe that everything ive done since then has been proper except that i chose to be secretive about it i should have told my family i should have come clean with sarah when i saw her in may and i should have taken you into my confidence for all of that i apologise to you he stopped first time in my life ive ever had to say that to you and itll be the last like pam said to me its a bugger when you discover you aint the person you thought you were the gruff old chief constable stood over him apology accepted son he said and sat down facing skinner dont be too hard on yourself now he muttered grimly what are we going to do about this bloody man salmon thats the point at which i have to leave you to make your own decisions sir if nothing else i have caused embarrassment to the force its for you to determine your course of action without input from me thats why ive brought royston with me hell brief you on the questions that are likely to come up and advise you on the shape of your responses the content is up to you if you want to suspend me forthwith ill respect that and make no public reaction myself hah the chief roared suspend you do you think id let a wipearse like salmon and his paper deprive this city of its finest police officer im going to stand by you just as youve always stood by everyone under your command the silverhaired sir james paused and his expression became serious once more there is one thing though of which we should both be conscious we have a new government in power elected on the crest of a wave of concern about probity in public life its party members are in the ruling majority on the joint police board the one area in this job where im still ahead of you bob is in the politics of it for you they dont exist but believe me they do i can hold the chair of the board in line but some of the members as youve seen for yourself are unpredictable a few are downright anti polis we even know of a couple with criminal records proud rose walked over to skinner and laid a hand on his shoulder i have friends in the scottish media that even you dont know about most of the press wont run with this story unless that is the board gives them no option ill do my best on that score i promise now lets see what advice master royston has to give me there was a long silence at the other end of the line let me get this straight said sarah at last her new york tones more drawnout than ever youre telling me that youre having an affair and that because of it our lives our child and the state of our marriage are going to be all over the gutter press i cant soften it love said bob thats whats happened this woman the pamela creature were you screwing her before you visited with jazz and me in may yes im sorry i should have told you back then a snort bounced off the satellite and crossed the atlantic oh no you shouldnt with my folks around while you were under their roof that would not have been the time to tell me id been traded in for a younger model pams older actually said bob automatically cursing himself at once oh darlin im sorry listen its not like that my world was upsidedown at the time im not making excuses but it just happened what there was a hitch in sarahs voice the sound of a suppressed sob you just fell in love with another woman with the ink barely dry on our separation no he protested listen shut up for a minute bob please let me get my head round this a piece at a time she paused and he could hear her fight to calm her breathing to calm herself that explains the phone call anyway she said finally in an even tone what phone call this afternoon i had a call from a guy in scotland he said his name was salmon he said that he was researching for a series on your career and that he needed medical background on some of your investigations he asked if he could come to buffalo to visit me i thought it was a little odd but i said okay if he was prepared to pay the air fare then i was prepared to see him next tuesday i take it that yes muttered bob grimly hes the shit who broke the story and he expects still to be alive next tuesday sarah responded with a faint hint of mockery andy was going to lock him up the trouble was he hadnt broken any laws pam may be able to sue him but thats it pam may be able what you mean she isnt a mangrabbing little opportunist her voice rose once more no said her husband quietly she isnt okay said sarah more calmly im sorry i shouldnt have got down to that level what does this man salmon want some photos of the wronged wife and baby i guess plus confirmation from you that im a shit and that you cant wait to divorce me none of that sounds too tough said sarah so youll see him there was another snort with a laugh in it this time like hell i will do you think for one moment that id involve myself or my baby with a rag like that ive seen the us spotlight and i can think of halfadozen congressmen whove trying to have it banned if you can get word to this guy let him know that if he sets foot on my dads doorstep hell have him arrested and in this city my dad could probably do that ill have royston pass that message on said bob sarah he went on strangely hesitant i have to ask you this do you intend to divorce me he heard her gasp slightly she was silent for several expensive transatlantic seconds until finally she responded very quietly do you want me to ive no right to expect otherwise but is it what you want this time it was bobs turn to fall silent no he said at last ask me now and the answers no do you and pamela love each other like does she want to have your babies another pause no i dont think we do i dont think she does weve avoided discussing anything so heavy then get yourselves sorted out ill give you three months if after that youre no longer involved with this woman and you tell me that you love me and want me back ill decide how i feel if you cant make me believe all that ill know its over dont we have to say those things to each other he asked she chuckled and in his minds eye he could see her shake her head not from where im standing we dont the big policeman alone in his sitting room heaved a sigh and nodded okay thats how itll be before i hang up can i speak to jazz hes out with granddad im afraid okay he was about to say goodbye when something struck him sarah one thing you should look out for this bastard salmon isnt going to like it when we blow him out be careful that he doesnt try any candid camera stuff on you okay but how could he well skinner gulped and took the plunge if you were seeing anyone however innocently as opposed to guiltily you mean aye okay he grunted there was a pause at the other end of the line well i have had a few dinner dates with a single guy around my own age on the medical staff at my hospital dinner dates though thats all he felt a tug in the pit of his stomach so you havent no i have not she cried sure the thought has crossed my mind im as human as you but maybe just a bit more restrained the invitations been extended too in a very gentlemanly diplomatic fashion till now ive thanked him but declined as a lady should after this though you can work out for yourself how im likely to respond however my dear theres one thing that i will promise you whats that when i do decide to let terry and me enjoy the good honest tuck to which hes probably entitled and which i undoubtedly deserve ill make bloody sure that the drapes are drawn tight the sound of a phone being slammed down crashed in his ear skinner sat on the edge of the couch in the curtained living room in gullane drawing listlessly on a bottle of becks it was just after ten thirty sarah gave you a hard time did she asked pamela come on tell me about it youve been silent as the grave on the subject it was true skinner had eaten before picking her up from the leith apartment principally to allow him to recover from his conversation with his wife as they had driven to east lothian having decided to ignore any paparazzi who might be on their trail next day he had told her of his instruction of mitchell laidlaw and of his conversation with the chief constable from the cottage he had made phone calls to royston and toalex to confirm that both the force and the solicitors spokeswoman had been bombarded with press enquiries since the spotlight story had broken but he had said nothing at all until then of his telephone call to sarah or other reaction what is it asked pamela once more has she asked for a divorce he took another swig of his beer shes stopped short of that but lets say shes reserved her position did you ask her if she has someone else pamelas eagerness irked him yes and she has platonic so far but ive driven her into his bed im sure what makes you think that christ she more or less told me so anyway youve been in her place how did you react when you found out about david she pouted just hold on david was living with me when he had his affairs so the situation isnt the same i certainly didnt respond in kind not for a while at least it was almost two years before i fancied anyone else were dodging an issue though if youre jealous of sarahs new man real or not i dont like that in fact you can either get over it or do without me which would you prefer bob laid the beer on the floor and took her by the hand calm down pammy its just that im an old presbyterian at heart ill get over it take me to bed then she said teasingly reaching for the buttons of his shirt i might consider it he said managing a weak smile but feeling a pang of doubt inside just in time the ring of the telephone took him off the hook sod it he said reaching across to pick it up good evening mr skinner said a smug voice raised slightly over a background of conversation i hope you enjoy your weekend reading if you switch on the telly at eleven oclock i think youll find that sky news give you a good show too salmon you little cunt the policeman snarled how did you get this number i have friends despite what your lawyer said i felt i had to give you the chance of coming clean for my readers can they expect your resignation within the week you can expect my hand on your collar you slimy wee toad skinner exploded plus were going to sue you till your fucking eyes pop you can forget going to see my wife too she has nothing to say to you and if you push your luck over there i have friends in the fbi wholl slam you right inside nice one bob said salmon with a disturbingly calm assurance ive got that all noted down and itll read well in next weeks spotlight you and pamela have a nice night now but think on this i havent finished with you yet not by a long way as the call ended skinner hurled the phone across the room tearing the flex from its socket and smashing it against the wall he turned to pam who sat shocked and drawn he got my number he said incredulously im on the mi network yet he got my ex directory number some shit sold it to him she stood up and held him to her feeling him tremble with rage control yourself love she said every point that nasty little man adds to your blood pressure is a victory for him remember the rule dont get mad get even he shook his head ive never been any good at that some guys like andy can count up to ten and by the time they get there theyve cooled down ive never made it past three nevertheless his breathing did begin to steady as she drew his face down to hers and kissed him and as she stroked his hair thats better she whispered with a smile forget salmon and come with me come on i drew the curtains earlier but well keep the light out as well just to be safe gradually his expression softened until finally he allowed himself to be led through to the bedroom slowly she undressed him in the dark peeling off her own clothes more quickly and climbing on top of him as he lay on the duvet he felt her tongue in his mouth flicking seeking his then it moved as she did he felt it lick its way along his chest playing lightly with its curly hairs felt her lips move on him kissing puckering felt himself growing huge as she made her steady way down until the only functional telephone in the cottage seemed to scream at the night a few feet from his ear no it was pams turn to shout her frustration if thats him again then hes a goner said skinner quite seriously he picked up the phone now listen you he began in a deadly tone good evening mr skinnerthe voice cut across his not salmon another man a quiet even and controlled tone without accent who i have the child he is alive but at my disposition you will hear from me again for the second time that evening a phone line went dead leaving skinner staring ahead into darkness british telecom couldnt help then andy i take it martin shook his head he and skinner sat grimfaced at the kitchen table in the cottage china mugs of coffee steaming before them it was twentyfive minutes past midnight and the head of cid had just arrived from edinburgh leaving alex alone in the haymarket flat from the living room the faint sound of the television carried through as pamela watched for the fourth or fifth time a video of the carefully worded sky news precis of noel salmons spotlight exclusive they did their best of course bob but without exceptional luck such as the guy forgetting to disable or advance warning there wasnt much chance that theyd be able to trace the origin of the call skinner grunted come on andy dyou think that i didnt try the automatic number trace you were called today at he mimicked the caller withheld his number martin glanced at him maybe he used a payphone did you hear coins drop no but thats not a giveaway any more they did away with press button a years ago on most of them the younger man raised an eyebrow hey maybe he used a credit card skinner glowered across the table andy son i know its past midnight and that were clutching at some very short straws but really martin sipped his coffee miracles happen no they bloody dont skinner slapped the table gently look its been a mindfucker of a night but lets get a grip of ourselves and start thinking and acting like the serious coppers we are i asked you out here so that the two of us could have a brainstorm before we call in the cavalry so lets get on with it can i join in too asked pamela from the doorway or is this for general staff only bob grinned at her as she leaned against the jamb wearing a teeshirt and his long towelling bathrobe aye come on in sergeant even though youre out of uniform she looked at him in football top and shorts then at martin in denims raised her eyebrows in a gesture which said oh yes then joined them at the table right said skinner there are all sorts of potential implications which we can draw from this call lets see if we can nail them all down a question first surely pamela interrupted was the call genuine could it have been a crank thats possible but if it was a crank bear in mind that the call was made to an exdirectory number that means that the perpetrator is either one of my inner circle with access to that number or hes gone to some trouble and possibly some risk to get it no he said emphatically ive no doubt that the call was genuine anyway we have to assume that it was until we know otherwise so okay not a hoax next why to you asked martin why did the guy give a personal message to you ive been the front man in this investigation all along youve never been involved publicly skinner nodded good one ideas pam she hesitated well you are pretty well known think police think edinburgh think bob skinner it could be no more than that except except said martin that its public knowledge that you have a special connection with this child after the lammermuirs air disaster when wee mark was the only survivor which proves incidentally he interjected triumphantly that miracles do happen it was you who rescued him from the sinking cockpit of the plane in the middle of a reservoir that was all over the papers at the time everybody knows about you saving that wee boys life so so it could explain why the kidnapper would choose to make contact with you skinner smiled and his eyes narrowed and could it explain why he took the child martin stared at him you mean could he have taken the child as an act of revenge against you well could heyoull concede ive made a few potential enemies over the years martin nodded even leaving out the ghosts of the dead ones okay suppose someone wants to hurt me the dcc went on what are his choices he could come at me in person but maybe he lacks the physical capability the resources or just the bottle for that he could target my daughter but she lives with you and youre as dangerous a customer as i am he could target my wife and son but theyre a long way off in the states so how does he do something thats going to hurt me to the heart skinner paused maybe just maybe he remembers last years publicity he remembers the bond between me and wee mark and he says thats the way so he keeps leonas house under observation he traces her movements he waits and he waits he picks his time and he kidnaps mark not skinners son but a surrogate pamela touched his arm but why kill the mother he turned and looked at her not sarah but a surrogate he said quietly then paused what do you think of the proposition chief superintendent sergeant martin frowned then rose from the table let me think about it for a minute he said moving towards the living room pam he smiled over his shoulder how about some more coffee you are on my staff after all yes sir she said smartly as skinner followed his friend out of the kitchen in the other room martin was waiting his smile gone bob i accept your theory not as a main line of investigation perhaps but as a credible scenario however should you be right have you thought of another implication which flows from it whats that the younger man paused the proposition that leona might have been attacked instead of sarah after this weekends publicity if that is true the killer has a new target he jerked a thumb towards the kitchen skinners face darkened whistling christ andy youre right he nodded absently to himself from now on shed better not leave my side and then like sunlight over a field as a cloud blows away his expression changed as a new thought came to him unless he said his voice rising hes already using pam to hurt me think of it for the past few months shes hardly been out of my sight while weve been off duty or out of yours while shes been at work in reality that would make her an even tougher target than sarah oralex but suppose my enemys been watching me hes seen the two of us together and made the connection yes said martin comprehending racing alongside skinners thinking we know all about salmon and his story but we dont know his source suppose the kidnapper tipped off salmon put him on your trail that figures andy the wee bastards never had a decent exclusive of his own before he could even have used it to land his job on the spotlight and something else added the chief superintendent salmon called you tonight and so did the kidnapper both on your ex directory number is it possible that the kidnapper gave salmon the number it had become a game now one they had often played before chasing an idea worrying at it throwing in possibilities adding tints and colours until a picture emerged skinner beamed or did salmon give it to him he asked even without knowing why he would use it his friend shook his head dont lets stop there bob lets give that slimeball the benefit of no doubt at all or did salmon know why he would use it i couldnt believe that said skinner doubtfully not even of him neither do i said martin as pamela came into the room carrying a cafetiere but it gives us all the reason we need and more to arrest the wee bastard and in the process to leak accidentally of course the name of the man whos assisting us with our investigation of a murder and kidnap bob threw back his big greymopped head and laughed heartily for what seemed to each of the others to be the first time in an age oh yes he chuckled im going to love that especially when i play my tape back to him andy and pamela stared at him what tape asked martin something even you didnt know mate and incidentally which the pair of you still dont know even after tonight its an open secret now that as the secretary of states security adviser im part of mi but the fact that all mis officers home phones are tapped thats a very closed secret indeed he punched martin gently on the shoulder lets nick him pal i suggest that you have mcguire do it hes hard enough to frighten stone and besides being lifted by special branch always concentites the mind he smiled as an afterthought came to him tell mario to take mcllhenney with him just for added effect have them pick him up tomorrow morning over breakfast then you and mcguire chew him around good and proper lean on him pressure him for the name of the person who gave him my unlisted number let him think were after him for bribery dont tell him about the kidnappers call i want to spring that on him myself after an hour or two ill come in and play my tape i cant wait to see the look on his face when i ask him to convince us that he isnt in cahoots with a killer martin nodded okay save for one thing i dont think it would be wise or even proper for you to take part in any interview with salmon youve got a personal involvement with him and a very public grudge against him ill play your tape to him dont worry about that the big dcc grunted yes i suppose youre right its a pity though i really want to see that wee sod piss his pants v r the building in which salmons flat was located was a dingy affair in a part of leith which seemed to have escaped the process of yuppification by which much of the old port has been transformed the door to the street was unsecured and the wide dusty stairway smelled strongly of urine jesus christ mario muttered mcllhenney places like this make a case for more public lavvies mario mcguire shook his dark latin head people who pish up closes will always pish up closes you know that he paused and grinned what happened to the sir by the way fuck off inspector thats for when there are people around dont let this sb stuff go to your heid i suppose you call your wife maam all the time eh what else would i call a senior officer you know dci rose shes a stickler for formality excuse me maam would you please pass the marmalade thats normal across our breakfast table or excuse me maam is there any chance of a shag thats for after dinner the big sergeant chuckled its lucky youre not in admin then or youd have to fill out a requisition aye said mcguire laughing himself another fuckin chitty married lifes agreeing with you then said mcllhenney as they climbed the dirty stairs away from the rankness of the street level to my slight surprise it is ill tell you as an old pal i was a wee bit scared when we tied the knot the italian side of my lineage isnt big on divorce i neednt have worried though mags is one in a million were a couple of lucky bastards you and i neil all those fish in the sea yet i land her and you land olive exceptional women both of them the sergeant nodded thoughtfully its true what you say about my olive too he said at last exceptional out of every million fish or so you can expect to find a great white shark aw come on neil mcguire protested you can kid the rest of them but not me i remember those sunday lunches olive used to cook for me when i was young free and single and i remember she had you eating them out of her hand mcllhenney shrugged his shoulders and smiled sheepishly fair enough he chuckled but dont tell anyone else okay ive got her image to protect ken in the seconds of silence which followed as they climbed past the second floor scanning the nameplate on each door his smile faded its a shame about the big man though mario isnt it he said at last depends what you mean replied mcguire i know a few guys would give their back teeth to be banging pam masters its a shame about them being all over the papers though as this guy salmons going to find out he added grimly no countered the sergeant i mean its a shame about him and sarah i thought that pair were set for life i just cant imagine what happened to split them up him bangin pam masters could have had just a wee bit to do with it maybe now it could but im pretty certain that didnt start till after they separated there was some other reason for him moving out when he did dont know what it was though mcguire drew a deep breath as they reached the fourth and top floor of the tenement building did you know about him and masters he asked at last i suspected being his pa and all i picked up the odd hint whats she like i dont really know her mcllheney shrugged again pam shes okay shes bright although i wouldnt put her in maggies league shes efficient too i know that having taken over from her its just och shes no sarah thats all he glanced at his colleague what does maggie think other she worked for her for a while didnt she mcguire nodded she hasnt said much i just get the impression that she doesnt think shes a real copper know what i mean mags isnt too struck on late entrants to the force she definitely doesnt approve other and the boss though i can tell you that when she saw the paper this morning shed a face like thunder the sergeant winced a few folkll think that way i fear tell you what i think mario its the first wrong move ive ever known big bob make he glanced across the landing lit by a glass cupola above to a mauvepainted door there he said pointing salmon thats the boys flat he looked at mcguire once again quiet or noisy he asked the blackhaired policeman grinned wickedly what do you think lets give the neighbours something to talk about he stepped up to the door and pounded on its wooden panel with the side of his heavy fist police he roared open up mcllhenney leaned against the door listening hes switched the tranny off the two policemen stood waiting after almost a minute the inspector thumped the door again come on open up or well kick it in the sergeant pressed his ear to the panel once more hes coming he said suddenly leaning back they heard the rattle of a security chain being slipped then a key turned in the lock and the mauve door swung open what dyouse the words died in the womans throat as she stared at mcllhenney in recognition she was tall and blonde in her midthirties her face was not unattractive but bony and the lines around the eyes had been carved not by laughter but by life her hair was dishevelled and her makeup only a memory of the night before as she looked at mcllhenney her right hand rose involuntarily clutching the long teeshirt which she wore and pulling it up in the process to the edge of immodesty oh no she said in a resigned tone no you again well well well said the sergeant if it isnt joanne virtue lady of the night the big easy herself and what my good woman would you be doing here the blonde struggled to recover her composure belligerence flickered in her eyes ah live here she said with an attempt at boldness like fuck you do joanne said mcllhenney patiently you live down by the waterfront as you and i both know now go and tell mr salmon that like you the polis await his pleasure whos mr salmon your punter said mcguire aw is that his name he just felt me it was noel mcllhenneys patience a scarce and fragile commodity at the best of times ran out bugger this for a game of soldiers he said marching past the prostitute and into the flat salmon where are you he bellowed throwing open the nearest door to the right off the hallway he looked quickly into an untidy stalesmelling bedroom a black dress bra and tights were thrown over a chair and mens clothing lay strewn across the floor but the room was empty the big detective looked over his shoulder at joanne virtue she shrugged her shoulders and pointed briefly at a door on the other side of the hall mcllhenney nodded and with a grim smile stepped across and threw it open a naked man stood with his back to him bent over the toilet bowl pumping at the handle as if that would make the cistern refill faster whatever youre doing salmon said mario mcguire from the doorway stop it right now the man turned and looked at the two policemen then grabbed a towel and fastened it round his middle what do you want he shouted his face contorted with a mixture of fear and frustration what do you think youre doing youve no right mcguire smiled were here to see you mr salmon in connection with a potential security leak which we have reason to believe may involve the corrupt obtaining of an unlisted telephone number as for our entering your premises miss virtue invited us he looked over his shoulder at the woman thats right isnt it joanne virtue nodded avoiding salmons glare you having trouble wi your bog noel asked mcllhenney isnt it flushing properly he stepped across the small bathroom and peered into the toilet bowl with an expression of distaste theres nothing i dislike more than skidmarks in the lavvie he said youre a dirty wee bastard arent you in every respect his eyes narrowed and he shook his head thats pretty pathetic chuckin talcum powder down it to freshen it up it is talcum powder isnt it oblivious of his covering towel as it unfastened and fell to the floor salmon spun round and grabbed the handle of the cistern but before he could twist it to flush mcllhenney seized his wrist in a grip like a vice let go he said in an even tone or ill break your fucking hand off the man whitefaced released the handle the sergeant spun him around and propelled him out of the bathroom and through to the bedroom get dressed friend we can hardly take you out like that noel salmon said mcguire i am arresting you on suspicion of being in possession of a controlled substance you do not have to say anything he administered the rest of the formal caution in a stiff formal tone speaking clearly and ensuring that he was word perfect in the form the law required reaching for his underwear the journalist looked up at him this is a fucking fitup he shouted almost in tears no mate the inspector replied its just your unlucky day thats all he turned to mcllhenney who was holding joanne virtue by the left arm gently but securely neil call fettes for a team of technicians well need to find out what that talc really is tell them to get a formal search warrant too wed better take the place apart just in case mr salmon has any other goodies hidden away the sergeant nodded very good sir he said with a grin ill ask for some uniforms to stand guard at the door till they get here that way we can take these two back to the shop quicker wouldnt do to keep mr martin waiting martin salmon bleated hes behind this what dae youse mean take us both back joanne virtue protested ahm an innocent bystander mcllhenney laughed out loud joanne he boomed you havent been fuckin innocent for about twentyfive years even before his appointment as head ofcid indeed from his days as bob skinners executive officer detective chief superintendent andy martin had come to know the edinburgh press corps well he had seen them amused he had seen them bored he had seen them at their most cynical and at their most constructive but in all that time he could not recall ever having seen them on the edge of their seats on his instruction alan royston had called a press briefing to announce an important development in the mcgrathcase sunday or not am or not the conference room was full as martin impassive sat down at the bluecovered table facing the cameras the room fell silent thank you ladies and gentlemen he began late yesterday evening at his home deputy chief constable bob skinner received a telephone call from a man the caller did not identify himself he said simply that he had the child and that he was alive then he ended the call our telecommunications experts have been unable to trace the phone from which the call was made so we have no way of identifying the caller or of knowing for sure whether the message was genuine however we are proceeding on the basis that the anonymous man was indeed the kidnapper if we take his statement at face value then mark mcgrath is alive as he paused a forest of hands shot up as always he took john hunter the senior journalist first andy did he say anything else asked the veteran he said that we would hear from him again thats all he made no ransom demand then martin shook his head none at all the call lasted seconds and thats all there was to it from the side of the room a woman brandishing a television microphone broke in did mr skinner take the call himself or was it ms masters the detective frowned at her but answered he took it himself and his recollection is quite clear a record was made there and then do you have any clue at all about where the call came from called a man from the back of the room not much im afraid we do know it didnt come from a mobile and we know that it wasnt international but other than that it could have been made from any telephone in the uk are you expecting a ransom demand eventually asked john hunter the head of cid raised his eyebrows its a possibility if the man had a reason other than money for abducting the child theres no indication of it dyou think youll find the wee boy alive andy hunter sounded weary as if he had been at too many briefings such as this we can only hope john we can only hope meantime every police force in the country is taking part in the search there are no available resources unused if this man has any compassion or any sense for that matter hell simply release mark if he doesnt hell be hunted down like a rabid animal he looked round the room ladies and gentlemen i dont think theres anything i can add so if youll excuse me the woman with the television mike raised her hand mr martin can you tell us if there are any developments on mr skinners situation the blond detective took a deep breath and clenched his teeth as you must know the chief constable issued a statement last night deprecating the conduct of the spotlight and saying that the dccs private life was his own business well she persisted do you or he have any response to the statement issued subsequently by several members of the police board saying that they intend to bring the matter up at the next meeting and to move that mr skinner be disciplined sorry lady said martin evenly and emphatically mr royston will deal with your questions from now on i have to be off i have business in another part of the building as he strode towards the door he caught the eye of john hunter and nodded so quickly and unobtrusively that noone else saw the old man rose and followed him from the room quickly before any other reporters emerged martin ushered him up the short flight of stairs which led to the command corridor i thought you might like to know old pal the detective said as the door clicked shut behind them weve got noel salmon in custody under investigation for corruption also when we lifted him the silly wee bugger had in his possession something which im sure that tests will prove to be cocaine hunter whistled what a shame eh whats the corruption about bob had another call last night on his unlisted phone number as well as the one from the kidnapper it was from noel salmon we want to know how he got the number specifically whether he bunged anyone to give it to him and we want to know whether he gave it to anyone else the old reporter was quick on the uptake jesus wept he whispered you dont think joanne virtue looked up as the door of the interview room opened in a corner stood a female officer in uniform staring fixedly at the wall opposite as detective chief superintendent martin entered with inspector mcguire following behind she stiffened and came to attention you can leave us constable said the head ofcid quietly the woman nodded and slipped out closing the door behind her hello jo the blond detective began with a smile dont take this personally but id hoped i wouldnt see you again the prostitute snorted as he sat down nobodys forcin yis taste see me mr martin she said in a heavy glasgow accent still hard at the edges despite her years in edinburgh theres nothin ah can tell yis about that fella lets just see about that when did you meet him last night in a boozer off constitution street youd never met him before she shook her head firmly okay said martin believing her he had known the big blonde whore since he was a beat constable and had a policemans grudging respect for her as a basically honest working woman what was he doing when you bumped into him he asked waving his wad around ah got talkin taste him and he waved some of it in ma direction didnt you think it was a bit risky going to his place asked mcguire naw nae danger ahve been on the game long enough taste ken the dodgy ones wee whits his names hermless the inspector looked her in the eye did you do any coke she glanced from mcguire to martin dont be daft she said ahm a tart no a dope fiend did you see salmon using asked the chief superintendent joanne nodded aye we were hardly in the door before he got out his wee poke and cut himself a line she snorted just as well ah didnae fancy ony the stingy wee bastard never even offered mcguire leaned across the table did he tell you anything about himself did he no just he said he wis a reporter wi a big international magazine anything else anything about his work she looked at the detectives a little cautiously aye she said at last he kept goin on about this big story he was workin on he said it was about your boss mr skinner and that once it was all out hed be out of a job and more give me that exactly joanne said martin the actual words he used thats whit he said mr martin hell be out of a job and more and he smiled when he said it real nasty like usually ah dont chat taste the punters not at all ahm there for copulation no conversation but even so ah asked him what he meant he wouldnae tell me though buy my paper for the next couple of weeks and find out that wis all hed say did he let slip anything else the big easy leaned back in her chair knitting her brows he did say that once it was all done his source would be very happy his source no name she shook her head naw and he only said it the once when did he say all this once we got back taste his place did he say anything in the pub no much how did you meet him joanne grinned he came over taste me and started chattin me up he thinks hes gods gift even though he wis at the end o the queue when the looks were handed out i let him go on for a bit then ah told him that ah took neither bullshit nor barclaycard and spelled things out for him martin looked at her i thought you only worked the saunas jo she laughed a short hard laugh aye but saturdays ma night off what dye think ah do in ma spare time orifuckm garni the chief superintendent grunted nothing you do would surprise me miss virtue did salmon do or say anything in the pub just before we left he went off taste make a phone call but thats all dyou know how many calls he made asked mcguire just the one i could see him from where ah was standing martin nodded and leaned back okay jo nearly finished theres just one other thing when mario banged the door what happened the woman frowned again ransacking her memory well he jumped off me for a start and switched off the radio then he grabbed his notebook its one of those filofax things he took something from it real quick like after that he picked up what was left of the coke and dived intae the bog and thats all everything she said honest the chief superintendent leaned back from the table aye jo i know you are okay you can go well let you know if we want a formal statement he pressed a buzzer on the wall meanwhile the wpc outside will see you out dyou want a lift back to leith she drew him a frosty look thei going hame in a polis car thatll be the day she stood up picked up her red plastic handbag smoothed her dress and strode from the room well muttered martin as the door closed behind her that was interesting he looked round at mcguire you sure there was no scrap of paper floating in the bog when neil looked at it ask him sir but you know big mcllhenney he wouldnt have missed it if there had been mmm thats what i thought so mr salmon was even more interested in flushing that page from his notebook down the toilet than he was in disposing of his cocaine why dyou think it was so important mario eh maybe it was the name of his source sir that or a phone number its too damn bad that piece of evidence will be out at sea by now well just have to see if we can frighten it out of him no i wont tell you who my source is the first rule of reputable journalism is to protect the integrity of your informants salmon said andy martin shaking his head in disbelief you could barely spell reputable okay he went on lets try another tack last night you called mr skinner agreed the man shook his head dark stubble showing on his chin no i agree nothing have it your way chum retorted martin we know you did noel salmon scowled whats the point of all this anyway ive been here for nearly four hours already waiting for you lot i want to go home the point said the head of cid pausing and looking hard across the table the point is that mr skinners number like all his telephone numbers like mine like inspector mcguires is ex directory we dont like the thought of people especially people like you having open access to them and we want to know who gave dcc skinners to you he glanced at the tape recorder at the side of the table its red record light shining in the dim interview room now i ask you formally how did you come by mr skinners unlisted number at his gullane address salmon looked up at him from behind furrowed brows i cant remember oh come onyou have the deputy chief constables exdirectory number in your possession and you cant remember how you got it who gave it to you i cant remember we dont believe you mr salmon tough that could be said martin quietly lets get this straight you recall very clearly who gave you that number but you dont intend to tell us thats the truth of it isnt it have it your way we will did you pay someone to give it to you no the dcs paused think carefully about that answer if we find out later that you did itll go hard for you salmon paled slightly wringing his hands together look i didnt pay anyone for the number okay it was given to me by the same person who gave you the information on mr skinner on which your story in the spotlight is based the little reporter opened his mouth to speak then clamped it shut mr salmon refuses to answer said martin in an aside to the tape he glanced at mcguire but lets make the assumption that the sources are one and the same i ask you again who was your informant salmon stared down at the table nothing to say can i go now no sir you may not in case youve forgotten youre being held on suspicion of being in possession of a class a drug aw come on the man whined a wee bit of coke almost as soon as the words left his mouth he turned and stared at the tape martin smiled thats right noel he nodded a wee bit of cocaine but enough to land you in front of the sheriff how do you think your many friends in the media will handle your court appearance dyou think they wont report it because youre one of their number i dont think so the detective paused for a second and what about your new employers at the spotlight he continued ive been reading some back numbers know what your magazines official policy is that all drug traffickers should be executed and that all users should get five years do you think youll be working for them after youre convicted for possession do you think youll be working for anyone all i have to do is file a report to the fiscal and professionally youre a goner he paused again of course if you were to tell me who gave you bob skinners exdirectory number maybe id think twice about it for the first time a trace of desperation showed in noel salmons expression he chewed his lip for a second or two weighing up his options finally he sighed i dont know who my source is he said it was almost a moan sure you dont said martin easily its the truth the man protested i had a letter a few weeks back it was anonymous all it said was that if i kept an eye on skinner id find that he was straying from the straight and narrow i thought it was crap at first but just for fun and because i hate the big bastard followed him it didnt take me long to find out about the masters bird she was staying at his place in gullane most nights when they werent there they were at hers i kept an eye on them looking for some juicy pictures to back up the story eventually i got them juicy was hardly the word him in the buff and her bent over him like she was sucking his cock suddenly martin was grimfaced this anonymous tipster ever had anything from him before salmon shook his head not that i know of what did you do with the letter i binned it long ago so what was the piece of paper you were so keen to get rid of when i thumped on your door asked mcguire the mans eyebrows narrowed for a second ah the tart told you that did she he said that had nothing to do with skinner so what was it salmon shook his head nothing to say a gleam came into his eye developing quickly into a smile did the tart tell you it was her coke martin laughed short sharp and hard no she did not she said it was yours as we both know it was the little man spread his palms wide and i say that it was hers that she brought it into my flat and offered me some before we had it off i refused of course the head ofcid sighed and youll say that when mario thumped your door you panicked and flushed it down the bog salmon nodded thats right so charge me ill plead not guilty shell tell her story and ill tell mine is a jury going to convict me on the word of a prostitute the reporter was recovering his confidence rapidly and as martin knew with justification his scenario had a loud ring of credibility about it so said the dishevelled little man can i go now oh no replied the blond detective not so easily besides theres a tape i want you to hear what sort of tape in a minute lets go back to mr skinners phone number was that included in your anonymous note im not saying any more about that well see martin reached into the pocket of his jacket and took out a small tape player he pressed the play button a few seconds later salmon heard his own voice echoing from the speaker with a metallic tone the two policemen gazed at him as he sat back in his chair surprised and slightly shocked but think on this i havent finished with you yet not by a long way as the recorded conversation ended with a click mcguire reached across and switched off the tape how did salmon began work it out for yourself said martin did it never occur to you that it was a bit dangerous to call a senior police officer on an unlisted number and to make threats what dyou mean threats what else would you call that last comment of yours the policeman paused but wait theres more a few minutes after you phoned him mr skinner received another call on his unlisted number if youd been at our press briefing this morning instead of being banged up in here youd know about it already he switched on the tape once more have the child he is alive but at my disposition you will hear from me again salmon sat bolt upright in his seat at the sound of the smooth controlled voice his eyes widened was that the man who murdered leona mcgrath and kidnapped her son we have to believe that it is which throws up a pretty big coincidence two men in possession of a very confidential telephone number using it within minutes of each other martin leaned forward his forearms on the table suddenly although his expression was as affable as ever there was an air of menace about him now salmon he said in a clear formal voice do you know that man did you give him mr skinners number or did he give it to you the dishevelled reporter gulped fear showing in his eyes ive no idea who he is he protested no i didnt give him skinners number no i didnt get it from him how did you get it then no more bullshit friend you are in very dangerous waters and way out of your depth noel salmon slumped back in his seat it was in the second message he whispered what second message i got it last week it was anonymous like the other one andy martin fixed his green eyes on the man so how do you know that it didnt come from the man weve just heard on that tape he asked in an even tone his quarry looked down at the scratched tabletop i dont he muttered helplessly no you dont do you not if youre telling the truth you dont for if we believed that you were lying to us in any way wed have to look at the possibility that you were this mans accomplice wait a minute so prove yourself to us let us see the second letter i cant said salmon plaintively that was what i flushed down the toilet the detective whistled i see you are in deep shit arent you appropriate in the circumstances said mcguire beside him help yourself then offered martin tell us what was in the letter salmon turned his face away from them towards the wall of the windowless interview room his fingers twisting intertwined in an unconscious show of indecision come on noel said the head ofcid salmon turned back to face them nodding slightly as if he had reached a decision he looked up in the silence which filled the room and opened his mouth as if to speak there was a knock on the brownpainted door the handle turned the door swung open revealing the bulky frame ofneil mcllhenney a tall darkhaired man stood behind him what the hell is it snapped andy martin in a rare display of annoyance im sorry sir said the sergeant but i had no choice he nodded over his shoulder towards the man who followed him into the room this is mr alee linden hes a solicitor retained by the spotlight to represent salmon he demanded that i bring him in here the chief superintendent sighed heavily in his exasperation and nodded standing up as he did so and reaching out to switch off the tape recorder youre right neil you didnt have a choice thank you interview suspended he turned to the lawyer as mcllhenney withdrew i dont think weve met mr linden the man shook his head no im senior partner of herd and phillips in glasgow martin recognised the name of the biggest criminal law firm in scotland i was instructed by mr salmons employers immediately after they heard of his arrest on a radio news bulletin they are naturally concerned that he is being persecuted because of the story in todays issue of their magazine so am i i understand from your sergeant said linden brusquely that you are questioning my client over his possession of an unlisted telephone number that and his possession of a quantity of cocaine the solicitor frowned i wasnt aware of that youll do me the courtesy of allowing me a few minutes alone with my client of course give us a call when youre ready the two detectives stepped outside into the corridor where mcllhenney waited what do you think sir asked mcguire i think hell piss all over us said martin glumly fuck me neil if youd only stopped to tie your shoelace before you knocked on that door we had salmon by the stones right then the sergeant looked crestfallen christ boss but im sorry ach never you mind big fella you werent to know they stood silent in the corridor for almost ten minutes before the door opened and lindens face appeared gentlemen were ready for you now martin and mcguire reentered the room and resumed their seats across the table from salmon and his new adviser ill come straight to the point said the solicitor on the matter of the cocaine my client maintains that it was introduced to his premises without his knowledge by his ladyfriend on the matter of the telephone number it is not an offence simply to possess such information and you have no evidence whatsoever that it was obtained corruptly also my client denies any knowledge of or cooperation with the person who made the second telephone call to mr skinner he paused i have advised my client that he should answer no further questions obviously it is up to you to decide how to proceed on the matter of the cocaine but in the meantime i insist that mr salmon be released andy martin glanced at the journalist who sat relaxed beaming back at him all his arrogance and cockiness restored in his mind he weighed the options of the situation realising that with his solicitor by his side salmon would not budge from his story he knew that he had no practical choice okay mr linden he sighed at last you can have him a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal itll be for him to decide whether your client will be charged with possession in the meantime i suggest that you advise him to be very careful of the people with whom he associates and to be wary of any further anonymous information he might receive now please take him away so that we can have this place fumigated dont take it to heart andy you did well do get anything out of the wee shit i know alee linden hes an honest operator but very sharp if hed turned up earlier youd have got sod all martins face twisted into a grimace i know that bob but i was so nearly there he knows more than he told us plus hes got something else up his sleeve im sure and he was that close to spilling it when that bloody lawyer turned up when he made the arrest mario offered him the chance to call someone but he turned it down we reckoned he was wetting himself so badly about the cocaine he wasnt thinking too straight so how did linden know about it and where to find him asked skinner sheer bad luck salmons boss was trying to find him one of the people he called was john hunter old john laughed and told him where he was the spotlight guy called his scottish lawyer who happens to be linden damn it said the dcc and linden happened to be available and not on the golf course lifes a bugger at times here you dont think it was big joannes stuff do you not a chance it was salmons okay but hes right itll be his word against hers the fiscal wont proceed against him hes off every single hook and free to carry on persecuting you skinner reached across the wooden garden table and slapped his friend lightly on the shoulder fuck him andy hes not worth the bother lets concentrate on the main event not on my selfinflicted troubles but on finding poor wee stolen mark mcgrath and the evil bastard who took him you say salmon told you that my number was included in the second anonymous letter he received right did you believe him i mean he cant produce either letter he could be lying andy martin shook his head taking a bite from one of the thick ham sandwiches which skinner and pamela had prepared i believed him he said after devouring the mouthful the second phone call on your tape knocked the feet from under him he knew that it looked bad for him just at that moment hed have shopped his granny to get off the hook bob stood up from the table sandwich in hand and began to pace backwards and forwards across the slabbed area of his cottage garden so what have we got he began a mystery informant slipping salmon damaging information about me and giving him my phone number as well so that he can really wind me up by calling me at home to rub it in a second man with my unlisted number who calls me specifically not the press association or the telly or even our headquarters but me to tell me in person that he has mark he stopped his pacing and looked back towards the table first at pamela then at martin what are the chances do you think given the connection of the number that our killer is also noel salmons anonymous source pretty good id have thought said pamela could be said martin but in a sense thats irrelevant the best lead we have is the number itself if we can find out how our man came by it then were close to finding him skinner chuckled unless he broke into fettes to get it thats been done before he sat down once more no but youre right have a blitz on telecom and on our own telecommunications room dont ruffle any feathers but if theres anyone there who might be making a bit of extra cash by selling restricted numbers find out the head of cid looked at his chief as pam masters carried the empty plate back into the kitchen dont worry its already under way if theres a bad apple in there anywhere ill crush the last drop of juice out of him or her if it comes to that im sure you will andy im sure meanwhile there are people down in london who are listening to that tape as carefully as they can not to the salmon bit but to the kidnappers call analysing every fragment of sound on it seeing if theres anything in the background that they can locate what are the chances to be truthful not very good ive listened to my copy time and time again but i can only hear the guys voice mind you our london friends are working with the original and can amplify sound to levels that only a very sharpeared dog could pick up if theres anything there theyll find it he stopped and looked towards the cottage you did tellalex you were coming out here again this afternoon didnt you he asked suddenly andy nodded she said she had some work that needed doing on a sunday christ shes only just started with that law firm they cant have her working weekends already surely no i think it was housework bob raised his eyebrows and stared across the table alex housework he pointed upwards to avshaped formation of geese flying westwards what dyou think those are andy pigs he shook his head no my daughter just didnt want to come alex doesnt approve ofpam and me does she bob thats between you and her andy hesitated but if i were you id just let it lie for a while shes said shell support you and she will but shes very fond of sarah and she was gutted when you two separated she wont give you any more grief but itd be best if you let her come to terms with things in her own time the older man stared at the sky again back towards the geese as they wheeled round towards aberiady nature reserve their nesting ground aye youre right he murmured at last the last thing i need is to fall out with our kid as well suddenly he glanced back across the table and what about you andy what about you do you approve of my new relationship after all youve got a double interest personal and professional abruptly martin stood up from the table lets go for a walk he said skinner shook his head i dont want to leave pam not after leona and everything thats happened not with a madman on the loose his friend smiled dont worry you have very discreet protection the dcc looked at him surprised i didnt ask for well you bloody should have my operational decision end of story im still not sure there might be photographers out there fuck em if there are lets go for a walk yeah all right then with a last show of reluctance skinner rose also and took a few paces across to the open back door of the cottage pam he called andy and i are off for a stroll back in half an hour or so remember keep the door shut and let the machine answer the phone there were no photographers in sight outside the cottage as he closed the gate behind him and stepped between andys silver mondeo and his own bmw bob glanced across the goose green at its lower end near the back entrance to the golf inn hotel a single car was parked a nondescript grey escort with a figure in the front passenger seat seemingly reading a newspaper ive got another officer positioned round in the paddock said martin quietly catching the look between them they cover all approaches to the cottage yes thats enough what are their orders if they see someone approaching the house theyre to radio in and alert you rather than tackling the suspect and risking him getting away unless pams there alone of course then theyd go in what you mean your game is to let him come at me asked skinner a grim edge to his voice yes said his colleague with a quick grin to give us the best chance of catching him not that i think it will happen but if it does try to leave the guy in one piece please they strolled out of the green taking a narrow pathway beside the episcopalian church which led them through the golf club car park to the slopes of gullane hill they trudged in silence up the steep road towards its summit until at last they stood on a grassy knoll which overlooked the clubs three courses and all of the wide forth estuary the two friends sat side by side on a memorial chair gazing out to sea well andy said bob at last breathing only slightly heavily from the climb what about it what do you think of my indiscretion give it to me straight martin hunched his broad shoulders within his roomy sports jacket if you insist but first tell me again how it came about i dont mean the situation between you and sarah i know that arose out of your extreme views on questions of trust i mean the thing between you and pam bob leaned against the back of the bench seat like i said he began it just happened i was lonely so was pamela we were thrown together by the job and we were attracted to each other pams divorced im separated when i realised how it was heading i transferred her out of my office he paused for a second and into my bed how do you feel about each other fond covers it i think somehow pam seems to feel safe she doesnt ask or threaten dyou understand what i mean i think so a oncebitten twiceshy career woman i can see why youd feel safe with her mmm bob grunted so come on out with it andy drew in a deep breath of the fresh afternoon air looking out at the grey sea beneath the blue sky remember when i was younger not that long ago i was a serial shagger and no mistake you used to tell me i had had more women than cooked breakfasts and you were right i always had to have a girlfriend because that was part of me but as soon as i started to feel safe with them i ran a mile in the opposite direction safety in my view is no basis for a relationship mere contentment shouldnt be enough he glanced round towards skinner bob you were never like i used to be nor will you ever be you couldnt philander to save your life when you met sarah i was pleased for you after more than fifteen years of widowhood youd finally found a woman who was made for you and i was as jealous as hell all of a sudden my own life seemed hollow and i wanted so much to be like you as youll remember that led me into one disastrous situation before i realised that the only woman for me was right before my eyes i just hadnt noticed that shed grown up he laughed but sadly without humour so look at us now you and me my dreams come true ive become like you were im in love settled and happy for the rest of my life you youre stumbling about like a lost soul you talk about feeling safe my old friend well i think thats cobblers i think youre on the fucking rebound thats what and i should know it used to happen to me all the time i rebounded from one to the next so often that i felt like a human pinball machine you ask me what i think well here it is ive nothing against pam she seems like a nice woman and a couple of years back id probably have fancied her myself but i love sarah and i think its fucking tragic that you and she between you are in the process of tearing apart one of the best marriages ive ever seen i dont often presume to speak foralex bob but ill tell you that if you asked her she would tell you that she feels exactly the same way skinner sat motionless on the bench staring out across the wide firth over to the fife coast towards the string of onetime fishing villages transformed by fashion and affluence into holiday resorts he sat there for minutes before responding still without looking round youre my best pal andy truth be told one of the very few real friends ive ever had i value your opinion and im sorry that sarah and i have caused you distress youre right about our marriage it seemed perfect but remember that its possible to shatter even a diamond into smithereens however as for pam and me were sort of tied together now by the spotlight thing and by this killers possible focus on me i do care for her too make no mistake i couldnt just abandon her even if i wanted to i accept what you say about my being on the rebound sure i know that i let my cock do my thinking for me i suppose i just needed to be told and only you could do that but its happened and things may have gone beyond redemption now between me and sarah he looked around at last right that was your personal view how do you see it professionally martin frowned you sure you want to hear s aye chief superintendent i can take it fire away very good sir you used the word earlier indiscretion however you justify it and however properly you think you acted by transferring pamela out of your office before your slept with her i believe that youve laid yourself wide open to accusations of indiscretion at the very least i know youve said in the past that your officers sex lives are their business as long as its legal but youre no ordinary copper youre going to be accused of abuse of your position and maybe even sexual harassment by at least two female members of the police board that i could name and the chief is going to have some bloody job defending you skinner sighed you saying i should resign andy he asked sombrely like hell if the board asks for your resignation theyll have mine too not to mention the chiefs and those of half a dozen senior officers no youll ride it out your real worry should be pamela the big dcc frowned tell me why think about it is this relationship going to last for ever or will it come to an end any way you size it up she has no future in our force working in my office shes just about okay as the dccs girlfriend as long as you keep your private lives miles away from fettes but she cant stay there for ever how would she survive in a division who among her colleagues would trust her with a confidence suppose in the future you were to marry no pams position would be completely untenable martin paused on the other hand what will happen if it comes to an end how do you expect the girl to survive as the deputy chiefs castoff mistress jesus said skinner loudly enough to draw a frown from a golfer on the seventh tee thirty yards away i really have made a nonsense of things havent i so what do we do to protect her you know the options as well as i do said martin if you and pam decide to marry i expect shed want to resign if that doesnt happen if you carry on as you are informally shall we say and she wants to stay in the police we should offer her a transfer to another force central maybe so she could still live in edinburgh should you split up the same would apply there was a renewed silence at the other end of the bench lets not discuss the first option andy the dcc responded finally this time in a quiet voice put feelers out regarding the second once this spotlight business has blown over ill talk to pam about it in due course meantime id be grateful if youd give her a weeks leave as of now ill take her back to her place in leith tomorrow itll be easier for the watchers and more discreet do you want to take some time off yourself do i bloody hell the media would say id been sent on gardening leave anyway im going nowhere till weve nailed down the bastard who killed leona mcgrath and till weve got wee mark back safely skinner stood up looking down at his friend you know son he chuckled im generally reckoned to be quite a smart guy ace detective and all that but over the last few months of my life ive been made to realise that when it comes to women i just havent a bloody clue ruth mcconnell was at her desk when skinner arrived at am on monday for his first morning in the office since the spotlight story had broken good morning sir she said with exactly the same friendly smile to which he had become accustomed the dcc glanced at his watch jeez but youre early ruthie he said i thought it might be a good idea she replied standing up from her typists swivel chair elegant as ever the slimness of her long legs accentuated by her tight skirt and her high heels she picked up a pile of newspapers from her side table theres fresh coffee in your filter machine ill need it when i go through those come in and have some with me i should talk to you anyway have you seen any of the papers yet asked his secretary as they crossed the corridor to his office the big policeman shook his head no we left gullane before mine arrived his expression changed for a second as a thought struck him that reminds me would you call my newsagent please and cancel them till further notice hes in the book surnames hector he took off the jacket of his dark blue suit and draped it round the back of his chair while ruth poured coffee into two mugs so said skinner as she sat down facing him across the rosewood desk what do you think of my newfound notoriety i think its absolutely disgraceful sir the woman exploded her full lips pouting in her anger i think its offensive intrusive and damned unfair even if ive never said it to you im as sorry as everyone else in here about your marriage breaking up but thats your business to have your private life poked into like that well its intolerable i have to tolerate it ruthie no choice i can roar on about what im going to do to the soandso who put that wee swine salmon on my trail but i just have to bear it yes she said but its the double standards that get me i mean if it had been neil mcllhenney having an affair with sergeant masters he wouldnt have been all over the front page skinner surprised her with his sudden laughter oh yes he would he said because olive would have killed him stone dead his smile faded as quickly as it had appeared no youre right but thats the way it is sergeant and sergeant so what deputy chief and sergeant and the press eat it up im a daft bastard i should have known better he looked across the desk tell me something ruthie had you guessed that something was going on to his surprise she gasped as a mixture of shock and fear flooded her eyes sir you dont think i she began he threw up his hands instantly in horror which matched hers no no no he insisted not for one second have i thought that i trust you absolutely no i just want to know how stupid ive been alex guessed and so did mcllhenney i think did you she dropped her gaze from him her long hair fell over the shoulders of her blue business jacket as she nodded as soon as you transferred pamela out of here i knew exactly why you were doing it i remembered those late nights when you were chasing jackie charles that time you were snowed in i could tell from then that something was cooking and you never said anything of course not im your secretary not your chaperone the policeman grinned at her once more maybe thats what you should have been seriously though im sorry i kept you in the dark along with everyone else you have my confidence in every other area i should have trusted you with that too come to think of it if i had asked your advice i probably wouldnt be in this mess now ruth shook her head you have too much faith mr skinner ive been living with a separated man for the last month mines a doctor a country gp were the talk of the community too although on a smaller scale than you he looked at her in surprise ruth was in her late twenties and when it came to men she had always led him to believe that she sought safety in numbers i wondered why youd changed your contact number he murmured and i didnt tell you she countered which if you want to look at it that way puts us both at fault now are you ready for what the papers say the deputy chief constable nodded as much as i ever will be ive been through them already ive marked the pages you should look at the red numbers are the stories about you the blue ones are about the mcgrath investigation skinner picked up the paper on top of the pile as always in ruths arrangement it was the scotsman his heart sank as he looked at the lower part of the front page from which his likeness gazed out at him at once he knew what the tone of the coverage would be rather than recycle the spotlights sensational scoop the responsible scotsman had taken as its frontpage lead the announcement by five members of the police supervisory board that they intended to raise the deputy chief constables conduct at the next meeting of the board on the following wednesday the chair of the board had agreed to accept an emergency motion of censure for debate skinner scanned the rest of the story in careful terms clearly legally approved it sketched out the allegations about his private life naming pamela masters and carrying the statements released by his solicitor and the chief constables office it closed with a footnote directing readers to page sixteen he leafed through the pages until he arrived at the editorial column there were two leader articles the second was headed morality and the media the detective scanned it through then read it aloud if it is to be of true value to society and ultimately to protect its freedom the media as a collective entity must never be afraid or reluctant to comment critically on one of its own when condemnation is justified it is with that in mind that we deprecate the conduct of spotlight magazine in its invasion of the private life of deputy chief constable bob skinner and in particular the methods which it chose to adopt this newspaper disapproves thoroughly of the surreptitious photographing of honest citizens within their own homes that is why we will not reproduce the photographs which appeared yesterday although we were offered publication rights at a price spotlight is a publication without any perceptible moral standards driven only by the greed of its owners and restrained only by the civil law of defamation your publishers find it distasteful whenever this newspaper occupies the same shelves in the relatively few outlets where they are sold together nevertheless when questionable behaviour comes to light the fact that its exposers are beneath contempt themselves does not make it any less questionable mr skinner occupies a high profile position which demands exemplary standards of personal behaviour we will not pass judgement on the motion which will be put before the joint police board on wednesday all we will say is that the deputy chief constable despite his great service to the city is not above personal censure on this occasion if his professional and moral conduct is called into question then in the circumstances it seems that he cannot blame the spotlight however unprofessional and immoral a rag it might be he can blame only himself he folded the paper and laid it aside i cant disagree with much of that he said who could given that its so circumspectly written he gave a wry smile mind you for all its position on the high moral ground i cant help noticing that the scotsman still manages to put my private life on its own front page is all the rest of it like this he asked yes ruth replied there are no other leaders and noone else has used the photos but all the stories lead on the censure motion everyones used it even the telegraph let me guess on page three right first time skinner picked up the daily record and turned to page seven as ruths red number indicated five hunt top cop he read he waved the newspaper in the air indicating a row of headandshoulder photographs there they are the famous five unreconstructed lefties all of them every one of them keen to take any opportunity to put their own party on the spot his secretary looked across at him will you go to the meeting on wednesday ive thought about that ill go only if the chair guarantees me the right to a personal statement after the discussion but before the vote do you think she will it wont be her choice itll be a group decision my bet is that she wont be allowed to he rearranged the newspapers into a pile will you issue any more statements before the meeting skinner shook his head no pam might though shes been advised that she has a case for defamation against the spotlight since they suggested that she slept with me to get on in the force im telling her to sue he saw ruth wince you dont agree if she was sure theyd settle out of court she said yes id agree but if it goes to trial she could be hammered in the witness box i wouldnt fancy being crossexamined about my sex life theyll settle ruth sooner rather than later too that rags used to paying off libel suitors he slapped the papers on his desk in a typical gesture but enough of that he said suddenly grim again lets see what the press say v about the mcgrath case thats my priority and the thing that makes me most angry about the spotlight is the fact that they deflected me from it martin and mcllhenney had barely left skinners office before he picked up his secure telephone and dialled a london number this is skinner in scotland he said curtly to the man who answered his call with a simple yes the technical people are analysing a tape for me have them call me back with a progress report within ten minutes six minutes and four seconds later the direct line rang he picked it up quickly laying down the file he was reading skinner the voice on the other end of the line answered in a middle american drawl skinner knew that the special relationship which had sprung up between the new prime minister and the us president had led to promises of greater cooperation between the security services for which each was responsible he wondered if the caller was early evidence of their sincerity good morning sir said the woman my name is caroline farmer ive been working on your tape good to hear from you ms farmer been with us long three weeks sir on secondment from langleythe scot smiled his supposition answered whats your background he asked im a graduate of massachusetts institute of technology been with the company for four years im over on the new information exchange programme thats good how about my mystery voice then you got anything for me caroline farmer hesitated yeah weve got something she began ill start with the accent we have people here who reckon they can place the origin of uk citizens by the nature of their speech yes i know what are they saying they believe that your caller is scottish sir hah laughed skinner thats very good now carry on please scotlands quite a big place thats it sir said the american they cant do any better than that they say that the basic cast of the voice indicates that the caller is scottish but his speech is absolutely flat other than that listening to you sir i can detect a pronounced accent which i assume is regional edinburgh mostly lanarkshire actually the dcc grunted okay but distinctive none the less this guy is either disguising his voice or hes been subject to so many influences that he cannot be pinned down they did say though that he could have spent some time outside scotland or have a nonscottish parent thats something at least now how about the tape itself any joy from that caroline farmer paused once more im not sure whether youll find it joyful sir try me okay she said but first i have to ask you something when the call came in was there an open door or window in your home skinner frowned searching his memory yes he said at last it was a warm night we had the window open a little good now think again can you remember as you listened to the man whether you could hear anything else he closed his eyes and tried to place himself back in the bedroom his anger still burning over salmons taunting call undressing in the dark beginning the process of unwinding of relaxing of making love then the ringing of the phone and his fury erupting once more he stopped and concentrated on the moments before the interruption pamela kissing licking nibbling her way down his body geese he said suddenly through the window i could hear geese its no big deal for us part of the sound furniture you might say theres a wildlife sanctuary near my house in summer they go over in flocks at all hours okay said caroline farmer that was on the tape the sound of geese you couldnt hear it on the cassette we sent up but when we built it up it was there now to the interesting part the equipment that we use to tape telephone calls records each half of the conversation on separate tracks this is the sound we took from the background of your track listen she broke off and suddenly skinner heard in the earpiece the familiar squawking sound of a large flight of wild geese as he had heard it thousands of times as he had heard it less than fortyeight hours before there was a click as the player was switched off now the woman resumed hold on while i switch cassettes okay ready this is the background from the callers track another pause another click once more the sound of flying geese filled skinners ear he listened puzzled for a few seconds wrong tape he said at last youre playing my track again no sir said farmer emphatically i am not that is the background from the callers track well surely the sound from my phone must have fed through to his it did there was feedback sound on both tracks weve stripped that off you and this guy sir you could both hear the same flight of geese at the same volume at the same time which means that the call was made from very near your home skinner sat at his desk stunned theres no possibility of the equipment being faulty no sir there is not you live in a village i understand right that might make it easier for you we were able to match the sounds on each track exactly the recording levels on each were almost exactly the same i would say that you and your caller were no more than a quarter of a mile apart can i ask you sir in which direction do the geese fly westward by evening and night they fly westward good that tells me from the sound pattern that the caller was to the east of your home anything else asked skinner eagerly was there anything else on his track can you tell what type of telephone it was the american chuckled on the other end of the secure line we aint that good sir it was a touchtone telephone and the caller disabled your tracing service but you knew that already there were other sounds though faintly beneath the geese an automobile passed close by during the call travelling in a straight line at about forty miles per hour and there was music playing nearby further away there was the sound of a woman shouting angrily does any of that help skinner grunted it might listen agent or whatever i should call you thats great work i want copies of all these tapes sent up here for my people as soon as possible like today can you isolate that womans voice sure ill put that on a separate tape ill have everything with you by courier by midafternoon meantime well keep on working we can take resolution up practically to the level of an individual goose you never know what else we might turn up vk detective chief superintendent martin was seated at his desk as skinner rapped on his door and burst into the room detective constable sammy pye with his back to the door looked over his shoulder and sprang to his feet im just getting young sammy started on that list you ordered sir said the head of cid good said skinner closing the door behind him and waving pye back to his seat but put it on hold for now our friends in the south have come up trumps we know where the caller was when he phoned me and youre not going to believe it the cheeky bastard was within a quarter of a mile of my bloody house martins eyebrows rose you what he gasped incredulously thats right the background noise gave him away from what ive been told my guess is that he called from the phone box outside the post office across the road from the pub however we cant be certain of that chief superintendent i want to know from british telecom the location of every telephone in gullane that was used at ten fifty last saturday night and i want every one of those subscribers checked out he paused i cant believe that the guy would actually hide mark in my home village but its the first lead weve had and it must be followed unless we turn up something from the telephone check i want a housebyhouse check of the whole place you can leave mine out but i want every other door in that village knocked what are we looking for were looking for a lucky break andy the head of cid grunted assent yes like the guy still being around it beggars belief though to think that he actually lives there sure i agree but he phoned from there its not beyond belief that he might be hiding out there remember there are still weekend cottages and holiday homes in gullane my own among them till recently at any rate do we know which they are a few through neighbourhood watch but not all not by any means quite a few are just left from one visit to the next some have private caretaking arrangements how do you want to play it what line should our officers take with the householders when they knock their doors these people are your neighbours after all skinner pondered the question for a while simple is best he said lets have them say that were extending our enquiries out from edinburgh ask each occupier if hes seen anything out of the ordinary in the area and ask those with substantial outbuildings and there are some youve seen them up the hill whether theyve checked them lately where a house is unoccupied see if the neighbours know anything about the owner martin nodded lets think carefully about all this he said weve got an advantage here our man cant know that were on to the fact that he called from gullane we want to keep that information secret for as long as we can fine in that case lets keep it literally to ourselves other than you me and our staffs the people doing the rounds can simply be told what weve just decided to tell the punters that the search is being widened theyll be all the more convincing if they dont know any different themselves youll need more legpower for all this so youd better mobilise brian mackie and maggie rose all of a sudden this investigation has spilled over into their area skinner nodded to himself as if in satisfaction how quickly can you get it done itll be done within fortyeight hours quicker if you can start today while thats happening theres something else we should do i want officers in all five pubs and hotel bars in gullane this evening checking on everyone who was out for a bevvy on saturday someone may have seen our man in the phone box and may be able to give us a description he paused well need a cover story for that too tell our troops that were looking for someone whos been using the box to make obscene phone calls christ he added grimly thats true in a way skinner turned to leave therell be another line of investigation to be followed up also he said but i cant do anything about that until a certain tape arrives from london he opened the door then stopped and spun round to face martin and pye again call box coins sammy get on to telecom and have them empty the cash from that phone box you never know maybe my caller left a thumbprint on a tenpence piece thatll help us put a name to his voice pamela frowned at him across the kitchen as she ladled soup into two shallow white bowls is this how its going to be you nipping home at lunchtime to check up on me she handed him a bowl and a plate of thickcut sandwiches and gestured him towards the door dont be daft he protested carrying his snack though to the big living area other topfloor flat and sitting on the couch which faced the bigwshaped window draped with white muslin now where once it had offered an uninterrupted view of the water ofleith as it coursed towards the sea im here because i want to be on top of that i had that news for you about the phone call unsmiling pam set about her lunch look she said finally how much longer do i have to stay here i feel like a hostage if im supposed to be on leave cant i at least go out yes said skinner if you take your escorts with you oh really this man wont come after me in shirtsleeves he shrugged his shoulders if theres only one chance in a hundred of that he said im still not going to take it whoever this guy is he certainly identifies with me maybe its purely because im a highprofile police figure that he can thumb his nose at but my publicised connection with wee mark mcgrath makes that unlikely against that background in the light of the spotlight story you have to be protected she looked at him as he devoured his last sandwich should i really be scared then she asked quietly when he was finished not while youre here with protection outside not while im here women and kids are this mans size she looked at him again sulkily but couldnt you protect me in the office after all im sure this leave im taking will come off my annual allowance dont try and tell me different i can see the spotlight headline now skinners girlfriend gets extra holidays its because of spotlight that we okay i thought youd be better away from the office for a few days what she sat bolt upright sulking seriously now i thought this was all about security but you mean you and andy decided id be better kept out of the way for a while to save embarrassment whose in that case mine or yours his eyebrows came together in a single heavy line im still there remember he growled oh so you are embarrassed no i didnt say that its you that im concerned about her expression softened yes she said i suppose you are but please dont make decisions about me without involving me even if you are my commanding officer she hesitated let me come back please if people point fingers at me itll be behind my back and i can take that i think lets do what weve done up to now travel to and from work separately and steer clear of each other in the office she slid across beside him on the couch and poked him in the ribs come on ill bet you need me too dont tell me that the head of cid isnt shorthanded just now it isnt right to keep me here when i could be out helping you catch the man who murdered mrs mcgrath and stole her son he laid his plate and bowl on the floor and turned towards her his hands gripping her upper arms gently okay he said smiling i give up you can come in tomorrow but either we go in together or you get a lift from the protection people deal deal she nodded slipping free of his grasp threw her arms around his neck and kissed him now she whispered since this is a oneoff occasion what say we take full advantage of it he disengaged himself still grinning one triumph per lunch hours enough for you he said i have to get back to the office theres a hot tape coming up from london meantime you can spend the afternoon deciding whether you intend to sue the spotlight for defaming your impeccable character sammy pye was waiting in the command corridor as skinner bounded up the stairs from the small entrance hallway the dcc knew at once that whatever news he had brought he would not be starting his afternoon with a smile whats the damage he asked the glum young detective its that phone box sir said pye heavily the cash compartment was emptied at half past nine this morning by the time i spoke to telecom the money was back at their regional office mixed up with the takings from about thirty other kiosks ive told them not to bank it till they hear from us skinner shook his head sam with that number of boxes even if we had enough technicians to dust all those coins wed be cross matching prints from now till christmas you tell telecom they can bank their cash let them concentrate on giving us that list of numbers in use last saturday night at eleven the young mans earnest face brightened ive got that already sir there were six phones used in gullane at that time as well as the call box he caught skinners expression and nodded yes sir bt confirmed that it was used at the time in question mr martin told me to give the list to superintendent mackie he went on quickly for him to check it out thats good thanks pye the young man nodded and made to leave but hesitated yes said skinner something bothering you the constable took a deep breath well sir couldnt we just check the subscribers and see who they are i mean most of the folk in gullane are he stopped sensing a chasm before him skinner smiled are old bufties you were going to say like me you mean well eh youre right of course ill probably know most of them no sam the main reason for checking every call is to prove beyond doubt that it was the phone box that was used pye nodded and headed off back to the cid suite to pass his message to bt skinner stepped into his secretarys office any deliveries he asked ruth nodded and picked up a tape cassette box from her desk waving it in the air ten minutes ago she said excellent said the dcc lets hear it full blast on her side table his secretary kept a radio cassette player which was used mainly for monitoring radio news bulletins she took the tape from its box inserted it in the slot and pressed play twisting the volume control to a high setting at first they heard only hissing but after thirty seconds or so the sound changed there was no background noise at all only a womans voice shouting but slurring her words insistent but thick as if with alcohol lemme go lemme go she called out then a mans voice not so loud flatter but sounding just as drunk fuckn bitch he said lemme go ya bassa another slurred shout then a sound a crack the noise possibly of palm meeting cheek the hissing resumed once more ruth pressed the stop button and rewound the tape theres a note with it she said handing skinner a folded sheet of paper he opened it and read this is what we were able to do the man s voice was a bonus i guess your caller used a phone box and that he had the door open skinner smiled guessing why he would choose to do that at such an hour on a saturday night the mikes on your public phones are very good the people you hear on the tape could have been up to twenty five yards away good luck caroline farmer he looked at ruth some bonuses from my saturday call he said it was made from the phone box near my cottage mmm she said you do have the nicest neighbours dont you skinner grinned at the waspish dryness of her humour aye he nodded and im going to find out who they are too have a copy made and give it to me ill send mcllhenney out to gullane to play it discreetly to the pub owners and bar staff in the village he should get a laugh from them at least and maybe a couple of names detective superintendent brian mackies expression was usually deadpan and so as the mcgrath investigation team filed into the conference room at the st leonards divisional police office at exactly am on tuesday morning andy martin was surprised to note that he looked a shade nervous he strolled up to the head of the table where mackie stood chin up thin man he whispered you should be pleased that the boss asked me to have you run the morning briefing and on your turf too sure said the newly promoted divisional cid commander but itd be easier if he wasnt here himself this is the first time ive done something like this outside special branch and that wasnt the same at all you know what the boss is like he cant stop himself from jumping in even when he isnt in the chair the head of cid grinned dont i bloody know it but dont worry ive asked him to be on his best behaviour mackie his shiny bald head adding to his cadaverous look looked unconvinced aye but even at that i really feel in the spotlight here considering who ive taken over from you put that right out of your mind with hindsight you should have been in this job before him anyway if you hadnt been so valuable in sb you probably would have been for the first time the slim detective looked reassured kind of you to say that andy true or not he paused and looked around the room as if searching for a face skinner making his way along the far side of the room caught his eye and nodded the boss is here but is your sergeant coming the superintendent murmured no way replied martin quietly hes let her come back to work this morning but im going to make sure that theyre never in the same room not with other officers around anyway mackie nodded good especially not with maggie rose shes good at studied disapproval is my secondincommand he looked up to see skinner reach detective chief inspector rose his executive assistant before pamela masters brief tenure in the post mornin mags said the dcc hows the new boss rose looked over her shoulder towards mackie strict but fair just about covers it sir she said with a faint smile if skinner noticed that it was less warm than usual he gave no sign bit like me you mean he reached out to shake the superintendents hand mornin brian christ he said suddenly look at the three of you all graduates from my private office a certain route to the top indeed skinner rarely said anything simply to make conversation but the words were out before he could stop them had he not known maggie rose so well he would never have noticed the slight change in her expression anyway he said quickly lets get on with it he nodded towards a chair at the side of the table brian ill sit over there and ill try to keep my mouth shut honest arrange the rest as you like mackie nodded and rapped the table okay ladies and gentlemen he called out if youll all take seats please he looked around the room in addition to skinner martin and rose by his side sammy pye and neil mcllhenney faced him across the table together with three other officers two men and a woman quickly the room came to order very good said the superintendent flanked in his seat by his deputy and by the head of cid this briefing has been called to review progress yesterday in our enquiries in gullane where a lead has developed in the mcgrath murder investigation he glanced round at martin of the officers involved in the investigation sir only the people in this room know the full story that mr skinners call on saturday was made from gullane briefly but comprehensively mackie related the developments since skinners unexpected telephone call and since the discovery of its point of origin first of all he said once everyone was up to date lets deal with the followup visits to the six telephone subscribers on that bt list sergeant reid you handled that the second female officer in the room nodded and sat straighter in her chair yes sir theyve all been checked out as far as possible how did you go about it asked martin discreetly sir as ordered mr mackie said that what we really wanted was to get a look at these people so i told every person i visited that i was investigating reports of nuisance phone calls in the area and was checking to see whether theyd had any just to make it convincing sir i called on all the homes around each of the names on my list have you excluded everyone asked skinner from the side mackie glanced at martin and raised an eyebrow slightly no sir one subscriber wasnt in however the folk next door told me that he was a seventyyearold widower whod gone off in a w a hurry on sunday to visit his sick grandson other than that though ive seen them all of the other five four were middleaged couples and the fifth was an old lady in a retirement community very good janice said mackie hurriedly taking back control of the meeting sergeant spring will you please report on the house byhouse check spring the older sergeant nodded were going as fast as we can sir some of the houses we know are a dead loss but like janice we have to be seen to be calling on everyone so its taking a while theres been nothing suspicious so far how about empty houses asked martin have you encountered any seven so far said spring five of them have no known local keyholder two have a keyholder known to us and the other is believed to have a local caretaker but the neighbours dont know who that is they keep themselves to themselves in gullane right enough sir all at once the sergeant gulped visibly and glanced across at skinner the dcc himself broke the ensuing silence what have you done about the empties john he asked had a good look round sir as far as we could there didnt seem to be anything out of the ordinary anywhere skinner nodded and leaned back in his seat mackie looked at the officer beside spring sergeant carney youve been doing the pubs any feedback some sir its a pity it was a saturday during the week the firemen from the training school would have been around and theyd have been going home around that time sober mostly and potentially good witnesses as it was we found a couple of guys who admitted they were passing the phone box just before eleven they were a bit shifty like so we pressed them one of them finally admitted that he had a piss in it on the way past and presumably phil there was noone else in it at the time said maggie rose with a grim disapproving smile not that he mentioned maam mackie clasped his hands together and leaned forward so thats it then is it phone subscribers clear nothing from the houseto house nothing from the pubs blanks all round he looked round the table from face to face in that case wed all best go back and get on with the housetohouse as quickly as possible he was almost in the act of rising when skinner leaned forward there is just one other thing superintendent he said martin mackie and rose looked at him their surprise undisguised mcllhenney has something to report go on neil the bulky sergeant shifted uncomfortably in his chair he looked along the table at mackie we had a tip sir he began that two people man and woman were near the phone box when the call was made the superintendent looked back stonefaced his special branch experience still fresh in his mind he knew better than to ask where the information had come from if skinners aide had not volunteered the fact on the bosss instruction i did some asking around im assured that theyre a couple called grayson michael and rose of carnoustie terrace in the village the dcc leaned forward again i know youre hard pressed with the housetohouse so i thought neil and i would check them out just to keep our hands in so to speak that all right with you brian of course boss said mackie managing to suppress his sigh watch this bend neil sergeant mcllhenney believed that if you were any good at the business of life you would learn something new every day for him tuesdays unexpected lesson was that bob skinner was a nervous passenger in a motor car all the way along the coast road the dcc had shifted uneasily in the passenger seat of the unmarked car which his personal assistant had drawn from the pool the dcc having reasoned that his own car was too well known in gullane not to be noticed if it was parked outside a strange house it was the first time that the sergeant had ever driven his commander now as mcllhenney took the lufihess corner at scarcely more than fifty miles an hour he pointed at the curve of the road and barked his warning no problem boss ive driven this road before you know of course you have neil sorry i just have this dislike of being driven thats all especially there its where my first wife was killed ah said mcllhenney understanding at once you should have said i just assumed that id be driving quite right grunted skinner its what personal assistants are for anyway you have to confront your dislikes every so often or they can become phobias as the police car swung round the righthand bend into gullane he began to give the sergeant a series of directions finally they turned a corner into carnoustie terrace mcllhenney crawling along the kerbside until he spotted number there we are boss he said cheerily ordeal over the two policeman stepped from the car into the warm sunshine of the summer day there were no more than two dozen hoses in carnoustie terrace linked as its name suggested in groups of six from the roughcast exterior skinners assistant guessed that they were councilbuilt although he guessed by the variety of window and door styles that most were now in private ownership number did not have new upvc windows its were wooden modern enough but matching only a few others in the street he held the rusty metal gate open for skinner and followed him into a short driveway the house was fronted by a dark green privet hedge in need of a trim and by weedy grass on either side of the path in need of cutting the bluepainted halfglazed front door was scratched and marked at the bottom as if it was kicked regularly no exactly houseproud sir muttered mcllhenney as he pressed the white plastic bellpush they saw the figure approach through the obscured glass seeming to shamble rather than walk the door opened slowly although the name had meant nothing to him when he had heard it first skinner recognised rose grayson at once part of the street furniture of the village a presence on his occasional visits to the local pubs she was a big woman aged anywhere between forty and fifty five feet eight and fat hipless with a thick waist despite the fine weather a nylon housecoat hung loosely round her shoulders covering a dirty pink sweater and a crumpled grey dress on her feet were carpet slippers trimmed with greypink artificial fur a cigarette hung loosely between the first two fingers of her right hand at once skinner formed a mental picture of her husband michael skinny badly suited with a shock of greasy dark hair and the permanent scowl of an evil disposition the graysons were a couple whom the rest of the village left to themselves rose grayson sighed as if the unannounced appearance at her door of two strange men in suits was not an unusual occurrence aye she asked wearily with a permanently defeated tone to her voice police mrs grayson skinner announced wed like a word is your husband at work you must be fuckinjokin mister hes out the back yisd better come in she turned and led them into the house the embossed wallpaper in the hall had been painted over but a long time before dirty curls made their way up from the skirting board the living room looked like a war zone littered with discarded newspapers empty beer cans and full ash trays automatically the policemen breathed as gently as they could trying to deflect the smell of the woman and of her shabby surroundings haud on a minute she said ahll get mick she stepped across to the window white on the outside with what looked like a seagulls message and rapped on the glass outside the policemen saw a man in a deck chair as he started as if from sleep he was wearing the crumpled trousers of a dark suit braces and a bluestriped shirt he was barefoot rose grayson waved her husband into the house and turned towards her visitors in the light from the window they noticed for the first time a bruise beneath her left eye a few seconds later mick grayson came into the living room tripping over the frayed edge of the carpet and stumbling as he entered cursing softly whove you he began then looked at skinner for the first time here dont ah ken you what dyis want you might know me by sight mr grayson said the dcc but thats all my name is skinner and this is sergeant mcllhenney were police officers the mans chest puffed out aggressively ah havenae done anything he turned suddenly on his wife you havenae been nickin fae the coop again have ye ya bitch he said loudly he made towards her raising his right hand as if to hit her before he had taken more than two steps mcllhenney grabbed him by the wrist and swung him round grayson made the merest of gestures towards him with his free hand bunched into a fist but stopped abruptly as common sense or selfpreservation took over wise man said the sergeant giving the wrist a quick painful squeeze before releasing it look said skinner for once we dont want to talk to you about anything youve done were looking for help with an investigation mick grayson subdued looked at him thats aright then he said managing amazingly to sound condescending whit is it were told that you two were out on saturday night and that at around eleven you were having an argument just outside the village hall grayson looked blank were we he said his wife narrowed her eyes her hand going to the bruise on her cheek aye she muttered fiercely we were her husbands eyes dropped oh aye so we were what was the barney about mcllhenney asked rose grayson glowered that yin bought himself a pint and her voice soared with indignation a whisky wi the last of our money and never got anything for me honest taste god hes a miserable wee toerag wi a drink in him so he is come taste think of it hes a miserable wee toerag a the time aye said skinner but hes your miserable wee toerag isnt he he went on quickly right weve got you two at the foot of the hill between the post office and bissetts having a dingdong now think carefully on your way past and while this was going on did you see anyone in the phone box mick grayson shook his head naw said his wife think carefully i said this is important husband and wife reproved knitted their brows but eventually they shook their heads naw said mick ah honestly cannae remember the dcc sighed well did you see anyone at all in the area there was a pause rose looked at her spouse a new hesitant look in her eyes well she said finally more to mick than to the policemen there was yon man grayson nodded briefly but it was enough she looked back to skinner and mcllhenney we were havin a bamey like you said i shoved mick and he hut me just after that this man appeared door the hill welldressed like ah said taste him did you see that mister he nodded his head and just went on some fuckin gent you ah shouted after him he stopped at that and he said taste mick dont hit the lady then hed have walked on again but mick took a swing at him so what did he do this man urged skinner grimly unexpectedly rose grayson smiled he flattened the wee toerag didnt he only hit him the wance but he laid him as broad as he was long the smile broadened into a grin then what he turned away got intae a motor in the village hall car park and drove off back up the hill he just missed runnin mick over mores the pity she added sincerely skinner looked at mcllhenney and shook his head describe him he snapped she shrugged wee bit smaller than you slim like dark hair mick grayson shook his head naw he wisnae like that he was taller than yon man and he had fair hair come on mcllhenney barked make up your minds fair hair dark hair tall short which is it ahm right said rose naw yere no her husband insisted jesus christ shouted skinner exasperated were agreed then that he wasnt a baldheaded dwarf he looked at rose how about his car what colour was it light she answered but it was shining orange under the street light so a couldnae tell for sure what make she shrugged ah dinnae ken things like that the dcc sighed okay one last thing when the guy got to the top of the hill did he turn right or left she looked at him befuddled towards north berwick or towards aberlady he asked patient once again she paused then nodded north berwick he wis heading for north berwick she announced with a smile of satisfaction skinner nodded good something at least right thats as far as we can take it come on neil the policemen headed for the doorway until skinner turned he pointed at mick grayson you he said evenly if i ever hear that youve hit your wife again ill have you barred from every pub in east lothian he strode off leading mcllhenney out into the fresh air what a pair of disasters the sergeant exploded outside say that again skinner agreed still weve got something at least assuming it was our man he was heading out of gullane theres nowhere beyond the post office where he wouldnt stick out like a sore thumb does it take you any further skinner shook his head not really pam i had hoped that wed come up with a description of the guy but not a double dose thats worse than useless we can hardly announce that were looking for someone whos either tall and fair or stocky and dark or issue two photofits which one do you think is most likely to be accurate she asked hah take your pick on that one the graysons were both pissed as rats the only thing she was certain about was the direction he took away from the scene and does that help skinner knitted his brows maybe it does it tells me that if he does have the boy hidden it isnt in gullane itself as i said to big neil most of the holiday houses are to the west of the village the eastern part was built much later the houses are closer together on smaller plots and nearly all of them are occupied so what do you do next ive spoken to andy weve pretty well decided to tell the press tomorrow that were widening the search to east lothian we cant knock on every door in the county but there are quite a few empty properties in north berwick we can check them at least she looked at him doubtfully is there much chance of a result he smiled sadly next to bugger all he admitted but what else can we do andy set the ball rolling at his press briefing tomorrow he leaned back on the couch the remnants of his late supper still on a tray in his lap and sighed she leaned over and kissed him on the forehead cheer up love she said at least the investigations still doing something yes but to what purpose its been three days since that phone call three days since the guy said that wed hear from him again three days with that wee boy at this nutters mercy at my disposition he said it chills my blood to think what might be happening to him she stood up took the tray from him laid it on the floor and tugged at his arm bob enough she said you look knackered and you sound depressed its almost eleven lets go to bed even if its only to sleep he nodded yes okay he rose wearily taking her hand as she led him through to the bedroom the bedside lamp was still on as she slipped in beside him naked of course she said we dont have to sleep he reached across without a word and switched the light off they made love silently pamela inventive as always took the initiative allowing him time to settle his mind and drawing his attention towards her and yet even as he climaxed with his lover bucking and writhing astride him there was a part of his mind that was somewhere else she knew it too she was barely finished before she rolled away and lay with her back to him in the dark that was a new twist she said its usually the woman who fakes it he was moved by the hurt in her voice no pam i didnt honest it was good great like always i just wasnt really in the mood im sorry honey he put a hand on her hip and leaned over her kissing her neck she turned on to her back and looked up at him what is it then she asked second thoughts he shook his head nothing to do with you and me he promised i just cant get this man out of my mind hes singled me out to be contacted he killed leona and she was my friend he kidnapped her son the wee boy i rescued last year its as if hes speaking directly to me and theres a taunt in it he even came to my home village to call me its as if hes challenging me to guess where hes hiding the kid he stopped short and she could see his eyes gleaming in the light from the window can you imagine how angry that makes me and how frustrated pamela propped herself up on her elbows the edge of the duvet falling around her waist yes she said softly i can imagine im sorry im such a petulant bitch he laid a hand on the flat of her stomach rubbing it gently youre not he murmured not at all youre under pressure too with the spotlight article and those appalling photos with one thing and another its as if were drowning you and i she laid her hand on his half a second before it suddenly clenched tightening on her belly drowning he hissed suddenly when the telephone rang alex and andy were watching a video one of the batman series with interchangeable heroes and bigname villains was reaching its conclusion damn said skinners daughter freezing the frame and picking up the telephone to find her father on the other end pops really she said we were just getting to the good bit of the movie i meant she passed the phone to her fiance yes bob said martin whats the panic no panic but a sudden thought quite clearly this guy is thumbing his nose at me with a call to my private line from my home village this guy doesnt want to get caught but he does want to show us how clever resourceful and daring he is you agree with me yes ill go along with that good now try this one for size if this guy is an expert on me and knows about my connection with mark dont you think hes bound to know where i first encountered the child martin whistled you think he might be hiding him up on the moors where the plane went down i dont think i wonder lets postpone the press briefing tomorrow and take a look up there okay said the head ofcid shifting his position against the back of the sofa as alex stood up to go into the kitchen ill do that first thing ill put men on all the roads then get a helicopter to take a look at all the sheds and bothies scattered about up there it makes sense andy skinner stressed were pretty certain that he took the laddie out of the city yet he wouldnt have risked being too long on the road not with him in his car those moors arent much more than half an hour from the mcgrath house sure i agree well do it first thing now you get some sleep and let us finish our video he replaced the phone just as alex came back into the living room carrying two cans of diet coke what did pops want she asked andy grinned hes had a hunch you know what hes like when he gets one of them do i is it a good one could be they usually are alex handed him his coke and sat beside him once again he picked up the video control but she put her hand on his before he could press the play button andy she whispered do you think my dads losing it he looked at her surprised bob never hes still firing on all cylinders what made you ask that anyway she leaned her head on her shoulders oh i dont know she said sadly he just seems like such a lost soul just now andy touched her chin gently and tilted her face towards him love you can see how much hes missing sarah and jazz so can i so can the chief your dads the only one who doesnt realise it no she was suddenly indignant because hes shacked up with this pamela woman maybe she was there for him when he had his bustup with sarah she helps him ward off the loneliness maybe he does the same for her is she a golddigger dyou think does she have an eye for the main chance he shook his head after a few seconds thought no i wouldnt say so i dont think she sees herself as your next stepmother if thats what you mean do you like her andy he pondered her question again yes i reckon i do shes bright intelligent and she seems to care for bob a lot she had nothing to do with his marriage breakup remember maybe not but with her around theres no chance of it being mended andy sighed that my darling is something your dads got to figure out for himself always assuming that he wants to mend it that is and his judgement in sleeping with this woman what do you think of that honestly he looked her in the eye were all entitled to make mistakes love alex grunted lets hope the police board take that view tomorrow she said gloomily the press benches in edinburghs ornate victorian council chamber had never been more full for a meeting of the joint police board made up of elected members of the local authorities whose areas the force covered the chair of the board marciatopham a labour councillor from midlothian was regarded by sir james proud as a moderate and someone with whom he could work or as bob skinner often put it in private someone whom he could twist round his little finger today was different in the anteroom outside the chamber the chief constable saw that councillor topham looked tense and nervous as he had anticipated skinners request to address the meeting at the close of the discussion had been rejected after consultation by the chair with her senior colleagues like i said the dcc had growled shes had her orders a buzz went round the press gallery as the members and officials filed into the chamber and as they saw that bob skinner was not in attendance marcia topham frowned in their direction but her disapproval was ignored she called the meeting to order quickly pounding on the old mahogany desk with her gavel ladies gentlemen she said loudly to mask the tremor in her voice let us proceed she looked around the members and nodded to the chief constable who was seated in the well of the chamber alongside the boards solicitor item one she announced bob skinner grudged every minute of the time that he was forced occasionally to spend at board meetings it was an advisory body but under the previous administration it had become a vehicle for political speeches however on the basis of a few months evidence the change of government had seen little change in the nature of the meetings it still sounds the same jimmy skinner had grumbled different bloody axes being ground thats all the chief constable on the other hand appreciated the board he focused on its advisory status deciding arbitrarily which parts of its advice he would reject and which he would accept he understood too that the police service benefited from the lack of significant w political interference with its work and had no intention of rocking that particular boat indulge them bob he always advised his deputy let them have their say then let them go away home they dont have any weight so they cant throw it about today though the normally benign chief was in no mood to be conciliatory the listed items on the agenda were eliminated with unprecedented speed until fifty minutes after opening the meeting councillor topham announced we now come to other business i am advised of a motion by councillor agnes maley of edinburgh city council sir james looked around as councillor maley rose to her feet he knew her well a selfconfessed enemy of the police service she owed her position of power within her party to her ability to mobilise the enlarged group of women members in her support as she stood short squat and denimclad she was flanked by five other colleagues thank you chair she began but had gone no further before the chief constable thrust himself to his feet if you will excuse me councillor maley he boomed he glowered at the chair councillor topham i had assumed that you would instruct that this motion if it has to be heard at all should be stated without the press and public being present standing orders allow you to declare that sensitive items be discussed in private i have to insist that be the case here marcia topham stared at the silverhaired policeman this was not kind benign call me jimmy proud this was someone she had never seen before fierce bristling formidable and on battle bent for several seconds her mouth formed sounds but none emerged she was beaten to it by a shout from the left i protest chair the chief constables right out of order hes responsible to this meeting he doesnt run it sir james rounded on agnes maley as usual councillor youre mistaken when it comes to police matters i am not responsible to this board it advises me now i am advising it that it is not appropriate for the private business of a senior serving officer any serving officer for that matter to be discussed in public session he looked back towards councillor topham madam chair you may wish to consult your solicitor grateful for the escape route marcia topham nodded mr wanless she asked quickly whats your guidance the solicitor took a deep breath and looked up at her the chief constable is quite right you have the power to order this matter heard in private however you do not have an obligation in this case a murmur of satisfaction sped along the benches behind proud that said the solicitor went on his voice rising in emphasis i am bound to remind you that no form of privilege attaches to this body should anything be said in discussion which was held subsequently to be defamatory of mr skinner or detective sergeant masters then the court would undoubtedly find that defamation to have been aggravated by a decision by you to hold the debate in public this would be in addition to the personal responsibility for such defamation which would probably attach to you the decision is yours madam chair councillor tophams gaze settled on the lawyer as if she was trapped by the headlights of an oncoming car at last she glanced helplessly across towards councillor maley will the press and public please leave she said before her on the members benches and in the public gallery cries of protest rang out however with council attendants and two police constables acting as ushers the room was cleared relatively quickly very good said the chair as the door closed on the last journalist now councillor maley do you wish to proceed one moment more please prouds voice boomed out even more loudly before the lady begins i have something else to say for a moment councillor topham looked as if she would use her gavel to intervene but the chief froze her with a glare and a dismissive wave of his hand i want it recorded in the minutes of this meeting that i believe that it is absolutely disgraceful for this motion to be entertained it relates entirely to matters which are within mr skinners private life and which are no business of this board in any way i believe that the proposer and seconder are motivated by malice against the police in general which has been evident before at meetings of this board they have seized on the disgraceful publicity attaching to mr skinners private life as a means of damaging my service even if it means the further public humiliation of one of its finest officers the days in which personal relationships between serving police officers were forbidden are long gone as the proposer and seconder and their supporters know well indeed were i to propose their reintroduction they would be the first on their feet in protest he turned and looked at the benches behind him on a personal level rather than professionally i do not believe that by todays standards mr skinner and miss masters are wrongdoers by my own standards perhaps but the world is changing he stared hard at agnes maley i am prepared to bet you he said that among the members of this board there must be at least one who is living in what some might call sin with a person separated not yet divorced the councillors face flushed beetroot red sir james turned back to the chair i am no great bible scholar he said but i do remember well the story of the woman taken in adultery i will say just this before anyone casts the first stone at bob skinner they should remember that noone in this room is in a better position than me to know which of you is without sin and before this matter is put to a vote councillor maley and her friends would do well to bear that in mind now i will leave you to your discussions he picked up his papers and strode from the chamber ill andy martin had only one phobia heights he also possessed an inherent will to win which had made him a feared opponent on the rugby field and which would not allow him to be overcome by anything not even mortal terror he had tackled his secret enemy headon by joining a rock climbing club in his senior year at high school and had taken this further at university by joining the mountaineering club it had been hard all the way through but he had kept his jaw tight and his hands strong in a domestic climbing career which had taken in some of the finest climbs in the cuillins the beautiful mountains of the island of skye and in the spectacular craggy lake district yet a true phobia is never banished it is only overcome moment by moment and so as the police helicopter swept over the purple heather of the moorland martin in the copilots seat still felt a lurching in his stomach as he looked down and still fought to master the panic at the back of his brain okay john he said to the police pilot through his headset essential equipment given the booming noise within the cockpit from the engine behind them and the whirring of the rotors above thats the fifth sector on this map covered and no sign of any recent activity up here other than bloody sheep one more to go bank south please down towards longformacus the pilot nodded in confirmation and swung the craft round they were flying at a height of around three hundred feet high enough not to be easily identified from the ground low enough to allow martin to scan the area beneath with powerful widefield binoculars they flew on for ten minutes sweeping the sector in swathes east to west west to east as if they were mowing it from a great height theres a bothy down to the right martin called out at last drop us down a bit and lets take a closer look the pilot obeyed dropping the helicopter by around fifty feet and slowing their steady speed still further martin peered through the glasses the bothy a stonebuilt shelter was in poor repair at one corner its slate roof had collapsed there had once been glass in its single window but now its panes were smashed and its door hung by a single hinge all around the grass stood high and the narrow worn path which led to the door from the heathery pasture was overgrown and barely discernible the chief superintendent shook his head no he called into his microphone another dud theres been noone there for years by the look of it pick it up again the pilot flew on as ordered through one swathe then another until finally they were almost over the village of longformacus beyond which the character of the land changed they were to the west of the tiny community when martin spotted the caravan whats that doing there he asked himself it was a touring van still shiny and new yet it was well away from the roadway parked on the bank of a small fastflowing stream feeding into a small loch over which they had just flown there was no car alongside it but the grass around it was crushed and torn as if a vehicle had turned and reversed there recently and frequently where are we martin muttered again he looked at his map tracing their progress with a finger the loch was marked as the black water reservoir but there was no carriageway shown at all know what that road is down there the detective asked the pilot either im misreading the map or it doesnt exist thats the southern upland way sir the walkway that crosses the country from the solway firth to the east coast theres going on for a hundred miles of it you can manage a car along part of it just about lets see if we can find out who owns that caravan then we came over a farmhouse a couple of miles back put me down near there and ill see if anyone knows the pilot nodded and swung the helicopter around he found a flat spot in an empty field just over a quarter of a mile from the house and set it down martin jumped out gratefully and set off across the dry grass the gravelled road to the farmhouse ran beside the field turning through a highpillared gateway as the detective slid through a gap in the beech hedge which served as a boundary a man appeared at the head of the driveway whats up he asked cheerfully mechanical trouble he stood around six feet four and despite the warmth of the day he was dressed in country clothes twill trousers heavy shirt and tweed jacket but martin noted his hands before anything else they were he thought bigger than any he had ever seen he smiled at the man shaking his huge right mitt no he replied nothing like that im a policeman from edinburgh were looking for someone and we thought that he might just have a hideaway up here on the moors my names martin by the way detective chief superintendent robert carr said the ruddyfaced man i own this land thousand bloody acres of it much of it useless for anything but sheep does that extend up there he pointed westwards past the reservoir yes replied carr and a damn sight further theres a caravan up there beside the stream the farmer looked surprised is there still you know about it yes but id assumed that the fellow would have been gone by now what fellow robert carr turned towards his big grey stone farmhouse beckoning martin to follow chap rang the doorbell about a week ago said his name was mr gilbert he told me that he was planning to do some walks along the way and that he had a caravan as a base he asked me if he could park it somewhere out of the way he seemed like a decent chap so i said okay and gave him directions up the road told him he could set up by the stream and take fresh water from it just as long as he didnt put anything back in he offered me cash but i told him i wasnt that strapped have you seen him about much i havent seen him at all not since then id thought hed moved on martin looked up at him as they reached the farmhouses kitchen door can you describe him for me this mr gilbert carr ushered him indoors mary he bellowed tea for two lass as he led the policeman through to a comfortable study a small grey woman scurried in the opposite direction smiling and nodding housekeeper he said im a widower he paused gilberthe went on description right same height as you few years older maybe cleanshaven fair hair though not as fair as yours short and very well cut slim build but not skinny if you know what i mean wearing light cotton trousers and a red tee shirt with a badge saying reebok or something also wore sports sandals without socks what about his accent asked the policeman for the first time the farmer looked puzzled havent a bloody clue he said eventually you know i dont think he had one no you sure scottish english irish welsh carrs eyes narrowed as he tried to hear again the sound of the mans voice but eventually he shook his head sorry not welsh or irish thats all i can tell you with any certainty the study door opened and the housekeeper appeared with tea and biscuits on a tray she filled two cups and handed one to each of the men before leaving still without having uttered a word martin declined milk and sugar actually he disliked strong tea but was too polite to say so what about his car he asked never saw it his host retorted he left it at the foot of the road and walked up the drive i could just see the top of the caravan over the hedge the tall man beamed so could he be your quarry my mr gilbert no idea martin lied but i would like to talk to him he smiled across at carr can i use your phone to be on the safe side i think id better call in the cavalry skinner from the corridor leaned into the anteroom to sir james prouds office is the chief free he asked gerry his civilian secretary it was just after midday yes sir hes catching up with his correspondence thats all im sure hell be pleased to see you the young man looked efficient and crisp in an immaculately pressed shortsleeved white shirt that our officers should be half as smart the dcc mused as he opened the door and stepped into proud jimmys long office the chief constable looked up from the papers on his desk oh hello bob he said almost casually what can i do for you skinner grinned you can give me your version of whatever the hell you said to the police board this morning ive just had a call from roger mather the tory member from east lothian he was laughing so much i thought hed have a stroke was he remarked the chief blandly what was the outcome i left before the end no vote was taken apparently aggie maley did some ranting but didnt quite get round to proposing the motion proud jimmy nodded thats good he said thats good best that it ends that way best for you and best for the force aye laughed skinner but according to roger most of the ranting was about you christ jimmy did you really accuse maley of being shacked up with a married man certainly not not directly at any rate but what if i had its true and did you really threaten to rattle all the skeletons in their cupboards if they put the motion to a vote the old chief leaned back in his chair beaming now with undisguised pleasure too bloody right i did my son too bloody right i did if those bastards thought that they could have a go at you and id just sit there and allow it or worse if they thought they could just ignore me they rucking well know different now dont they skinner shook his head still laughing quietly you know chief when you drop the old avuncular act you drop it with a real vengeance iyiyy gradually though his expression grew more serious mind you he said youve made an enemy of aggie maley nothing new in that councillor maleys the enemy of everyone in a uniform unless its got a red star on it somewhere i can handle her and the troublemakers behind her hopefully ms topham will have a bit more control over them now that ive set her the example he slapped his palms flat on the desk youll find out for yourself at the next meeting im on holiday so youll have to be there skinner scowled maybe theyll have another go no danger of that said proud theyre paper tigers with a lighted match held at their tails they might shout the odds for a day or two but they wont cross me again or you no bob you dont have to worry about the councillors he paused and frowned ministers though thats another matter i dont know this new secretary of state at all whats he like skinner shrugged his shoulders i barely know him either he said ive met him twice to brief him on outstanding matters on each occasion he just listened barely said a word what do we know about him hes squeaky clean hes a doctor by profession he was a gp for five years till he landed his seat in the wilds of glasgow propolice or anti would you say the dcc thought the question over prohimself more than anything else he wants to climb the tree i reckon hed step on his own granny to reach a higher branch watch him then warned proud he swung round in his chair bob he ventured suddenly tentative about pamela would it make life easier for you if i gave her a job on my personal staff skinner looked at him surprised yes jimmy it would but it would make life more difficult for you so i would be against it the thoughts much appreciated he said but andy and i are considering pams career options and soon im going to have to let her in on our thinking this could be nothing but there is a chance that it could be a life ordeath situation detective chief superintendent martin looked round the group of officers gathered in farmer carrs driveway there were twenty of them all but one of them men and apart from the head of cid detective superintendent mackie and dci rose they were all in uniform most were carrying carbines the caravans in the middle of open country he said the choppers just done another overflight and theres still no sign of any car theres no obvious place close by where one could be hidden either theres an old barn a mile away but thats been checked now there is no hard evidence of a connection with the kidnapper however mr carrs description of the mans featureless accent is in line with the tape the boss received added to that is the fact that weve checked the number plate on the caravan its entirely fictitious because of all that im not taking any chances the road approach to the van is blocked off already now i want a dozen armed men deployed on vantage points around the area out of sight in the heather just in case our suspect is in there the best outcome here will be for the child to be in the caravan alive and alone i neednt say what the worst would be but the most difficult would be if the kidnapper and mark were both inside he looked around the officers once more so how do we approach the caravan the thing is bang in the middle of open country if we try to rush it and theyre both inside chances are well be seen before were halfway there there isnt any way we can sneak up on it safely either there are windows all around no said martin i propose that two people man and woman should walk right up to it and knock on the door as if theyre hikers asking for directions water to use the toilet anything he looked at mackie and rose brian mags its down to you i think my face has been all over the papers and the telly since this started i cant take the chance that hell recognise me you two okay with that mackie nodded rose replied of course sir ive got a better plan than just walking up to the door though fine so just make it work now youll both be armed if the man does open the door to you grab him down him and put a gun to his head until hes cuffed the superintendent looked up at martin what if he opens the door with a gun in his hand if he does that the blond detective replied then both of you stand aside ill be covering you myself if he shows a weapon then he goes down he waited for a few seconds then nodded to one of the uniformed officers inspector brown get the marksmen in position chief inspector fill me in on your plan of approach lets get this operation moving skinner picked up the nearest of the three telephones on his desk and punched in an extension number sergeant masters said the bright voice on the other end hello sergeant dcc skinner here word from the board meeting the motion was not pressed he heard her gasp with surprise thats great what happened the chief read his own version of the riot act and put the fear of god into the enemy ill tell you tonight how he did it so long for now bye he had barely hung up when there was a knock on the door okay he called it opened and alan royston came into the room he was holding a minicassette i thought you might like to hear this sir he began its a tape of the radio forth news bulletin at the top of the hour councillor maleys on it complaining about the chief bullying the chair of the police board as she puts it the dcc grinned from what i hear shes right about that does she say anything about me she says that in the circumstances she didnt press for a vote because she knew that the chief would ignore it anyway she winds up complaining about his generally threatening behaviour her words again the press officer paused and she says she still thinks that you should be censured he concluded what about pam her name wasnt mentioned how will the written media report her asked skinner i dont think that itll be too serious sir she isnt saying anything about you that she hasnt said before as for the chief hes like edinburghs favourite uncle noone can really see him as a bully and a tyrant the dcc laughed apart from the police board that is so alan are pam and i yesterdays news roystons mood changed in an instant i hope so sir but i hear from a source that salmons still hell of a pleased with himself hes giving everyone the impression that theres another exclusive coming out this weekend he hesitated im sorry sir but its my job to ask you this you cant think of any other potential skeleton can you skinner frowned what you mean like pam being pregnant royston reddened dont worry alan shes not badtaste joke sorry no salmon hasnt been near sarah nor has anyone else from the spotlight or i would know about it so it wont be anything involving her apart from my relationship with pam i cant think of anything else that salmon could possibly have on me that would interest his readers but look here you keep in touch with your sources anything you can find out would be welcome yes sir equally if anything does occur to you skinner glowered at him alan he said in a grinding tone that little bastard of a journalist is not going to make me into a goldfish there are aspects of my life that are going to stay private even from you maggie rose clung to brian mackie with her right arm as tightly as she had ever held her husband the difference was that she was wearing walking clothes and hopping on her left foot together they crested the rise above the caravan until they were in full sight of anyone who happened to be watching from inside they were approaching from the opposite direction to the farmhouse an injured rambler and her escort in search of help the tourer was long and white with a television aerial on top and it looked virtually new two windows faced them above the towbar and the gas bottle which sat upon it and on what would have been the offside on the road behind both curtains were partly drawn they looked at the van only occasionally as they approached but neither could see any signs of occupancy as they approached mackie called out hello anyone there he and rose watched carefully for signs of anyone moving inside but saw not as much as a tremor soon they reached the door which was accessed by three portable steps lean against the van love said the superintendent loud enough to be heard by anyone who might be inside ill knock he stood on the middle step and rapped the door firmly with the knuckles of his left hand his jacket was open giving him instant access to his pistol in its holster beneath his left armpit the silence from within the caravan was unbroken he knocked again finally he waved a hand in the air as a sign to the hidden watchers reached up and tried the handle of the door to his surprise and that of rose it swung open outwards at his touch instinctively both officers drew their guns im going in maggie said mackie and a moment later launched himself through the doorway into the living area inside the caravan was empty or so it seemed there was a toilet cubicle in one corner and a tall cupboard beside the door mackie opened both and looked inside then checked the sliding doors of the storage areas under the window seats okay maggie he called out at last its empty signal andy would you please outside rose waved both arms above her head in an allclear gesture twentyone men all but one in uniform stood up awkwardly from their concealment in the heather handing his carbine to the man closest to him martin bounded down the slope towards her and together they joined mackie in the suspect van martin looked round carefully its as clean as a whistle isnt it theres not a sign of occupancy mackie lifted the metal lid which covered the burners of the gas hob this has been cleaned he said you can still smell the flash so have all the other worksurfaces said rose within the last couple of days probably theres barely a sign of dust she opened the cubicle door once more and checked inside the chemical toilets been emptied too but theres bleach in the pan so it has been used radio communications are hopeless up here said martin stepping back to the door inspector he called outside send someone back to the farmhouse use mr carrs phone to order a team of technicians up here he turned back to mackie and rose this guys been very efficient but lets turn the place over quickly ourselves just in case hes missed something each taking one third of the caravan the three detectives began to search quickly and efficiently looking inside empty drawers behind curtains inside the oven under the movable squabs of the window seats for any scrap which might lead them eventually to the identity of the man who had brought the vehicle to its isolated parking place nothing this end called maggie rose from near the door after ten minutes the neither said mackie from the kitchen area no said martin nowt here either that i can see as he spoke he made to pick up the squab of the seat beneath the end window but it was secure he tugged either end to make sure that it was indeed immovable and was about to turn away when his eye was caught by a glint just where the upholstery nestled against the wall he leaned forward and forced a gap with his right index finger working away until he freed an object whats this then he muttered to himself it was in fact a piece of foil folded over double as he straightened it a slip of brown waxy paper fell out he picked it up and spread out the foil look at this he said to his colleagues transway its the cover off a rich and creamy yoghurt complete with bestbefore date five days hence he looked at the paper haifa mars bar label and he said almost triumphantly theres a bar code on it wheres the nearest transway supermarket asked mackie haddington said martin and rose in unison the dcs handed over both items to the superintendent holding each carefully by the corner i suggest he said that you take the wrapper down there and find out what they can tell you from that bar code i dont imagine itll identify the transaction but it should tell you whether they sold it and when the technicians can have a look at the yoghurt top if they can get a print off it ill bet you it was left by mark mcgrath maggie rose looked at him astutely dyou think mark planted those deliberately hoping that wed find them eventually god knows said martin hes a clever and resourceful wee boy no doubt but that might be expecting too much of him rose smiled as she remembered her first encounter with the missing child i only hope she said earnestly that we have a chance to ask him whats wrong pamela asked from the kitchen doorway she was leaning against the jamb wrapped in her short dressinggown looking anxiously at skinner he was reading the scotsman which he had picked up from the corner newsagents towards the end of his earlymorning run his teeshirt and shorts were plastered to him soaked with sweat hey bob she called as he failed to answer her remember me the woman you sleep with i live here now whats wrong he glanced over his shoulder at her and smiled apologetically ach its the bloody press again love they didnt like being kicked out of the police board meeting yesterday so theyre having another indirect pop at me what are they saying he folded the paper and threw it down on to the worksurface theyve given some space to aggie maleys beef about the way the meeting was run and her criticism of the topham woman in the process theyve rehashed all that shite from the weekend and said that my position remains difficult as they put it she crossed the kitchen and took his arm squeezing it dont let it get to you it was predictable that theyd carry something what page was it on five there you are then she said in an encouraging tone alan was right the storys running out of steam were not page one news any more he frowned i dont care to be page anything news thanks not in this way at least i know im sorry she took a deep breath look bob she ventured hesitantly would it be better for you if we were to call it a day no it would not he retorted sharply the frown turned into a scowl that would make me look like an even bigger shit i run into some embarrassing personal publicity and i react by giving you the elbow even id hate me if i did that we wouldnt need to make a public announcement about it pam argued i could get a transfer to another force and be gone from out of your hair skinner looked down at her i agree with you about a transfer to tell you the truth he said apologetically ive already put out feelers in fife and central i was choosing my moment to talk to you about it it would be much more how do i put it much more comfortable if we were with different forces and frankly its easier to transfer a sergeant than a deputy chief i understand that and i dont mind really make it central if you can though id prefer a more urban force than fife she paused but dont duck the main issue it isnt about how youd look its about whats best we always said that this arrangement had no strings and that it was based on mutual physical attraction rather than anything deeper she turned him round to face her would it be better for you then if i called it a day he smiled at her lightly for the first time that morning thats what you want is it a silence hung between them as pam gazed at him solemnly at last her eyes dropped to his chest no she whispered no its not i want you and i dont feel any guilt about it either then enough of such talk as for me im not going to do anything to satisfy the likes of aggie maley or noel salmon she frowned thats your main reason for staying with me not giving them satisfaction he growled at her playfully dont crossexamine me lady he said more skilled counsel than you have tried and failed i have many reasons for staying with you in a single movement he slid her robe from her shoulders leaving it lying at her feet let me show you a couple he picked her up and headed for the bedroom he was looking down at her lying waiting for him and peeling off his shorts when the phone rang for fucks sake he shouted why does this always happen when ive got a hardon he sat naked on the edge of the bed and picked up the receiver yes mr skinner david hewlett here in private office the policeman recognised the smooth tones of the secretary of state for scotlands private secretary youre early david he said its barely gone seven oclock which office are you at edinburgh we took the sleeper up from london the civil servant replied mr skinner the boss was wondering it you could come in to see him this morning to give him a progress report on the mcgrath murder investigation he has a special interest with mrs mcgrath being a fellow member of parliament of course said skinner ill look in before i go to fettes thats good when can we expect you he looked round at pam better give me a couple of hours im sorry i wasnt available yesterday said graham ross the manager of the haddington transway supermarket these quality training days are mandatory for all staff we really are in the most competitive retail environment these days anyway im here now what can i do for you i need any information that you can give me on a couple of items that i hope were bought from your store said maggie rose from her pocket she removed the foil yoghurt top and the portion of mars bar wrapper which they had found in the caravan each now encased in a clear plastic folder she passed them across mr ross small desk the balding manager peered at each through his spectacles he held up the yoghurt foil this is from a multipack rather than an individual item sale the only thing i can tell you is that from the use by date wherever it was sold it wasnt any earlier than tuesday of last week thats a start said dci rose how about the wrapper it has a bar code ross nodded thats more hopeful gimme a minute he stood up and strode from the office in fact he was gone for almost ten minutes by the time he returned dci rose was fidgeting impatiently in her chair but his smile soothed her annoyance at once yes he said even before sitting down it is one of ours it was sold at nine fortythree last wednesday morning eight days ago he handed over a long slip of paper this is a record of the transaction the policewoman looked at him how did the buyer pay she asked eagerly by cash i take it you were hoping it was by switch or credit card cant have everything i suppose she ran her eye down the slip tinned soup corned beef bread flora tinned meatballs tinned sweetcorn fourpack of yoghurt another tin of soup milk eggs bacon coffee sixpack of coke its as if the buyer was going camping isnt it the manager suggested oh he was said maggie rose forcefully he was the zeal that comes from newly acquired but longanticipated power still shone in the eyes of dr bruce anderson secretary of state for scotland he stood as skinner entered his office in st andrews house scotlands seat of national government and came towards him hand outstretched hello bob he welcomed him with a reassuring smile wonder if this was his bedside manner when he was in practiced skinner mused good morning secretary of state he replied shaking the proffered hand he had learned from bitter experience that it was best to keep his relationship with his ministerial boss on a formal footing politicians are a bit like rottweilers proud jimmy had warned him when he had accepted his appointment as security adviser to the scottish office just when you think they re domesticated they can turn round and bite your bloody hand off have a seat have a seat saidanderson looking fresh despite his night on the sleeper youll take coffee no thank you sir said the policeman sitting on a low chair facing the secretary of states desk he glanced round the woodpanelled room which he had come to know so well ive just had breakfast okay then lets get down to business im really asking you this as deputy chief in edinburgh not as my adviser what can you tell me about leona mcgraths murder its nearly a week now and still no arrest my parliamentary colleagues are badgering me about it incessantly especially the tories since she was their last mp in scotland so how are things going skinner frowned as well as can be expected id say the killer didnt leave us any forensic evidence at the scene none that weve been able to find so far at any rate and hes been very efficient in covering his tracks however he went on weve had some excellent technical help from an outside agency and that led to us tracing a caravan where the man held young mark after the abduction there was a serial number on the van it was stolen last week from a dealership near penicuik did it have number plates asked anderson phoney skinner replied weve put out a countrywide alert for any vehicle with that number but if the killer had one set of fictitious plates then hell have two and hell have swapped over by now how do you know that they were there skinner smiled grimly like the murder scene the place was wiped clean however we found two food labels stuffed down the back of a cushion one of them was foil and had the boys right thumbprint on it very clearly were checking even as i speak with the supermarket where we hope the items were bought but ill tell you now that it wont help us identify the killer if he was there hell have paid cash so said the secretary of state another dead end not quite now we have an accurate description of the man and a good witness who can draw a photofit for us also where its been surmise before thanks to a fingerprint on an item we now know for sure that the child was in that caravan alive the usual motive for childstealing is ransom whatever the purpose here i believe that there will be a further message from the man and i expect that it will be addressed to me why do you say that because of the lengths to which he went to contact me personally on saturday evening he could have taken his pick from dozens of working phone boxes all over east lothian or berwick yet he came to gullane to make his call from my very own doorstep whether it was risktaking for thrills or simply his way of rubbing my nose in it it was thought out deliberate and directed at me this is personal i tell you this man is a ghost from somewhere in my past only hes a very live one anderson frowned i take it that youre looking into all the people who might have grudges against you of course but without success so far the secretary of state nodded i see he swung round in his swivel chair and stared out of the window across towards calton hill bob he said at last without looking round dont you feel that it would be better if you were able to give one hundred per cent of your time to this investigation skinner thought of proud jimmy and felt a tightening around his wrist like the phantom jaws of a rottweiler no sir he replied evenly i do not i have an excellent head of cid in daytoday charge and reporting to me added to that if i am a linking factor in this crime the arguments are all against me being informed personally nevertheless anderson continued i might feel happier the detective felt his jaw tighten and his eyes narrow quite involuntarily if anderson had been looking at him he might have felt less assured secretary of state he said evenly please dont play games with me and most of all dont patronise me i dont honestly give a fuck about your happiness if youve got something to say then please as they say in american football lets skip the bullshit and go straight to the nut cutting anderson stiffened and swung round in his seat all the earlier bonhomie was gone very well i dont have to say i hope how much i admire you as a policeman mr skinner your record of success speaks for itself nor can i fault the advice youve given me since ive been in office however i would prefer it if my security adviser was with me on a fulltime basis i am honoured to accept your offer said skinner laconically and lying in his teeth the secretary of state reddened as he took the bait all right he snapped your private life and the way in which it has become public gives me a real difficulty my party has a high moral code and thats crap too retorted skinner im in on the mi briefings remember the security service knows of at least fifteen members of your government who are having extramarital affairs two of them are with people of the same sex and another of them is a junior minister in your own department abruptly the policeman stood up irked by having anderson look down on him in the low visitors seat lets deal with the truth shall we he said your party still has difficulty in scotland in keeping your leftwingers under control you cant afford to give them the slightest weapon to use against you aggie maley and her pals antipolice to begin with think that my extramarital relationship with pam gives them a bit of leverage shes painting me as some sort of sexual predator abusing his position within the force and within your own party circles shes accusing you of being prosleaze and antiwomen by keeping me in post being new in office you dont need that sort of flak so you want me to let you off the hook by offering my resignation thats the truth of it dr anderson isnt it the secretary of states face was redder than ever i wouldnt have put it quite so directly he spluttered well said skinner if youre ever going to fill that chair adequately youd better learn to express it as you will but im right anderson sighed if thats how you see it finally he looked directly at the other man will you let me have your resignation the detective laughed a short dry humourless laugh id rather stick hot needles in my eyes than give maley that satisfaction if you want me out youll have to fire me so be it said the politician wearily how would you like me to frame the announcement i dont give a damn if anything you say is actionable and not covered by privilege ill sue you other than that say what you like he smiled there is of course the matter of my contract youll be paid in full with a termination bonus of six months salary my announcement will say simply that youre leaving the job and that ive decided to make a fulltime appointment actually sir john govan will take up the post when he retires as chief constable of strathclyde in a few months mmm skinner growled as he rose to leave it was nice of jock to call and tell me he smiled at andersons expression of sudden shock dont worry secretary of state he didnt im afraid ive never been very good at sarcasm tell you one thing though no two first if i ever find out that councillor maley put the spotlight on to me ill fucking crucify her second i had decided not to apply for the strathclyde job now ive changed my mind if that bastard govan thinks he can fill my shoes i might as well go after his even though they might be too tight whats up boss said detective chief superintendent martin as he closed the door of skinners office behind him fucking politicians andy thats whats up never again will i have anything to do with them our secretary of states concerned about theaggie maley tendency rocking his boat so hes thrown me to them as a human sacrifice briefly succinctly but explosively the dcc described his meeting with dr bruce anderson i tell you mate he concluded from now on whenever i meet someone with the words right and honourable before his name ill know its odds on that both are a fucking lie his pointing finger stabbed the air and as for jock govan i never had him down as such a slippery bastard thats for sure he picked up his direct line and dialled in a number hello he barked is that sir john govans office good dcc bob skinner here edinburgh put me through please if hes in martin stared at him screwing up his eyes and making calm down signals with his hands but skinner turned away jock bob i hear congratulations are in order the younger man waited for the explosion but none came instead he saw an incredulous look spread across his friends face you did he heard him say he told you that skinner shook his head jock in the time that youve known me when have i ever walked away from anything there was a short silence exactly well its the same this time i refused to quit so anderson fired me the dcc held the earpiece of his phone a little away from his ear from its bowl martin heard the sound of shouting no jock said skinner dont do that please take the job mi must have an experienced hand up here someone with common sense just make sure that you use the power that youll have to protect yourself against this sort of rubbish good luck i mean it thanks ill be all right skinner hung up the phone and looked up at his secondin command would you believe it govan says that when anderson offered him the job yesterday he said that id asked to be relieved of my duties in view of my compromised position he says that he told anderson that hed only accept after he had made one more determined effort to persuade me to stay on half an hour ago anderson called him back and said that hed flung himself at my feet but that i was adamant about going martin looked serious you believe govan do you come on andy id take the word of a chief police officer over that of a politician ten times out of ten i tell you i wish i had something on anderson himself rather than his sidekick id bloody use it as for maley by god it was skinners friend not his junior officer who sat on the edge of his desk bob he said let it go why should i because with all this lashing about youre in danger of forgetting one thing bruce anderson didnt walk out on his wife weeks after she nursed him back to health you did aggie maley isnt sleeping with pam masters you are skinner glared at him ready to erupt once more sure andersons behaving badly okay maleys using your situation to score points but theyre only doing so because you made it possible noone else did bob only you i no not just me alex and i are begging you to forget all this shit and get on with your career before you blow it gradually the fire faded from bobs eyes as he looked across the desk gradually he seemed to sag to slump back in his chair youre right of course andy he muttered quietly i can get as angry as i like with those characters but im really only trying to shift the blame for my problems away from my own doorstep im their architect beginning to end not salmon maley or anyone else he smiled suddenly you know if one of my divisional commanders was in a pickle like this id send him on a couple of months sabbatical to sort himself out i dressed it up as irreconcilable differences when sarah and i separated but youre right i just walked out i exploded accused her of disloyalty and manipulation and didnt make the slightest effort to reconcile anything now its too late he glanced up suddenly and sharply so what does that make pam are the maley clique right is she a victim andy shook his head no she isnt youre clearly attracted to each other he stopped but if you are asking me he resumed abruptly id say you might be using her as a shield a barrier to prevent you facing up to how much youve lost in sarah and how much you miss her and jazz bob rose from his chair and went to the window he stood with his back to his friend looking out oblivious of the people coming and going below dyou think this is my midlife crisis boy he asked if it is replied andy i hope its your first and last and i hope that its over soon i can suggest one cure though some good oldfashioned police work arthur dorward called me sounding fair pleased with himself he says hes found a potential lead and he wants to come to see me about it hes due in my office in ten minutes want to sit in sure said skinner the dcc once more why not you head back along ill round up mcllhenney and join you directly oh and andy he added as martin headed for the door thanks for making me face up to myself at last aw the redhaired inspector was already in the head of cids office when skinner and his assistant arrived both men sat relaxed as if waiting for him as they had been morning arthur no dont get up said the dcc as he and mcllhenney took the other seats that martin had drawn up to his desk well he said the dcs said you had made a breakthrough lets hear about it very good sir said dorward sitting more upright in his chair the first thing i have to report is that the pathologists staff have completed their examination of mrs mcgraths body there was nothing there nothing at all that shouldnt have been the tissue under the fingernails was her own right enough and there were no stray hairs lodged anywhere certain asked skinner one thousand per cent sir so wheres your breakthrough the inspector fought to suppress a smile of selfsatisfaction well sir it started with a bit of luck really one of my team was talking to the cleaning woman and she mentioned that mrs mcgraths en suite bathroom had only been fitted a few months before with some of the insurance money she received after her husbands death yes thats right said the dcc i remember her mentioning that shed made some improvements to the house so where does that take us dorwards smile broke through irresistibly well sir that made me wonder like how many people would have used the shower or the handbasin since they were installed and like did the killer wash away the blood and stuff after the rape and murder so i got in a plumber to strip out the piping and examine the traps he paused skinner and martin each nodded approval there were some hairs trapped in the shower he continued all mrs mcgraths some head some pubic but all hers no doubt about it but in the sbend of the basin there we got lucky we found hair samples from six different people weve identified three of them the lady herself mark his nanny and the cleaner the other two we dont know about other than that theyre from different people with your permission he looked from martin to skinner then back again id like to start dna testing fair enough said skinner but before you get too excited remember that leona had been a widow for quite a few months there may have been other people in her bedroom apart from the killer martin shook his head not since the new plumbing was installed weve spoken to the close family members and to her friends none of them can remember having used that basin as for man friends we dont believe that were in the plural there we spoke to a close woman friend of the victim she said that the two of them had a drink together on the sunday evening before the murder at leonas place once theyd had a few it got down to girl talk and leona confessed to her that since her husbands death shed had sex just once did she mention a name asked the dcc no sir dorward answered only that it had happened at her place in her bedroom and just on the one occasion he smiled according to the pal she did say that the guy had a bigger cock than her husband but thats all she told her about him i dont think thats admissible in evidence said martin okay arthur run your dna tests the budget will stand them its a long shot but you never know your luck the cashier remembers him sir maggie rose told dcs martin youngish men shopping alone early in the morning tend to stand out in supermarkets so it seems the girls name is lesley and id say shes a reliable witness her description matches the one mr carr the farmer gave us what about accent lesley said she doesnt remember him saying anything other than thank you when she gave him his change anything strike her as odd about him martin heard rose laugh at the other end of the line i asked her that she said that she noticed that he didnt buy any cat food or any becks apparently guys his age shopping for themselves nearly always buy cat food and becks the dcs grunted thats the sort of sweeping generalisation that forms gender stereotypes high ranks teaching you diplomacy all right said rose a couple of years ago youd have said thats bloody women for you thats funny said martin with a smile i thought thats what i just said thanks mags see you he hung up and turned to skinner the man bought enough food for two days he said quickcook easydispose stuff corned beef meatballs yoghurt the stuff hed expect a kid to go for two days said the dcc so if he brought mark back to the caravan on friday and called me on saturday unless he went shopping again its a fair bet that he moved him again on sunday martin nodded one thing more skinner added he bought enough tinned food for two days but he bought it on wednesday morning which tells us suggests to us broke in the head ofcid that he didnt live in the caravan between wednesday and friday otherwise hed have bought more food aye so lets add to our file on this guy the possibility that he has an address in the edinburgh area lets try and read him this clever bastard who thinks hes thumbing his nose at me lets try and picture him planning this crime forget about motive for now hell tell us what that is when hes good and ready lets try to read his mind hes very meticulous is our man i think he must have watched leona for a long time he must have known her routine when shed be at home from parliament and so on he must have known that marks au pair skinner paused and smiled the wee chap gets very offended if you call her a nanny he was thirty when he was born that one he continued he must have watched for long enough to know that the girl always had friday afternoon off mark might have called her his aupair but shes from perth she went home to her parents as soon as leona got back from london on a friday and came back on sunday night he planned everything in the almost certain knowledge that the two of them mother and child would be together and unprotected he stole the caravan no big deal hed just cut the chain on the gate to the dealership yard and help himself then set it up on this man carrs land in the middle of fucking nowhere provisioned and ready for a twoday stopover once it was ready he went home and waited for his moment he paused his eyes distant so wheres home he asked himself aloud the kidnapper decided to take mark out of town somewhere near enough so that he wouldnt have to spend too long on the road getting there but far enough off the beaten track to be safe the moors are perfect and they were even close enough to my place to allow him to pull his telephone stunt with me but why did he go to all that bother answer because he wanted to keep the child to use him for some purpose yet to be revealed next question why not just take him home possible answer because he has a family or lives with a parent yet all my instincts are crying out to me that this man is a loner better answer because he knew that in the period immediately after the murder we would make edinburgh very hot indeed far too risky a place to hide the boy i think this guy lives in our city andy do you agree yes said the head ofcid i do i think thats more than likely but bob theres one thing thats still eating at me clearly this guy knows you and knows of your bond with mark hes targeting you somehow through this crime but to come to gullane to make that call why would he do that because hes crazy andy thats why and hes a gamester this guy is as mad as a rucking hatter and he thinks that he can play with the stupid policeman skinner went on lets consider something else he only planned to stay in the van for a couple of days why he wouldnt want to outstay his welcome with carr i guess martin offered right so where did he go when he left on sunday after he and mark had finished their food supply if i knew that said the younger man id go and get him if i knew where he lived said skinner so would i if he guessed that we only have the manpower to keep the real pressure on for a short period what was to keep him from just going home the chief superintendent looked at the deputy chief and simply nodded his silent agreement are you seeing the press today skinner asked whenever carr finishes the photofit right why dont you tell them that weve found the caravan on the moors that its empty and that we believe that the kidnapper and mark may be back in the city lets heat the place up again with a vengeance if he is here maybe well panic him into making a break for it martin looked suddenly doubtful isnt there a danger that if he panics hell kill the child the dcc looked him in the eye yes theres bound to be yet this man wants mark andy he needs him for something that risk has existed since the kidnap but he hasnt done it yet or im pretty sure youd have found the kid dead in the caravan look our man has been setting the agenda all along lets make some moves of our own and show him that weve got some brains after all okay said the head ofcid ill play it that way now since you seem to have recovered your powers of deduction and are back in the detecting game is there anything else that we could be doing that were not skinner smiled since you ask he said that caravan it had a phoney number plate didnt it yes i wonder why the guy didnt take it off hes blown his cover in a way by leaving it there sure but if hed removed it hed have drawn early attention to the van which he did not want to do anyway it doesnt matter since we dont know who he is our man will be using his legal number again the dcc paused but still the phoneys are a potential lead how about taking the city apart to see if you can find out who made them this is getting to be a habit said skinner hanging up the phone and turning to choose a tie from the halfdozen or so that he kept in pamelas wardrobe telephone calls from david hewlett two mornings on the trot she stopped in the act of fastening her skirt and looked across at him that was the secretary of states office dyou think hes changed his mind about she paused about giving me the bullet you were going to say no chance of that hes already made the announcement although he may have to find another replacement for me even after my chat with jock govan he wouldnt offer it to the chief would he asked pam bob laughed do not be daft my dear jimmys a career administrator never served in cid in his life hes a better politician than anderson but he knows bugger all about security anyway not even our secretary of state would be crude enough to offer my chief a job that id been fired from a refusal often offends as they say he wouldnt invite it no if hed asked my advice id have told him to recruit my pal haggerty from strathclyde willies a bit of a hairyback but hes a bloody good copper and he knows everything thats going on through in the west where youll find most of the organised crime and terrorism in scotland what did hewlett want then anderson wants to see me again apparently ten oclock this morning st andrews house he looked in the mirror to straighten his tie then picked up his jacket from the bedroom chair over which he had draped it the night before he was frowning as he followed pam through to the kitchen wonder what the hell it could be about he asked himself aloud didnt hewlett say he said that he didnt know and you believed him after what happened yesterday skinner nodded as he poured cornflakes into two bowls and reached into the fridge for milk davids one of the good guys he wouldnt tell me an outright lie he said i dont know what its about not i cant tell you and i take him at his word anyway he said i can usually tell when someones telling me porkies so what do you think it might be about could be one or two things a terrorist whisper from down south although id probably have heard about that too an attack of nerves over arrangements for his partys conference in glasgow this autumn although haggertys well in control there skinner shook his head i could guess all morning and still get it wrong anyway enough about me he spooned up some cornflakes ive got some news for you i spoke to scott rolland yesterday afternoon the chief in central he has a pregnant detective sergeant in his drugs squad based in falkirk she goes off on maternity leave in eight weeks and her jobs yours if you want it itd be a secondment at first but the womans told him that if everythings all right with the baby then shell be resigning what dyou think she stared at him why didnt you tell me this last night she asked i was too steamed up over anderson also i thought you looked tired didnt want to put you off your sleep she smiled i suppose i was probably something to do with the way theday began she hesitated it sounds good but do you think im right for drugs work you want to make a difference dont you yes then youre right for it look this job isnt about going after colombian cartels they dont stretch as far as falkirk there will be sharpend stuff but it is educational too policecommunity liaison schools visits that sort of activity she pushed her cornflakes to one side stepped up to him and slipped her arms round his waist what do you think i should do not what i think he said firmly what you want but itd make life easier longterm for us both yes but still the only factor is whether youd be happy in the job when do you have to tell mr rolland today if possible but i can stretch it to next week pam shook her head no tell him yes please thank you very much and thank you very much too he smiled de nada he said no she contradicted him its not nothing its a lot she looked up at him her eyes suddenly very serious bob i want to be legit as far as youre concerned as far as were concerned the companionship principle only holds good for a while like the girl whose job ill be taking in falkirk i want to have a baby too before its too late and i want to have it with you i know this might be breaking an unwritten rule between us but i have to say it anyway youre a smart guy you must have figured it out i love you he stared down at her taken your breath away copper have i she whispered he nodded just a bit ill tell you what tonight lets ditch our minders and lets go somewhere different a hotel maybe somewhere down in the borders peebles hydro if we can get in lets do that and lets talk about longterm and what it means agreed ive never been to peebles hydro okay be ready to leave at six by then ill have found out what the bloody hell my exboss wants skinner walked into the entrance hall of st andrews house at five minutes to ten it faced north and even in the height of summer always extended a cold welcome to visitors to the building he showed his official pass to the blackuniformed guard who gave him a brisk salute and a good morning the policeman knew that he should have surrendered the pass on the morning before but he had kept it out of devilment as a personal security check he stepped into one of the waiting lifts and rode it to the fifth floor david hewlett looking as serious as ever was in his office with his assistant and his clerk he was a thin man in his middle thirties with receding fair hair and a domelike forehead morning dave said skinner i thought id paid my last visit here any idea yet what the panic is hewlett shook his head i havent been told bob he replied sounding concerned and more than a little offended at having been left in the dark s of s came in this morning from bute house at eight fifteen a little later than usual he instructed me to call you and two other people and to ask you in particular to be here at ten sharp two others skinner repeated curious theyve been here since nine fifteen with a fourth person who are they hewletts natural frown deepened even more im not allowed to say bob im even disobeying orders by having this conversation s of s told me to say nothing to you when you arrived but to send you down to committee room one on the third floor fucking nonsense skinner growled exasperated time i sorted this lot out thanks dave i think ill go and paper the walls with your boss ive half a mind to charge him with wasting police time he left the small office and took the stairs down to the third floor he thought about knocking on the door of committee room one but with a muttered bugger it under his breath he opened the door and strode inside four people were waiting seated with their backs to the window facing the door and a single empty chair the detective scanned them from left to right councillor marciatopham the usual slightly overawed expression worn by the police board chair had been replaced by one of pure fright lord archibald ofalva the lord advocate scotlands senior law officer archie nelson qc dean of the faculty of advocates until his ennoblement and an old friend now sat staring at him impassively as he entered dr bruceanderson the secretary of state for scotland sat staring grimly at a folder on the desk before him sir james proud the chief constable sat ashenfaced more shocked than his deputy had ever seen him as he stared across the table skinner felt a mixture of apprehension and anger welling up within him as usual anger won what the bloody hell is this dr anderson he said not quite a shout but close to it you and i severed our links yesterday i think the secretary of state looked up and shook his head not quite he replied i still have certain powers and responsibilities over police officers of executive rank until now ive never had to use them i hoped it would never be necessary he stopped oh sit down bob please this is difficult enough for us all without you eyeing us up as if youre deciding who youre going to set about first skinner took hold of his temper and sat in the vacant chair right he retorted but i warn you now if this is about my private life the secretary of state shook his head lord archibald sighed marcia topham whimpered slightly proud jimmy moaned it isnt bob replied anderson i only wish it was at quarter to eight this morning an envelope was delivered to bute house my official residence in charlotte square it contained a serious allegation against you and documents pertaining to it as soon as i had read them i called the lord advocate skinners eyes narrowed what is this allegation he asked quietly it concerns corruption the secretary of state turned to lord archibald archie would you please the law officer nodded bob weve all discussed this prior to your arrival were shocked by the allegation which has been made and every one of us is loath to believe it but if there is anything in it we feel that it is only right to give you an opportunity to explain it at this stage consequently i have to ask you one question do you admit to having a personal account in the guernsey branch of the jzg bank the policeman stared at him across the table what the hell is the jzg bank its a small private bank based in liechtenstein with branches in guernsey and in the cayman islands now please give me a direct answer to my question skinner drew a hard deep snorting impatient breath no archie i do not have a personal account there or in any other channel island bank then we have a problem bob because the secretary of state has been given evidence that you do and that you have a significant amount of cash there thats preposterous skinner protested im reasonably well off but i dont have bank accounts that ive forgotten about i demand to be told the detail of the allegation made against me and to be shown the evidence thats been presented in due course deputy chief constable said bruce anderson suddenly formal in tone however in the light of the information which has been put before me i must first formally suspend you from duty i must advise you also that i shall be requesting senior officers from a force outside scotland to conduct an independent enquiry into these matters skinner felt the blood drain from his face secretary of state he interrupted did your information come from an anonymous source the minister looked across at him no the donor of the material identified himself would i be right in supposing that your source is noel salmon of the spotlightt yes youd be correct and youre putting a senior police officers career and reputation on the line on the word of that disreputable wee man are you lord archibald replied bob you know that we wouldnt do that im sorry but they have given us material in support of the allegation then let me see it please archie in due course said the lord advocate look i want to help you clear your name here we all do but the secretary of state can play no favourites two senior officers a deputy chief constable and a chief superintendent are already on their way here from manchester to begin enquiries into the allegations against you i think it would be best for you to go away and arrange legal representation once youve done that the visiting officers and i will meet with you and your solicitor and we will show you the material which we hold he stopped abruptly looking down at the table for a second or two the secretary of state has decided he continued and im afraid that i have to agree with him that while the investigation is in progress you should not take part in any police activity thats why you have to be formally suspended from duty you shouldnt enter fettes or any other police office for any purpose not related to your defence against the accusation furthermore i have to counsel you most strongly against conducting any personal investigation the visiting officers will have the brief of enquiring and reporting to me and to me alone if you approach anyone to whom they wish to speak you could make yourself vulnerable to accusations of intimidation and believe me bob thats the last thing you need archie said skinner evenly ill do what you say but if that wee shit salmon approaches me then you can be damn sure ill intimidate him salmon will be advised not to approach you said lord archibald reassuringly we cant order him of course sub judice rules dont apply at this stage as you know but we can warn him of the dangers of interfering with a police inquiry thats all very well said skinner but why should my hands be tied behind my back if you cant prevent salmon from approaching me how the hell can you justify forbidding me from making my own enquiries into accusations against me if thats what youre saying then id prefer you to charge me with corruption right now if the allegations are the subject of criminal proceedings then noone can publish till the case comes to court and my team will have the right of access to the prosecution witnesses christ bob spluttered the former archie nelson the last thing i want is to charge you with anything he paused as he considered what skinner had said i take your point though look lets have an understanding you stay away from witnesses personally but your lawyers can approach them deal the policeman surprised the lord advocate by smiling an open smile but with something devious lurking behind it youve got a deal mlud he said the first thing im going to do though is look for an injunction preventing the spotlight from publishing any of his crap the smile vanished as he turned towards the secretary of state as for you dranderson be aware that im going to seek advice on the possibility of raising an injunction against you and having my suspension lifted you can but try said the secretary of state before you do though bob lord archibald interrupted you should be aware that the court would require you to show good cause why it should injunctyou would be forced to present strong defences against the evidence in effect you would be putting yourself on trial without time to prepare and based on what ive seen this morning i have to tell you that i believe you would lose please my friend go and consult your lawyers quickly then bring them to crown office and ill meet you with the manchester people lets make it two thirty ill arrange for you to use the back door to avoid the media theyll be keeping an eye on the entrance as soon as this goes public skinner smiled again i appreciate the courtesy archie but bollocks to it ive never sneaked in the tradesmans entrance in my life and im damned if i will now the media have tons of shots of me on file a few more wont make any difference he nodded across the table thank you secretary of state the next time we meet ill accept your apology the big policeman stood up with the briefest of nods to his chief constable and walked out of the room outside in the corridor he stood at the lift doors for a few seconds then headed for the stairs he stood on the first landing and waited a few seconds later sir james proud puffing and blowing crashed through the double doors bob i skinner held up a hand jimmy before you say anything whatever it is that anderson has on me i swear to you that i know nothing about any guernsey money and that i have never in my life accepted as much as a bent penny you dont have to tell me that son come on lets walk side by side they descended the wide stairway archie will show you the papers later said proud but theyve got documentary evidence of an account in your name in this jzg bank opened a few months back in the middle of the jackie charles investigation how much one hundred thousand jesus but jimmy anyone could open an account in the name of robert skinner im not unique why should they think its me proud shook his head its not in anyones name its a numbered account but anderson said that there was potential evidence which shows that youre the knowing beneficiary its a highinterest long access job what bloody evidence can he have its all nonsense i dont know what he has anderson wouldnt tell me but i think its pretty serious i tried to get him to stop short of immediate suspension but he told me that in his view the supportive evidence made it essential skinner looked round at his friend as they emerged once more into the cold barren entrance hall i tell you one thing jimmy for our secretary of states sake hed better pray hes on solid ground because if hes playing politics with my reputation again hell find it giving way beneath his feet andy its me listen carefully i want you to find pam theres some pretty shocking news youre going to have to break to her where are you bob i know you cant be in the building to have come through on this line im in mitch laidlaws office with mitch and with alex now shut up and listen speedily skinner told martin of his summons to meet the secretary of state and of his encounter in committee room one anderson set it up as a real star chamber he said as he finished roping in archie nelson with jimmy and the topham woman as his official observers the bastard didnt have to play it like that he could have called me in and shown me his evidence informally given me the chance to knock it on the head before setting up this very public inquiry this is the second secretary of state whos crossed me up andy i tell you if i can ill see to it that he goes the same way as the other one sure bob but get yourself off the hook before you start to get even whys he called in officers from england hes got to have at least a dcc in charge i know all the chiefs and deputies in scotland so i guess he figured he had to be seen to be setting up an impartial inquiry martin snorted so hes saying in effect that he has no faith in the honesty of any chief officer in scotland thats one way of looking at it in fact its a point i should have made to the bugger myself tell you what have a word with royston and ask him when this thing goes public to try and work that line into the media coverage tomorrow i smell another scotsman leader coming on when will it go public any minute now i should think anderson wont hang about so please get hold of pam and tell her before she hears it on the radio then youd better call scott rolland for me tell him that pamll take the falkirk job before he changes his mind and withdraws the offer okay look bob i cant think of anything to say except good luck thanks mate but i dont need luck im innocent remember he hung up and turned to face mitchell laidlaw the chambers of curie anthony and jarvis were in one of edinburghs newest and grandest office developments with a fine outlook across the castle rock and up to princes street laidlaws room enjoyed the best of it it was furnished comfortably rather than opulently but left visitors in no doubt that they were in the nerve centre of one of the countrys leading professional firms so mitch said skinner i know your firm doesnt get involved in criminal work as a rule but nonetheless will you take me on of course we will bob nodded the ruddyfaced lawyer looking more rotund than ever in his highbacked leather chair from what youve told me this isnt really a criminal inquiry anyway its a sort of a halfbreed set up by the secretary of state rather than the lord advocate even if it does report to him i take it that anderson has the power to do that the policeman asked laidlaw smiled broadly across at alex who sat by the side of his twinpillared partners desk what do you think ms skinner he asked alex flushed slightly thought for a few moments then launched into her reply basically she said the secretary of state can do what he bloody well likes unless statute or the courts tell him differently from what we know of the way this investigations been set up id say that you could probably challenge its validity before just about any scottish judge and win the day but what would that achieve you would be seen as trying to frustrate investigation of the complaint against you and at the end of the day anderson would simply turn the papers over to the lord advocate and back off himself so any court victory would be pyrrhic it would result in you becoming the subject of a fullscale criminal investigation and possibly even liable to arrest at a fairly early stage thats what i think couldnt have put it better myself said laidlaw of course if you could establish malice against you by anderson there might be grounds for another form of action is there a chance of that skinner shook his head i cant say so honestly andersens just covering his arse playing to his backbenchers he snorted if theres any malice in evidence its borne by me towards him laidlaw spluttered lets not repeat that outside this room he swung round in his chair and leaned across the desk right bob ill handle this matter personally with an assistant the policeman nodded and pointed towards his daughter yes he said and shes sat there i promised archie that i wouldnt go near any potential witnesses myself but i want them to know who theyre dealing with pops alex intervened are you sure about this mitch laidlaw raised a hand if he isnt i am i dont see anything wrong with a bit of personal involvement in these circumstances also if this does require detailed investigation by us well something of your father must have rubbed off on you one other thing he said it may be helpful if we engage counsel at some point do you have any preferences bob skinner rocked his head back and stared for a while at the dappled ceiling as if racking his brains at last he looked back across the desk you might think her daft but of all the people currently available the best criminal silk who ever crossexamined me is dear old christabel innes dawson qc i often thought that if i was really in the shit theres noone at the bar id rather have on my side well i am now shes still listed as a practising member and she still has all her marbles laidlaw smiled ive never instructed her he said but i remember seeing her in action when i was a student a terrifying sight in full cry as i recall if you want her ill have a word with her clerk today to put down a warning marker but meanwhile lets the three of us have some lunch before we head up to the crown office to find out just what sort of battle the old lady is going to have to fight pamela sat openmouthed facing andy martin across his desk i cant believe it surely this must be a setup but how would the spotlight manage to fake evidence so well that it convinced the secretary of state beats me sarge said the chief superintendent noel salmon didnt do it all on his own thats for sure he could barely forge a betting slip far less set up a phoney account in an offshore bank a light came into his eyes as he said the words thats a thought isnt it i think its time we stopped bothering about the monkey and found out more about the organgrinder pamela do you want to help bob she looked at him with sudden outrage of course i do sorry that was a silly thing to say he acknowledged what i want you to do then is dig up companies house and get hold of the registration details for spotlight in the uk after that i want you to call a man in washington he owes bob a couple of favours its time we called one in he reached into his desk drawer and produced a small notebook he flipped through it until he found the page he was looking for then picked up a pen and scribbled on a scrap of paper when he was finished he replaced the notebook locked the drawer and pushed the paper across the desk to pamela thats a direct number to a desk on capitol hill once youve used it burn it the mans name is joe doherty and hes a top gun on the us national security council tell him that bob needs help and why then ask him if he can get for us detailed information on the ownership of spotlight and on how it operates internationally anything that he thinks is relevant ask him to call me personally as soon as he has something for us he glanced at his watch it was ten minutes past midday go on then and get started by the time youve checked the uk company listings joe should be in his office incidentally you dont need to say anything to bob about this he regards joe doherty as his own personal snout pamela stood up to leave looking shocked and slightly bewildered for all his personal loyalties to sarah andy felt a pang of sympathy for her hey he said standing up he put his hands on her shoulders and turned her to face him try not to worry too much this is nothing at worst this is just some evil sod playing silly buggers bobs been in far worse scrapes than this and come through them i often think that hes been in more trouble than even i know about there was one time he was shot in the leg he told alex and me that he had been careless and that his own pistol had gone off accidentally but that same night a man disappeared right off the face of the earth as far as i know at any rate i asked about him afterwards out of curiosity all i got was silence and sincere advice through the special branch network to mind my own business she looked up at him youre not saying that bob im not saying anything other than dont be too concerned about him hes like a cat with quite a few of his nine lives left you know what i like about you chief superintendent pamela said with a smile you only see one bob skinner and he can do no wrong martin grinned back i wouldnt go that far these contact lenses of mine have a green tint not rosecoloured now on you go ill come out with you i want to see young sammy he ushered her out of his office and towards her own desk in the corner of the cid command suite tell you something he said quietly as she took her seat i aint half going to miss the big fellas presence whoever set bob up has done leona mcgraths killer a favour unless of course theyre one and the same person he looked down at her the same thoughts been niggling away at me but lets not turn a long shot into a conclusion the boss would tell you that setting up the mcgrath crime was a fulltime job hed say that the guy wouldnt have had time to spare for him the head of cid switched his gaze to the far corner sammy he called come through and give me a report on the supplier of those false plates ive been waiting to do just that sir the young detective constable replied i think i might be on to something martin had been heading for his office he stopped in his tracks and turned back to face pye as he rose from his desk you do do you good work if you are lad come on lets hear it he strode back into his office with his junior at his heels its like this boss said the constable closing the door behind him i was plugging away like you told me to round the used car network and round our informants without getting as much as a w sniff about anyone supplying dodgy plates i thought i had run it dry then i had an idea remember those two guys we encountered in the jackie charles investigation whitehead and bailey the two salesmen who worked for him in the seafield showroom yes martin acknowledged i remember we interviewed them but they were on the up and up werent they thats right the inquiry concluded that the showroom was the only legitimate part of charless business portfolio and that they were exactly as they seemed honest car salesmen the chief superintendent nodded go on well sir i thought wasnt that a bit unlikely really everything else about charles was completely bent surely some of it must have washed over the car operation then i remembered that guy mccartney the heavy who was nicked in ainwick with the eh incriminating cargo in his boot he was one of charless team and the plates on that big white rover of his turned out to have been false too so i took a chance i went down to seafield to see bailey and whitehead you know that jackies showroom was rebuilt and that his dads managing it for him yes the old man was out when i called so i saw the two salesmen together without being bothered by him interfering or intimidating them by his presence i told them that we were wrapping up the prosecution case against ricky mccartney and that we had info that jackies workshop behind the showroom had put false plates on the rover i asked if they could confirm it but i said that we were pretty sure of our ground of course i sort of pointed out that it would mean the end for the business the finance companies would blacklist it that sort of thing so they bought it bailey swore blind and whitehead backed him up that nothing dodgy ever happened at seafield then he told me that on the morning of the incident that mccartney was nicked for dougie terry charless minder called him he asked him to pick up a parcel from a workshop just off dairy road and deliver it to big ricky at his home address bailey said that he didnt look in the parcel but that it was long and rectangular and was about the right weight for a couple of plates could he remember the address of the workshop asked martin eagerly yes sir he gave it to me he said the guy who handed over the package was called eddie sweeney i checked but it doesnt appear that hes known to us the head of cid smiled good work right enough sammy of course theres nothing to link our man on the moors with sweeney but baileys information gives us grounds to pull him in when we squeeze him you never know whatll pop out i should really turn it over to superintendent pringle its his divisional area but what the hell you did the legwork on this so lets you and i pay a call on mr sweeney ourselves as lord archibald had anticipated skinners way was blocked by a small group of photographers as he mitchell laidlaw and alex stepped out of their taxi in chambers street beside them stood the exultant figure of noel salmon look this way bob the spotlight journalist called a triumphant edge to his tone what the policeman called out with an easy contemptuous smile you mean short crosseyed and crumpled several of the photographers laughed sorry about this bob said one a bulky bearded figure whom skinner knew well raising his camera to focus on the group thats all right denis ive never objected to being photographed before so why should i now he looked to his left at laidlaw and alex just walk on he said and smile if you look into anyones lens how does it feel to have a crook for a father miss skinner alex stopped in her tracks and turned to face her heckler the spotlight reporter she stared at him with something closely related to the unblinking glare with which her father had transfixed a thousand criminals through his career are you just plain stupid or can you really stand the cost of a defamation action mr salmon she asked him edging closer to him as the little man backed off because when this is over what youve just said will give us grounds come on lass said her father thatll come in due course lets not keep archie waiting the trio strode off through a gateway and towards the entrance to the crown office from which scotlands criminal prosecution service is run the photographers watched them leave they were not allowed beyond the pavement since the building also housed edinburghs sheriff court from whose precincts they were always banned inside the recently built office laidlaw headed for the reception desk his approach was anticipated by a young woman in a smart grey suit hello she introduced herself im susan shaw the lord advocates assistant if youll follow me ill take you straight to lord archibald they walked in silence as she led them along a corridor which ended at a light oak door she knocked lightly upon it then held it open for skinner and his companions lord archibald crossed the room to met them small grey and twinkling his hand outstretched in greeting hello bob he said then smiled as he saw the other man im not too surprised to see you here mitch its an honour to be in your new chambers my lord laidlaw responded he and archie nelson had been contemporaries at university and had served their legal apprenticeships in the same office he turned to alex this is my assistant miss skinner the lordadvocates eyebrows rose in surprise as he looked from alex to her father and back again wed better watch our step then he said managing to sound not in the least patronising come lets sit down he turned towards a big conference table to the left of his desk on the far side sat two men unsmiling in dark suits neither rose as the others joined them these are the investigating officers announced lord archibald briskly deputy chief constable cheshire and detective chief superintendent ericson theyve just arrived the men nodded in turn as they were introduced cheshire was in his midfifties ericson ten years younger skinner had heard of the manchester dcc he had a reputation within his own force as a fierce disciplinarian and had handled a number of similar interconstabulary investigations in england for the home office he gave him an affable appraising look the englishman stared back with an expression which made the room suddenly colder skinner knew what the eyes said i dont like bent coppers mate and when i get finished you ii know how much i dont like them his own gaze hardened normally id be pleased to meet you gentlemen he began but in these circumstances i cant honestly say that i am however i recognise that you have a job to do and as long as you approach it fairly and impartially well cooperate in any way we can cheshire shook his bullet head his greying hair was cut so close that it almost seemed shaved and he wore the deep tan of an outdoorsman let me disabuse you of that notion mr skinner he barked presumption of innocence is all very well for an ordinary criminal investigation this isnt in investigating allegations against policemen i begin with a presumption of guilt this time itll be up to you to prove yourself innocent mitchell laidlaw stiffened and seemed about to intervene but lord archibald forestalled him with the slightest wave of a hand if thats the approach which the home office has allowed you to take in the past he said in his light lilting accent im afraid youll find that we do things differently in scotland i think it best if i begin by setting out for everyones benefit the basis on which this enquiry will proceed he leaned forward linking his short stubby fingers together and looking directly at cheshire this is in law and in fact my investigation you are here to look into the allegations which have been made against deputy chief constable skinner and to report to me on the weight of the evidence if your findings are that there is a criminal case to be answered the precognition of witnesses will be undertaken by the procurator fiscal of strathclyde and his deputies all members of the crown office staff you and mr ericson will not take formal statements from potential witnesses nor will you be permitted to interview mr skinner under caution in all of this i must insist that you adopt a neutral attitude you will make no suggestions to witnesses and you will conduct all your interviews together never individually you are not witch finders gentlemen you are simply my agents he switched his gaze to laidlaw do those ground rules seem fair to you perfectly with the proviso that we have access to any notes taken by mr cheshire and mr ericson in the course of interviews thats fine by me said the lord advocate which means its fine he reached for a thin green manilla folder which lay on the table and pulled it towards him right lets get down to business he looked at laidlaw again mitchell he said in a quiet and suddenly very formal tone this is what we have against your client he opened the folder and took out a single document thats it asked alex almost incredulous the lord advocate looked at her and nodded for the moment it is uncovering the rest or discounting it is what this investigation is about this is a covering letter from mr noel salmon of the newspaper spotlight it claims that he received information that a corrupt payment in the amount of was made to mr skinner with a view to securing for the donor a favourable outcome of a case under investigation the money it alleges was paid into a new account in the guernsey office of the private bank jzg the account is numbered uk and the deposit was received in cash from whom asked skinner sharply but his solicitor laid a hand on his sleeve as if to silence him patience bob said the lord advocate the sum was delivered by courier with a covering letter of instruction unsigned he looked across at laidlaw who nodded where is the evidence linking this payment to mr skinner he asked mr salmons letter advises me that he is informed that with the covering letter was a note saying that the beneficiary of the account was mr robert morgan skinner of edinburgh the note it is alleged identified you specifically by giving your birthplace and your date of birth further it is said that there was a separate sheet of paper with the note which bears a sample of mr skinners signature mitchell laidlaw rocked back in his chair looking up at the ceiling and took a breath so deep that for a second or two it seemed that the buttons on his waistcoat would pop i see he boomed at last as his explosive exhalation subsided but you are only speaking of allegations archie allegations if i may say so from a very disreputable source with a known grudge against my client if the secretary of state has suspended a senior police officer based purely on what youve told me im going straight to the court of session im going to rouse the lord president himself and have that suspension lifted skinner looked at his friend seeing him once more in a new light but lord archibald shook his head no no mitch he retorted quietly i wouldnt have let him do that and you know it salmons letter says that the manager of the bank refused to discuss the matter with him quite right too and beneficial not even the spotlight would dare run the story this sunday without corroboration from him he paused however the same manager was pragmatic and wise enough to agree to discuss it with me why should he do that with respect asked alex because im a member of the government and because jzg has a banking licence in the uk i didnt have to spell anything out to him once id convinced him who i was i called him this morning from the secretary of states office and established my bona fides simply by having him call me back through the scottish office switchboard his name is mr medine french influence i suppose he confirmed to me that account number uk does exist and that the substance of the allegation is correct hes awaiting the arrival of mr cheshire and mr ericson he doesnt normally go to the office on saturdays but hes making an exception tomorrow skinner leaned forward looking up the table towards the lord advocate weve got access to this man too archie yes in principle you have i cant order him to see you of course can we make life easier for him then what do you have in mind the policeman smiled well since this is an informal enquiry and since well have access to witnesses and interview notes how about letting one of my team accompany your men to guernsey to sit in on the interview cheshire snorted nice try skinner lord archibald frowned at first at the investigators comment then smiled as he began to think the request through as an observer you say not to conduct the interview in any way skinner shook his head no but with the right to ask supplementary questions at the end the law officer turned to the investigators apart from there being no precedent can you give me a good reason why i shouldnt allow this potential intimidation of witnesses sir said cheshire aggressively indeed id expect a witness to be intimidated by two senior police officers but hardly if i read mr skinners mind aright by a legal apprentice just out of university alex looked round at her father in surprise he grinned at her and nodded all right bob said archibald i agree but your representative must not interrupt mr cheshires questioning mind he turned to the men from manchester you will allow miss skinner to ask supplementaries though cheshire sat silent and grimfaced a flush showing even through the heavy tan it was ericson who broke the silence very good sir he said turning to alex leave me your office number miss skinner and ill advise you of our travel plans once theyre made even with the aid of a street map and even although the chief superintendents flat was less than a mile away martin and pye had trouble finding eddie sweeneys workshop it was tucked away out of sight at the end of one of the lanes which ran off dairy road behind a georgian town house a forgotten treasure which had been rescued by an office developer it was perhaps eight yards across and twenty deep a wooden structure with a corrugated iron roof bounded at the rear and on the right by the high red brick walls of the adjoining building before setting out from fettes martin had called the forces criminal intelligence unit and the national criminal records department to check on their target the second source had yielded a faxed photograph taken at the time of a conviction in aberdeen twelve years earlier for receiving a stolen motor car an offence which the sheriff had taken lightly enough to punish with only a years probation that had been completed impeccably and since then there had been no sign of a subsequent transgression the policemen drew up in martins mondeo beside big grey painted double gates which seemed to cover almost the full width of the workshop the lane was a dead end and so narrow that the chief superintendent had to position the car carefully to allow both pye and himself to open their doors the gates were secured by a heavy chain and padlock but inset to the right there was a smaller doorway blackpainted standing out from the surrounding grey and with a brass nameplate on which the name e sweeney motor engineer was etched martin banged on the grey gate mr sweeney police open up please there was no reply no sound from within he pushed the smaller door but itsyale was secure is there a back entrance to this place dyou think martin mused not unless its through the wall of the whisky bond next door pye pointed out maybe he closes early on a friday the chief superintendent sighed well he bloody shouldnt he said this week started with a locked door now its ending with another fuck this sammy im fed up being pissed about i think i feel an accidental stumble coming on abruptly he lifted his right foot and slammed the door with his heel there was a crack as the keeper of the yale gave under the force of the kick oh dear said the young detective constable that was nearly a nasty fall are you all right sir ive been worse thank god that door was there to stop me there were no windows in the workshop it was in darkness as they stepped inside the little light which spilled in from the small doorway lit up a red car jacked up at the front but beyond the gloom was too deep to make out anything the place smelled of oil of grease of old leather and of something else christ said pye dyou think sweeney just pisses in the corner when hes needing martin said nothing but peered around near the entrance until he found a light switch he threw it and after a few seconds a sequence of half a dozen neon tubes flickered into life as they did pye had reached the red car and could see beyond he gave a slight involuntary shout and started for a moment martin thought that the young man would turn and run but he held his ground sweeneys in after all sir he whispered quickly martin stepped up beside him and together they advanced into the furthest corner of the workshop clearly eddie sweeney had not been a big man in life his feet only just touched the ground as he sat in the green straightbacked wooden chair his wrists and ankles lashed securely to its legs with heavy black insulating tape but in death his eyes were huge they stood out in their sockets seemingly only a very short step from popping out altogether martin leaned over and stared into the grotesque purple dead face oh sammy he whispered were dealing with a very special mind here this mans an expert he believes in death as an art form ive only ever encountered one other like him pye crouched down beside his boss looking up at the dead head lolling sweeney and as he did he saw that the mans nose was swollen with white wisps of cotton wool protruding from the nostrils his cheeks were distorted too and something showed between the protruding teeth something dirty yellow and furred thats not his tongue is it sir martin chuckled blackly not even the most liverish tongue ever looked like that he stood up and leaned over the body yes theres a grazed lump on his head our mr sweeney was cracked on the head from behind then taped into his chair he shook his head what an imagination and what a way to go the killer packed his nose with cotton wool rammed a tennis ball into his mouth and stood back to watch while the poor sod suffocated pye shuddered a tennis ball he looked closer in the name of so it is game set and match to our man said the chief superintendent or so he thinks wed better take a look around for the sake of form but this is a very thorough person i dont think for a moment that well find anything to help us he stepped across to the far side of the workshop where a grey filing cabinet stood against the wall with its second drawer slid open on the floor beside it there was a big brown steel waste bin martin looked inside sammy forget it he called to his young colleague he got what he was after theres ash in here and you can bet that once it was the paperwork related to a set of plates supplied to customer unknown no questions asked are you sure that this was the man were after sir maybe sweeney was in bother with someone else the chunky martin shook his head forget it sam this was our guy all right as soon as he saw the photofit which we issued yesterday he knew that wed linked him to the caravan so he went back and covered his tracks end of story for mr sweeney he looked at the body once more it could be that hes even sending us a message in the way he chose to kill him all significant openings closed off fine let him be that cocky for thats how well catch him what do you mean sir i mean that when youre dealing with a criminal as arrogant and sure of himself as this one is all you have to do is wait while his ego and his feelings of infallibility get bigger and bigger until sure as eggs is eggs he makes the mistake which lets you nab him pam woke at seven fortyfive on saturday morning alone in the bedroom of the gullane cottage she was startled at first until she remembered that she and bob had decided to leave edinburgh for the weekend although not for peebles hydro they had spent a long silent friday evening in the cottage skinner was morose and largely silent with the telephone set on auto answer catching calls from a few sympathetic friends the only calls which he had returned had been from neil mcllhenney offering his sympathy and his total support and from andy martin telling him of sweeneys murder wont that put that farmer in danger pam had asked as he had explained what had happened mr carr i mean the man who did the photofit i shouldnt think so hell assume rightly that andy will put a guard on him so itd be too dangerous to go back to the farm to take him out anyway what would be the point the composite picture would be evidence in itself no his meeting with carr was very brief he must have spent much more time with sweeney or maybe sweeney even knew who he was he had shuddered quite violently startling her i hate people like him you know people who kill with flair not just with purpose murders murder i know always terrible but usually its in hot blood occasionally its a commercial transaction a fallingout among criminals who live by different rules from the rest of us i dont tolerate any of it but nothing turns my stomach like a man who can kill the way this fellow does hes so premeditated the way he just disposed of sweeney the way he killed leona leona was that necessarily premeditated couldnt that have been sexual in origin with him catching her naked bob had given her a long cool look shaking his head not the way i read it he didnt have to go upstairs he could have taken the boy and gone but he chose to go upstairs to find the mother to rape and kill her there was a message there too i think she had stared at him then astonished a message for whom but he had shaken his head and fallen silent once more now with the soft sunlight of early morning making patterns of the windowframes on the bedroom curtains she rose and putting on her robe as she went made her way through the living room to the kitchen there she found him sitting at the table in running shorts and teeshirt sweating heavily his shoulders hunched his head down caught off guard in an attitude which touched her heart she moved silently behind him and ran her fingers through his matted hair come on big boy she whispered soothingly its supposed to be darkest just before the dawn not after it he looked up at her over his shoulder im still waiting for dawn he muttered i feel like im at war on two fronts can you imagine how it feels to know that my name will be all over this mornings press ive been a police officer for almost a quarter of a century more than half my life in that time i like to think that ive never done a dishonourable thing yet here i am accused of abusing my position through my relationship with you sacked by anderson as unsuitable for my security post under investigation for corruption stigmatised suspended and effectively banned from acting personally in my defence at the same time theres a madman at large with a kidnapped child with whom i have a strong personal link and for whom somehow i feel a responsibility not just that hes targeting me in some way i dont yet understand i want to be out there chasing the guy i ought to be yet i cant by order ofdr bruce anderson i tell you girl there are a few ghosts in my life and its as if theyre all coming back to haunt me all of them at once he took the hand which she laid upon his shoulder and pressed it gently cant i help love she asked can i help ease the pain he stood up from the table and turned looking down at her no honey no you cant i suppose youre a third front another area of conflict in my life is that how you see me she asked quietly he shrugged his wide shoulders oh god i dont know maybe i should have chosen my words more carefully but our future is something else to be resolved and right now i just cant handle any of it he cried out in sudden exasperation when i was out there just now running along the top of the beach i remember thinking to myself why stop why turn back theres part of me that wants to chuck it all in and ive never felt like that before its scary pam its as if since the stabbing since my split with sarah since my discoveries about myra and now with all of this that im just not me any more theres a bloke inside me but hes a stranger know what else im finding out i dont even like him she pulled him to her and hugged him pressing her face against his chest running her fingers through his hair but he stood still and upright in her arms until finally his right hand came up and he stroked her cheek with his fingers im a real mess am i not he whispered as she looked up and saw his sad smile whod want a future with a crock like me as he spoke as he asked his despondent question a face came into his minds eye quite unexpectedly sarah looking at him and frowning with a mixture of surprise and disappointment he tried to will her away but her mental image remained and he knew at that moment he knew a thump from the hall broke the moment post lady he said matteroffact once more shes always early on a saturday he released himself from her hug and walked through to the hallway there were three items of mail lying on the doormat between the glass and outer doors picking them up he glanced at each in turn as he stepped back into the living room he recognised the handwriting on the first and tore it open as fast as he could it was a cheer up card from alex with a note inside which read dont worry pops ill keep an eye on that awful man cheshire anyway with me on your side how can you lose he smiled and positioned the cheery beryl cook card with its voluminous yet voluptuous ladies on the shelf above the gas fire then laid the second envelope a bill from scottish power unopened beside it as soon as he looked at the third item he felt an old familiar tremor in the pit of his stomach policemen more than any others have an instinct for danger which is triggered even in the most normal of surroundings deputy chief constable robert skinner he read his name aloud as he stared at the padded a jiffy bag the container of choice for many a small letter bomb he never received official mail at home but always in the office where it was xrayed as a matter of routine at that moment pam appeared in the doorway he beckoned her into the room wait here he ordered i need to check this out he stepped past her back into the kitchen reaching for the cutlery drawer from which he took a short but razor sharp fruit knife he sat down once more at the table and felt the package with both hands from all angles pressing gently and very carefully lest he should activate a trigger mechanism inside the only object which he could sense within the bag seemed to be solid and rectangular a small firm box relaxing only slightly skinner picked up the fruit knife slowly centimetre by centimetre he began to cut his way into the bag not along the top or along the bottom since letter bombs were often wired at both ends but along the side through the outer skin and into the fibre padding which he pulled out to expose the inner layer when it was laid bare from end to end of the bag he carried the parcel over to the sink which he filled with water so that he could drop it should it be after all an incendiary device finally when he was completely prepared with the bag laid on the work surface he crouched beside it at eye level and began to make the final incision with the sharp little knife he worked slowly ready to stop should he meet any resistance easing the blade through the paper until the bag was open leaving it where it was he reached into the cupboard under the sink and found a small torch he rumbled at first with the unreasonably small button wondering if the batteries were flat until at last its bulb lit up pressing the ends of the bag very gently with his broad left hand to widen the opening which he had cut he shone the beam undetectable in the daylight into the gap he was looking for wires but he saw none only a black cassette box he released his breath which he had been holding in a loud gasp and picked up the bag allowing its contents to drop on to the work surface only then did he look closely again at the jiffy it was stamped with what he took to be the regulation amount but the postmark was smudged and faint he shone the torch beam directly on to it from close range but both the time and postal district were indecipherable he swore gently and tossed the container on to the table picking up the cassette box as he did so the lid was clear and showed a shiny new tape inside only then did he look up to see pam standing in the doorway looking anxious he glowered at her i thought i told you to stay next door i couldnt i was worried for you its okay he nodded waving the box as he shooed her back into the living room if this is some direct marketing gimmick i will personally eat the senders liver but somehow i doubt it she looked at him you think lets find out he stepped across to his hifi stack took out the cassette and slipped it into the playonly deck which was incapable of erasing tapes even by accident using the remote handset he switched on the amplifier adjusted the volume upwards and pressed the tape button beside him pam jumped as the shouts and background music of a rapper burst from the speakers skinner waited guessing what would come next its radio one boomed the disc jockey as the music track faded the nations number one its thursday its eleven thirty and its time for the news there was a short jingle and a second voice cut in this is newsbeat with mary slavin edinburgh police today released a photofit picture of the man they want to question about the murder of mp leona mcgrath and the kidnap of her son mark it shows a cleanshaven fairhaired white man in his mid to late thirties the news announcer was cut off abruptly uncle bob uncle bob the childs cry which replaced it was unmistakably that of mark mcgrath but not the selfpossessed slightly precocious child whom skinner knew it was frightened shocked and tearful uncle bob mr gilbert said that the news would show you when this tape was made and that im all right but he never said what would be on it what did the lady mean about my mummy my mummys all right isnt she you wouldnt let anything happen to her uncle bob would you it was not a question rather a cry for reassurance a cry for a denial of the horror that the boy had just heard on the radio clearly for the first time he broke off in a crying and whimpering sound which ended after a few seconds in a loud sniff mr gilbert says ive to tell you uncle bob that he has one more thing still to do then hell be ready to tell you what this is about thats what he said and he says hell be in touch again soon there was a click and the tape went dead skinner who had been staring at the tape deck as if the child was actually inside it turned back to pamela her hands were to her mouth and there were tears shining in her eyes how awful she cried for the poor wee boy to find out like that about his mother being dead you just cant imagine cruelty like that you can when youve seen it as often as i have bob told her but i doubt if the guy knew that would happen we didnt release the photofit until eleven mr gilbert would have no way of knowing that it would be the lead item on the eleven thirty news mind you i dont think his conscience would be pricked by the way it turned out i knew you were close to mark said pamela but i never knew you were on uncle bob terms i made a point of seeing him a lot after the accident then later i would look in to say hello sometimes on a friday after work when leona got back from westminster he sighed hes a very gifted wee boy but he hasnt half been touched by tragedy his father his mother his mothers best friend all of them dying violent deaths whatll happen to him assuming we get him back alive that is oh we will pam we will if you believe in anything believe in that as for afterwards thats a good question the grandparents are probably too old to take on a sixyearold fulltime and there are no uncles or aunts if its adoption itll need to be a pretty special home he reached down and took the tape from the deck lets concentrate on the first part for now though getting him back safe that means getting this tape down to the technical people in london to see if mr gilberts given us any more accidental assistance im going to take it up to the office as soon as im showered and dressed youd better come for i aint leaving you here alone im beginning to regret getting rid of our watchers yesterday but youre not supposed to go to the office she protested fuck that for a game of soldiers but if it makes you happy youll be going in ill just be there as your bodyguard okay she started to say more but hesitated what is it he asked as they moved together towards the bedroom oh nothing i was just going to teach my granny to suck eggs that was all come on out with it he insisted well it was that name mr gilbert i dont imagine its for real but all the same have you checked skinner nodded as soon as carr came up with it i had big neil do just that he checked every case on which ive led the investigation way back no mr something gilberts no mr gilbert somethings youre right it was bound to be a phoney still we had to try bob i thought the lord advocate told you to stay away from here andy martin looked up in surprise as the door of his office opened and they entered pam had noticed his car in the rear park but skinner had known already that with the search for the kidnapper in full swing and with his own absence there would be no more days off for his friend for the foreseeable future he can try having me arrested or he can sue me or he can piss off he took a tape from his pocket and laid it on the desk play this without a word martin picked up the cassette reached across without standing up to put it in the player and listened in grim glowering silence to the childs desperate message bastard he hissed very quietly when it was finished another one for the specialists andy he wrote down a name and a number heres who to call thats a copy ive got the original in an envelope in my pocket he patted his jacket sergeant would you like to fly it down to london pam surprised nodded good ill drive you to the airport and pick you up youll be safe travelling and in london i reckon he turned back to martin anything strike you about the message you mean apart from the cruelty of mark finding out about his mothers death the head of cid growled one thing he went on thats what he said he has one more thing still to do before he tells us what hes up to that one thing was killing our mr sweeney no doubt so we can expect to hear from him any time now no i dont think that was it have you got a time of death on sweeney yet about four oclock on thursday that figures you see i dont think mr gilbert knew that hed have to take the risk of killing sweeney until he heard the news bulletin recorded on the tape he must have known then that only carr could have given us that detailed a picture and he must have guessed too that we had the phoney number plate from the caravan only at that point did it become a bigger risk to leave sweeney alive than to kill him skinner stabbed at the table with a finger so he said vehementlymarks one more thing means something else the guys going to pull another stunt maybe an even bigger stunt and there he is the cocky bastard telling us telling me about it knowing that i havent clue where to start looking his face twisted into a scowl of frustration you havent gone public on the link between the mcgrath investigation and the sweeney murder have you christ no i didnt want to start a feeding frenzy in the media quite right youd just have added to the pressure on the troops and on yourself the two detectives sat for a while staring ahead neither looking at the other each concentrating so hard on possibilities that they almost failed to react when pam broke the silence a bigger stunt she said hes killed an mp and stolen her son what could be a bigger stunt as you put it than that the words left skinners mouth almost without conscious thought to do it again he said quietly as martin looked at him his initial disbelief faded against his knowledge of a hundred other viable kites that his friend had flown in the time that he had known him how many other mps have young children he asked no idea said skinner but the special branch offices around the country should know i think its time we got on the phone you dig up mcguire and ill contact strathclyde the two manchester detectives had flown british airways to london for the onward flight to guernsey alex had chosen to travel with british midland to minimise the time she would have to spend in the company of the formidable and hostile cheshire with very few business travellers in the air on saturday the flights were all on time in takeoff and in landing as they disembarked through the tiny guernsey terminal building into the dull breezy morning after a crosschannel hop spent mostly in silence alex looked around for a taxi rank its all right said ericson coming up behind her as she headed for a white primera minicab weve arranged transport im sure my boss wont mind if you join us cheshire looked as if he would be quite prepared to allow her to take the taxi but said nothing alex fell into step beside the two officers as they headed for the police car which waited a short distance from the terminal entrance a uniformed constable standing to attention by the drivers door first time in guernsey ericson asked her in a reasonable show of courtesy as the car pulled away from its stand alex shook her head setting her curls tumbling and smiling at the policeman in a way that made even cheshire stir in his seat no dad brought me here on holiday once a couple of years after my mum died i was only about six but i remember it rained all the time we were in the best hotel in town though with plenty of covered facilities so it didnt matter so much cheshire turned in the front passenger seat your father could afford good holidays even then he asked his cold expressionless eyes fixed on her hes a man of property isnt he two houses in scotland i understand and two more in spain looking at that some might say its hardly surprising that some chickens have come home to roost ericson looked straight ahead focusing on the back of the drivers head she wondered if his question had been a setup until she realised that he was embarrassed by his chiefs brutal directness quite unexpectedly alex smiled mr cheshire she said if that look is meant to intimidate me youre wasting your time when i was a wee girl if i did or said something i shouldnt have my dad would let me know just by giving me a long look it was his worst punishment almost the only one he ever needed a couple of seconds and id be saying sorry believe me when it comes to intimidating stares youre not in the same class as him her smile vanished im not here to be interrogated by you two but i am happy to put you right about pops hes had three inheritances in his life when my mum was killed the mortgage on the gullane house was paid off and there were other life policies in his name that helped him to buy largely an apartment in spain which we used he still owns it but he rents it out to policemen at a very reasonable rate incidentally later an aunt died and left him a lot of money the bulk of it in property in perthshire which he sold he only needed part of that to buy the spanish villa which we use as a family the rest was invested after that when my grandparents died he and i were the only beneficiaries oh yes and the edinburgh property is jointly owned by pops and sarah my stepmother theres a small loan on that because with mortgage tax relief it was cheaper to borrow than take it all from invested capital now it was her turn to stare hard at her inquisitor mr cheshire were all here looking into an allegation by persons unknown that my dads taken a bung of a hundred grand if all youve done so far is check up on his assets without checking how he came by them youre pretty shoddy detectives no wonder the crime rate in manchester is so high the fact is gentlemen my dad doesnt need a hundred thousand he has a hundred thousand and quite a lot more cheshires glare had softened but he was still unsmiling very good miss skinner i hear what you say and if you thought i was trying to bully you i apologise the fact is we know all of your fathers financial history hes been vetted several times in the course of his career but i have to tell you i dont care how comfortably off he is i have never met anyone even my own dear wife he interjected with his first flicker of humour who couldnt use another hundred thousand i once knew a man neighbour of mine said the policeman in his rumbling northern accent gynaecologist he was middleaged private practice very successful who was arrested for nicking a pound box of cadburys roses from wh smith his defence was that he was experiencing the male menopause the prosecution case which the bench accepted was that he was just a thieving bastard as he finished the car drew to a halt they had barely noticed their journey through st peter port the islands tiny capital now they r found themselves in what seemed to be a side street outside a three storey whitepainted building as they emerged from the car they saw a single entrance door with three brass plates and three door buzzers beside it jzg bank was the middle of the three cheshire stepped forward and pressed the button almost immediately a tinny voice sounded through the small speaker grille which surrounded it yes three visitors for mr medine i am he please enter and come up one flight of stairs there was aloud buzz at which the policeman pushed the door open medine was waiting for them on the first landing he was a small thin man aged around sixty with a sallow windburned face and round rimless spectacles of the type worn almost invariably by gestapo officers in movies alex wondered fleetingly if they might be a relic of the days of the german occupation of the island come in come in said the little man after cheshire had made the introductions there is noone else in the building it is discreet he was dressed not in a business suit but in the casual shirt baggy cardigan and slacks which alex guessed he might wear for his weekend gardening she had been expecting to hear french overtones in the channel islanders accent but in fact there were none if anything there was the merest touch of home counties south he led them into a small office suite which looked not at all like a bank he caught alexs expression and smiled this is not a place where people come to withdraw fifty pounds or negotiate an overdraft for all that it says on the sign by the door here we handle fairly large amounts of money for people who require offshore banking services normally theyre expat workers or people whove retired abroad to spain france or italy say but who prefer to keep their main money in the british isles for tax reasons alex enquired thats their business we dont declare interest paid to the exchequer in london paris madrid or anywhere else he showed them through a large office into a smaller conference room with a window which looked across the street to an almost identical white building as the one in which they took their seats thank you for seeing us cheshire began brusque formal and forbidding once more this is an informal meeting but mr ericson and miss skinner may take notes miss skinner is here as an observer but she may ask a few question at the conclusion of our discussion if she feels it necessary medine nodded straightfaced i have taken instructions from my head office in germany i am cleared to cooperate with you as far as i can he rose from the round table at which they sat and walked round behind alex to a small filing cabinet you wish to discuss our account number uk understand from the call which i received yesterday correct medine took a small folder from the cabinet and resumed his seat at the table its all in here he said all the detail of the instruction the account details are on computer i can get you an exact balance if you wish it will show the sum deposited plus interest to date there have been no withdrawals that would have been unlikely anyway at this stage he added why asked ericson because the terms of the account specify ninety days notice of withdrawal this account was set up only a few months ago whats the rate of interest currently ninepointsevenfive per cent thats very good said the chief superintendent thats why we are popular with our customer base we give that little bit extra for larger deposits our minimum is fifty thousand sterling cheshire leaned forward lets get a bit more specific about your customer base shall we what types might it include the little managers eyes narrowed he pinched his nose below the crosspiece of his spectacles most of them are corporate our private clients include engineers working abroad i suppose retired people as i said soldiers soldiers do they earn that much cheshire looked at him quizzically there are other armies beside ours sir the policeman nodded you mean mercenaries maybe in my experience most prefer to be called military advisers are all your accounts numbered oh no said medine that is simply a service which jzg offers most of our accounts are held in the name of the depositor what about access always we require a signature and proof of identity we dont go in for codewords or half banknotes or any of that nonsense he smiled thinly yet if someone comes to you asking for a numbered account what might that mean the manager leaned back in his chair who am i to know he countered you tell me of a private bank which asks a customer to provide references when he comes to it with a large sum of money to deposit if i am asked for a numbered account i provide it without question and that was how it was in the case of uk cheshire asked exactly so how was that account set up medine opened his folder around five months ago he said a man arrived with a parcel he didnt give a name and we didnt ask he said simply that he was a courier engaged by a third party and he asked to see the manager i interviewed him in this same room and he gave me the parcel it contained one hundred thousand pounds in sterling in bank of england notes of various denominations and ages with it there was a covering letter i have it here he took a sheet of paper from the folder and handed it to cheshire it instructed me to place the contents of the parcel in a numbered account for the benefit of robert morgan skinner born in motherwell lanarkshire on april withdrawals from the account could be made only by mr skinner on his signature and on production of a means of secondary identification the letter asked me also to provide acceptable confirmation that the account had been opened it was unsigned cheshire read the document which medine had handed over once twice a third time then he passed it across to alex she picked it up and stared at it peering closely the letter had been typed not on a wordprocessor for printing but directly on a manual typewriter it was on a plain sheet of cream a paper this is an instruction she began to read aloud it was exactly as the manager had said her fathers name his birthplace his date of birth but anyone could have gone to the general register office and looked that up she protested her selfcontrol beginning to slip for the first time that day cheshire raised a hand to silence her glancing across for the first time his eyes were sympathetic rather than unkind shh he said i know that he looked back at the banker what else mr medine how was the depositor to know that the courier hadnt just legged it with the cash he asked for and i gave him a signed numbered receipt from this bank it bore the number of the account its part of our security requirement that account holders must quote the number of their receipt as well as the title of the account when requesting withdrawals he took a copy of the slip from the file and handed it over of course i have no idea what the courier did with the receipt but he did ask me also to telephone a uk telephone number and leave a message on its answering machine saying simply consignment received and giving the date this i did do you recall the number medine nodded i wrote it down here it is he took a slip of paper from the folder and passed it to the policeman before he slid it across to alex she had seen the first numbers even so when she saw her fathers unlisted gullane number a shaft of cold fear swept through her she wondered if she had gone pale and if cheshire had noticed until she realised that if the investigators had checked his financial details they would also know all of his telephone numbers and finally asked cheshire the signature how was that to be verified easily the banker answered this was in the parcel he took the last document from the folder and handed it to the investigator cheshire looked at it his face set once more and passed it to alex it was another sheet of plain a paper creamcoloured she read aloud once more this is a sample of mr skinners signature he will also identify himself by producing his police warrant card issued by his office in fettes avenue edinburgh below the typescript there it was in a clear hand which she knew so well robert m skinner its all right alex said cheshire speaking suddenly almost like a kindly uncle im not going to ask you she found his sympathy so much harder to take than his aggression are there any questions youd like to ask he offered she pulled herself together and nodded the money in the package mr medine you said that it was in bank of england notes thats right a mix of denominations and ages yes nearly all twenties and fifties i remember because i had to authenticate every one of them most were in sequence but not continuous not new but most if not all unused it was as if the whole sum had been gathered together piece by piece over a period of time and all of them were bank of england notes the banker looked at her puzzled what else as i said the deposit was in sterling mmm okay can we go back to the courier now alex asked can you describe him let me think medine knitted his brow in concentration he was tall he said at last hesitantly and slimbuilt wearing a grey suit he had fairish hair as i recall i would say that he was in his thirties how about his accent im bad on uk accents i can barely tell a jock from a geordie this chap just sounded bland thats all i can say about him he didnt give me any regional impression on alexs left chief superintendent ericson opened his briefcase reached into it and after fumbling with his papers took out a single sheet which he handed facedown to the bank manager did he look anything like this he asked as medine turned the paper over alex started in surprise it was the photofit of mark mcgraths kidnapper the channel islander nodded at once yes this could have been him im not saying that it was mind you but in terms of general appearance yes thats in the ballpark apart from the glasses of course he looked up oh didnt i say the man wore glasses so you do have open minds after all alex smiled at ericson as the car moved off course we do said cheshire its unthinkable to me that another deputy chief would take a bung from anyone but in this task you have to entertain the unthinkable you have as your dad would be the first to tell you to look at all the possibilities having studied everything about dcc skinner we just happened to have that photofit with us when medine gave us that description ronnie sparked on it right away incidentally i was going to ask him to describe the courier before we left pity about those bloody glasses though he smiled at alex suddenly all right young lady weve given you something now pay us back why were you going on about that money she hesitated but finally grinned okay guv she said ill cough those bank of england notes if this socalled bung originated from scotland and where else would it and it was put together over a period like medine said not in a single wodge of cash its very unlikely to say the least that there wouldnt be any scottish banknotes in it most of the notes in circulation in scotland are issued by our own clearing banks the bank of scotland the royal bank and the clydesdale medine obviously doesnt know that she looked from cheshire to ericson neither equally obviously do you louche sir said the chief superintendent to his boss nice one alex the deputy chief nodded yes it is but i wont lie to you lass things still look dodgy for your dad first and foremost theres his signature well have to check that but i could tell when you looked at it that you thought it was genuine it took me by surprise she protested but it could still be a good forgery it must be time and the calligraphy experts will tell of course if it is a phoney then the whole allegation is a fitup but if not he gave her a meaningful look anyway on top of that theres the confirmatory telephone call to his unlisted number in gullane and that receipt ive got a feeling in my water that it has to be kicking around somewhere you going to let us look for it or do i get a warrant she nodded ill ask pops but hell say yes as for the telephone number the mcgrath kidnapper has that cheshire looked at her in genuine surprise my fiance lets me in on some secrets you know she said the first contact from the man was in a telephone call to my dads unlisted number in gullane andys people are still tearing british telecom apart looking for the person who sold it to him the deputy chief frowned if i was in my nasty bastard mode he muttered id say that maybe your dad gave it him that maybe the link between thems stronger than we think that maybe this mans after a kingsize ransom and that your dads got reasons for making sure he gets it maybe the hundred grand was a downpayment from him he saw a look of horror cross her face of course thats just my nasty bastard imagination running away with me he said but he is facing a divorce petition from your stepmother and since his assets are mostly in property or longterm investments maybe another nasty bastard in the crown office say might think that he did need some cash in a hurry maybe a bit more than a hundred grand he stopped thats what i really hate about this job he said gloomily its not just about looking under stones its about really rummaging around under em for the most horrible things you could ever imagine how are we doing andy asked skinner from the door of martins office he had just returned from edinburgh airport where he had put pam on the am flight to london bound for m with the original of mark mcgraths horrific taped message just about there strathclyde called back a couple of minutes ago im only waiting for fife the buggers over there are probably all on the golf course the dcc growled but he had barely spoken before the telephone rang none he heard martin say you sure yes okay thats fine thanks he hung up and looked across at skinner they only have five mps ones a bachelor anothers newly married a thirds getting on a bit and so on end result zero so no additions to my list he picked up a sheet of paper from the desk seventytwo scottish mps and only nine of them with children under twelve twentyfive others have teenagers but lets discount them for now at least he handed the list to skinner who barely glanced at it how do we go about this he mused its pure speculation on our part if we act on it and give them all protection itll cost a fortune and probably start a parliamentary panic i agree said martin but given the threat on that tape its speculation we cant ignore look why dont we ask special branch offices to make quiet contact with all the names on our list to advise them to keep their kids under constant observation and to offer them protection if they want it good idea lets play it that way you brief mario mcguire and have him make the calls he turned to the list once more lets see whos here then he had only just begun to read and martin was reaching for his telephone when it rang frowning with momentary annoyance the chief superintendent picked it up mario he said surprised i was just going to call you he fell silent as a look of pure horror crossed his face oh no skinner heard him gasp get down there now he snapped the boss and i will meet you there he slammed the phone back into its cradle lets have it then said the dcc quietly see that speculation of ours the younger man replied hunching his shoulders and clasping his hands together i think its suddenly turned into fact theres just been a shooting in abercromby place the victim is a mrs anderson mario thinks that its the secretary of states wife abercromby place is little more than a connecting road linking dublin street and dundas street with few private residences and much of its townhouse office space vacant and available for let its main value to the city is as a place for shoppers to park when martin and skinner swung out of dundas street they found the road partially blocked by a police car slewed sideways the two constables on duty recognised the detectives at once and waved them through although one sneaked a second surprised glance at the suspended dcc they drove on but had gone barely any distance before at a point where the road curved they came upon two more police cars an ambulance and a knot of half a dozen uniformed officers with men in plain clothes mingled among them as they jumped from the car mario mcguire saw them and waved them through the crowd are all these bystanders necessary skinner barked im waiting for someone senior from division to take command sir said mcguire will we do dyou think said martin curtly senior officer forward he called a uniformed inspector stepped up get this lot organised and searching i want spent cartridge cases and anything else thats lying around he turned back to mcguire any witnesses one shes in the ambulance being looked after she was just coming out of her flat in albany street when she heard a bang she didnt react at first but finally she looked along here and saw something on the ground she ran along and realised what it was by that time the manager of the pub on the corner had appeared too he called us how did you get involved skinner asked by luck inspector good was in the first car to respond he looked in the womans handbag found this and called me straight away mcguire handed skinner a laminated photopass showing a blonde woman in her thirties it bore a house of commons crest and a name mrs catherine anderson oh shit whispered the dcc its bruces wife all right lets have a look at her then he said resignedly mcguire led them across the street towards a car parked nosein in the only occupied bay in a group of six the body lay on the ground beside the drivers door covered in a grey blanket emblazoned with the crest of the scottish ambulance service skinner knelt down and lifted it up by a corner carefully two eyes stared out at him vacantly looking not in the slightest surprised just very dead there was a big ragged hole in the womans forehead just at the hairline from which blood and grey brain matter still oozed he dropped the blanket quickly fighting for control of his stomach shot in the back of the head he asked mcguire yes sir you can see the exit wound it looks like he just stepped up behind her and bang poor woman never knew what hit her he paused eh whos going to tell mr anderson i will skinner answered suspended or not but well need to find him first he reached into a pocket of his jacket to produce a small book ive got his private secretarys home number here he began to search again for his mobile this time but was interrupted excuse me sirs said a nervous woman constable appearing on the edge of the group but theres someone here who says he might know the victim the three detectives looked across to see a middleaged man dressed in a grey shirt grey trousers and with greying hair and beard standing with another officer martin and skinner walked across towards him yes sir the chief superintendent began first can you tell us who you are the man who was also greyfaced nodded quickly im charlie kettles i have the hair studio on the corner look when i saw the car and heard what had happened its not mrs anderson is it dyou know her skinner asked kettles nodded anxiously shes a customer she has been ever since her husband became secretary of state and they took over bute house she comes at nine thirty every saturday morning for a tidy up usually she left my place not long ago i see the dcc nodded im afraid it is mrs anderson god thats terrible said the hairdresser his eyes glistening suddenly what about tanya what dyou mean martin asked yet knew the answer a sinking feeling gathered in his stomach her daughter tanya shes eight every second saturday she comes with her mother she was here today shes not as well is she no skinner replied theres no sign of tanya thanks mr kettles someone will take a statement from you in due course if youll excuse us though for now of course the man nodded turned and headed back to his studio head bowed as the dcc took out his mobile phone once more he punched in a number after a few seconds the secretary of states private secretary answered david its bob skinner here wheres your boss bute house why hewlett sounded alarmed never mind why just listen how long will he be there quite a while hes expecting the permanent under secretary of state and me for a working lunch okay you contact the permanent secretary and cancel him then get along there yourself andy martin and i will be there before you this is a real emergency so no questions for now dave just do it we spoke to the nearest thing we have to a witness before we came along here when we pressed her she said she thought she saw a silver or a grey car heading away from the scene towards dundas street what does that mean asked the secretary of state for scotland ashenfaced we believe that the man who killed leona mcgrath and took mark drives a grey car said andy martin i see dr bruce anderson nodded he was standing by the tall fireplace at one end of the long formal drawing room of bute house his official residence in charlotte square he started to walk to the window but bob skinner reached out and caught his arm dont do that you wouldnt want to be photographed just now no agreed anderson youre right wouldnt do would it his cheeks were still wet with tears as he looked up at skinner i was surprised to see you here bob but now im glad of your presence yours and mr martins look lets go upstairs and have a seat somewhere less grand so we can talk about this you dont have to do that yet sir said the dcc i mean to say youve just lost your wife yes and my child has just been kidnapped i cant do anything for the one but if i can help you find the other come on he turned to hewlett who was standing close by david youd better find a phone and sort something out with the information office the directors on his way sir good you wait here for him then i suppose you should get together with the police press officer so that everyone knows everything thats being said he led the way out of the public room and up a narrow staircase to the floor which had been fitted out as private family quarters in the fine old georgian house why did you stay here every saturday when your main home and your constituency are in the west martin asked as the three men entered another sitting room much smaller than the first but still finely furnished anderson smiled as the three men sat catherine liked edinburgh she was like a kid with a new toy when she found that this place came with the job so every friday evening when she had finished teaching and i had done my constituency surgery she insisted that the three of us pack the car and come through here normally we stay till sunday evening the girls have to be back in glasgow for school on monday his eyes moistened again as his outofdate tenses caught up with him catherine found the hairdresser charlie whatshisname through the wife of one of my colleagues she was very particular about her hair and about tanyas he broke off look bob when can i see her as soon as possible before the postmortem certainly where was she shot the bereaved husband asked quietly back of the head once from close range skinner replied shed have died in an instant he touched his forehead the bullet exited here it was a mediumcalibre weapon from the cartridge case we found id say ninemillimetre christ and i thought wed banned all handguns anderson moaned you might as well have banned the wheel in my experience murderers dont mind using illegal firearms the fact is they nearly always do with one or two notorious exceptions when a person used his own registered firearm to kill it was nearly always a suicide he smiled grimly for a second see those blokes youve brought up to investigate me in their home city you can buy a gun in a pub for a few quid there are so many shootings down there they barely make the papers now unless theyre fatal eastern european weapons usually half the red fucking army seems to have sold its weapons on the black market ninemillimetre pistols many of them are and they change hands a lot when we find the bullet that killed your wife minister it will tell us whether the gun has been used in an earlier crime but its highly unlikely that it will tell us who pulled the trigger anderson nodded i understand he sighed to think that i turned down the chance of protection squad cover what a bloody self confident fool i am no said skinner quickly and emphatically dont torture yourself with that one sir theyd have been with you not your wife and daughter okay thats some comfort now what can we do to catch this man weve already blocked every main road out of edinburgh martin replied however he may have gone to ground in the city itself alternatively he had plenty of time to make it out of the city before our officers were in place to be frank sir i dont see this man simply driving up to a roadblock hes too thorough the head ofcid paused how long had your wife been going to charlie kettles on saturday mornings about three months and taking tanya every second week the man must have been watching her for all of that time establishing a pattern planning he must have watched leona mcgrath in the same way anderson twisted in his chair to look at skinner need this be the same man couldnt it be a copycat aye said skinner it could but it isnt its the same man i received a tape this morning he looked round and saw a midi hifi unit on a sideboard behind the couch listen to this he took the copy of mark mcgraths message from his pocket slid it into the tape player and switched it on anderson listened in silence as the childs voice filled the room gradually his face twisted in anguish and he began to sob the two detectives waited as he composed himself once more sorry gentlemen he said at last its all just too much i know skinner whispered my daughter was kidnapped once the secretary of state looked up at him did you catch the man who did it oh yes said the detective even more softly than before i caught him he wont do it again ill catch this bastard too and neither will he anderson smiled weakly id better lift your suspension then pending the outcome of the enquiry no dont do that i dont know for sure but it may be better if this man thinks im out of the action whatever you want so how will you catch him bob ill wait the next move is his when he makes it ill be ready for him if he makes the slightest mistake sooner or later he will anderson sighed oh my god but i hope so he looked at the two detectives numbly from one to the other is this political gentlemen he asked bewildered it has to be skinner replied two mps children snatched a member and a members wife murdered and yet it could be personal too in some way the man chooses to contact me theres a link between leona and me and between mark and me theres a link between you and me dr anderson so it could be aimed at me somehow or it could be all about money well know soon when he contacts us again for now andy and i will just have to do the thing were worst at whats that the waiting he rose from his seat well send a car for you dr anderson when your wife is ready for a visit itll be within the hour i hope well use the back entrance for your privacy also said martin ill put armed officers in position front and back whats the point replied the secretary of state the horse has bolted still the head ofcid followed skinner out of the room all the way down the stairs to the back door at the subbasement level here he began at last as they slid into the mondeo upstairs when you were talking about motives you said something odd about links i know said skinner i should have told you before and i better had now because im pretty certain youre going to find out anyway it was the most tumultuous press conference that martin had ever attended let alone chaired the murder of a cabinet ministers wife and the kidnap of a second politicians child for the first time in his life he had felt that the media were out to get him and although he had been as careful as he could not to allow words to be put into his mouth he knew that he would be lucky if only a few newspapers questioned his competence and hinted that skinners suspension was compromising the investigation the dcc was gone when he returned to his office en route for the airport to pick up pam from her return flight martin sat with his head in his hands feeling helpless as the first radio news bulletins were already beginning to say and very alone he was grateful for the sound of the telephone even though he did not have the slightest expectation that it might be bringing him good news he snatched the handset out of its cradle martin he said eagerly hi andy i like it when someones pleased to hear from me such was the clarity of his voice that the man on the line might have been in the next room but the chief superintendent knew that he was calling from washington hi joe he responded yes it is good to hear from you i feel like im running out of friends and luck just at the moment jesus kid drawled the american what size of dogs crapped on your lawn quickly martin told him of the mornings atrocity and of the earlier surprise in skinners morning mail i see what you mean said joe doherty tersely i would say that you are dealing with a real lulu there yes indeed a real peach i take it youve looked for a terrorist connection joe weve looked for every sort of connection and come up blank like bob says all we can do now is wait for the guy to make his next move and hope that he makes a mistake you never know maybe we will get something from marks message tape yeah you never know but just dont hope for anything then at least you wont be disappointed there was a pause as doherty drew on a cigarette martin guessed hows bob bearing up he asked at last hes like a grizzly with a hangover and piles after all thats happened in his life over the last year or so he really did not need this nonsense from spotlight did you appreciate that pam who called you yesterday is the new woman i put two and two together bob called me beginning of last week and asked me to make sure that sarah wasnt bothered he told me then about his domestic alterations lets say whats gone wrong with him andy i dont know joe truth is i dont think he does either did you speak to sarah yeah i called her how did she sound hurt and confused just like bob really ahh cried martin despairing i just feel helpless and for these corruption allegations to come on top of it all yeah said doherty ms masters told me about that what the tuck is that about someones set him up he has people working on it alex among them i hope shell bring back some good news tonight we sure as hell need some he forced himself to sound more upbeat anyway why this call at the us governments expense have you got anything for me on this miserable rag thats crucifying my friend ive got some spotlight is quite an institution over here you know its making inroads in great britain too as you have reason to know the story about bob and pam got it the sort of national attention its been after so who owns it a straight question not such a straight answer in the first instance spotlight belongs to a corporation registered in chicago it owns just that one news magazine but also a string of cracker radio stations mostly though not all in the south radio kkk you mean oh no nothing so unsubtle radio free america is more like it the voice of the militants those backwoods democrats who only like elected government when it does what they want who owns the equity in the chicago corporation asked martin another corporation registered in houston its owned in turn by yet another corporation registered in la which also holds a large chunk of the stock of a satellite television news network strip the whole thing away though and you wind up with a global holding company which pulls together a part of the corporate holdings of a very interesting guy hes possibly the richest man in america doherty paused as if for effect does the name everard balliol mean anything to you somehow i feel it should martin scratched his head and searched his remarkable memory yes i remember him that proam golf tournament bob wound up playing in a while back the one there was bother with everard balliol was one of the leading amateurs as i recall he didnt like losing doherty laughed he wouldnt mr balliol doesnt like losing at anything its a common trait with billionaires they tell me whats his background his granddaddy was in oil everard diversified in a big way hes still a major player in the oil business but on top of that hes into computers telecommunications air transport banking insurance and a few other things politically hes way out on the right wing there was talk a few years back of him going after the republican nomination but when he talked about nuking the colombian coca fields they decided that they didnt want another goldwater for a while he thought of running as an independent but he decided that he couldnt win under that flag so he dropped it instead he contents himself with backing rightwing causes he funds but doesnt own one or two militant publications and gives them airtime on his stations spotlight is a special toy he uses it in the states to embarrass federal and state governments if he feels that theyre backsliding and he feels that way a lot the international editions run the same way doherty went on balliol hates every sort of liberalism anywhere when your election turned out the way it did he went ballistic apparently martin realised that he was frowning and that it was growing deeper by the second is this man dangerous joe there was a pause for thought hes dangerous in that he has unlimited resources hes dangerous in that his political attitudes are shared by a large number of very spooky people and if he ever gave them serious financial backing wed have a real problem but if you mean is he dangerous like homicidal i doubt it hes completely ruthless but i reckon if he really took a dislike to someone hed prefer to hurt him in a way hed remember rather than just by having him made dead spotlight is the perfect tool for him bob should have let him win that proam i think you could see bob doing that could you maybe not he chuckled at the thought there is one other thing about balliol that should interest you hes a real scotophile oh yes yeah said the laconic doherty he claims scottish descent in fact he claims to be the descendant of kings he owns a castle in your fair land with an estate bought it a year or two back they tell me hes building a private golf course on the land it isnt balmoral is it the american laughed out loud no but if that ever comes on the market you can bet everard will snap it up his current pile is a place called erran mhor north of somewhere called fort william apparently does he use it much he never announces his arrival or departure said the american but yes he does in fact hes there right now what about the signature bob asked mitchell laidlaw holding a photocopy ofmedines sample which cheshire and ericson had given to alex is there any chance that this could be genuine skinner took the sheet from him and looked at it id say it probably is almost certainly he shrugged his broad shoulders but so what mitch i attend lots of public functions quite often i have to make speeches to rotarians for example or parent groups at schools i even chaired a reading once at james thin in george street for the publication of the memoirs of a retired copper frequently im asked for my autograph at these events i always give it sometimes without even looking at the person who wants it so getting hold of a sample of my signature would not be a difficult thing to do dont worry too much about that even if the handwriting gurus insist that it is genuine we can still defend against it he handed the photocopy back to laidlaw and looked across at alex the threestrong defence team had gathered once more in the offices of curie anthony and jarvis as soon as alex had returned from guernsey its some comfort to know that al cheshire is a straightdowntheline operator after all i was getting the idea that hed arrived with his mind made up when i checked him out i found that every investigation that hes handled within another force has ended in a prosecution mind you in nearly every one of those he was called in only after preliminary enquiries showed strong evidence of corruption hed tell you thats the case here bob said laidlaw quietly aye and from what alex has told us hed be dead right skinner turned to his daughter that was good work you did though love picking up the point about the bank of england notes and rubbing his nose in it if the money had been in one big lump of sequentially numbered notes then fair enough but the fact that it was put together as it was that helps us how asked laidlaw the policeman smiled im not sure yet it tells us that it was put together if not outside scotland then probably from an external source now the fact is that if anyone had bunged me it would have been someone within my own patch alex frowned yes thats true pops but that person could have had cash in another country its hardly the strongest defence to lay before a jury i agree her father replied but if this thing does get to court at least its something for old christabel to argue he chuckled suddenly glancing at laidlaw its a pity old orlachs dead if wed been able to fix it for him to be on the bench with christabel defending lets look at the courier said the solicitor his crimson weather beaten cheeks indicating that he had spent his morning on the golf course that was a major stroke of luck surely beside her boss alex nodded vigorously yes the mans targeting you in some way through these crimes he used your private phone number theres evidence of malice and a potential identification of him as the courier christabel will make hay with that if we capture the guy alive maybe she wont have to but skinner shook his head slightly im not so sure okay medine picked him out from the photofit and okay he had my gullane number yet there are two major holes in the argument what are they asked alex frowning well its a mistake for a start and this is a very smart guy were after if the kidnapper had set me up in guernsey i dont see him exposing himself by acting as his own courier why not pops youve said yourself that youre waiting for him to make a mistake not one as big as this though hes better than that he stood up from the conference table and walked to the window anyway all thats subjective the other hole in the arguments based on fact the kidnapper made that tape on thursday he posted it first class on friday although we still dont know from where the postmark was too badly smudged so he knew id have it on saturday so asked laidlaw so if it was him who set me up through spotlight he did that on thursday at the latest if it was him hed have known that by saturday id be under investigation yet there was not the faintest hint of that on the tape not even the faintest hint of him through mark he was still talking to me as a copper on saturday morning no im afraid i need a lot more convincing that the kidnapper is behind this he turned to alex whats al cheshires next move hes going to interview noel salmon tomorrow midday salmon says he doesnt want me there he says hed feel threatened hes catching on is he scowled skinner did cheshire tell him he had a choice well he has pops this is still an informal investigation no ones under caution thats right bob laidlaw confirmed however alex find out if salmon would accept my presence maybe hed find me less of a threat he looked across at skinner as he resumed his seat going back to christabel for a moment bob in the light of the information which alex has brought back i think it would be good idea if we arranged a consultation for monday if thats okay with you ill set it up skinner nodded and laidlaw made a small note on a pad on the table in front of him he looked up again what about this receipt bob what do we do about that the detective shrugged alex was right let cheshire search wherever he likes any sheriff would give him a warrant if he asked for one with what hes got theres no point in putting him to the bother pops alex intervened hesitantly he wants to search pams as well youve been living there of course he does ive already discussed the possibility with her as long as its done very discreetly shes okay with it to be on the up and up neither of us should go back to anywhere thats to be searched so alex once weve finished here you go back to see cheshire and ericson and take them where they need to go ill give you keys to pams place laidlaw leaned across his desk bob i have to ask you this weve got copies of all the documents cheshire was good enough to give us them while he holds the originals looking at that receipt have you ever seen however casually it or anything like it skinner laughed you asking if i mistook it for one of sarahs jenners receipts oh yes a hundred grand got off light today didnt we no mitch i have never seen that receipt in my life anywhere although the way things are going for me just now he stopped in midsentence what the hell let al cheshire and his pal but only them mind not one of my own officers is to be used let them go through my socks pamelas knickers and everywhere else you go along with them though alex and look over their shoulders just to keep them on their toes they wont like the business any more than i do i suppose he growled tell you one thing i really dont like though and thats jimmy letting them use my office i know why he did it to keep them out of sight of the troops as much as possible but i dont have to enjoy it even though i would have done the same thing myself because when this is over and i go back in there ill always know its a bit like someone sleeping with your wife i suppose or your husband said alex instinctively and as unthinking as her father mitch laidlaw coughed to break the silence look this will all be over soon he said i know its tough on you both therell be more pain murmured skinner before anything starts to heal he reached across and squeezed his daughters hand one thing i was going to ask said laidlaw casting around desperately for anything that would change the subject cheshire for the record what is the al short for alan alexander skinner smiled again hell of a good question he replied weve all got a secret somewhere but in the end noones is safe from me algernon thats cheshires secret hes an algernon they say that someone called him algie once and was never seen again bff pamela shuddered in andy martins armchair it makes my flesh creep she said to know that even as were sitting here strangers are searching my home skinner smiled glancing across at martin i suppose its a sort of justice for a copper you and i have done the same thing to other people often enough he looked round at pam maybe you havent honey not yet at least but its part of the career youve chosen part of making a difference as you put it perhaps its only right that we should have a taste of how our subjects feel not so much the villains were after but their families when we invade their homes and start tearing the most private parts of their lives apart remember that japanese bloke out in balerno talking about private parts you mean interjected martin from the kitchen door skinner laughed short and savage and in that time a gleam came into his eye pam started in her chair as she caught a glimpse of a man she did not know a glimpse she realised of bob as he had been before life had cut him so deep she shivered slightly as she realised also that perhaps it was a man she did not really want to know aye maybe he said but i was trying to be serious i was thinking of his poor bewildered wife confronted with a team of hardfaced men and women bursting into her home armed with a warrant as far as i know shes back in japan now picking up her life but i bet thats one experience shell never get over weve got it easy pammy compared to her our houses are being gone over by a dcc and a chief super not by tom dick and harriet or even neil mario and maggie but what about yours she said wont they be tearing up the carpets and everything nah theyll be going through the motions algernon knows well enough that if i am bent ive had time and warning enough to hide the evidence where hell never find it in a real search for a single piece of paper he wouldnt just be under the carpets hed be under the floor and into the ventilation grilles and damp courses thats right pam called martin in his chefs apron quartering s a yellow pepper ready for the food processor only he doesnt expect to find it because he doesnt really believe bobs bent he stepped back into the doorway where would you hide a piece of paper he asked skinner smiled same place as you and ill betalgie looks there too behind him the livingroom door opened alex stood there smiling all over she said congratulations you two all three houses are clear they were very thorough they even looked among jazzs nappies down in fairyhouse avenue but they cleared everything up too too effing right said bob did they say anything about the search no salmon has agreed that mr laidlaw should sit in on the interview though she looked across at andy and at the pepper in his hand is that as far as youve got with dinner here out of the way the kitchen was too small for four to work together and so bob and pam went out together to the nearest oddbins to choose the wine for the evening they took a conscious decision to talk about golf music food and drink over dinner anything bob insisted but work politics and sex but eventually the meal was over eventually the dregs of coffee were drying in their cups ive got something else for you now said andy to skinner at last something that pams been involved in joe doherty called today bob started in his seat nothing to do with sarah he asked but his friend stilled his anxiety with a smile and a shake of the head no no this is some checking up we asked him to do under the old pals act on the ownership of spotlight we got a result remember everard balliol skinner frowned yank golfer witches hill proam bad loser am i getting close spot on andy launched into joe dohertys account ofballiols interests of his nature and of his scottish connections what does that make you wonder he asked when he was finished a hell of a lot my son said bob a hell of a lot you know i was wondering what to do with myself tomorrow with me having to keep back from the investigations and away from my own bloody office i thought that id be at a loose end not any more now my sundays laid out for me how asked alex what will you be doing im surprised you have to ask daughter ill be driving up to erran mhor north of fort william mr everard balliol is one bastard that i want to look in the eye pamela was at work at her desk when martin and alan royston returned from the stormy sunday morning press briefing held only to record the fact that twentyfour hours after the murder of the secretary of states wife there was still no progress to report not unnaturally neither man was smiling she had offered to go with skinner on his search for balliol but he had turned her down firmly i cant do anything to help find these kids pam but you can even if its only by sitting at a desk beside a telephone waiting for it to ring and so she had gone to work to her desk and the telephone had rung once she waited for alan royston to leave the chief superintendents office before knocking on his door excuse me sir she said impeccably formally while you were away there was a call from a lady she didnt leave a name just a number she handed him a note and left once he was alone he punched the number which pamela had given him into his direct telephone the call was answered after three rings yeah said an unmistakably american voice andy martin head of cid edinburgh you rang me yeah hi im caroline farmer i called about the tape you sent down yesterday no luck with this one im afraid is there anything at all that you can tell me the scot asked nothing thats gonna help you the message was recorded on some fairly average equipment a standard ghettoblaster id say apart from the sound of the tape motor itself and someone breathing next to the mike there is absolutely no background noise this tape was recorded indoors for sure theres no traffic noise no birdsong no rustling leaves just that motor and the breathing like i said how about the message the news bulletin and the child were definitely recorded at the same time were they for sure the radio sound came from another receiver if hed been dubbing off the ghettoblaster itself you wouldnt hear the kid over it as it fades also theres a faint click as he switches the other radio off how about the breathing itself caroline farmer chuckled what can i tell you you breathe in you breathe out from the rate of respiration id say that it was a man but thats all sorry to disappoint fair enough sighed martin thanks ms farmer theres no disappointment we really didnt expect anything more have the tape sent back up with your report please he hung up staring out of his window and cursing quietly at the slamming of another door when he looked round there was a bullet headed figure in his doorway yes he asked curtly dont you believe in knocking not a lot no we havent met im dcc al cheshire and youll know why im here from your fiancee and from her father no doubt i wonder if i could ask you to come with me chief superintendent i assure you its necessary curiosity overcoming his annoyance martin nodded and rose following his visitor out of the office past pamela and past sammy pye both of whom looked up as they passed have you seen salmon yet he asked outside in the corridor yes said cheshire amicably he is an obnoxious little shit isnt he pity you couldnt make that cocaine charge stick he didnt tell us anything new really still insists that his sources on both stories about skinner were anonymous dyou believe him doesnt matter really we cant force him to tell us anything the way were set up do you martin smiled and shook his head i never believe salmon not unless i know hes terrified then i suggest you scare him mr martin said cheshire quietly he led the way into skinners office chief superintendent ericson was waiting inside grimfaced we wanted you to see this right away said the investigator even though youre skinners mate youre the senior man available as you know we searched his premises yesterday and miss masters flat clean as a whistle as wed expected and frankly as wed hoped but we were sitting here half an hour ago when ronnie said to me al where do you feel most secure and i said to him in my office dont i so we searched in here and im afraid we found this he walked behind skinners desk and pulled out the top right hand drawer raising it slightly to free it from its track and lifting it clean out he upturned it and held it out to martin the chief superintendents heart sank and his face fell taped to the underside of the drawer was a receipt he looked closer it bore a signature a number the crest of the jzg bank guernsey and a second number uk im sorry mr martin i really am but were going to have to see the lord advocate at this point with a recommendation can you call in a forensic team for us please i want this item removed by them with the greatest care then dusted independently for fingerprints i think you should call your chief constable as well as a courtesy not miss skinner however weve reached a stage in this investigation when cooperation with the defence team should be suspended in everyones interests i hardly think i need to tell you chief superintendent but we really are talking about criminal charges now it is the variety of landscapes confined within such a small country that makes scotland a remarkable place there is the flat industrial spread of the central belt everchanging in character as the blackest of the black country disappears to be replaced by new clean sunrise industry there are the rolling uplands of the borders regions with their sheep and cattle grazing on their moors and pastures there are the fertile coastal plains of the lothians and fife their fields yellow in spring with rape flowers and golden in summer with wheat and with barley to fill the makings and to the north beyond the foothills of the campsies and the ochils there stand the highlands the mountain country where some say the real scotland lies the land which gave its men to rally behind the banner of the young pretender bob skinner was a cynic when it came to the myths and legends of his own country as he drove through glencoe he recalled that its notorious massacre had been perpetrated by scot upon scot clan upon clan a family feud reaching a bloody conclusion he knew that for all of those who had backed prince charlie the jacobite there were many others who had maintained their loyalty to the crown distant and germanic though it may have been it was the grandeur of the mountains which touched the patriot in him the suddenness of their approach seemed to give them stature above their measured height there was no rolling approach to distant heights across a hundredmile plain as with the pyrenees or the alps he had seen both he had walked in both yet neither impressed him as did the mountains of his home there was something great and looming and threatening about ben nevis approached from the south and about all the other munros the scottish peaks of greater than three thousand feet it was small wonder he thought as he drove on that someone like everard balliol to all intents as american as the stars and stripes itself should be drawn back to roots which had been physically severed hundreds of years before he thought of the american as he drove and their last meeting under a gathering storm around the eighteenth green of witches hill golf and country club sallowskinned midfifties gunmetal crew y cut hair tall and lean those intense ruthless deadly serious eyes the grudging resentful admission of defeat the challenge to another encounter any time skinner had said your place or mine balliols place erran mhor was such a significant estate that unlike most private dwellings it merited its own entry on the map of scotland the policeman stayed on the main road towards wester ross for almost thirty miles after passing through fort william at the base of the great ben eventually he came upon a single signpost pointing westward like a finger and bearing the names erran mhor and loch mhor he drove on for miles along the singletrack road with the mountains behind him and without seeing another car there were few trees on the peaty plain and grey boulders and sheep indistinguishable from a distance were the only features of the landscape he had no clue of whether or not he had passed on to balliols estate but gradually the road rose once more towards a horizon above which he could see wheeling gulls as he crested the rise the landscape changed before him the land stretched cultivated and tended with neat forest plantations reaching towards the head of a loch he pulled his car to a stop in a passing place and climbed out picking up a small pair of binoculars to survey the scene on the northern shore of loch mhor skinner could see the turrets of a castle an impressive structure even from a distance this was no historic monument built by feudal lords over the centuries the policeman could tell but the folly of a victorian grandee indulging himself upon money flowing from the sweat of poor people in britain and around the empire beyond balliols castle and beyond a helicopter on its landing pad there was a green area with a few trees and familiar golden patches skinner smiled and sharpened the focus of his glasses men were working like ants on a determined mission there were tractors and mowers and pickups loaded with sand the billionaires golf course was nearing completion he climbed back into the bmw and drove on towards the mock castle when he was still a mile away he passed through a large gate a symbolic gesture really for the place was too large to be walled in beyond the entrance the road widened out into newly laid whitelined tarmac the detective drove on to the very end which came as a curve opened into a wide area beside a lawn which stretched from the castle of erran mhor down to the lochside skinner dressed in crisp blue trousers and a matching polo shirt drew his car to a halt beside a green range rover climbed out and walked across the parking area and towards the house climbing a wide flight of stairs set into the lawn and stepping on to a terrace which stretched for the full width of the fourstorey building around eighty yards he crossed it passing under a portico which arched over the main doorway one half of the great double door swung open before he reached it and a man stepped out korean skinner guessed dressed in a black teeshirt and slacks balanced lightly on his feet with brown muscles oiled and rippling the bodyguard stared at him impassively without offering a word im here to see mr balliol said the policeman i reckon he owes me a game of golf the korean stared back mr balliol please skinner repeated still the man did not move or speak okay sighed the detective at last ill play the game he took a step towards the doorkeeper as the man leapt forward to grasp him in what would have been a judo hold the policeman pivoted with exceptional speed and hit him on the temple it was a short hooking righthanded punch hard but well short of full force the koreans eyes glazed as he slumped to his knees skinner seized his right arm and twisted it round behind him jerking him back to his feet did i get the password right he asked looking towards the open door not bad said everard balliol stepping into view not bad at all for a guy your age the policeman had met the american four times and had spoken to him twice this was the first time that he had ever seen him smile skinner released the korean and patted him on the shoulder the bodyguard nodded without any sign of animosity and went inside just my rich mans game balliol grinned pretty risky game i might really have hurt that bloke the billionaire shook his head not you i guessed you wouldnt damage the guy too bad for just doing his job he stretched out his hand in a friendly greeting which skinner accepted come on in he turned and led the way into a surprisingly small hallway from which a staircase climbed you want the grand tour he asked maybe not this time balliol led him through the hall and into a study behind the stairway it had a big picture window which looked out across the golf course skinner could see two greens cut and prepared although only the one on the right had a flag in position so what brings you to see me mr skinner id have thought youd have worked it out balliol looked at him his expression guarded should i come on now you going to tell me that though you own it you dont actually read spotlight shit man drawled the texan of course i dont read that stuff would you he smiled but sometimes they do tell me whats goin in it he walked over to the window you serious about that golf game i heard you were building a course so i stuck my clubs in the car go get em then ive only got nine holes in play so far but theyre good ones tiger nakamura advised me on the layout come round to the first tee just outside the window ill call out the caddies when skinner arrived on the tee balliol was waiting for him with a huge bag holding a set of brand new callaways and with two more koreans dressed in black like the doorman but with white golf shoes on their feet the american handed over a map of the course and a holebyhole yardage chart were playing ten to eighteen he said the earth moving took longer on the front nine you still off seven down to five skinner replied but im out of practice you get a shot then balliol grinned hugely the practice is your problem he took out his great big bertha driver and split the first fairway skinner took a few practice swings then tugged his teeshot left into heavy rough lets play for now said the billionaire as they moved off their blackclad caddies lugging their bags and talk later tell me one thing though how dyou know about the golf course only tiger and me and a few others know about that more people must know than you think said skinner if a simple copper like me can find out about it have you got planning permission balliol laughed dont need it you gotta know that all im doing is landscaping my own back yard they played on chatting occasionally but largely in silence skinner had been serious about his lack of practice putting rather than the quality of his shots kept him in touch with his hosts tidy game but when he missed from ten feet on the seventeenth the match was over the sweetness of revenge shone in the americans eye while the worm of defeat gnawed at the policemans stomach it was late afternoon when they returned to the castle where sandwiches and drinks were laid out in a great drawing room with a southward view across the loch okay mr skinner said balliol at last as he and his guest looked out across the terrace so youre steamed up at me about that spotlight stuff the policeman shook his head no he muttered not steamed up thats an understatement the american looked at him this is something youll never hear me say again so listen good im sorry skinner looked at him in surprise but said nothing a few weeks ago balliol went on the chief editor told me that the british edition had been offered a story about a wellknown guy in britain who was twotiming his american wife and diddling this woman who worked for him the guy who claimed to have the story noel salmon thought it was a gal at first with a name like noel said he wanted a job why did this come all the way up to you balliol smiled spotlights kinda like my toy he said but im tight with my business money see and the british edition had been swallowing cash so i said a while back that all new spending had to be given the nod by me so i was asked about salmon and i said if the story holds up hire him that was the last i heard till someone sent me a copy and i saw your beefy ass on the front cover something in the americans tone made skinner guess that balliol might be homosexual he wondered if the fbi had its own suspicions i have to admit i laughed when i remembered how pissed id been with you at witches hill i didnt feel too good about your lady friend being in those shots though especially the ones where it looks like she could be you know ill pass on your regrets grunted the detective sourly shell be touched balliol looked away for a second yeah okay anyway he continued quickly at the same time as im sent the copy my chief editor says that salmon has another story about you and an illegal payment a bribe our lawyers say though no way can we use it without more evidence so the chief editor says lets pass the story on to the authorities announce that weve done it and act like the good guys we still sell magazines but we dont get sued if the story turns out wrong so i said to go ahead and thats the way it played skinner looked at him you know the real reason i came up here balliol im a great believer in looking people in the eye ive never met a man who can do that and tell me a direct lie at the same time so will you look me in the eye right now and tell me that it wasnt you who set me up with that rigged bank account then tipped off your own man about the story the billionaire turned to face him fixed his gaze upon him eye to eye and smiled shit son he laughed if id been going to set you up itd have been with a million not a miserable hundred grand id have set you up so youd have gone away for life but i didnt and that is the truth there was a long silence now said balliol breaking it finally is that all you came for or is there something else the big detective nodded yes there is your creep salmon says that the information about me came to him from an anonymous source that he doesnt know who it was tipped him off we dont believe that my pal and i we think that he was about to give it up when your lawyer arrived to get him out of custody id like you to order him to come clean now to tell me who his source is because thats the person who set me up with this phoney bribery charge balliol sighed well thats a bastard aint it id do that for you bob sir only i cant why the hell not because salmon doesnt work for me any more i told my chief editor to fire him as soon as he had sent his information to your lord guy what for balliol looked at him genuinely shocked what for because he was caught with narcotics in his possession and in the company of a prostitoot either one of those things would have got him fired from any one of my companies both together hes lucky i didnt set my koreans on him dammit cursed skinner now you have to turn out to be a closet moralist and you the owner of spotlight too nothing closet about it son the american protested spotlight exposes the private sins of public figures how can you have a higher moral tone than that despite himself the policeman laughed ill tell you a story mr morality he said a couple of years back we had some really bad trouble at our edinburgh festival someone was after something very valuable and went to extraordinary lengths to try to get it they didnt succeed and the people who caused all that mayhem were caught but they were only the hired help they had a paymaster and we never did find out who that was funny is it not that when i showed up here today you really werent a hundred per cent sure what id come about skinner leaned over his face very close to balliol am i ringing any bells here the american smiled coolly bob son i remember reading about that affair the people who did those things were completely out of control and they got their just deserts i tell you now you can dig all the livelong day and all of tomorrow and all of the day after that and so on but you will never tie me to that one believe me on this skinner stared at him evenly oh i do mr balliol i do but diggings my job and when i get started im like the seven fucking dwarfs all rolled into one arthur dorward stripped the last of the tape from the underside of the drawer hands encased in latex gloves he lifted the receipt very carefully and slid it into a large plastic envelope with a fastening along the top we wont do any tests here sir he said to cheshire as his sergeant placed the envelope in a document case id much prefer to have my full lab facilities available when we start to look for traces fair enough inspector said the investigator but if you dont mind mr ericson and i will come with you dorwards face set instantly into a frown as he sensed an implied slur on his integrity andy martin stepped in quickly thats all right arthur he said its necessary to the enquiry very good sir the redhaired man nodded but his expression remained frozen before we go to get on with it he said could i have a word with you and with the chief in private of course said sir james proud who was standing near the door of skinners office come across the corridor he glanced unsmiling at cheshire and ericson excuse us gentlemen he led his two officers out of the room and into his own suite the veteran chief looked confused angry and very upset i still dont believe it you know dorward sighed who wants to sir but if we find mr skinners prints on that receipt then you better hadnt proud jimmy barked the inspector glanced at martin with a look of panic but the chief soothed him almost at once oh arthur make no mistake i want you to do your job as honestly and as well as you always do i just hate all this thats all now what did you want to see us about here man sit down youre not on report as the chief constable ushered them to chairs dorwards brows knitted looking at him martin thought that he might be trembling slightly i had a call this morning from a specialist unit which my lab uses on a consultancy basis they were reporting on a task id given them his voice was weak faltering i hardly know how to put this gentlemen try said the chief superintendent so tersely that proud looked at him in surprise very good sir its like this then remember we found a number of hair samples trapped in the plumbing of mrs mcgraths new bathroom martin nodded almost as a reflex well as we thought we were able to identify four of them very easily the victim the child the nanny and the cleaner all the people we knew had used the basin that left us with two hair samples he hesitated again this time it was the chief constable who urged him on with an impatient frown weve subjected both of them to intensive analysis theyre both from men for a start also they have different blood groups one is perfectly common almost regulation issue you might say but the other is unusual its not a oneinamillion type but it is very unusual now as you know ordinary medical records dont necessarily include blood type so we have no way of knowing other than statistically how many people have this group and we certainly cant identify them all but where a person has been treated in hospital there youll find a note inspector dorward gulped naturally we checked at once with the hospitals in our health board area they gave us a quick response five men with that blood group have been treated in edinburgh hospitals since the beginning of last year two of them are dead one of them is still in the western a fourth is seventyseven years old the fifth he faltered once more he glanced at martin but he was looking at the floor the fifth he said at last is mr skinner silence has a quality and a value of its own it may allow time for reflection between loving partners it may contain expressions which need not be committed to words but the silence which enveloped sir james prouds office as dorward finished his story was the type which follows the lighting of a fuse eventually the explosion came sweet suffering christ boomed chief constable sir james proud are there any more rabbits in this fucking hat he glowered at martin then looked across at dorward thank you arthur difficult job telling us that on you go with cheshire now not a bloody word about this to him though not even if he asks you straight out he does that refer him to me neither of the senior officers stood as the inspector left the room jesus christ and general jackson barked the unusually eloquent proud as the door closed behind him bobs up to his neck in the shit with this corruption thing does this make him a murder suspect now martin impassive shook his head no it doesnt chief he was with pam at the time of the murder could he have left the hair when he visited the murder scene no he was suited up then and he didnt use the basin he left it there on another occasion did you know about this the chief asked suddenly his eyebrows rising you were awful quiet when dorward came out with it the head of cid nodded bob told me about it yesterday he said that he was pretty certain that one of those hair samples would turn out to be his proud jimmys mouth hung open slightly as he stared at the younger man with incredulity spreading across his face oh in the name of he wasnt screwing leona mcgrath as well was he in spite of himself martin smiled momentarily at the chiefs reaction as the truth dawned it happened just once he told me before the pam relationship began but at a time when he and sarah were having very real difficulty ever since the air disaster when bob rescued the wee chap and with all the things that happened afterwards he always took a special interest in mark after leona was elected he used to look in on them on a friday evening after work just to say hello and check that they were okay the role that all higgins would have filled had things not he paused as he and proud exchanged glances well he continued there was one friday when bob was dropped off there rather than calling in his own car hed been visiting one of the midlothian offices i think and hed used a driver leona invited him to stay for supper they had a couple of drinks he was down she was pretty low too after wee mark went to bed one thing led to another and so did they afterwards bob told me they agreed that it would be a oneoff for everyones sake he started to phone her on a friday or at the weekend instead of looking in he told me that he was never in the house again until i called him on the day of the murder andy martin shook his blond head think about it chief one evening bobs in that room in her bed next time hes there hes looking at her raped battered strangled body he said to me that holding it together was one of the most difficult things hes ever had to do i can imagine said proud why didnt he tell you about this sooner though or tell me for that matter he didnt think we needed to know chief it was only when he worked out how arthur dorward would conduct that investigation that he realised it would come out anyway sir james stood up and walked to his window its a mess andy a horrible mess i never thought id see a day like this what dyou think cheshire will make of this development if we tell him said martin this is part of the mcgrath investigation not his careful son warned the chief you have to remember to think like a policeman here not as a friend this has to do with bob cheshires investigating bob we dont have any choice but to tell him he wont think bobs implicated in the murder not for a second but hell be entitled to consider it to be evidence of moral instability the chief constable shook his silver head wearily i mean if we look at this thing dispassionately if we just think in terms of mr x and do our jobs what have we got a secret account for a hundred thousand for the benefit of mr x his signature lodged with the bank the deposit receipt found concealed in his office against all that what is there alexs point which you mentioned about the bank of england notes and the fact that the courier may or may not have been leona mcgraths killer who may or may not have a grudge against mr x not the strongest defence ive ever encountered proud jimmy sighed lets face it all we have is the fact that you and i cant believe that bob skinner could possibly be corrupt yet take your mind back twelve months and ask yourself at that time whether its possible that in a year hell be split from his wife and son and living with another woman he looked back at martin who looked at the floor and shook his head slowly anyway andy the chief constable went on none of that is either relevant nor proper we are senior police officers with a public duty if this was anyone else hed be charged by now on the basis of those facts alone see if cheshire and ericson are still in the building will you we have to tell them what we know its grim isnt it asked alex no love andy replied sincerely its much worse than that whatll they do now theyll continue to look into every aspect of your dads recent investigations to try to find a link with the bank account okay and they wont find it so doesnt that make it a stalemate at worst he reached out and turned her face round towards his alex this afternoon proud jimmy had to remind me to think like a policeman now ive got to remind you to think like a lawyer al cheshire doesnt need to find any more there neednt be any link to a past enquiry the crown can argue that the money was a down payment for future services finding that receipt hidden in bobs desk was a real killer they can go back to lord archibald any time they like and recommend prosecution cheshire said hed let me know when they finally decided to do that he said hed keep me informed of anything else they turn up anything else such as who knows after today tears of helplessness sprang into her eyes andy this is a nightmare i know pops has had a terrible time over the last few months but he hasnt changed that much this is my dad and hes still one of the two best men in the world he drew her to him and hugged her as they stood in the window of the haymarket flat looking up towards princes street and the castle i know sweetheart the chief may tell me to think like a policeman but i just cant in this case i dont give a bugger about the evidence bob didnt do it and thats that alex was sobbing now in his arms but andy what if hes convicted then ill leave the force if necessary to prove his innocence you mean because he wont be able to where hell be shh wee one dont imagine that even for a second i try not to but the thing you told me about last night about pops and leona how much harm can that do probably none injury terms i doubt if it would be admissible in evidence no its damage is in the way that it makes cheshire and ericson see bob as being flawed vulnerable open to offers if you like he squeezed her shoulders again listen youre one of his team you have to keep fear at bay youre seeing old christabel tomorrow she should be good for morale i never asked you said alex dyou know her andy smiled i dont know how to answer that she isnt an acquaintance yet i know the old witch all right she crossexamined me once in the high court i was only a baby dc then in some breakingandentering thing id only been involved in interviewing the minor witnesses the advocate depute took me through it a bit casually maybe then it was her turn she stood there over her papers and by god did she put a spell on me she started going on about witness a witness b and witness c and by the time she was finished i hadnt a bloody clue who was who every question she asked her voice got louder and louder until she was bawling at me like an old cow across a field my mother was there too to watch me give evidence in the high court for the first time so proud shed been he laughed afterwards outside in the corridor id to stop her from tearing into christabel for bullying her boy i tell you with her on his side bobs got a chance whatever the evidence thats been set up against him the clock on the bmw showed am when skinner pulled into a vacant parking space outside pams converted warehouse he had expected her to be in bed asleep but as he turned his key in the lock and opened the front door he heard the sound of music playing softly from the stereo there was no light in the living room other than that of the city outside diffused by the muslin drapes but he could see her silhouette as she sat waiting for him in her armchair her legs doubled beneath her she turned towards him as he entered the warm room from the slope of her shoulders and the swell of her breasts he could tell even before his eyes grew accustomed to the dimness of the light that she was naked she rose and came towards him to wrap herself around him to press her body against his i was just beginning to worry she whispered pulling his head gently down and kissing him its been a long day for you did you find balliol did he tell you what you wanted to know he swept her up in his arms and carried her through to the bedroom the music she began let it play out he laid her down on the bed and began to undress yes i found balliol he said quietly no he didnt tell me because he doesnt know either salmons been fired into the bargain thats good news at least skinner shrugged his shoulders as he stripped off his polo shirt all in a single supple movement christ he said i hum what with the golf and the journey think ill take a shower he stepped out of his slacks and briefs salmon was just a commodity to balliol he went on something to be bought and traded in once it was used up as he headed for the bathroom she rose to follow incidentally he called over his shoulder his voice loaded with irony everard sends his regrets for your personal embarrassment i told him itd make your day over dinner i told him you were still thinking about suing made your mind up yet she nodded as she watched him step into the bath and twist the shower control standing back for a few seconds till it reached the set temperature im not going to i just dont need the extra embarrassment it would bring even if they settled the press would still get hold of it he looked at her as the water began to play on his chest wed be talking serious money here from what balliol said i suspect hes already told his solicitors to deal if you press it still replied pam i want to bring no more embarrassment into your life or rather into our life because thats the way i want it skinner frowned just as he plunged his head into the spray bob she went on over the splashing of the water i wasnt going to tell you this until morning but i cant keep it in alex called she said that andy had gone out on purpose so that she could phone eh hes been forbidden to have contact with you on a personal basis what why he stepped back out of the spray because cheshire and ericson searched your office they found the receipt taped underneath one of your desk drawers breath hissed out of skinner jesus hidden in my bloody desk and i said to andy that if i had hidden it id have put it where i felt most secure that smart bastard cheshire must have thought along the same lines he smiled grimly at pam completely without humour commandment number five sergeant thou shalt not underestimate your adversary im always breaking that one if only id had the sense to search my fucking office before he did the bastard who set me up must have broken into fettes right enough i tell you when this is over im going to have such a security blitz on that office he snorted except that if i dont come up with something pretty fast when this is over im going to be the subject of some pretty tight security myself he stepped back into the shower i think ill ask to be sent to shotts prison my friend big lenny plenderleith and i would make quite a team wed be running the place inside a week dont say that pam cried she stepped into the shower beside him rubbing her face in the wet hair of his chest none of that will happen you will come up with something youre invincible dont think about it think about this instead she picked up a hot wet sponge ran it up the inside of his thigh and began to massage him he grinned down at her youre a bit optimistic arent you not even i have that good a mental isolator switch besides ive covered most of scotland today and back again he switched off the shower and reached for two towels the smile vanished and the glower was back be patient maybe after a couple of years theyll allow us a conjugal visit l skinner was familiar with parliament house and with the advocates library headquarters of the scottish bar so was alex from student visits and from occasional visits as a teenager to watch her father give evidence as a police witness in a significant trial but neither had ever been inside the lord reid building the advocates consultation centre until they arrived in its small courtyard off the royal mile number high street in new assembly close was built in by james gillespie graham as the commercial bank much later before its acquisition by the faculty of advocates it housed the popular edinburgh wax museum skinner guessed that currently far fewer people passed through its doors every year than during its time as a tourist attraction but that in income terms its turnover was far greater consultation with miss christabel innes dawson qc mitchell laidlaw announced to the uniformed faculty officer at the small desk in the reception hall very good sir said the man if your party will please go into the waiting room he pointed them towards a large leather upholstered waiting room its walls hung with works of art from the facultys extensive collection and with a large fireplace similar in size and style to that in the formal drawing room in bute house and which skinner guessed at once was original the policeman in him thought of the profitable trade in stolen antiquities and of the signs posted on several disused georgian and victorian offices in and around edinburghs golden mile which advised potential burglars that all fireplaces had been removed if they ever find out where the store is he had said once to andy martin normally an advocate will arrive to greet solicitors and clients and to take them to their consultation rooms but christabel innes dawson qc was far too senior and venerable to do her own fetching after a few minutes the attendant reappeared if you will follow me gentlemen madam miss dawson will receive you in room five the trio followed him latterly in single file because of the narrowness of the corridor which led to the rear of the building until they reached a flight of four steps with a varnished door at the top the attendant knocked opened it and announced them mr laidlaw and party miss dawson christabel innes dawson qc did not rise as her instructing solicitor led her client into the room she was seated at a very ordinary round table in a very ordinary room a far cry from that in which they had awaited her pleasure she surveyed them as they entered one by one the attendant retreating and closing the door finally she nodded to the solicitor well mr laidlaw the words seemed to roll from her tongue i had begun to despair that you would ever instruct me in a case i know all about you mind when ken my clerk told me you wanted me in this matter i asked three senior members of faculty about you two of them described you as the best litigation solicitor in scotland the third said you were a shark in a lagoon filled with holidaymaking children i think he was saying the same thing as the other two only in a different way sit down sit down please youre all so tall she turned her attention to skinner well chief inspector or what is it now this is a sad surprise i never imagined for one instant that when the great mr laidlaw finally called on me it would be to represent you in a criminal cause last time our paths crossed literally was in aberlady i think a couple of weeks ago your informal salute was appreciated so few people pay respects these days to a funeral cortege there was a time when gentlemen always removed their hats as a hearse passed by so few gentlemen left now she mused maybe just fewer with hats miss dawson said skinner gently maybe maybe her eyes flashed suddenly with a cunning gleam if memory serves you were in your car with the young lady ive been reading about well i certainly wont be the one to criticise you for such a relationship she frowned for an instant id tell her shes a bloody fool though beside her father alex gasped but miss dawson ignored her presence she guessed that with her apprenticeship completed and two or three years experience at the bar she might merit a nod skinner looked at his senior counsel he had seen her only twice before out of her court dress each time from a distance for their meeting she wore a formal charcoal grey suit and a white blouse with a ruffled collar he guessed that she had a dozen such outfits in her wardrobe and precious little else close to she really did look old he realised but he was not surprised since judging by the year of her calling to the bar she could not be less than seventyeight years old he had expected her hair to be shorter and more grey until he took a second look and realised that she wore a wig not only for court but on all public appearances but her voice disguised her frailty and her years it had kept its strength through over fifty years of practice and even now it was only faintly reedy as she spoke she addressed laidlaw once more thank you for the papers which you sent to my clerk i have read them she glanced quickly and slightly mischievously at skinneryou realise that means that the meters running young man skinner nodded he knew also that her meter was one of the most reasonable at the bar although her clerk was free to negotiate private fees she never charged more than the appropriate legal aid rate for criminal work she looked directly at laidlaw once more as i say ive read them and ive been made aware of yesterdays subsequent development the discovery of the receipt in mr skinners office im glad at least that there were no fingerprints on it you know i must ask you this would a plea of guilty be considered by our client should the crown wish to negotiate surrender terms mitch laidlaw shook his round head vigorously under no circumstances our client maintains his innocence and believes that he is the victim of a clever ruthless and wellplanned conspiracy he relaxed slightly in any event given the evidence which they have its difficult to imagine how the crown could come up with a reduced charge or why it would wish to indeed very well lets look at our cards she leaned across the table her skinny arms folded on the face of it the signature is a problem however i note mr skinners explanation of how it might have been obtained i find that credible so i believe will the members of the jury as long as we can sow other seeds of doubt in their minds in respect of other aspects of the crown case she glanced briefly at skinner i like the point about the bank of england notes i think that is odd enough to start the jury thinking also then there is the bank managers unwitting identification of the photofit of the suspect in the mcgrath and anderson cases as the courier who delivered the money a chap with evident malice towards our client thats a piece of luck hold on though miss dawson skinner intervened thats a coincidence thats all not even i believe for a second that its the same man the ancient queens counsel gathered her breath and frowned at him with a degree of outrage what you believe or do not is of no interest to me or relevance to your case you are the accused here not the investigator it is what i can make the jury believe that will determine your future liberty so any doubts you may have about your own defence arguments would be best kept to yourself the big policeman grinned noone had spoken to him in that tone since he was a detective constable we can argue on both those points his counsel continued but for me the strongest card they have is the crowns lack of information on who might have paid this money and for what purpose she looked at skinner again now she said ill ask for your professional view would you be completely happy to be proceeding in a case with such an omission the dcc considered her question and as he did he began to feel optimistic for the first time in fortyeight hours no he answered at last i dont think that i would he grinned i certainly wouldnt fancy having you crossexamine me in those circumstances the old lady nodded her gracious thanks for his compliment very well then gentlemen our best hope is that the donor of this hundred thousand pounds remains unidentified who knows mr skinner legally you may even be able to keep it mitch laidlaw smiled at the idea what can we expect next miss dawsonhe asked a charge i should think the secretary of state has really set up poor archie nelson with his damn investigation politics and justice arent supposed to mix but in these circumstances i doubt if the new lord advocate can afford not to let this one go to trial so youd better brace yourself young man she addressed alex for the first time and you young lady it will probably get worse before it starts to get better sir james said cheshire sitting not in the comfortable suite where callers were usually received but in a straightbacked chair set in front of the chiefs big desk you really shouldnt be doing this you know my remit here is to investigate and report to the lord advocate noone else proud jimmy nodded so ive been told and ive gone along with it for long enough he paused and tapped the heavy silver braid on the epaulettes of his uniform jacket but the fact is i wont have anyone operating as a police officer anywhere in this building or even in this city and imagining that ive no jurisdiction over what he does im the chief constable here youre out of your own area and you will answer any question which i choose to put to you i may have ordered andy martin not to see bob skinner informally until this nonsense is over but thats purely because i dont want to take the slightest chance of compromising his career if you think im going to sit on my arse and just watch as my deputy and one of my best friends to boot is sent down the swannee then think again sir i know all about the declared and physical evidence that you have now i want to know what youve got on who might have set bob up or bribed him said cheshire coldly dont even think that in this office barked proud far less say it now i want to know what youve done to check into people hes put away in his time you can and no doubt will tell archie nelson all about this but ive seen off a right few lord advocates in my time so that doesnt worry me ive given you an order now obey it cheshire capitulated very good the fact is he began the list isnt a very long one there are very few of skinners customers with the means to do something like this and theyre all inside weve been to see the chap plenderieith mmm big lenny that was brave of you cheshire nodded i thought so too hes bit of a monster isnt he however he does seem to hold skinner in high regard id expected to find malice there but when i put the suggestion to him that he might have set this thing up he took real offence in fact he left ronnie and me in no doubt about what he would do to anyone who was out to get skinner you dont surprise me said the chief he was in no doubt about it being a setup then none at all it seemed he offered to help us in fact i gather that mr plenderleith is a very important man in prisoner circles yes hes very rich as well as being very dangerous i see said the mancunian we accepted his offer in any event as long as he promised not to have anyone killed he did hes putting out feelers to see if anyone knows anything about it proud nodded thats unconventional but go on next we looked at the chap who was arrested after the witches hill affair he hadnt a clue what we were talking about apparently he lives in voluntary isolation he refuses to do prison work and he hasnt had a visitor a letter or received or made a phone call since the day of his sentence so you can forget him cheshire went on finally we looked at the jackie charles case the chap who was arrested at its conclusion yes him growled proud youll recall he hanged himself in his cell before he could be brought to trial but then there was charles himself we interviewed him and and to be frank sir james that is where my suspicions lie charles agreed to see us without even asking why but when we got down to the substance of the enquiry the allegations he clammed up he became positively evasive wouldnt answer direct questions and finally he asked for a lawyer proud scowled across the desk jackie charles has been evasive with police officers all his life its second nature to him he knows also that theres no point in refusing to see us hes always preferred to get it over with quickly nevertheless sir countered the englishman i have to be suspicious he behaved almost coyly it was as if he didnt want to incriminate himself but he wanted us to nail skinner of course proud bellowed he hates bob it goes back almost twenty years bob arrested him in the end why the hell would he bribe him cheshire paused well sir james i know you took an interest in the case so ill have to be diplomatic here but didnt it occur to you that after all the time that it took to nail charles it was odd that the charges skinner pressed against him should be limited to tax evasion even in england we were aware of the case we expected many more serious charges possibly murder or attempted murder it was prouds turn to be hesitant there were circumstances he said which led bob to conclude with the agreement of the procurator fiscal i must stress that we should accept a plea to the counts we were sure of maybe there were sir but as dispassionate investigators looking at the current set of circumstances we have to look at the possibility that there may have been private considerations of which you were not aware aye i suppose so the chief agreed reluctantly so whats your next move its being made right now sir james by ronnie ericson weve looked at that case in the most minute detail and theres one thing we want to check for everyones sake said cheshire heavily i really do hope that it draws a blank maybe ill be like christabel in about sixty years said alex what cried her father vehemently a driedup old dear with nothing in your life except the law god forbid i hope that in sixty years time you will be secure in the enjoyment of your children and grandchildren and still gaining pleasure from the care you lavish on your venerable husband and on my centenarian father i hope he grinned across the garden table of the fairyhouse avenue bungalow having used his unaccustomed leisure time to shop at the nearby sainsburys for a saladandsandwich lunch for two no bloody chance of that he chuckled ill be in dirleton cemetery by that time beside mum asked alex quietly serious suddenly he shook his head no ive bought another lair a bit along from her grave i wont lie with myra again not even in death youll have that option though with whom will you lie then pamela or will it be time will tell he said shortly it wont be my decision i hope jesus girl but this is morbid change the subject she tried to catch his eye but for once he avoided her gaze pops are you beginning to he cut her off i mean it lets talk about something else so what did you make of our learned counsel shes formidable still isnt she just saidalex she seems to be as sharp as a tack still mr laidlaw was certainly impressed by her i liked her analysis too things arent nearly as black when you look at it from her angle he smiled sure but christabel would be the first to remind you that optimism alone wont make the jury see it her way sure there are holes in the crown case but its still strong the old dear made me admit that i wouldnt choose to take it to court myself but if i was forced to it i still reckon id have at least an even chance of a conviction mind you when you add in the christabel factor the odds might tilt a bit his smile turned into soft laugh i will never in my life forget the doing she gave that fiance of yours in the witness box after ten minutes of it he more or less swore on the bible that he didnt know his arse from his elbow well she said loyally he was only young at the time what about you how did you do against her i think the referees decision was a draw she kept trying to get me to say that black might have been a bit grey if not completely white but i stuck to the script how do you think shell do with cheshire she might rattle his cage a bit but hes a cool one is algernon hell survive anyway most of what hell have to say wont be subject to challenge the question will be what weight the jury gives to old chrissies interpretation he frowned no im more worried about what shell do to jimmy will she call him absolutely for certain shell call him unless i forbid it shell want him as a character witness but shell attack him too why should she do that bob smiled come on girl are you on the team or not work it out alex bit into her last sandwich as she thought the question through as she chewed she began to nod yes she offered at last shell have to rubbish the security of the police headquarters building shell have to convince the jury that someone could have walked in there and planted that receipt in your desk she looked at him sharply could they thats what happened isnt it in that case youre right to demonstrate that shell need the chief constable himself to admit it under oath spot on and will he she asked i honestly dont know my darling alex slapped the table wrinkling her forehead in a huge frown none of this should be happening she cried out its just not fair her father reached across and ruffled her hair whoever said life was my angel whoever said it wasyou go into the house and check your birth certificate im pretty certain that youll find that it doesnt include any warranties or guarantees no i dont recall that it does she said rising from the table and glancing at her watch time i was off she helped him carry the plates and mugs into the kitchen he was walking with her to the door when the telephone rang closest to it she picked it up hello she said as if to a familiar voice yes hes here she handed over the phone kissed him on the cheek and disappeared through the front door with a wave yes grunted skinner watching the door close with a surge of pleasure at the woman his daughter had become hello boss neil mcllhenney replied howre you doing fine big fella fine he paused well no im not im very very deeply pissed off if the truth be told is this a social call seeing as how im a nonpolisman at the moment of course it is boss i just wanted to make sure that youre hanging in there at the other end of the line skinner heard a soft rumbling chuckle mr martin specifically didnt tell me to call you he also told me not to let slip that the mcgrathanderson team have just had a tip from a woman out in howgate about a man taking a wee lass into a cottage out there this morning she was struggling so the woman said skinner stood bolt upright did she know the man no did she give a description tall fair slim he took the kid out of the back of a grey toyota van with a towbar who owns the cottage anyone checked yet sammy just did it belongs to a mr george he gets a council tax discount as a sole occupant but the witness says its not usually occupied its a holiday place and she hasnt a clue whether the man she saw is the owner or not skinner took a deep breath when were just leaving now mr martin the boy pye pam and me were using two unmarked cars theres an armed team on the way up now to deploy out of sight pam said the dcc sharply why pam dont worry boss the sergeant reassured him quickly shell be well back mr martin wants a woman there to look after the kids if we recover them whos carrying mr martin and me wheres the cottage you know where the old inn was yes at the end of a track just beyond it and where does the witness live in a converted steading across the field there are four houses there the uniform team has orders to empty them very good neil said skinner everything sounds fine im glad the situations in such good hands best of luck thanks boss said mcllhenney sounding a touch bewildered fancy seeing you here mcllhenney grinned as he stepped out of the passenger seat of martins car opposite what had once been the howgate inn a popular midlothian watering place just for a minute there i i thought id go for a drive replied skinner casually forestalling him something going on here an attractive blonde woman in her midforties stood beside him three other people two more women and an elderly man residents of the steading the sergeant guessed were gathered a few yards away with a uniformed constable this is mrs christopher said the dcc as martin approached followed by pam and sammy pye from a second car your witness thats good nodded the chief superintendent there are a few other questions i wanted to ask skinner smiled mrs christy the grey vans been around h here for a couple of days th it last on friday night sho ye had a chat already or three weeks hack she saw e andy martin frowned mrs christophers thursday morning to the younger detfrom his pocket and the photofitd the print cou b a t q s s y os s oh w if aaidlaw tioney he didnt p to perth and told possibilities opened up in though was make that phone call mrs christ she said n certain bi i could tj of the fa somplice the solicitor suggested isiead firmly pursing his lips the only three she pointed to skinner this gentlemans already asked me that the answers still no though i havent thanks anyway said the head ofcid would you join the others now please as mrs christopher retreated he turned back to skinner how dyou think we should play this sir its your show andy the dcc replied not so as id noticed skinner grinned well i did have a quick scout around he pointed along the twisting road which led out of the village the track to the cottage is over there but youre out of its sight until youre almost at the front door the vans tucked away beyond it but its angled so that you cant make out its number dammit behind the house theres a wee patch of woodland the place backs right on to it with hardly any garden some of the armed support is in there already the rest are in the steading he looked quizzically at martin why dont neil and i make our way through the woods and you and sammy go straight up the track why dont we call in the sas asked pye because there is at least one kid in there that we know of sam skinner replied the sas go in bloody i dont want any child deafened by a stun grenade or shot by this man in a panic thats right said the chief superintendent lets be gentle about it ill just walk up and knock the front door with you two out the back and all that firepower in the woods and across the field skinner nodded youd better advise the armed support commander if he comes out shooting or even showing a gun he goes down he grimaced i wish we knew just a wee bit more about the situation but with what weve got the balance of the risk says we do it now they split into the agreed pairs skinner led mcllhenney into the wood finding a rough path through the trees trodden down by the armed support officers a hundred yards or so into the plantation they came upon the fourstrong unit well hidden in the gloom from anyone looking from the bright afternoon outside seen any movement inside the house the dcc asked a uniformed sergeant the man looked at him clearly surprised by his presence only once sir a man came into the kitchen then went out again carrying a can of pepsi he was a dead ringer for the photofit the radio which mcllhenney was carrying crackled into life were in position martins voice sounded whispered skinner and his sergeant stepped across the low wire fence into the cottages small garden ready said mcllhenney a few seconds later they heard a loud knock a few seconds after that the back door swung open fast and a man rushed out a tall slim fairhaired man his mouth opened in surprise as he caught sight of the two detectives then panic showed in his eyes at the sight of the pistol in mcllhenneys hand he started to run for the corner of the house towards the grey van the bonnet of which was just visible he had taken two steps when skinner hit him slamming into him with a rugby tackle and bearing him to the ground roughly the dcc rolled the man on to his face and drove a knee into the small of his back as he reached for his wrists to secure them the girls voice took him by surprise what are you doing to my daddy she cried what have you done with him asked alex hes on his way back to england right now pamela and sammy pye are driving him and wee sally down to york theyll be met at the police headquarters there by two officers from the suffolk force theyll hand him over stay overnight in york and come back tomorrow morning has he done this before this mr george martin shrugged once is too often for the courts liking the custody arrangement in his divorce only allows him one weekend a month and he doesnt like it he wanted to take his daughter on holiday for a week but his exwife refused so he turned up at her house yesterday evening and grabbed the child the mother went to court this morning and the judge ordered his arrest for contempt i feel a bit sorry for the guy really hes just a decent honest soul a selfemployed electrician who works on big projects thats why his van was away for a few days at a time the exwifes a lawyer though and shes got him tied up every way alex reached across the dining table and punched him lightly on the chin just you bear that in mind then she laughed did pops hurt him much this poor chap not really he just knocked the wind out of him he scared the wee girl though he was a bit upset about that it would have scared her more if big neil had shot the bloke though why did he run she asked he said that he was going round the side of the house to see who was at the door when he saw bob and mcllhenney pistol drawn he panicked and tried to leg it and was it his cottage his dads his wife didnt know about it apparently alex frowned poor sod its awful when couples get to that stage whatll happen to him dyou think ach the judge probably keep him in custody for a week or two then give him a bollocking and let him go hopefully hell review the custody deal while hes at it i think the guys got a grievance he glanced at her across the pizzas your dads on his side too of course i only hope it doesnt come to that with him and sarah it wont how can you be so sure i know my dad thats how and my stepmum too mmm andy mused i miss sarah you know wonder how shes doing or who his names terry i believe eh so pops told me sarah wouldnt she grinned at him again even more widely than before maybe she wouldnt bloody sure i would though in her shoes you can store that away for future reference too hey he asked her are you trying to talk me out of this engagement far from it she replied i want to get married his eyes widened with his smile you do when as soon as ive got my dad sorted out are you game need you ask he rose drawing her to her feet also and pulled her to him kissing her running his broad fingers through her abundant wavy hair she reached down for his belt buckle pizzas get cold he murmured sod the pizzas from time to time andy martin could convince himself that all telephones show malice towards humans especially in certain circumstances sod that he growled as it rang still he picked it up as alex watched him his face grew grim you sure he said i see no it doesnt yes ill tell her shell have him there he hung up and turned to her that wasal cheshire keeping his word to me hes fixed a meeting with the lord advocate for ten oclock tomorrow and he wants bob there theyve found something else and he thinks that lordarchibald will be forced to place formal charges theres no doubt about this is there no chance that your expert could be wrong deputy chief constable cheshire looked at the lord advocate solemnly sir weve consulted the manufacturer of the machine the companys chief design engineer himself will testify that the note which accompanied the deposit in the guernsey bank was typed on an electric machine purchased five years ago by john jackson charles automobiles limited a typewriter seized subsequently by the police during a raid on premises owned by mr and mrs charles since the day when it was impounded by mr skinner and sergeant neil mcllhenney it has been under lock and key in the production store at fettes avenue mr skinner may argue in his defence that someone found their way into his office to hide the guernsey receipt in his desk but to argue that the same person broke into the production store found that machine among thousands of items plugged it in and typed the note im sorry my lord but that is surely stretching credulity lord archibald gazed at skinner across his desk the detective stared back impassively im sorry bob he said and i have to say that im hugely disappointed are you still maintaining your innocence skinner gave no answer nor made any movement mmm said archibald youd better say nothing anyway look david pettigrew the fiscal is in the next room he will caution and charge you formally there will be no announcement from this office but you will appear in the sheriff court tomorrow to be formally remanded therell be no plea taken and of course youll be released on a simple ordination to appear at a later hearing but at the pleading diet itll be for the sheriff to decide whether bail should be allowed i think its inevitable that the case will be sent to the high court for disposal he turned back to cheshire and ericson you two get up to perth right away and see the man charles again id like to proceed against him but i dont have a prospect of success so tell him what weve got and see if hell agree to be a crown witness with immunity mitchell laidlaw stirred in his seat chair archie may i the lord advocate anticipated the rest of the question yes he said you may interview charles also separately but i mean you and you alone not bob under any circumstances and not alex either he rose ending the meeting now lets get pettigrew in here and start putting this most unfortunate business to rest ys iiss that tears it bob said laidlaw charles has given cheshire and ericson a statement saying that he paid you the hundred thousand as a bribe to secure reduced charges he says that you gave him a sealed envelope with the destination bank inside and that he passed it unopened to his associate douglas terry further he goes on to say that it was terry who is of course conveniently dead who hired the courier and arranged the gathering in of the money the crown will probably argue that terry may have raised the cash in england knocking the banknote defence on the head does charles admit to typing the note asked skinner laidlaw nodded yes he does the lawyer sighed bob would charles have spent a hundred thousand just to frame you the big policeman smiled grimly it sure looks like that doesnt it the two men with andy martin were in the living room at fairyhouse avenue so where do you think the typewriter thing puts us mitch in terms of our defence skinner asked ive spoken to miss dawson about that by telephone the solicitor replied her view is that its very serious indeed it almost completes the chain of evidence however she still feels that as long as the crown cant produce the note which charles alleges you gave him she has a slim chance of steering the jury towards a not proven verdict providing she can also convince them that your signature could have been obtained by trickery skinner turned towards his solicitor the balls in your court you go back to see christabel start work on a defence as for me im going looking for mr noel salmon im going to do something i should have done long ago im going to scare the shit out of that little man and with it hopefully a name he smiled wickedly you see the one thing that jackie charles would find it difficult to do from his hotel suite in perth jail is to make a private unrecorded call to salmon to tip him off about the bank account jackies cute hes turned cheshire and ericson back on themselves and got them to buy a statement that could be complete supposition on his part hes built his story on things that theyve told him the idea that he agreed to pay me off then turned the mechanics over to dougie terry thats brilliant for two reasons one because thats exactly how he used to work and two because terry isnt around any more to contradict him not that he would have dougie the comedian would have died for charles come to think of it he did skinner smiled again in recollection this time jackie to terry terry to someone else and that someone else did whatever needed doing one to one all the time so there was never any corroboration that was the way they worked and it was the reason why we were never able to nail jackie for any of the big stuff he was involved in thats why the idea of bunging me to reduce the charges is all so much shite we always needed terrys evidence to be sure of convicting charles so when he got his head caved in we were stuffed thats something jackies overlooked in his eagerness to nail me and cheshire and ericson didnt realise with terry dead there were no other charges we could have made stick christabel should be able to take him apart in the box with that he turned to martin andy would you do me a big favour dont tell anyone about it just do it please ask mcguire and mcllhenney if they would go up to perth to question charles tell them to get him to go over his statement again and again and again tell them also while hes doing that to drop in plenty of hints about perjury charges and the penalties jackies out on a limb you see i reckon hes seen a chance to get even with me and hes jumped at it but if we can undermine his confidence scare him a wee bit about the risk hes taking hint that there are one or two things that he doesnt know about then maybe just maybe hell withdraw that statement will you do that martin noddedof course thanks but explain to mario and neil that this isnt an order if either of them feels uncomfortable about it ill understand you really do think charles is lying bob dont you said laidlaw that he couldnt be the one whos set you up im certain of it he had nothing to do with that money he didnt know about it till cheshire and ericson went up to perth and told him but when they did a whole world of possibilities opened up in his devious wee mind the one thing he couldnt do though was make that phone call to salmon maybe he had an accomplice the solicitor suggested skinner shook his head firmly pursing his lips the only three accomplices jackie charles ever had in his life were his wife carole tony manson and dougie terry and theyre all dead no the person who gave that information to salmon was the person who set me up without any assistance from jackie or anyone else he stood abruptly right mitch youd better go and see christabel again ill meet the two of you at the sheriff court tomorrow nine thirty as davie pettigrew asked andy you talk to mario and neil about going up to perth martin nodded are you going after salmon because if you find him i wouldnt want his friend laughed you wouldnt want me to damage him you were going to say dont worry son ill get the truth out of that wee man without laying a finger on him anyway he can wait till tomorrow this afternoon im going out to gullane i was reminded on sunday that my golf games a bit rusty so just for a break and to let me do some uninterrupted thinking i think ill hit a few balls when pam gets back from york tell her thats where ill be and that ill probably stay out there tonight if she wants to join me sure ill do that his right eyebrow rose with a recollection speaking of your lady he added i had a call this morning from the central force the woman shes due to replace has had a complication of pregnancy so shes gone off earlier than scheduled theyd like pam right away if they can have her how soon thursday if possible can you spare her i think in all the circumstances itd be best if i could then talk to her about it and as long as shes happy thatll be fine then the two of us can get on with sorting out our future i think i owe it to us both to make an honest woman out of pamela how long have you got to do jackie asked mcguire john jackson charles managing somehow to look immaculate even in badly cut prison clothes looked at him coolly i expect to be released in two years and one month as you must know this story the one youve told us twice now about our boss said neil mcllhenney you wouldnt have the idea would you that it might get you out a year or so early im not so naive sergeant mcllhenney laughed i know that all right youre not infallible either though if you were you wouldnt be wearing that fucking awful suit right now daks is your preference isnt it yes countered charles evenly and hugo boss just for the odd bit of variety you understand ive got a wardrobe full of them waiting for me dior shirts too you might find it easier to put them on when you get out growled mcguire why you might not have to pull them over your head because you might not have a rucking head by then jackie charles looked at the silent guards standing by the door of the prison interview room are you threatening me inspector mcguire flashed his best latin smile not at all i was just hinting at something you might have forgotten suppose this bright idea of yours actually works and a jury believes that you bribed our boss hell go down undoubtedly seven or eight years probably while you as a crown witness will be immune from prosecution the scottish prison network isnt all that big the odds against big bob being sent here arent all that great suppose you two wind up in the same nick have you considered what he might do to you the first flicker of doubt showed through charles confident veneer why would he do that he solicited the bribe he only has himself to blame mcllhenney grunted i know big bob a bit better than you jackie he might not see it that way and the inspectors right you know hes got a real nasty streak to him christ if he could put big lenny plenderleith in hospital whats he going to do to you lets just go over this story of yours one more time said mcguire charles sighed really humour us just one more time oh very well but just once more and thats ityour great skinner approached me last year we go way back you know bob and i he thought rightly as it turned out that one of your guys might be on the take i made enquiries about some things that my wife and dougie terry were doing and found that he was right into the bargain i found out that i was in some trouble so i went back to bob and i gave him the name of your bad apple i also suggested very obliquely that there might be something in it for him if he could limit my personal damage he looked at mcguire and mcllhenney his eyes wide and innocent to my surprise he came back to me and said that his terms were a hundred thousand cash payable in accordance with instructions in a sealed envelope he told me that it contained the address of a bank and a copy of his signature and personal details in return he said that charges against me would be limited to tax offences and that i would do a year eighteen months at the most and you agreed to pay this backhander asked mcllhenney yes i decided that it was a worthwhile investment so i gave the envelope unopened to douglas and told him to make it work two days later he came back to me and told me that the arrangements had been made and gave me the name of the bank to which the money had been sent why did you decide to shop him now charles smiled grimly when i heard about the publicity over bobs private life it occurred to me that his feet of clay had been exposed so i decided to drop a word i didnt intend that it should get back to me of course i thought that evidence of the payment would be enough mcguire leaned forward forearms on the table how did you get that word to the lord advocate he asked we know you didnt phone his office from here that would have been picked up charles hesitated for the first time taken aback by the question i found someone from edinburgh who was being released first thing next day he replied at last and gave him an anonymous note addressed to the crown office handwritten suggesting that someone should look at the jzg bank in guernsey thats right what was the name of the man who dropped the note for you charles shrugged i cant remember he was just another inmate his name wasnt salmon was it asked mcllhenney noel salmon the prisoner hesitated again yes he said finally that was it the two policemen looked at each other smiling interview suspended said mcguire reaching across to switch off the tape recorder on the table jackie he grinned youve blown it twice noel salmon delivered the message all right but he was never in here he should have been but he wasnt he didnt deliver it to the crown office either but to the secretary of state and because his boss told him to not you youre a liar charles and if you go into the witness box to tell that fairy story about bob skinner well destroy you with whats on that tape there arent too many perjury trials but when they happen the judges are always tough we can also charge you right now through that tape with giving false information to the police mcguires smile vanished completely his eyes hardened as he leaned forward and focused on the man across the table this is a onceonly offer jackie you may withdraw the statement you gave cheshire and ericson and you withdraw it right now you may admit that you have no knowledge of and had no involvement in the opening of the guernsey bank account you can do that right now and no action will be taken against you persist and i doubt if those suits will still fit by the time you get out theyll certainly be well out of fashion now which is it to be charles looked at him for around ten seconds unwavering then without warning his eyes dropped he sighed and he nodded mcguire reached across and switched in the tape once more interview resumed detective inspector mcguire and detective sergeant mcllhenney present in perth prison with john jackson charles for all her natural confidence and selfbelief and for all her involvement in her fathers defence team alex still felt slightly overawed when she was summoned to the office of the head of the partnership the call from mitchell laidlaws secretary came just after pm the unexpected presence of christabel innes dawson qc did nothing to calm the nerves tugging at her stomach you sent for me mr laidlaw she asked yes alex miss dawson thought it would be good for you to sit in on our consultation im sorry i really should have advised you that she was coming in to see us i enjoy the odd touch of opulence the old lady rumbled honestly i only wish i could take all the people who go on about fatcat advocates and parade them through offices like this one she glanced at skinners daughter dyou intend to come to the bar young lady ive given it some thought hmm then look around you and give it some more damned hard work damned little recognition of course i suppose in these times you would have the opportunity to become a judge if you were good enough that path was closed to me she looked more than a little angry at the recollection giving alex a sudden picture of a tiny gimleteyed figure in an erminetrimmed red robe glaring down at the court well she said fearlessly i for one am glad that youll be in the well of the court and on our side when my dads case is called the old lady smiled thank you for that compliment miss but you really should say if not when weve just had a very surprising call laidlaw nodded thats right from the procurator fiscal no less it seems that john jackson charles has withdrawn the statement which he gave cheshire and ericson she looked at him astonished and delighted simultaneously he has but why it seems that your fiance sent a couple of heavies to talk to him to clear up a discrepancy was how they put it it seems that it was big enough to persuade him to alter his recollection of events i dont suppose my dad had anything to do with it did he mitchell laidlaw smiled beatifically thats right my dear he said dont suppose how did the fiscal take it ive known him to be more cheerful christabel dawson replied he has decided to postpone tomorrows scheduled court appearance to allow him to discuss the position with the lord advocate i gather that young archie is a bit miffed that mr martins persuaders promised charles that there would be no consequences if he withdrew his statement cheshires furious too said laidlaw hes got no damn right then barked miss dawson the man obviously let slip far too much information about the allegation the first time he interviewed charles he let him know the amount the time the name and the location of the bank the awful man was clever enough to build his original story around facts gleaned from them your fiances chaps seem to have been much more subtle where will the crown go from here asked alex the ancient silk allowed herself a thin smile maybe nowhere charless behaviour has attached a bad smell to their side somehow laidlaw leaned forward in his chair smiling agreement yes into the bargain alex i was getting strange vibes from your father today even before charles decided to withdraw his evidence with things looking fairly black he was still oddly confident although he didnt say anything to confirm it i felt as if he had something up his sleeve ive no idea what it could be but i felt that it might be pretty devastating alexis skinner laughed seized by a sudden and almost overwhelming relief indeed she said i rather think i know those vibes when my father starts playing his cards close to his chest then it usually means that someones in for it and no mistake there wont be any repercussions for you will there andy after all the secretary of state did appoint cheshire to handle the enquiry could you be disciplined for intervening i suppose its possible love but i hardly think so al cheshires interview with charles was downright sloppy work all he succeeded in doing was getting him to give false evidence against bob martin smiled at his fiancee across the table over the debris of a meal which for once they had completed uninterrupted mario and neil did good work though i played their tape to cheshire this afternoon once hed calmed down enough to listen to it after a while he conceded that hed assumed too much when he interviewed charles and left himself wide open to being conned what will he do next hes doing it already he and ericson are writing up their final report to the lord advocate once its submitted theyre off home what do you think itll say i know from cheshire what itll say he grinned i shouldnt really tell you since youre acting for the accused but ill chance it they will report that even without charless admission theres still a strong case to answer the money exists the sample signature exists the note exists without using jackie as a witness the crown could try to imply a connection between the charleses either him or carole and your dad alex nodded fair enough but well be able to introduce charless withdrawal of his statement to undermine that agreed said andy yet cheshire and ericson will suggest to lord archibald that the public interest requires that charges should be brought and the matter put to the jury if for no other reason than to try to answer one of the key questions whats that whose is the money the account is in bobs name beyond question but without the charles statement or another to replace it it only becomes a bribe and thus forfeit if the jury says it is if hes tried and acquitted then i reckon that legally the moneys his she smiled just as well hell need it to pay our fees whats your gut feeling though andy do you think the prosecution will still go ahead martin sighed yes on reflection i think it will the police service cannot afford to be seen to be sweeping anything under the carpet after all the publicity this business has had if it was simply dropped with no prosecution being brought against anyone thats exactly what would be said the post lady was early on a wednesday also but skinner was showered and shaved by seven fifteen ready and waiting when he heard the loud metallic bang as the springloaded letter box cover snapped back into place he was alone having suggested to pamela that she should spend the night in leith to be in promptly for her last day at the fettes headquarters a bowl empty save for traces of milk and one sad solitary cornflake and a halffinished mug of coffee lay on the table before him as he scanned the scotsman for any reference to the charges laid against him less than twentyfour hours before to his satisfaction there was none both lord archibald and davie pettigrew had promised him secrecy until the moment of his first court appearance and they had been as good as their word reading the newspaper which led with a report of widespread demonstrations against a terrorist murder in spain he still felt the cold burning anger which had gripped him as pettigrew had recited the formal charge that he had corruptly accepted a payment of one hundred thousand pounds from a person then under investigation in respect of serious offences he felt no surprise at all only an eager satisfaction when he saw the jiffy bag with its handwritten address a twin of the earlier package except that this time the postmark was sharp and legible he looked at it and noted with interest that the padded envelope had been posted in inverness on the day before so hes taken them north he said to himself he carried the parcel through to the kitchen and opened it in exactly the same way in which he had unfastened the first taking the same precautions however when the contents of the bag finally fell on to the counter it was as he had expected a second tape cassette quickly he slid it into his hifi deck and pressed the play button the pips broke the silence of the room this is bbc radio four the announcer began the monday news headlines included reports of half a million people on the streets of bilbao in a mass demonstration and of the relatively peaceful passage of orange marches in ireland as the second story reached its conclusion the radio faded and mark mcgraths voice frightened but controlled rose once more uncle bob he shrilled mr gilbert says ive to tell you some things ive to tell you that tanyas here shes too frightened to speak and she cries all the time but shes here the next thing ive to say is that mr gilbert wants a million pounds each fortanya and me from the guvmint he says its to be paid into the bank that you know the one in the child paused as the noise of a lowflying aircraft threatened to drown out his voice in gernzie he said the name awkwardly and with difficulty as if he had needed coaching its to be paid in at exactly ten oclock on friday morning there was a pause in the background skinner could hear a murmur and the sound of a second child crying mark went on mr gilbert says ive to tell you that its money hes owed by the guvmint and that if you ask youll find out why he says that if it isnt paid you know whatll happen that is right mr skinnerthe cold flat voice broke in suddenly and unexpectedly you know exactly and afterwards there will be more the detective stared at the tape as it went dead then he rewound it and searched through it replaying the same section over and over again putting a face to a voice and making certain also that the thing which even he had believed unthinkable must after all be true skinner burst into the cid office like an avenging angel sweeping past pam with a nod and a wave and beckoning sammy pye to follow its here andy he said to the surprised martin waving a cassette the contact ive been expecting since saturday this has got to go to london too sammy its your turn for the shuttle ill give you the address and contact name now both of you listen to this he walked across to martins player and put the tape into the slot big ben followed by mark mcgraths shrill young voice filled the office did you hear he asked when it was finished the bank that i know the one in guernsey id thought that it couldnt be possible andy but its true the kidnapper and the courier are one and the same man it has to be none of that stuff has been in the public domain in any way the head of cid nodded as skinner wrote caroline farmers name and the ml office address on a pad on his desk has to be but how about the rest of it later andy later he handed the note and the original of the tape to pye get yourself a travel warrant and get going now sam tell the lady i want a full analysis as usual with a voice analysis to confirm that the man at the end is the same as in the telephone call to my house come on shift as the young constable bolted from the room skinner turned back to the chief superintendent theres something else andy he picked up the telephone and called ruth mcconnell ruthie he barked without pleasantries find big mcllhenney and get him down here martin looked at him as he replaced the phone there was a new edge to his friend beyond the underlying confidence which mitch laidlaw had described to alex and which he had observed himself this was cold hard and lethal and he had seen it before mr gilberts made a mistake said skinner you heard the plane on that tape it was a jet a military aircraft flying very low and flat out from the noise and the duration yet it was after ten in the evening gathering dusk if not dead of night there are very few places in scotland where aircraft are allowed to fly at that height and that late every one of those flights is logged and recorded in detail he paused and smiled when i saw everard balliol on sunday he went on at some length about lowflying jets over his castle he told me that the raf agreed to move the route ten miles to the north even so part of that training run probably still goes over his land martin started you dont think balliol skinner laughed everard needs a million pounds about three and a half thousand times less than you and i thats how many of them hes got already besides hes a man who thinks that all rapists and paedophiles should be castrated he turned as detective sergeant mcllhenney came into the room i owe you and mcguire a big drink neil he said but itll have to wait for now i want you to get up to raf leuchars have them plot the route of every plane they had in the air on monday night and show you on the map where each one was at exactly fifty seconds past ten then i want you to bring that map back here very good boss as the sergeant headed for the door skinner followed beckoning to martin now its our turn andy yours and mine lets leave my lovely pamela in charge of cid while you and i go for another consultation with christabel innes dawson qc shell enjoy meeting you again and this time you might too the old advocate looked at martin you have done well for yourself young man she said im willing to bet too that youve never again been as bad in the witness box as you were that day i hope not miss dawson you taught me a lesson its a long time ago though you have a remarkable memory not at all chief superintendent counsel rarely score such a comprehensive victory over police witnesses when we do it sticks in the mind skinner laughed you didnt get your client off though did you or had that detail slipped your mind she frowned at him no it had not she snapped you may well find yourself hoping that history does not repeat itself i do indeed miss dawson but lets wait and see whether we actually get to court shall we he went on were not here to talk to you about my case though i want to search your memory of the trial in which you crucified poor andy here you see although i was the chief police witness in that one i didnt lead the investigation andy and i were drafted into help the burglary unit because of the sensitive nature of the enquiry and because the superintendent who ran it mr oriordan was on the list for a back operation when it happened he did the lead work all i really did was give evidence the old lady nodded i seem to recall that i tried to challenge you but john was forced to concede that you were a competent witness your client asked skinner what do you remember of him didnt he have a german surname you are correct said miss dawson his name was heuer thats h e u e r his father was german and his mother scottish but he took his mothers nationality even served in the british army for a short while strange that he should have turned into a burglar yes he was caught breaking into the polish consul generals residence in edinburgh not far from our headquarters building he didnt really have much of a defence did he no the ancient silk agreed but he insisted on pleading not guilty he seemed to think that the charges would be dropped eventually when he agreed to make a statement he gave the oddest evidence on his own behalf he tried to say that he had entered the wrong house by mistake as if that would affect the relevance of the complaint skinner smiled i remember hearing the first part of your examination you did your best she looked at him frostily as i do always but he was guilty and the fact that he was armed added to the severity of johns sentence eight years as i recall the detective produced a tape player from his case and placed it on the table think of that voice in the witness box he asked could this be him he pressed the play button and the recording of the saturday night call to his cottage filled the consulting room miss dawson sat up sharply her ears twitching like a mouse let me hear it again she commanded skinner rewound the tape and played it once more oh yes said christabel innes dawson qc thats him all right thats heuer peter gilbert heuer id forgotten everything about him said andy martin back in his office so had i skinner agreed but why should either of us have remembered neither you nor i ever interviewed him we only handled the support players we were hauled off drugs work to do it remember and we were pissed off about it but when christabel came on the scene as my counsel and we started to talk about it i began to have an itch about something when i heard his voice on the tape this morning insistent angry as it was in court i was almost sure if the old dear hadnt picked him from the first message id have played her the other but she knew him well knew all sides of him he looked at the case notes on martins desk it reads oddly doesnt it he was caught in the polish consuls house with a gun and some of the consulate silver in a bag yet at first he wouldnt make any statement all the notes say that he was arrogant and confident yet silent as the grave until the case was almost ready for trial it reads as if he thought someone was going to spring him he acted that way in court too but if you recall my evidence was about how the technicians had found his prints on the disabled alarm and about how he had activated the second system linked direct to fettes that he hadnt known about when i was finished he knew that he was done for thinking back i remember the way he looked at me when i stepped down from the box pure hatred it was as if i had been sent along as his executioner he paused and picked up the notes when heuer was arrested he gave his address as cromden in derbyshire im sure if we had time wed find that recently hes been living somewhere in edinburgh maybe as mr gilbert you should put clan pringles team on to checking that but lets not base our hopes on us i left bruce anderson to consult the prime minister about payment of the ransom i think that hell agree but how will heuer collect it asked martin he wont leave it in guernsey thats for sure itll be forwarded to another bank and maybe one or two more after that till it reaches its final destination id guess itll go somewhere weve no jurisdiction where heuer can pick it up and disappear for good and the kids skinner looked at him you have to ask hell kill them andy if he hasnt already at best he checked his watch we have forty seven hours to find them and we cant do anything until neil gets back from raf leuchars skinner threw open the door of martins office i hate hanging around andy he called from the doorway im going off to make a phone call after that im going to find noel salmon take him into a quiet corner and find out exactly what he knows about all of this once mcllhenney gets back with a bit of luck well have a good idea of where to look for mr peter gilbert heuer given that then tomorrow well take him and pray that the children are still alive i hate to remind you bob said martin but youre still suspended bugger that when we run this bastard to ground im going to be there and no rucking politicians are going to stop me he paused anyway i called in to see bruce anderson just after eight on my way in here i played him that tape and this time i let him lift my suspension when he offered he looked across the room before i forget pammy come out to gullane tonight after all you start your new job tomorrow somehow or other we must fit in dinner to celebrate that skinner sat behind his desk for the first time in days it felt secure and comfortable as always not defiled at all by its temporary occupancy by algernon cheshire he picked up the telephone and dialled mcllhenneys mobile number road noise almost drowned the sergeants voice as he answered neil he said in something approaching a shout a slight change of plan if you get a result up at leuchars meet me at fairyhouse avenue got that understood sir there was not a hint of a question in his assistants voice skinner replaced the phone and picked up another from a book which he never left in the office he selected another number yes said the voice at the other end of the secure line knowing that wrong numbers can happen anywhere adam snapped skinner tersely its bob here hello mate all of a sudden the derbyshire accent was warm and friendly how are you doing and ows that lovely wife of yours living in america said skinner even more shortly than before im with another lady now dont you read the spotlight have you been abroad for the last couple of weeks as a matter of fact i have but still i mean jesus christ bob you and sarahadam arrow was rarely knocked off balance in any respect no time for explanations adam i need a favour very fast if i can lets hope i want you to try a name for me peter gilbert heuer mixed germanuk parentage a few years ago he was nicked in the polish consuls residence in edinburgh with a gun and a bag which more or less had swag written across it i was young and naive then but now i dont believe for one second that he was a burglar i need to know what he was there for who sent him and what his deal was meant to be okay said arrow ill try whys this name come up all of a sudden can you tell me sure mr heuer seems to have diversified into stealing politicians children and selling them back to the government for a million pounds a time i see ive heard about that all right lets not hang about then where can i get back to you use my mobile number weve no time for niceties even if the mi snoopers might overhear something that could be hazardous to their health noel salmon was easy to find there was no answer to the doorbell of his seedy flat when skinner rang it but a single phone call to john hunter established that the spotlights former ace reporter could be found on most mornings in a pub called the eastern not far away skinner knew it well it was the type of place where knives were regarded as fashion accessories the journalist had his back to the door as skinner opened it the two mens eyes met in the mirror behind the bar but before salmon had time to react far less to run the policeman reached across seized his collar from behind and hauled him out into the street into the summer rain your place or mine he hissed yours i think this time more discreet and i dont mind making a mess there he hustled his helpless captive along the wet pavement as fast as he could away from the eastern as the first curious morning drunks lurched out to see what was happening together they turned a corner and found themselves almost at the stairway to salmons building the policeman was barely breathing hard when they reached the fourthfloor doorway yet the little mans chest was heaving open it skinner snarled salmon tried to obey but he could only fumble for his key and poke it ineffectively at the lock with a shaking hand impatiently the detective tore it from his grasp opened the door and threw him roughly inside sending him tumbling and falling along the floor of the hallway the quarry scrambled to his feet completely terrified now you you you he wailed to skinners disgust his former tormentor wet himself through there he ordered the living room if thats what you call it salmon obeyed and collapsed helpless into a chair there are no lawyers about now noel snarled the policeman not a soul in fact just you and me and this place being where it is noone will remember having seen us on our way up here he crossed to the sashcord window and pulled it up tugging hard and opening a gap of around two feet know what defenestration means cockroach he asked salmon gaped at him speechless it means jumping or being thrown out of the fucking window i and that is just about where i am with you youve given me grief son and now youre going to find out just how stupid youve been im not going to thump you around or anything its as simple as this you either give me the name of the person who tipped you off about pam and me and who gave you the info on this bribe setup or out you go splat youll be back on the front page again only as a headline not a byline a drunken suicide itll be there wont even be a fatal accident inquiry skinner seized the reporter by the collar once more jerked him upright and hauled him whimpering over to the wideopen window i know it was one of two people i think i know which and im certain you do too for your sake i hope im right so whats it to be he asked and noel salmon found himself with no reason to doubt the sincerity of his question are you talking or flying skinner was in his dressing gown as he opened the door of the fairyhouse avenue bungalow for once in his life sergeant mcllhenney looked nonplussed the dcc laughed relax neil its all right im alone i just felt the need of a shower and a change of clothes thats all go into the kitchen and make us a couple of coffees the milk in the fridge should be okay ill be with you by the time youre done he was as good as his word mcllhenney turned from the counter and handed him a steaming mug as he walked into the room dressed in a black teeshirt and light cotton trousers did you get caught in the rain boss no not for long anyway the company i was in made me feel unclean thats all ive seen the last of the wee bastard though he decided to take a flight the sergeant looked at him curiously mr salmons going to make a fresh start in london i persuaded him that edinburgh was too small a place for his talents to blossom hell be able to walk on to the plane will he walk i reckon hell run up the steps so neil how did you get on at leuchars his assistant beamed his satisfaction score one for us he answered you were right or if you werent those planes were russian the co up there was a bit coy at first until i explained to him that if he didnt cooperate youd arrange for the secretary of state to shit on him from a great height from what he said he had good reason to be coy theyve been running secret tests out of leuchars at night on a new radar system using it to try to keep track of american stealth fighters you know those star warslooking things it was one of them you heard on the wee boys tape and was the course plotted mcllhenney nodded oh aye boss both by the radar system and by the planes onboard system he took a map from the pocket of his jacket and spread it on skinners kitchen worksurface we timed the noise from the big ben chimes on the tape to within a couple of seconds when the recorder picked it up it was right here travelling from east to west he leaned over the map and pointed to an oval drawn in blue ballpoint ink with an arrow indicating direction this is a detailed ordnance survery map boss the flightpath at that point went over a valley called kings gully its twelve miles north of your man balliols place on loch mhor theres nothing but hills between the two but the map shows a couple of cottages in kings gully itself yes skinner hissed i think tomorrow morning well pay a call as he spoke his mobile phone which he had laid on the counter began to ring he picked it up and answered walking towards the back door and out into the garden skinner the said adam arrow tersely your man is known to certain people down here if hes done what you say then they are very very angry with him im authorised to tell you about him also i have a very specific request for you a request not an order if you feel youd rather not then ill come up to handle the matter but the belief is that it should be dealt with locally if possible and ive told them that youre more than capable skinner felt the hair prickle at the back of his neck is this your request he asked or does it come from someone else oh yes arrow replied this doesnt come from me or my boss or even his boss it comes from the very top man from everyones boss now let me tell you about your man skinner was grimfaced and thinking hard when he walked back into the kitchen ive been thinking sir said mcllhenney if were going after this man shouldnt we let the northern force know about it kings gullys on their patch youre right neil said the dcc we should but were not going to he took the kitchen telephone from its wall bracket and dialled the head ofcids direct line andy he said as soon as the call was answered i want you to meet me at headquarters at six thirty dont discuss it with anyone not even the chief but make sure that the sports field is clear theres an army helicopter coming to pick us up just you and me that is ill be there sharp but ive something to do between now and then understood is there any equipment that you want me to draw no skinner replied the armys providing suitable clothing and boots your size and mine other items too everything well need will be on the chopper he was in the bathroom when he heard the key in the lock the door opened and closed quickly then light footsteps crossed the living room he dried his hands listening with a soft smile as he heard drawers and doors sliding and general sounds of rushing around silently he stepped out of the bathroom grinning as he stood in the doorway of pamelas bedroom christ he chuckled havent you got enough clothes out at my place already did andy let you go early its just gone four oclock with her back to the door she jumped at the sound of his voice bob she cried i almost died she turned to face him looking flushed what are you doing here i thought you said youd see me at gullane he shrugged call of nature madam like we used to say when i was in uniform i was nearby so i answered it here i didnt notice your car she said recovering her composure as you guessed i just looked in to pick up one or two more things he laughed in a suitcase he shook his head love why dont you just admit it her eyes narrowed slightly and her face flushed again as she looked at him quizzically admit what that youre moving in with me piece by piece dress by dress shoe by shoe tight by tight knicker by knicker her face lit up as she grinned gauchely like any young girl in love well she said now that im transferring to another force now that hopefully i dont have to feel threatened by this madman isnt it time that you bob chuckled again ah you mean like i said to andy that i made an honest woman of you well she asked with an expectant tone in her voice his grin widened into a broad smile then she looked into his eyes and was hit like a hammer by the truth of something that she had been told once before that he was the most dangerous man she had ever seen pamela he said quietly still smiling but deadly and cold quite literally i couldnt make an honest woman of you to save your life its way beyond that youre my implacable enemy my socalled love i was more baffled and bewildered than ive ever been trying to find the person who wanted to finish me and yet all the time i was sleeping with her even though in the end he was desperate to tell me all about it i didnt actually need noel salmon to admit to me that it was you who tipped him off about our being together or gave him the bribe information he caught her gasp never underestimate anyone even a weasel like him not even he is going to take an anonymous tip without at least trying to check the source he pushed himself upright off the doorframe remember when you called him and dropped that note for him in the dustbin near the norwegian memorial in princes street gardens he went there early and watched you drop it he didnt know who you were not then until he saw the two of us together after he started watching us when you dropped him the information about the bank account in the same way he didnt need to follow you again skinner paused at first i wondered why anyone would pick a useless pissedup wee twat like salmon as a means of shafting me but as soon as i knew it was you i worked that one out for myself you were having it off with alan royston when i barred wee noel from fettes you found out from him on the pillow which journalist hated me the most his smile was all gone now come on pam dont disappoint me protest your innocence she looked at him her oncesoft eyes blazing i cant because i cant believe what im hearing i didnt realise you were so desperate that you could do something like this if you cant believe it he answered her then why did you call air uk this afternoon and book a flight for amsterdam at five forty five this evening he eyed her evenly mario called me just afterwards on my mobile while i was in the garden at fairyhouse he smiled cruelly at her surprise ever since i knew it was you special branch have been bugging your phone thats what the suitcase is about pam she started to speak but he silenced her with a single look no dont interrupt me you are in very great danger just listen i knew it was you my pet because of two stupid mistakes you made the first was when you slipped me a blank sheet of paper to sign when you were my executive assistant for a second or two i actually believed my own story that i had given someone my autograph then i remembered that when i do that i always sign myself bob skinner the full monty signature robert m skinner thats reserved for official letters and for cheques he shook his head i should have known from the first moment that i heard of the bribe allegation that it was an inside job but there are some things that not even ill face willingly and i didnt not until alex brought me back my own signature from guernsey skinner sighed then went on in a cold even voice the clincher came when you used carole charless typewriter to type that note you never believed for an instant did you that anyone would match the note to that machine it was handy a standard electric typewriter unconnected with the force so you used it after it was recovered from the flat in westmoreland cliff that carole kept as a secret office neil and i brought it back to fettes and i put it in your room it was there for a day or so until it went off to the production store you had that time to use it in the same way as my assistant you had every chance to hide that receipt in my desk later if cheshire hadnt found it i suppose that eventually youd have dropped a hint that he should look there it would have been a clumsy accidental hint of course he said sarcastically and youd have been appalled by the way it turned out he paused the typewriter was a huge mistake really far bigger than the signature because who else could have used it i knew i didnt not neil mcllhenney in a million years not ruth mcconnell in the same million not carole charles because she was dead when most of this happened not jackie because he didnt even know about the westmoreland cliff office let alone about the bloody typewriter in fact when jackie did claim to have typed the note the whole thing screamed out at me and the last of my disbelief vanished skinner grinned again cruelly think about it pam when was the last time that you and i made love before that note was tied to that typewriter ever since then ive managed to have a headache no lady only you could have used that machine to type the note i didnt want to believe it at first i wouldnt let myself not because im deep in love with you because im not no because i didnt want to admit to myself that you could con me and maybe because i didnt want to find out why he began to move slowly menacingly towards her then something happened he said slowly that made everything else insignificant when cheshire and alex came back from guernsey with the suggestion that the man who made the cash delivery might have been the same man who killed leona and catherine anderson and kidnapped the kids at first i dismissed it out of hand but when peter gilbert heuer sent me this mornings tape that outlandish idea turned out to be the truth i made sure you were in earshot when i said that out loud in andys office this afternoon i wanted to see how youd react it didnt take you very long to call air uk because you know pamela that heuers involvement in both plots makes all of this a whole different game one with lives at stake and maybe yours among them he was standing over her now as she backed towards the window that thing he let slip my dear that he knew of the guernsey bank means that you are linked to peter gilbert heuer it means that you gave him my unlisted number in gullane just as you gave it to salmon most of all it means that you are linked to the murder of two women and the kidnapping of their children he gripped her by the arms just below the armpits and he lifted her up clear off her feet to stare into her eyes cold hard and with menace you must tell me now pamela he said evenly you have no choices left he lowered her to the ground turned her around and pushed her firmly towards the living room you will tell me everything because you are standing on ground more deadly than you know and most of all for the first time his tone betrayed his hurt and huge disappointment you will tell me why when she looked up at him her eyes were almost as cold as cruel as his why she repeated in a calm hardedged voice which he had never before heard issue from her lips but it reminded him at once of one that he had heard before and had thought was silenced for ever to take away your life she said thats why and to quote you back at yourself to look at the wreckage afterwards and say quite fucking right too sorry im late andy said skinner stepping out of his car parked at the rear of the headquarters building the time was fifteen minutes to seven and a green helicopter stood on the sports field its blades still and drooping sokay said martin our stuffs on the chopper they began to walk towards the aircraft did you do the business you mentioned he nodded i wont be seeing pamela masters again martins head swivelled round in surprise the ladys been a rucking roadblock in my life pal skinner said vehemently but not any more a clean break i hope asked martin tentatively oh yes as clean as they come the younger man looked at him puzzled again by both his tone and his mood ill tell you all about it later for now lets get away in this contraption hello gerald he said recognising the young lieutenant who stood by the helicopter door and shaking hands before climbing in where are we going sir the pilot asked mr arrow only told me to report here he said youd have further orders martin looked at skinner in surprise at the mention of arrows name thats right he produced mcllhenneys map were going to pay a call on a man named everard balliol at a castle on the shore of loch mhor he doesnt know were coming though i always think it best to surprise everard he thinks im all right though especially since i let him beat me at golf the pilot looked at the map then at a larger chart spread out on the seat beside him okay gentlemen he said it looks simple enough ill file a flightplan with prestwick once were in the air id guess around an hour and a half two hours i should warn you though theres a restricted area just to the north that might be a problem if theres military traffic expected skinner shook his head i dont think so lets go conversation was difficult because of the noise of the engines but skinner managed to brief martin on the intelligence gleaned by mcllhenney on his visit to leuchars if the cottages are on balliols land as i think they are he should be able to tell us who the occupants are and hopefully some more besides yes lets hope so whos meeting us up there a squad from northern the dcc shook his head nobody eh this is down to us andy just you and me they sat in silence for the rest of the flight looking at the scenery as they crossed stirlingshire to crianlarich then swung northward skirting ben nevis and fort william to the west and following the jagged coastline finally just before eight thirty the pilot began his descent until balliols castle came into view a grey speck on the horizon at first but growing larger and larger as they approached along the banks of loch mhor set it down near mr balliols own helicopter skinner ordered looking down and seeing two blackclad figures run out on to the castle terrace as the aircraft settled in the grass and as the blades began to slow in their rotation the dcc saw balliol himself emerge from a small door not far from his study he jumped down from the helicopter and ran towards him what the hells this bob drawled the american yet with the air of someone who had not been truly surprised for a long time skinner shook his hand and introduced martin who had followed behind sorry to drop in unannounced like this everard but this is important and we have to move fast i need to know does you estate include a place called kings gully the billionaire looked at him sure and the land for ten miles north of that five miles east and all the way west to the coast there are cottages in the gully two according to the map who lives there christ bob i dont know that my estate factor deals with all that stuff is he here no he lives on the far side of the loch come on in guys ill call him and tell him to get round here thanks said skinner and ask him also if he has any plans of the kings gully cottages to bring them with him yeah okay he led the way into the house and through to the study set three more places for supper he barked to one of the koreans no make that four i forgot about the pilot no said the dcc he has to stay with the chopper im sure hed be pleased if you took something out to him though they were still in the study but ready to eat when the estate factors land rover drew up outside the study window twenty minutes after balliols telephone summons a tall grey weatherbeaten tweedclad man jumped down from the drivers seat and strode purposefully into the house carrying a briefcase hi don called balliol as the newcomer appeared in the doorway of the study this is donald mcdonald he announced to skinner and martin he was here when i bought the place but if he hadnt been id have hired him anyway for his name alone the billionaire waved his employee towards a seat as two koreans followed him into the room carrying trays laden with hamburger rolls and jugs of coffee don these guys are policemen they need to know about the cottages up in kings gully like are they occupied and if so by whom mcdonald gave a thin smile i can answer those questions his accent like his name was pure highlands you may have seen two cottages on the map gentlemen but one has been derelict for years he turned to balliol ive been meaning to talk to you sir about either demolishing it or refurbishing it for rental later don later very good the cottage which is in habitable condition is rented to a single gentleman his name is gilbert peters how long has he held the tenancy asked martin this time these six months past this time yes sir a few years ago now when my father was estate factor here and i was his assistant in the time of lord erran mr peters also rented the cottage when he gave it up we assumed wed seen the last of him but when he turned up again i remembered him well enough i had no hesitation about letting him have the place once more my father used to comment on how good a tenant he was always paid his rent on time by bank transfer and always kept the place spotless he even made a few improvements such as well when he was here the first time he had the telephone put in since hes been back hes painted the outside and hes installed a television satellite dish what sort of car does he drive asked skinner last time he came to see me it was a subaru replied mcdonald silvery grey in colour fourwheel drive you really need that here when did he come to see you last about four months ago to ask if he could paint the place and install the dish and when did you last call on him i dont said the factor my father and i have always held that good tenants have as much right to privacy as propertyowners ive seen the place from a distance seen the repainting and the dish but thats all if mr peters invited me to call on him i would but otherwise no last time he was here he used to invite my father and me up for a malt on occasion but that hasnt happened since hes been back what do you know about him asked the dcc i know that he was a soldier because when he rented the cottage the first time my father took up the references he gave i saw no need to do so this time did he tell you where hed been since he left mcdonald scratched his head not directly but he implied that hed been on service abroad he did say that hed retired from the army though he didnt say what hes doing now i dont suppose that youll know when hes there and when he isnt no the last time i looked into the gully i didnt see his car but he could have gone to fort william to shop when was that the factor scratched his head a second time as if to aid his memory a week ago last friday he replied at last skinner nodded okay one last question mr mcdonald he said he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and took out a small photograph taken earlier from the folder on peter gilbert heuer he held it up is this gilbert peters the grey man peered at the picture oh yes he nodded its not recent more like from his first time here but thats mr peters all right the two policemen looked at each other plans mr mcdonald asked martin do you have any plans oh yes the factor answered delving into his briefcase he unfolded an old sheet of waxed paper this goes back years to the time that the electricity was installed but its still accurate there have been no internal structural alterations to the cottage since then he spread the plan on balliols desk the four men stood around it studying the layout mr mcdonald pointed to a direction symbol in the top right corner the front of the cottage faces south across the kings gully he said to catch the sun it is built more or less on the gully floor he took them through the layout this is the front door here with a window to the left there is a small entrance hall with a living room to the right and a bedroom to the left at the back of the hall there are doors to the kitchen bathroom and second bedroom wheres the back door asked the chief superintendent through the kitchen theres a wee garden to the back with a wee burn running through it skinner and martin leaned over the plan studying it in detail how wide is the floor of the gully asked the dcc about two hundred yards the cottage is in the centre of the basin how is it approached normally by vehicle from a rough track to the east and whats the terrain bracken said the factor tall green bracken none of the estate workers ever go into the gully theres no point its no use for pasture so you dont get sheep or deer going in there either only rabbits mr peters is free to shoot as many of them as he likes for the pot theres a wee loch just to the north he can fish that for trout if he wants too does he shoot do you know skinner interposed ive never seen him but ive heard shots that could only have been him if it had been poachers the keeper would have found their signs what sort of firearm shotgun no rifle it sounded like mmm i see mused the detective one more thing he asked can you remember where the phone is the telephone sir yes its on a wee table by the front door beneath the window is that the only one or are there extensions mcdonald shook his head as far as i recall theres only the one unless mr peters has put in more but it would not be easy to do that because its an oldfashioned installation not the kind they have today that you can unplug and move about right said skinner pointing at the plan the phones under this window can you remember is there a curtain or a blind no sir there is not or at least there has not been the front door is solid so there is only the window to catch the light thats good thats very good said the dcc almost to himself he picked up a hamburger glancing at his watch in the process its nine thirty so therell be some halfdecent light left could you take us up towards the gully now to a point about a mile short so that we know how to get back there in the morning mcdonald glanced at balliol who nodded thanks said skinner taking his mobile phone from his belt where it was clipped before we go i must call my daughter will i get a signal up here sure balliol told him i had a cell specially installed so i can be contacted anywhere on the estate anytime he stepped to the study window and dialled andy and alexs number the signal was strong and her voice was clear when she came on line thats good love he said i wasnt sure this thing would work up here andy and i have had to go up north well be back tomorrow okay pops i know better than to ask why tell him to bring back some salmon venison more like were off hunting see you he reclipped the phone and turned to see martin follow mcdonald from the study only balliol remained see here bob he asked whats this about skinner looked him in the eye debating with himself for a moment or two at last he decided your mr peters has killed two women and kidnapped their children hes holding them for ransom in your cottage payday is the day after tomorrow andy and i have to get those kids out before then thats if theyre still alive the billionaires sallow face went pale i have done some things in my time he snarled but women and children his eyes narrowed you want my koreans theyre damn good mercenaries night fighters not good enough for this guy hell have the area around the place wired with traps and geophones sos hed know as soon as they were within fifty yards hed kill the children for sure at that then your koreans and hed be off into the night the big policeman looked at the american if you could lend us a land rover tomorrow morning that would be good but i dont want your men anywhere near the gully i dont want anyone around i didnt have a firm plan before id spoken to mr mcdonald but i do now if everything is as he said itll work and if it isnt then everard i will simply wait for as long as it takes for what for a clear shot then ill just kill the fucker it was am as they left the land rover in the small copse beside the track which donald mcdonald had shown them the night before on the slow drive from the castle where they had spent the night and breakfasted with balliol andy had asked bob about pamela and about their split later man later ill tell you and alex together but for now we have to concentrate completely on whats to be done here there were no estate workers about as they made their way north up the climbing winding track towards the gully nor would there be any on balliols orders mcdonald would direct them all to work on the south side of loch mhor the two policemen were clad in the green trousers and pullovers which the army had provided for them pouches hung on their belts and each carried a short stubby assault carbine skinners weapon was fitted on top with a cumbersome awkwardlooking device with an eyepiece even in the early morning cool they were both sweating as after a thirtyfiveminute trek they reached the slope which as their map showed them led up to kings gully as the factor had described it they could see that near the top the grass gave way abruptly to wavy green ferns skinner waved to martin to stop just at the point where the bracken began the two of them sitting down heavily at the edge of the open grass okay andy he said once weve got our breath back well get into position youre clear on the plan martin nodded he wore a dark green beret to hide his blond hair and his powerful shoulders bulged in the tight battledress pullover i take up position to the north behind the house no closer than one hundred yards away right with your twoway radio on receive listen and do as you hear me say itll take you longer to get in position than me ill wait fifteen minutes before i move in martin nodded and snaked off eastward keeping below the ridge of kings gully skinner sat on the grass and waited hefting his carbine testing and retesting the device on top at last with a final check of his watch he moved off up towards the crest of the slope diving into the thick bracken before it opened out into the bowl of the gully he snaked forward slowly and carefully on his belly taking care so that any disturbance of the thick ferns would look like no more than morning breeze after a few yards he stopped and peered through a gap in the undergrowth he saw the cottage exactly where the map had promised and exactly as donald mcdonald had described it at the side stood a silvery grey car a hatchback with a slightly bulbous rear he changed course wriggling to the left of his original approach parallel with the front of the cottage careful not to go too close at last he was in his chosen position around one hundred yards away from the cottage directly facing the front door and the wide green framed window he smiled the window still had no curtain or blind from the pouch on the left side of his belt he took out his two way radio ready to go andy he said quietly into its microphone next from the same pouch he took his mobile phone and laid it on the ground in front of him finally he removed a small headset with earpiece and mouthpiece which he put on before plugging its lead into a socket in the phone casing taking a deep breath he switched on his phone then pressed the short code for the telephone number which he had programmed in the night before the number which donald mcdonald had given him the number of the kings gully cottage the mobiles display lit up green amidst the bracken skinner pressed send then hefted his carbine up to his shoulder looking through his very special telescopic sight and training it on the window beside the blackpainted front door of the house he heard the ringing in his ear once twice a third time on the fourth ring a tall slim fairhaired figure stepped into the hall from the left he was wearing glasses framed in the window skinner saw him pick up the telephone good morning mr heuer he said calmly and evenly before the man could speak himself please dont move a muscle other than to look down at your shirt just left of centre where you heart is through the sight he saw the man look down slowly at a small red dot on his shirt a dot which was not printed on yet which stayed rocksteady thats good said skinner i think you might know what that dot is nod if you do very slowly peter gilbert heuer nodded his head thats right its the trace from a laser sight mounted in this case on an h k carbine not very far away i am very very good with an h k my names bob skinner by the way its my turn to phone you now as im sure youve worked out by now mr heuer if you drop the phone or make any attempt to move from the spot on which youre standing right now that nice wee red dot will turn all of a sudden into a black hole and you will be dead now his voice became rockhard where are the children they are in the kitchen heuers voice was still flat and calm but no longer assertive are they alive yes and they are alone there is noone else in the house noone if there is youre dead whatever else happens you know that heuer do you for the first time the voice was less than calm there is noone i swear skinner raised his voice so that it would be picked up by the radio lying in front of him okay andy kids in the kitchen kick the back door in go go go fire two shots when youre clear he held the sight on heuer if theres any unpleasant surprise waiting in there for my mate he said ill shoot your eyes out are you religious he asked suddenly almost conversationally no the voice was flat and calm once more id give it some thought right now if i were you there are a few ghosts waiting for you on the other side i asked about you peter and now i know what your obsession is he paused studying heuers face through the sight seeing it twitch and watching his eyes shift around as he peered through the window into the sunlight youre a contractor he pronounced at last or you were until you cocked it up you did wet jobs in the intelligence community you were an assassin peter back then when our paths first crossed you didnt go into the polish consulate that night to steal the silver did you you went in to kill the consul and his wife those were your orders our people were going to plant documents to make it look as if the pole had been working for east germany and that the stasi had killed him the whole idea was to create a big stooshie within the warsaw pact and give solidarity a big shove forward the red dot wavered on heuers white shirt as a sudden tremor went through him careful called skinner and it steadied immediately i told you not as much as a twitch boy he paused but you made an arse of it peter you didnt do your homework you missed the second alarm or by your way of it you werent told about it for you decided that youd been set up you expected your paymasters to have you released on some technicality but they felt that would be too risky and that youd have to do time for your mistake naturally being a psychopathic type you took it personally but what i want to know is why you took it out on me you cunt i was only a poor innocent copper doing my job when i gave evidence at your trial in the sight he saw heuer look out of the window his eyes searching the bracken no you were not he said you were part of the plot it was your evidence more than any other which had me convicted and you lied in the witness box skinner there never was a second alarm there was a lastminute change of plan someone at the top took cold feet my own people tipped you off by then it was the only way they could stop me so they did and then they left me to rot skinner laughed into the phone how long did it take you to work that story out peter careful now he warned as heuer reacted to his taunt there was no plot to get you your mission was meant to succeed but you fucked it up of course there was a second alarm it was even visible too a small lineofsight transmitter on the roof aimed directly into our communication tower at headquarters it looked like a radio aerial and thats what you thought it was you cant accept the idea that youre fallible can you heuer you never could thats why you were kicked out of the army they let you off then when you departed from an operational plan in argentina in and had two of your men killed they let you resign because the op was secret and they couldnt have a court martial and because you had a special talent for killing people they passed you on to the intelligence community how many people did you kill for our side and for the americans a couple of dozen was it as skinner paused two shots rang out around the gully he smiled free and clear he said mission accomplished youve cocked it up again peter youll probably blame the raf this time face it at last man he went on you got yourself caught in the polish consuls house before you had killed him fortunately you were nicked by three carloads of our people a dozen of them there was no way with that number of witnesses that anyone could get you out of it for fucks sake you were even paid when you were inside even though youd botched the job to keep you loyal they thought his voice hardened youve been planning this for years havent you you did your time five years with parole and even took on a couple of jobs when you came out four years ago yet all the time you were planning to make your bosses pay bigtime for the years you did inside unexpectedly skinner chuckled startling heuer making the red dot jump they are not pleased with you this time not at all do you know they even asked me to kill you they dont want any of this coming out in a trial you see so they asked me to do you in very quietly resisting arrest sort of thing what dyou think of that he said a shocked tone in his voice asking me a policeman to kill you thats how much they want you dead he paused no peter no he said sharply dont move yet not till andy and the kids are well clear and keep the phone pressed to your ear through his own earpiece he could hear heuers breathing no longer even but heavy and ragged making the red dot seem to ripple on his shirt as he watched imagine thinking that id do that he went on even though you terrified two kids out of their wits and did things that may well scar them emotionally for life i mean did you hear marks voice when he learned from the radio that his mum was dead and what about tanya after you blew her mums brains out right in front of her as for leona would you have raped and killed her if she hadnt been someone you knew i was fond of you were watching her house that friday night peter werent you come on i want an answer you were watching and you saw the bedroom light go on isnt that right yes cried heuer the detective drew in a deep breath boy he said you must be thinking that all your christmas days have come at once right now you must be thanking your luckiest star that its a straight idealistic career copper like me holding this gun and not someone like my mate adam arrow whod kill you in an instant nod once if im right slowly the man in the gunsight nodded behind the carbine bob skinners face took on a cold terrible expression as the memory of leona mcgraths abused battered throttled corpse appeared in his minds eye wrong peter he whispered sometimes life hands you a luxury you can afford the red dot swept upwards to the centre of heuers forehead say hello to ross for me he squeezed the trigger martin and the two children were waiting at the foot of the hill south of the gully as skinner reappeared over its crest after pressing heuers pistol into his hand and squeezing off one shot into the wall beside the window just as arrow had told him to do mark came running towards him uncle bob uncle bob he cried out i told tanya that itd be all right i told her that youd come to get us skinner swept him up in his arms and carried him off back down the hill towards andy and the whitefaced shocked little girl and you were right werent you just like you always are tanyas awful frightened uncle bob shes had every right to be so have you although i dont suppose you were well mark began what about the man mr gilbert he asked he wont come back will he no son mr gilberts dead i told him not to do anything silly but he did and i had to shoot him you mean he went back into the kitchen for his gun skinner winced inwardly as he was reminded of the childs astonishing memory for detail yes thats just the way it was whatll happen now some army people will come up to take him away in fact he had begun the cleanup process with a phone call to adam arrow from the cottage and then mark asked the inevitable question the one which his remarkable young mind had allowed him to block out until then uncle bob he began what it said on the radio about my mummy that wasnt true was it skinner hugged the boy to him lets sit down over here wee man he said and lets have a chat mitch does your firm handle property sales no said laidlaw but i can recommend good people why im selling the gullane cottage said skinner you hardly need do that bob the portly lawyer beamed since the secretary of state has said that his office would fund your defence costs he was pretty magnanimous in his statement exonerating you after the line he took at the start he was told to be said skinner the lawyer shot him a curious look fine by me he said it means i can now add your daughters time to the fee note with a clear conscience the policeman laughed i was surprised by what he said in the rest of the statement laidlaw went on that the allegations had proved to be spurious and that there would be no further enquiries he was told to say that too said skinner in a way which invited no further discussion of the matter still mitch he went on quickly despite the outcome it was pretty hairy while it lasted all your input and support was much appreciated and i thank you for it dont mention it its good to see you looking so relaxed after it all and after yesterdays events youve had no reaction to the rest of the question was unnecessary skinner glanced at him to having to shoot heuer he shook his head no its a part of the job not an everyday part thank goodness but part nonetheless heuer made his choice when he killed leona up the crematorium chimneys the best place for him was he killed outright asked the solicitor slightly awed by a side of his friend that he had never seen oh yes when your brains are all over the wall behind you everything else tends to stop working laidlaw shuddered how were the children afterwards he asked the policeman grimaced weetanyas completely withdrawn itll take her a long time to recover i think if she ever does i dont envy bruce anderson his job as a father i think he may even resign his office to look after her m as for mark hes a remarkable and resilient wee boy but hes still only that a wee boy orphaned by violence whatll happen to him hes with his grandparents just now but theyre retired hell need a different longterm solution still im sure that one will be found laidlaw nodded lets hope so anyway back to your house youre serious yes i just fancy a change somewhere i can build a new set of memories i plan to sell the edinburgh house too and buy another place in gullane ah so we wont be losing you from the thursday night football club shit no thats my religion thats good but after yesterday i wont be kicking you again thats for sure skinner laughed as he rose to his feet is my daughter available by the way he asked laidlaw shook his head no she called in and asked for the day off she said that you and she and andy had had a stressful time last night unwinding i told her i quite understood and that id see her on monday she did ask me to give you a message though she said that a delivery service had been trying to reach you about a package thats en route to you shes told them youll receive it at fairyhouse avenue at midday skinner frowned as he headed for the door of the lawyers office delivery service he mused aloud wonder what the hell thats about the way my lucks been going lately this one really will be a bomb the package was explosive in its own way but it was no bomb it had arrived before he reached the bungalow he smelled fresh coffee in the kitchen as he stepped through the back door he caught the fragrance of a familiar perfume as he stepped into the hall he heard the rustle of movement as he turned into the living room sarah he said her name quietly and calmly as nervousness relief and uncertainty struggled for mastery within him bob she replied coolly and cautiously with no hostility but with no hint of emotion what he began what do you want why have you come back ive come back for a fight she said her jaw set defiantly holding her head proud and high light glinting on her auburn hair within him uncertainty triumphed over relief oh my love he cried out sadly i dont want to fight with you i never did and i never should have only i was too big a fool to know she stepped towards him skirt swinging stepped right up against him tall in her high heels with her hands on her hips i didnt say i was going to fight with you honey she paused still without a smile after you called me to tell me about you and the other woman and to warn me about the spotlight stuff and i gave you that three month ultimatum after all that i sat down and i said to myself hold on here a minute doctor have you ever stopped loving this man since the day you met him would your life ever be the same if you lost him are you prepared to let some other lady enjoy your happy ever after the answers were no no and hell no right there and then i decided that you were not getting rid of me that easily with just one phone call three months down the road im here to fight for you bob my love thats if i have to at last a tentative smile came to her lips and into her wonderful eyes he shook his head as if to clear it picked her up and pressed her to him oh but you dont he said hugging her tight as relief with an overwhelming countersurge swept everything else aside my darling you dont i am so so sorry for the fool ive been please please forgive me i accused you of being disloyal to me and i drove you away in the process but its me who failed the loyalty test in a big way he set her back on her feet yeah she said her smile gone once more you sure did but i have to tell you husband were even on that score he felt a punch a hard winding punch in the pit of his stomach but he rode out its force this terry guy yes she nodded well he sighed you were entitled as far as im concerned it never happened oh but it did lover she insisted and you must listen to me like i said i have to tell you why it had nothing to do with entitlement or revenge i was evening the score between us yes but with a good motive behind it i hope i decided i should go to bed with terry for one reason alone and im telling you for that same reason so that ill never in the future if ever i was stupid enough be able to brandish my fidelity over your head like a club she laid her forehead against his chest and spoke quietly this is what happened i invited him on a dinner date and i even insisted on paying afterwards i took him to a hotel room id booked and i said okay terry now give me your best and ill give you mine as it turned out his was a lot better than mine youll be glad to know im lousy at casual sex but it was nowhere my love nowhere near as good as yours when wed done it once was enough i got out of bed took a shower said thanks and good night and went home feeling guilty about using terry but leaving my banner of virtue behind me as i had set out to do i didnt feel like a whore though i was relieved because id been able to do what i believed was necessary and most of all because i was ready to go home i want to make a fresh start she whispered forgiveness on both sides she looked up to find his eyes looking solemnly into hers if terry had looked in my bag when i was in the shower she said hed have found the plane tickets there edinburgh via amsterdam one way tickets he asked hopefully of course we both came back she said jazz is with alex she grinned hey your gals getting a touch broody pops maybe having her baby brother back will calm her down a bit she hesitated alex told me all about pam she told me the whole story that it was her who tipped off spotlight it was her who set you up with the bribe thing and all because you put her brother away for something or other how driven can a person be bob shook his head alex doesnt know the whole story love neither does andy only you can ever know it sit down he took her hand and led her to the couch sitting her down and facing her along the leather cushions i put pams brother away all right sarah love six feet deep remember the time we had the president of syria here and he was killed remember the man who shot him and who was going to kill me and you too because i found out the truth her face went white she leaned suddenly and heavily against the back of the sofa the man you shot dead that was pams brother yes thats who he was his real name was ross masters just like heuer he was a soldier whod become a professional assassin and he worked within the intelligence community he and pamela were very close he hesitated and she caught his meaning incestuous you mean thats right bob grunted grimly incest the game the whole family can play ross called her polly by the way she came to hate it if that name was used by anyone else even by her poor mug of a husband the marriage was rosss idea she told me purely for show the two of them were so close in fact that she knew what ross did and the risks it involved they had an arrangement he always contacted her in person or by telephone within a threemonth period he told her that if ever he failed to do that it would certainly be because he was dead if that happened she was to go to a private safe depository in london and present a key which he had given her just over three months after ross and i had our fatal encounter she made that trip she was given a box which her brother had kept inside she found a hundred thousand pounds in bank of england notes and a letter he reached into the pocket of his soft brown leather jacket and took out a folded piece of paper this is it he began to read my darling polly you re reading this so im dead you can be sure of that and you can be sure also that my end will have been unrecorded the work i have been doing lately has been so secret and potentially calamitousor those who commissioned me that if i fail or die in the act it will be as if i have disappeared from the face of the earth my real identity died a while back as you know in a genuine helicopter crash in oman in which ross masters was listed among the dead burned to ashes in the process yesterday i met a man his name is bob skinner and he works in edinburgh i do not expect to die on this assignment but if i do then i know within myself and with a great certainty that it will be bob skinner who will kill me he is a career policeman but he has a certain quality too one which only people like me can see in others he may not even know it himself but mr skinner is a killer just like me he is tenacious he is very good and it is possible that before this commission is complete he and i will have a confrontation should that not happen i will have been in touch as usual but should skinner get too close then one of us will not survive and you may have to read this letter polly as you know i don tfear death but i am proud as you are and i am vengeful as you are also take all the money in this box most of my savings from my career as a contractor i would like you to use some of it at least to ensure that skinner accounts for my death in a meaningful way dont have him killed though unless you have no other choice he does not fear death either and in any event you would have to be certain of success or he would be very dangerous you we always been a creative girl use your talents and this money to even my score with my executioner take skinners life from him not in an instant but in a way that will hurt him for as long as he breathes but be careful touch none of his or he will hunt you down hurt him alone there is a man who will help you he is an acquaintance of mine in the same line of work and he has met skinner also his name is peter gilbert heuer and he is very bitter he can be contacted by placing a personal ad in the northern echo on any tuesday under a box number simply asking pgh to respond peter with you and only three other people knows my real name ask him for it to confirm his identity do this for me polly as best you can i leave you my heart and my undying love for you and i are soulmates goodbye ross bob folded the letter put it back in his pocket and looked again at his wife so polly or pamela rather took the money took her marketing degree and experience and joined the police my force naturally as a late entrant once there she took the service options which would bring her closest to me she even had an affair with the force press officer who knows me better than most as part of her preparation when the time was right she contacted heuer when he heard that it was me she was after he was only too willing to help her she had her plan all along and it worked better than she had ever dared to hope had it not been for a couple of mistakes that she made i could have been convicted as a minimum if things had worked out id have had to leave the force under a very big cloud my splitting up with you was a tremendous bonus for her shes a wonderful actress is pamela she played it so well so properly she was there to lend me a shoulder to moan on yet she refused to sleep with me before you and i were legally separated she was in the final act of setting me up when it all went sour for her she told me she wanted to get married thats how confident she was his face was twisted with anger sarah looked at him almost fearfully what have you done with her she asked alex said that all you told them was that she had left i havent done anything with her he answered bitterly or to her i could hardly have her arrested and charged in all the circumstances with the national security interests that would have been involved a trial would have been unthinkable so instead i signed the hundred thousand back into her name i drove her to the airport to catch her plane and i told her to get as far away from me and mine as she could i promised her also that i would let my contacts in mi and the cia know that ross masters had a sister who is aware of the work he did for them and have you will you no but she believes that i will and that will keep her on the move and will keep her mouth shut for the rest of her life shell disappear like her brother i guess like him shell find a new identity this man heuer sarah broke in didnt he kill leona mcgrath and the secretary of states wife wasnt he the man you shot yesterday when you rescued the children bob nodded yes but pam had no idea about that until andy and i made the connection she only used him as a courier to set me up with the bank in guernsey she swore blind that she didnt know he was planning the killings or the kidnapping eventually she made me believe her and if you hadnt accepted it he looked at the wall suddenly cold as ice id have handed her over to adam arrow he whispered and she knew that he meant it anyway he said softening in an instant heuers dead and pams gone for good both of my persecutors are dealt with bob leaned back wearily on the couch beside his wife and drew her to him to lay her head on his shoulder i feel as if ive been haunted for the last few months sarah my love visited by all my ghosts and horrors from my past god willing now theyre all exorcised and the demons the misunderstanding and the anger which drove us apart are gone as well she drew his head down and kissed him for the first time in months long and slow yes she said theyre gone so if youve any more secrets to reveal nows the time to do it nothing you say will be taken down or held against you he took a deep breath well he began about leona mcgrath she put her fingers to his lips its okay i know alex told me that i halfguessed at the time too although we were barely speaking i remember that when you got home late that night i thought that it was the first time i had ever seen you with a guilty look on your face poor woman sarah sighed no grudges borne and oh her poor little boy he looked her in the eye so close to her that he was almost squinting speaking of mark he murmured i know this is a biggie but how would you and jazz feel about adopting an older brother i think wed feel okay she replied without a moments hesitation she leaned back and gazed at him for a moment you know ross masters didnt have a clue about the real you she said smiling oh no which of us is dead and which of you was on the side of right as almost invariably my darling you are she was silent contemplative for a few seconds one thing i learned from ross though she added at last whats that he told pam that he and she were soulmates she said until this moment ive never really considered far less understood the meaning of the term she looked up at him and saw a glistening in his eyes oh sarah he sighed with the relief of someone who has stepped into a chasm in the dark only to have his foot land safely upon a bridge then maybe youll know just how glad i am that youre back cuts both ways honey she drawled in her finest american beginning to unbutton his shirt now lets give each other our very very best for today skinners ghosts arent all thats gonna get laid
