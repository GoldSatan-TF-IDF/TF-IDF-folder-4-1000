hey dad catch casey tossed the frisbee across the smooth green lawn caseys dad made a face squinting into the sun the frisbee hit the ground and skipped a few times before landing under the hedge at the back of the house not today im busy dr brewer said and abruptly turned and loped into the house the screen door slammed behind him casey brushed his straight blond hair back off his forehead whats his problem he called to margaret his sister who had watched the whole scene from the side of the redwood garage you know margaret said quietly she wiped her hands on the legs of her jeans and held them both up inviting a toss ill play frisbee with you for a little while she said okay casey said without enthusiasm he walked slowly over to retrieve the frisbee from under the hedge margaret moved closer she felt sorry for casey he and their dad were really close always playing ball or frisbee or nintendo together but dr brewer didnt seem to have time for that anymore jumping up to catch the frisbee margaret realized she felt sorry for herself too dad hadnt been the same to her either in fact he spent so much time down in the basement he barely said a word to her he doesnt even call me princess anymore margaret thought it was a nickname she hated but at least it was a nickname a sign of closeness she tossed the red frisbee back a bad toss casey chased after it but it sailed away from him margaret looked up to the golden hills beyond their backyard california she thought its so weird out here here it is the middle of winter and there isnt a cloud in the sky and casey and i are out in jeans and tshirts as if it were the middle of summer she made a diving latch for a wild toss rolling over on the manicured lawn and raising the frisbee above her head triumphantly show off casey muttered unimpressed youre the hot dog in the family margaret called well youre a dork hey casey you want me to play with you or not he shrugged everyone was so edgy these days margaret realized it was easy to figure out why she made a high toss the frisbee sailed over caseys head you chase it he cried angrily putting his hands on his hips no you she cried you casey youre eleven years old dont act like a twoyearold she snapped well you act like a oneyearold was his reply as he grudgingly went after the frisbee it was all dads fault margaret realized things had been so tense ever since he started working at home down in the basement with his plants and weird machines he hardly ever came up for air and when he did he wouldnt even catch a frisbee or spend two minutes with either of them mom had noticed it too margaret thought running fullout and making another grandstand catch just before colliding with the side of the garage having dad home has made mom really tense too she pretends everything is fine but i can tell shes worried about him lucky catch fatso casey called margaret hated the name fatso even more than she hated princess people in her family jokingly called her fatso because she was so thin like her father she also was tall like him but she had her mothers straight brown hair brown eyes and dark coloring dont call me that she heaved the red disc at him he caught it at his knees and flipped it back to her they tossed it back and forth without saying much for another ten or fifteen minutes im getting hot margaret said shielding her eyes from the afternoon sun with her hand lets go in casey tossed the frisbee against the garage wall it dropped onto the grass he came trotting over to her dad always plays longer he said peevishly and he throws better you throw like a girl give me a break margaret groaned giving him a playful shove as she jogged to the back door you throw like a chimpanzee how come dad got fired he asked she blinked and stopped running the question had caught her by surprise huh his pale freckled face turned serious you know i mean why he asked obviously uncomfortable she and casey had never discussed this in the four weeks since dad had been home which was unusual since they were pretty close being only a year apart i mean we came all the way out here so he could work at polytech right casey asked yeah well he got fired margaret said halfwhispering in case her dad might be able to hear but why did he blow up the lab or something casey grinned the idea of his dad blowing up a huge campus science lab appealed to him no he didnt blow anything up margaret said tugging at a strand of dark hair botanists work with plants you know they dont get much of a chance to blow things up they both laughed casey followed her into the narrow strip of shade cast by the low ranchstyle house im not sure exactly what happened margaret continued still halfwhispering but i overheard dad on the phone i think he was talking to mr martinez his department head remember the quiet little man who came to dinner that night the barbecue grill caught fire casey nodded martinez fired dad probably margaret whispered from what i overheard it had something to do with the plants dad was growing some experiments that had gone wrong or something but dads real smart casey insisted as if margaret were arguing with him if his experiments went wrong hed know how to fix them margaret shrugged thats all i know she said come on casey lets go inside im dying of thirst she stuck her tongue out and moaned demonstrating her dire need of liquid youre gross casey said he pulled open the screen door then dodged in front of her so he could get inside first whos gross mrs brewer asked from the sink she turned to greet the two of them dont answer that mom looks very tired today margaret thought noticing the crisscross of fine lines at the corners of her mothers eyes and the first strands of gray in her mothers shoulderlength brown hair i hate this job mrs brewer said turning back to the sink what are you doing casey asked pulling open the refrigerator and removing a box of juice im deveining shrimp yuck margaret exclaimed thanks for the support mrs brewer said dryly the phone rang wiping her shrimpy hands with a dish towel she hurried across the room to pick up the phone margaret got a box of juice from the fridge popped the straw into the top and followed casey into the front hallway the basement door usually shut tight when dr brewer was working down there was slightly ajar casey started to close it then stopped lets go down and see what dad is doing he suggested margaret sucked the last drops of juice through the straw and squeezed the empty box flat in her hand okay she knew they probably shouldnt disturb their father but her curiosity got the better of her he had been working down there for four weeks now all kinds of interesting equipment lights and plants had been delivered most days he spent at least eight or nine hours down there doing whatever it was he was doing and he hadnt shown it to them once yeah lets go margaret said it was their house too after all besides maybe their dad was just waiting for them to show some interest maybe he was hurt that they hadnt bothered to come downstairs in all this time she pulled the door open the rest of the way and they stepped onto the narrow stairway hey dad casey called excitedly dad can we see they were halfway down when their father appeared at the foot of the stairs he glared up at them angrily his skin strangely green under the fluorescent light fixture he was holding his right hand drops of red blood falling onto his white lab coat stay out of the basement he bellowed in a voice theyd never heard before both kids shrank back surprised to hear their father scream like that he was usually so mild and softspoken stay out of the basement he repeated holding his bleeding hand dont ever come down here im warning you okay all packed mrs brewer said dropping her suitcases with a thud in the front hallway she poked her head into the living room where the tv was blaring do you think you could stop the movie for one minute to say goodbye to your mother casey pushed a button on the remote control and the screen went blank he and margaret obediently walked to the hallway to give their mother hugs margarets friend diane manning who lived just around the corner followed them into the hallway how long are you going to be gone mrs brewer she asked her eyes on the two bulging suitcases i dont know mrs brewer replied fretfully my sister went into the hospital in tucson this morning i guess ill have to stay until shes able to go home well ill be glad to babysit for casey and margaret while youre away diane joked give me a break margaret said rolling her eyes im older than you are diane and im smarter than both of you casey added with typical modesty im not worried about you kids mrs brewer said glancing nervously at her watch im worried about your father dont worry margaret told her seriously well take good care of him just make sure that he eats something once in a while mrs brewer said hes so obsessed with his work he doesnt remember to eat unless you tell him its going to be really lonely around here without mom margaret thought dad hardly ever comes up from the basement it had been two weeks since he yelled at casey and her to stay out of the basement they had been tiptoeing around ever since afraid to get him angry again but in the past two weeks he had barely spoken to them except for the occasional good morning and good night dont worry about anything mom she said forcing a smile just take good care of aunt eleanor ill call as soon as i get to tucson mrs brewer said nervously lowering her eyes to her watch again she took three long strides to the basement door then shouted down michael time to take me to the airport after a long wait dr brewer called up a reply then mrs brewer turned back to the kids think hell even notice im gone she asked in a loud whisper she meant it to be a light remark but her eyes revealed some sadness a few seconds later they heard footsteps on the basement stairs and their dad appeared he putted off his stained lab coat revealing tan slacks and a bright yellow tshirt and tossed the lab coat onto the banister even though it was two weeks later his right hand the hand that had been bleeding was still heavily bandaged ready he asked his wife mrs brewer sighed i guess she gave margaret and casey a helpless look then moved quickly to give them each one last hug lets go then dr brewer said impatiently he picked up the two bags and groaned wow how long are you planning to stay a year then he headed out the front door with them not waiting for an answer bye mrs brewer diane said waving have a good trip how can she have a good trip casey asked sharply her sisters in the hospital you know what i mean diane replied tossing back her long red hair and rolling her eyes they watched the station wagon roll down the driveway then returned to the living room casey picked up the remote control and started the movie diane sprawled on the couch and picked up the bag of potato chips shed been eating who picked this movie diane asked crinkling the foil bag noisily i did casey said its neat he had pulled a couch cushion down to the living room carpet and was lying on it margaret was sitting crosslegged on the floor her back against the base of an armchair still thinking about her mother and her aunt eleanor its neat if you like to see a lot of people blown up and their guts flying all over she said making a face for dianes benefit yeah its neat casey said not taking his eyes off the glowing tv screen ive got so much homework i dont know why im sitting here diane said reaching her hand into the potato chip bag me too margaret sighed i guess ill do it after dinner do you have the math assignment i think i left my math book at school sshhh casey hissed kicking a sneakered foot in margarets direction this is a good part youve seen this tape before diane shrieked twice casey admitted he ducked and the sofa pillow diane threw sailed over his head its a pretty afternoon margaret said stretching her arms above her head maybe we should go outside you know ride bikes or something you think youre still back in michigan its always a pretty afternoon here diane said chewing loudly i dont even notice it anymore maybe we should do the math assignment together margaret suggested hopefully diane was much better in math than she was diane shrugged yeah maybe she crinkled up the bag and set it on the floor your dad looked kind of nervous you know huh what do you mean just nervous diane said hows he doing sshhh casey insisted picking up the potato chip bag and tossing it at diane you know being laid off and all i guess hes okay margaret said wistfully i dont know really he spends all his time down in the basement with his experiments experiments hey lets go take a look tossing her hair back behind her shoulders diane jumped up from the chrome and white leather couch diane was a science freak math and science the two subjects margaret hated she should have been in the brewer family margaret thought with a trace of bitterness maybe dad would pay some attention to her since shes into the same things he is come on diane urged bending over to pull margaret up from the floor hes a botanist right whats he doing down there its complicated margaret said shouting over the explosions and gunfire on the tv he tried to explain it to me once but margaret allowed diane to pull her to her feet shut up casey yelled staring at the movie the colors from the tv screen reflecting over his clothes is he building a frankenstein monster or something diane demanded or some kind of robocop wouldnt that be cool shut up casey repeated shrilly as arnold schwarzenegger bounded across the screen hes got all these machines and plants down there margaret said uncomfortably but he doesnt want us to go down there huh its like top secret dianes emerald green eyes lit up with excitement come on well just take a peek no i dont think so margaret told her she couldnt forget the angry look on her fathers face two weeks before when she and casey had tried to pay a visit or the way he had screamed at them never to come down to the basement come on i dare you diane challenged are you chicken im not afraid margaret insisted shrilly diane was always daring her to do things she didnt want to do why is it so important for diane to think shes so much braver than everyone else margaret wondered chicken diane repeated tossing her mane of red hair behind her shoulder she strode quickly toward the basement door diane stop margaret cried following after her hey wait casey cried clicking off the movie are we going downstairs wait for me he climbed quickly to his feet and enthusiastically hurried to join them at the basement door we cant margaret started but diane clamped a hand over her mouth well take a quick peek diane insisted well just look we wont touch anything and then well come right back upstairs okay ill go first casey said grabbing for the doorknob why do you want to do this margaret asked her friend why are you so eager to go down there diane shrugged it beats doing our math she replied grinning margaret sighed defeated okay lets go but remember just looking no touching casey pulled open the door and led the way onto the stairway stepping onto the landing they were immediately engulfed in hot steamy air they could hear the buzz and hum of electronic machinery and off to the right they could see the glare of the bright white lights from dr brewers workroom this is kind of fun margaret thought as the three of them made their way down the linoleumcovered stairway its an adventure theres no harm in taking a peek so why was her heart pounding why did she have this sudden tingle of fear yuck its so hot in here as they stepped away from the stairs the air became unbearably hot and thick margaret gasped the sudden change in temperature was suffocating its so moist diane said good for your hair and skin we studied the rain forest in school casey said maybe dads building a rain forest maybe margaret said uncertainly why did she feel so strange was it just because they were invading their fathers domain doing something he had told them not to do she held back gazing in both directions the basement was divided into two large rectangular rooms to the left an unfinished rec room stood in darkness she could barely make out the outlines of the pingpong table in the center of the room the workroom to the right was brightly lit so bright they had to blink and wait for their eyes to adjust beams of white light poured down from large halogen lamps on tracks in the ceiling wow look casey cried his eyes wide as he stepped excitedly toward the light reaching up toward the lights were shiny tall plants dozens of them thickstalked and broadleafed planted close together in an enormous low trough of dark soil its like a jungle margaret exclaimed following casey into the white glare the plants in fact resembled jungle plants leafy vines and tall treelike plants with long slender tendrils fragilelooking ferns plants with gnarled creamcolored roots poking up like bony knees from the soil its like a swamp or something diane said did your father really grow these things in just five or six weeks yeah im pretty sure margaret replied staring at the enormous red tomatoes on a slender yellow stalk ooh feel this one diane said margaret glanced over to find her friend rubbing her hand over a large flat leaf the shape of a teardrop diane we shouldnt touch i know i know diane said not letting go of the leaf but just rub your hand on it margaret reluctantly obeyed it doesnt feel like a leaf she said as diane moved over to examine a large fern its so smooth like glass the three of them stood under the bright white lights examining the plants for several minutes touching the thick stalks running their hands over the smooth warm leaves surprised by the enormous size of the fruits some of the plants had produced its too hot down here casey complained he pulled his tshirt off over his head and dropped it onto the floor what a bod diane teased him he stuck out his tongue at her then his pale blue eyes grew wide and he seemed to freeze in surprise hey casey whats the matter margaret asked hurrying over to him this one he pointed to a tall treelike plant its breathing diane laughed but margaret heard it too she grabbed caseys bare shoulder and listened yes she could hear breathing sounds and they seemed to be coming from the tall leafy tree whats your problem diane asked seeing the amazed expressions on caseys and margarets faces caseys right margaret said softly listening to the steady rhythmic sound you can hear it breathing diane rolled her eyes maybe it has a cold maybe its vine is stuffed up she laughed at her own joke but her two companions didnt join in i dont hear it she moved closer all three of them listened silence it stopped margaret said stop it you two diane scolded youre not going to scare me no really margaret protested hey look at this casey had already moved on to something else he was standing in front of a tall glass case that stood on the other side of the plants it looked a little like a phone booth with a shelf inside about shoulderhigh and dozens of wires attached to the back and sides margarets eyes followed the wires to a similar glass booth a few feet away some kind of electrical generator stood between the two booths and appeared to be connected to both of them what could that be diane asked hurrying over to casey dont touch it margaret warned giving the breathing plant one final glance then joining the others but casey reached out to the glass door on the front of the booth i just want to see if this opens he said he grabbed the glass and his eyes went wide with shock his entire body began to shake and vibrate his head jerked wildly from side to side his eyes rolled up in his head oh help he managed to cry his body vibrating and shaking harder and faster help me i cant stop help me caseys whole body shook as if an electrical current were charging through him his head jerked on his shoulders and his eyes looked wild and dazed please margaret and diane stared in openmouthed horror margaret was the first to move she lunged at casey and reached out to try to pull him away from the glass margaret dont diane screamed dont touch him but we have to do something margaret cried it took both girls a while to realize that casey had stopped shaking and was laughing casey margaret asked staring at him her terrified expression fading to astonishment he was leaning against the glass his body still now his mouth wrapped in a broad mischievous grin gotcha he declared and then began to laugh even harder pointing at them and repeating the phrase through his triumphant laughter gotcha gotcha that wasnt funny margaret screamed you were faking it i dont believe it diane cried her face as pale as the white lights above them her lower lip trembling both girls leapt onto casey and pushed him to the floor margaret sat on top of him while diane held his shoulders down gotcha gotcha he continued stopping only when margaret tickled his stomach so hard he couldnt talk you rat diane cried you little rat the freeforall was brought to a sudden halt by a low moan from across the room all three kids raised their heads and stared in the direction of the sound the large basement was silent now except for their heavy breathing what was that diane whispered they listened another low moan a mournful sound muffled like air through a saxophone the tendrils of a treelike plant suddenly drooped like snakes lowering themselves to the ground another low sad moan its the plants casey said his expression frightened now he pushed his sister off him and climbed to his feet brushing back his disheveled blond hair as he stood up plants dont cry and moan diane said her eyes on the vast trough of plants that filled the room these do margaret said tendrils moved like human arms shifting their position they could hear breathing again slow steady breathing then a sigh like air escaping lets get out of here casey said edging toward the stairs its definitely creepy down here diane said following him her eyes remaining on the shifting moaning plants im sure dad could explain it margaret said her words were calm but her voice trembled and she was backing out of the room following diane and casey your dad is weird diane said reaching the doorway no he isnt casey quickly insisted hes doing important work here a tall treelike plant sighed and appeared to bend toward them raising its tendrils as if beckoning to them calling them back lets just get out of here margaret exclaimed all three of them were out of breath by the time they ran up the stairs casey closed the door tightly making sure it clicked shut weird diane repeated playing nervously with a strand of her long red hair definitely weird it was her word of the day but margaret had to admit it was appropriate well dad warned us not to go down there margaret said struggling to catch her breath i guess he knew it would look scary to us and we wouldnt understand im getting out of here diane said only halfkidding she stepped out of the screen door and turned back toward them want to go over the math later yeah sure margaret said still thinking about the moaning shifting plants some of them had seemed to be reaching out to them crying out to them but of course that was impossible later diane said and headed at a trot down the drive just as she disappeared their fathers dark blue station wagon turned the corner and started up the drive back from the airport margaret said she turned from the door back to casey a few yards behind her in the hallway is the basement door closed yeah casey replied looking again to make sure no way dad will know we he stopped his mouth dropped open but no sound came out his face went pale my tshirt casey exclaimed slapping his bare chest i left it in the basement ive got to get it casey said otherwise dadll know its too late margaret interrupted her eyes on the driveway hes already pulled up the drive itll only take a second casey insisted his hand on the basement doorknob ill run down and run right up no margaret stood tensely in the center of the narrow hallway halfway between the front door and the basement door her eyes toward the front hes parked hes getting out of the car but hell know hell know casey cried his voice high and whiny so remember how mad he got last time casey asked of course i remember margaret replied but hes not going to kill us casey just because we took a peek at his plants hes margaret stopped she moved closer to the screen door hey wait whats going on casey asked hurry margaret turned and gestured with both hands go get downstairs fast mr henry from next door he stopped dad theyre talking about something in the drive with a loud cry casey flung open the basement door and disappeared margaret heard him clumping rapidly down the stairs then she heard his footsteps fade as he hurried into their fathers workroom hurry casey she thought standing guard at the front door watching her father shielding his eyes from the sun with one hand as he talked with mr henry hurry you know dad never talks for long with the neighbors mr henry seemed to be doing all the talking probably asking dad some kind of favor margaret thought mr henry wasnt handy at all not like dr brewer and so he was always asking margarets dad to come over and help repair or install things her father was nodding now a tight smile on his face harry casey get back up here where are you still shielding his eyes dr brewer gave mr henry a quick wave then both men spun around and began walking quickly toward their houses hurry casey casey hes coming hurry margaret urged silently it doesnt take this long to pick your tshirt up from the floor and run up the stairs it shouldnt take this long her dad was on the front walk now he spotted her in the doorway and waved margaret returned the wave and looked back through the hallway to the basement door casey where are you she called aloud no reply no sound from the basement no sound at all dr brewer had paused outside to inspect the rosebushes at the head of the front walk casey margaret called still no reply casey hurry silence her father was crouching down doing something to the soil beneath the rosebushes with a feeling of dread weighing down her entire body margaret realized she had no choice she had to go downstairs and see what was keeping casey casey ran down the steps leaning on the metal banister so that he could jump down two steps at a time he landed hard on the cement basement floor and darted into the bright white light of the plant room stopping at the entranceway he waited for his eyes to adjust to the brighterthanday light he took a deep breath inhaling the steamy air and held it it was so hot down here so sticky his back began to itch the back of his neck tingled the jungle of plants stood as if at attention under the bright white lights he saw his tshirt lying crumpled on the floor a few feet from a tall leafy tree the tree seemed to lean toward the tshirt its long tendrils hanging down loosely coiled on the soil around its trunk casey took a timid step into the room why am i so afraid he wondered its just a room filled with strange plants why do i have the feeling that theyre watching me waiting for me he scolded himself for being so afraid and took a few more steps toward the crumpled tshirt on the floor hey wait the breathing there it was again steady breathing not too loud not too soft either who could be breathing what could be breathing was the big tree breathing casey stared at the shirt on the floor so near what was keeping him from grabbing it and running back upstairs what was holding him back he took a step forward then another was the breathing growing louder he jumped startled by a sudden low moan from the big supply closet against the wall it sounded so human as if someone were in there moaning in pain casey where are you margarets voice sounded so far away even though she was just at the head of the stairs okay so far he called back to her but his voice came out in a whisper she probably couldnt hear him he took another step another the shirt was about three yards away a quick dash a quick dive and hed have it another low moan from the supply closet a plant seemed to sigh a tall fern suddenly dipped low shifting its leaves casey he could hear his sister from upstairs sounding very worried casey hurry im trying he thought im trying to hurry what was holding him back another low moan this time from the other side of the room he took two more steps then crouched low his arms straight out in front of him the shirt was almost within reach he heard a groaning sound then more breathing he raised his eyes to the tall tree the long ropy tendrils had tensed stiffened or had he imagined it no they had been drooping loosely now they were taut ready ready to grab him casey hurry margaret called sounding even farther away he didnt answer he was concentrating on the shirt just a few feet away just a few feet just a foot the plant groaned again casey casey the leaves quivered all the way up the trunk just a foot away almost in reach casey are you okay answer me he grabbed the shirt two snakelike tendrils swung out at him huh he cried out paralyzed with fear whats happening the tendrils wrapped themselves around his waist let go he cried holding the tshirt tightly in one hand grabbing at the tendrils with the other the tendrils hung on and gently tightened around him margaret casey tried calling but no sound came out of his mouth margaret he jerked violently then pulled straight ahead the tendrils held on they didnt squeeze him they werent trying to strangle him or pull him back but they didnt let go they felt warm and wet against his bare skin like animal arms not like a plant help he again tried to shout he pulled once more leaning forward using all his strength no good he ducked low hit the floor tried to roll away the tendrils hung on the plant uttered a loud sigh let go casey cried finally finding his voice and then suddenly margaret was standing beside him he hadnt heard her come down the stairs he hadnt seen her enter the room casey she cried whats her mouth dropped open and her eyes grew wide it wont let go he told her no she screamed and grabbed one of the tendrils with both hands and tugged with all her strength the tendril resisted for only a moment then went slack casey uttered a joyful cry and spun away from the remaining tendril margaret dropped the tendril and grabbed caseys hand and began running toward the stairs oh they both stopped short at the bottom of the stairway standing at the top was their father glaring down at them his hands balled into tight fists at his sides his face rigid with anger dad the plants margaret cried he stared down at them his eyes cold and angry unblinking he was silent it grabbed casey margaret told him i just went down to get my shirt casey said his voice trembling they stared up at him expectantly waiting for him to move to unball his fists to relax his hard expression to speak but he glared down at them for the longest time finally he said youre okay yeah they said in unison both of them nodding margaret realized she was still holding caseys hand she let go of it and reached for the banister im very disappointed in you both dr brewer said in a low flat voice cool but not angry sorry margaret said we knew we shouldnt we didnt touch anything really casey exclaimed very disappointed their father repeated sorry dad dr brewer motioned for them to come upstairs then he stepped into the hallway i thought he was going to yell at us casey whispered to margaret as he followed her up the steps thats not dads style margaret whispered back he sure yelled at us the last time we started into the basement casey replied they followed their father into the kitchen he motioned for them to sit down at the white formica table then dropped into a chair across from them his eyes went from one to the other as if studying them as if seeing them for the first time his expression was totally flat almost robotlike revealing no emotion at all dad whats with those plants casey asked what do you mean dr brewer asked theyre so weird casey said ill explain them to you some day he said flatly still staring at the two of them it looks very interesting margaret said struggling to say the right thing was their dad trying to make them feel uncomfortable she wondered if so he was doing a good job of it this wasnt like him not at all he was always a very direct person margaret thought if he was angry he said he was angry if he was upset hed tell them he was upset so why was he acting so strange so silent so cold i asked you not to go in the basement he said quietly crossing his legs and leaning back so that the kitchen chair tilted back on two legs i thought i made it clear margaret and casey glanced at each other finally margaret said we wont do it again but cant you take us down there and tell us what youre doing casey asked he still hadnt put the tshirt on he was holding it in a ball between his hands on the kitchen table yeah wed really like to understand it margaret added enthusiastically some day their father said he returned the chair to all four legs and then stood up well do it soon okay he raised his arms above his head and stretched ive got to get back to work he disappeared into the front hallway casey raised his eyes to margaret and shrugged their father reappeared carrying the lab coat he had tossed over the front banister mom got off okay margaret asked he nodded i guess he pulled on the lab coat over his head i hope aunt eleanor is okay margaret said dr brewers reply was muffled as he adjusted the lab coat and straightened the collar later he said he disappeared into the hallway they heard him shut the basement door behind him i guess hes not going to ground us or anything for going down there margaret said leaning against the table and resting her chin in her hands i guess casey said he sure is acting weird maybe hes upset because mom is gone margaret said she sat up and gave casey a push come on get up ive got work to do i cant believe that plant grabbed me casey said thoughtfully not budging you dont have to push casey griped but he climbed to his feet and stepped out of margarets way im going to have bad dreams tonight he said glumly just dont think about the basement margaret advised thats really lame advice she told herself but what else could she say she went up to her room thinking about how she missed her mother already then the scene in the basement with casey trying to pull himself free of the enormous twining plant tendrils played once again through her mind with a shudder she grabbed her textbook and threw herself onto her stomach on the bed prepared to read but the words on the page blurred as the moaning breathing plants kept creeping back into her thoughts at least were not being punished for going down there she thought at least dad didnt yell and frighten us this time and at least dad has promised to take us downstairs with him soon and explain to us what hes working on down there that thought made margaret feel a lot better she felt better until the next morning when she awoke early and went downstairs to make some breakfast to her surprise her father was already at work the basement door was shut tight and a lock had been installed on the door the next saturday afternoon margaret was up in her room lying on top of the bed talking to her mom on the phone im really sorry about aunt eleanor she said twisting the white phone cord around her wrist the surgery didnt go as well as expected her mother said sounding very tired the doctors say she may have to have more surgery but they have to build up her strength first i guess this means you wont be coming home real soon margaret said sadly mrs brewer laughed dont tell me you actually miss me well yes margaret admitted she raised her eyes to the bedroom window two sparrows had landed outside on the window ledge and were chattering excitedly distracting margaret making it hard to hear her mother over the crackling line from tucson hows your father doing mrs brewer asked i spoke to him last night but he only grunted he doesnt even grunt to us margaret complained she held her hand over her ear to drown out the chattering birds he hardly says a word hes working really hard mrs brewer replied in the background margaret could hear some kind of loudspeaker announcement her mother was calling from a pay phone at the hospital he never comes out of the basement margaret complained a little more bitterly than she had intended your fathers experiments are very important to him her mother said more important than we are margaret cried she hated the whiny tone in her voice she wished she hadnt started complaining about her dad over the phone her mother had enough to worry about at the hospital margaret knew she shouldnt make her feel even worse your dad has a lot to prove mrs brewer said to himself and to others i think hes working so hard because he wants to prove to mr martinez and the others at the university that they were wrong to fire him he wants to show them that they made a big mistake but we used to see him more before he was home all the time margaret complained she could hear her mother sigh impatiently margaret im trying to explain to you youre old enough to understand im sorry margaret said quickly she decided to change the subject hes wearing a baseball cap all of a sudden who casey no mom margaret replied dad hes wearing a dodgers cap he never takes it off really mrs brewer sounded very surprised margaret laughed we told him he looks really dorky in it but he refuses to take it off mrs brewer laughed too uhoh im being called she said got to run take care dear ill try to call back later a click and she was gone margaret stared up at the ceiling watching shadows from trees in the front yard move back and forth the sparrows had flown away leaving silence behind poor mom margaret thought shes so worried about her sister and i had to go and complain about dad why did i do that she sat up listening to the silence casey was over at a friends her dad was no doubt working in the basement the door carefully locked behind him maybe ill give diane a call margaret thought she reached for the phone then realized she was hungry lunch first she decided then diane she brushed her dark hair quickly shaking her head at the mirror over her dressing table then hurried downstairs to her surprise her dad was in the kitchen he was huddled over the sink his back to her she started to call out to him but stopped what was he doing curious she pressed against the wall gazing at him through the doorway to the kitchen dr brewer appeared to be eating something with one hand he was holding a bag on the counter beside the sink as margaret watched in surprise he dipped his hand into the bag pulled out a big handful of something and shoved it into his mouth margaret watched him chew hungrily noisily then pull out another handful from the bag and eat it greedily what on earth is he eating she wondered he never eats with casey and me he always says he isnt hungry but he sure is hungry now he acts as if hes starving she watched from the doorway as dr brewer continued to grab handful after handful from the bag gulping down his solitary meal after a while he crinkled up the bag and tossed it into the trash can under the sink then he wiped his hands off on the sides of his white lab coat margaret quickly backed away from the door tiptoed through the hall and ducked into the living room she held her breath as her father came into the hall clearing his throat loudly the basement door closed behind him she heard him carefully lock it when she was sure that he had gone downstairs margaret walked eagerly into the kitchen she had to know what her father had been eating so greedily so hungrily she pulled open the sink cabinet reached into the trash and pulled out the crinkledup bag then she gasped aloud as her eyes ran over the label her father she saw had been devouring plant food margaret swallowed hard her mouth felt dry as cotton she suddenly realized she was squeezing the side of the counter so tightly her hand ached forcing herself to loosen her grip she stared down at the halfempty plant food bag which she had dropped onto the floor she felt sick she couldnt get the disgusting picture out of her mind how could her dad eat mud he didnt just eat it she realized he shoveled it into his mouth and gulped it down as if he liked it as if he needed it eating the plant food had to be part of his experiments margaret told herself but what kind of experiments what was he trying to prove with those strange plants he was growing the stuff inside the bag smelled sour like fertilizer margaret took a deep breath and held it she suddenly felt sick to her stomach staring at the bag she couldnt help but imagine what the disgusting muck inside must taste like ohh she nearly gagged how could her own father shove this horrid stuff into his mouth still holding her breath she grabbed the nearly empty bag wadded it up and tossed it back into the trash she started to turn away from the counter when a hand grabbed her shoulder margaret uttered a silent cry and spun around casey im home he said grinning at her whats for lunch later after making him a peanut butter sandwich she told casey what she had seen casey laughed it isnt funny she said crossly our own dad was eating dirt casey laughed again for some reason it struck him funny margaret punched him hard on the shoulder so hard that he dropped his sandwich sorry she said quickly but i dont see what youre laughing at its sick theres something wrong with dad something really wrong maybe he just had a craving for plant food casey cracked still not taking her seriously you know like you get a craving for those honeyroasted peanuts thats different margaret snapped eating dirt is disgusting why wont you admit it but before casey could reply margaret continued letting all of her unhappiness out at once dont you see dad has changed a lot even since mom has been gone he spends even more time in the basement thats because mom isnt around casey interrupted and hes so quiet all the time and so cold to us margaret continued ignoring him he hardly says a word to us he used to kid around all the time and ask us about our homework he never says a human word he never calls me princess or fatso the way he used to he never you hate those names fatso casey said giggling with a mouthful of peanut butter i know margaret said impatiently thats just an example so what are you trying to say casey asked that dad is out of his tree that hes gone totally bananas i i dont know margaret answered in frustration watching him gulp down that disgusting plant food i i had this horrible thought that hes turning into a plant casey jumped up causing his chair to scrape back across the floor he began staggering around the kitchen zombielike his eyes closed his arms stretched out stiffly in front of him i am the incredible plant man he declared trying to make his voice sound bold and deep not funny margaret insisted crossing her arms over her chest refusing to be amused plant man versus weed woman casey declared staggering toward margaret not funny she repeated he bumped into the counter banging his knee ow serves you right margaret said plant man kills he cried and rushed at her he ran right into her using his head as a battering ram against her shoulder casey will you stop it she screamed give me a break okay okay he backed off if youll do me one favor what favor margaret asked rolling her eyes make me another sandwich monday afternoon after school margaret casey and diane were tossing a frisbee back and forth in dianes backyard it was a warm breezy day the sky dotted with small puffy white clouds diane tossed the disc high it sailed over caseys head into the row of fragrant lemon trees that stretched from behind the clapboard garage casey went running after it and tripped over an inground sprinkler that poked up just an inch above the lawn both girls laughed casey on the run flung the frisbee toward margaret she reached for it but the breeze sent it sailing from her hand whats it like to have a mad scientist for a dad diane asked suddenly what margaret wasnt sure she heard right dont just stand there throw it casey urged from beside the garage margaret tossed the frisbee high in the air in her brothers general direction he liked to run and make diving catches just because hes doing strange experiments doesnt mean hes a mad scientist margaret said sharply strange is right diane said her expression turning serious i had a nightmare last night about those gross plants in your basement they were crying and reaching for me sorry margaret said sincerely ive had nightmares too look out casey cried he tossed a low one that diane caught around her ankles mad scientist margaret thought mad scientist mad scientist the words kept repeating in her mind mad scientists were only in the movies right my dad was talking about your dad the other night diane said flipping the disc to casey you didnt tell him about going down in the basement did you margaret asked anxiously no diane replied shaking her head hey are these lemons ripe casey asked pointing at one of the low trees why dont you suck one to find out margaret snapped annoyed that he kept interrupting why dont you he predictably shot back my dad said that your dad was fired from polytech because his experiments got out of control and he wouldnt stop them diane confided she ran along the smooth closely cropped grass chasing down the frisbee what do you mean margaret asked the university told him he had to stop whatever it was he was doing and he refused he said he couldnt stop at least thats what my dad heard from a guy who came into the salesroom margaret hadnt heard this story it made her feel bad but she thought it was probably true something really bad happened in your dads lab diane continued someone got really hurt or killed or something thats not true margaret insisted we wouldve heard if that happened yeah probably diane admitted but my dad said your dad was fired because he refused to stop his experiments well that doesnt make him a mad scientist margaret said defensively she suddenly felt she had to stick up for her father she wasnt sure why im just telling you what i heard diane said brusquely tossing back her red hair you dont have to bite my head off they played for a few more minutes diane changed the subject and talked about some kids they knew who were eleven but were going steady then they talked about school for a while time to go margaret called to casey he picked the frisbee up from the lawn and came running over call you later margaret told diane giving her a little wave then she and casey began to jog home cutting through familiar backyards we need a lemon tree casey said as they slowed to a walk theyre cool oh yeah margaret replied sarcastically thats just what we need at our house another plant as they stepped through the hedges into their backyard they were both surprised to see their dad he was standing at the rose trellis examining clusters of pink roses hey dad casey called catch he tossed the frisbee to his father dr brewer turned around a little too slowly the frisbee glanced off his head knocking the dodgers cap off his mouth opened wide in surprise he raised his hands to cover his head but it was too late margaret and casey both shrieked in surprise as they saw his head at first margaret thought her fathers hair had turned green but then she clearly saw that it wasnt hair on his scalp his hair was gone it had all fallen out in place of hair dr brewer had bright green leaves sprouting from his head kids its okay dr brewer called he bent down quickly picked up the baseball cap and replaced it on his head a crow flew low overhead cawing loudly margaret raised her eyes to follow the bird but the sight of the hideous leaves sprouting from her fathers head wouldnt go away her whole head began to itch as she imagined what it must feel like to have leaves uncurling from your scalp its okay really dr brewer repeated hurrying over to them but dad your head casey stammered he suddenly looked very pale margaret felt sick she kept swallowing hard trying to ride out the waves of nausea come here you two their father said softly putting an arm around each of their shoulders lets sit down in the shade over there and have a talk i spoke to your mom on the phone this morning she told me youre upset about my work your head its all green casey repeated i know dr brewer said smiling thats why i put on the cap i didnt want you two to worry he led them to the shade of the tall hedges that ran along the garage and they sat down on the grass i guess you two think your dad has gotten pretty weird huh he stared into margarets eyes feeling uncomfortable she looked away cawing frantically the crow flew over again heading in the other direction margaret you havent said a word her father said squeezing her hand tenderly between his whats wrong what do you want to say to me margaret sighed and still avoided her fathers glance come on tell us why do you have leaves growing out of your head she asked bluntly its a side effect he told her continuing to hold her hand its only temporary itll go away soon and my hair will grow back but how did it happen casey asked staring at his fathers dodgers cap a few green leaves poked out from under the brim maybe you two would feel better if i explained what im trying to do down in the basement dr brewer said shifting his weight and leaning back on his hands ive been so wrapped up in my experiments i havent had much time to talk to you you havent had any time margaret corrected him im sorry he said lowering his eyes i really am but this work im doing is so exciting and so difficult did you discover a new kind of plant casey asked crossing his legs beneath him no im trying to build a new kind of plant dr brewer explained huh casey exclaimed have you ever talked about dna in school their father asked they shook their heads well its pretty complicated he continued dr brewer thought for a moment let me try and put it in simple terms he said fiddling with the bandage around his hand lets say we took a person who had a very high iq you know real brain power like me casey interrupted casey shut up margaret said edgily a real brain like casey dr brewer said agreeably and lets say we were able to isolate the molecule or gene or tiny part of a gene that enabled the person to have such high intelligence and then lets say we were able to transmit it into other brains and then this brain power could be passed along from generation to generation and lots of people would have a high iq do you understand he looked first at casey then at margaret yeah kind of margaret said you take a good quality from one person and put it into other people and then they have the good quality too and they pass it on to their children and on and on very good dr brewer said smiling for the first time in weeks thats what a lot of botanists do with plants they try to take the fruitbearing building block from one plant and put it into another create a new plant that will bear five times as much fruit or five times as much grain or vegetables and thats what youre doing casey asked not exactly their father said lowering his voice im doing something a little more unusual i really dont want to go into detail now but ill tell you that what im trying to do is build a kind of plant that has never existed and could never exist im trying to build a plant thats part animal casey and margaret stared at their father in surprise margaret was the first to speak you mean youre taking cells from an animal and putting them into a plant he nodded i really dont want to say more you two understand why this must be kept secret he turned his eyes on margaret then casey studying their reactions how do you do it margaret asked thinking hard about everything he had just told them how do you get these cells from the animals to the plant im trying to do it by breaking them down electronically he answered i have two glass booths connected by a powerful electron generator you may have seen them when you were snooping around down there he made a sour face yeah they look like phone booths casey said one booth is a sender and one is a receiver he explained im trying to send the right dma the right building blocks from one booth to the other its very delicate work and have you done it margaret asked ive come very close dr brewer said a pleased smile crossing his face the smile lasted only a few seconds then his expression thoughtful he abruptly climbed to his feet got to get back to work he said quietly see you two later he started walking across the lawn taking long strides but dad margaret called after him she and casey climbed to their feet too your head the leaves you didnt explain it she said as she and her brother hurried to catch up to him dr brewer shrugged nothing to explain he said curtly just a side effect he adjusted his dodgers cap dont worry about it its only temporary just a side effect then he hurried into the house casey seemed really pleased by their dads explanation of what was going on in the basement dads doing really important work he said with unusual seriousness but as margaret made her way into the house she found herself troubled by what her dad had said and even more troubled by what he hadnt said margaret closed the door to her room and lay down on the bed to think about things her father hadnt really explained the leaves growing on his head just a side effect didnt explain much at all a side effect from what what actually caused it what made his hair fall out when will his hair grow back it was obvious that he hadnt wanted to discuss it with them he had certainly hurried back to his basement after telling them it was just a side effect a side effect it made margaret feel sick every time she thought about it what must it feel like green leaves pushing up from your pores uncurling against your head yuck thinking about it made her itch all over she knew shed have hideous dreams tonight she grabbed her pillow and hugged it over her stomach wrapping her arms tightly around it there were lots of other questions casey and i should have asked she decided like why were the plants moaning down there why did some of them sound like they were breathing why did that plant grab casey what animal was dad using lots of questions not to mention the one margaret wanted to ask most of all why were you gulping down that disgusting plant food but she couldnt ask that one she couldnt let her dad know shed been spying on him she and casey hadnt really asked any of the questions theyd wanted answered they were just so pleased that their father had decided to sit down and talk with them even for a few minutes his explanation was really interesting as far as it went margaret decided and it was good to know that he was close to doing something truly amazing something that would make him really famous but what about the rest of it a frightening thought entered her mind could he have been lying to them no she quickly decided no dad wouldnt lie to us there are just some questions he hasnt answered yet she was still thinking about all of these questions late that night after dinner after talking to diane on the phone for an hour after homework after watching a little tv after going to bed and she was still puzzling over them when she heard her fathers soft footsteps coming up the carpeted stairs she sat up in bed a soft breeze fluttered the curtains across the room she listened to her fathers footsteps pass her room heard him go into the bathroom heard the water begin to run into the sink ive got to ask him she decided glancing at the clock she saw that it was twothirty in the morning but she realized she was wide awake ive got to ask him about the plant food otherwise it will drive me crazy ill think about it and think about it and think about it every time i see him ill picture him standing over the sink shoving handful after handful into his mouth theres got to be a simple explanation she told herself climbing out of bed theres got to be a logical explanation and i have to know it she padded softly down the hall a sliver of light escaping through the bathroom door which was slightly ajar water still ran into the sink she heard him cough then heard him adjust the water i have to know the answer she thought ill just ask him pointblank she stepped into the narrow triangle of light and peered into the bathroom he was standing at the sink leaning over it his chest bare his shirt tossed behind him on the floor he had put the baseball cap on the closed toilet lid and the leaves covering his head shone brightly under the bathroom light margaret held her breath the leaves were so geeen so thick he didnt notice her he was concentrating on the bandage on his hand using a small scissors he cut the bandage then pulled it off the hand was still bleeding margaret saw or was it what was that dripping from the cut on her fathers hand still holding her breath she watched him wash it off carefully under the hot water then he examined it his eyes narrowed in concentration after washing the cut continued to bleed margaret stared hard trying to better focus her eyes it couldnt be blood could it it couldnt be blood dripping into the sink it was bright green she gasped and started to run back to her room the floor creaked under her footsteps whos there dr brewer cried margaret casey he poked his head into the hallway as margaret disappeared back into her room he saw me she realized leaping into bed he saw me and now hes coming after me margaret pulled the covers up to her chin she realized she was trembling her whole body shaking and chilled she held her breath and listened she could still hear water splashing into the bathroom sink but no footsteps he isnt coming after me she told herself letting out a long silent sigh how could i have thought that how could i have been so terrified of my own father terrified it was the first time the word had crossed her mind but sitting there in bed trembling so violently holding onto the covers so hard listening for his approaching footsteps margaret realized that she was terrified of her own father if only mom were home she thought without thinking she reached for the phone she had the idea in her head to call her mother wake her up tell her to come home as fast as she could tell her something terrible was happening to dad that he was changing that he was acting so weird she glanced at the clock twofortythree no she couldnt do that her poor mother was having such a terrible time in tucson trying to care for her sister margaret couldnt frighten her like that besides what could she say how could she explain to her mother how she had become terrified of her own father mrs brewer would just tell her to calm down that her father still loved her that he would never harm her that he was just caught up in his work caught up he had leaves growing out of his head he was eating dirt and his blood was green caught up she heard the water in the sink shut off she heard the bathroom light being clicked off then she heard her father pad slowly to his room at the end of the hall margaret relaxed a little slid down in the bed loosened her grip on the blankets she closed her eyes and tried to clear her mind she tried counting sheep that never worked she tried counting to one thousand at she sat up her head throbbed her mouth was as dry as cotton she decided to go downstairs and get a drink of cold water from the refrigerator im going to be a wreck tomorrow she thought making her way silently through the hall and down the stairs it is tomorrow what am i going to do ive got to get to sleep the kitchen floor creaked beneath her bare feet the refrigerator motor clicked on noisily startling her be cool she told herself youve got to be cool she had opened the refrigerator and was reaching for the water bottle when a hand grabbed her shoulder aii she cried out and dropped the open bottle onto the floor icecold water puddled around her feet she leapt back but her feet were soaked casey you scared me she exclaimed what are you doing up what are you doing up he replied half asleep his blond hair matted against his forehead i couldnt sleep help me mop up this water i didnt spill it he said backing away you mop it up you made me spill it margaret declared shrilly she grabbed a roll of paper towels off the counter and handed him a wad of them come on hurry they both got down on their knees and by the light from the refrigerator began mopping up the cold water i just keep thinking about things casey said tossing a soaking wad of paper towel onto the counter thats why i cant sleep me too margaret said frowning she started to say something else but a sound from the hallway stopped her it was a plaintive cry a moan filled with sadness margaret gasped and stopped dabbing at the water what was that caseys eyes filled with fear they heard it again such a sad sound like a plea a mournful plea it its coming from the basement margaret said do you think its a plant casey asked very quietly do you think its one of dads plants margaret didnt answer she crouched on her knees not moving just listening another moan softer this time but just as mournful i dont think dad told us the truth she told casey staring into his eyes he looked pale and frightened in the dim refrigerator light i dont think a tomato plant would make a sound like that margaret climbed to her feet collected the wet clumps of paper towel and deposited them in the trash can under the sink then she closed the refrigerator door covering the room in darkness her hand on caseys shoulder she guided him out of the kitchen and through the hall they stopped at the basement door and listened silence now casey tried the door it was locked another low moan sounding very nearby now its so human casey whispered margaret shuddered what was going on down in the basement what was really going on she led the way up the stairs and waited at her doorway until casey was safely in his room he gave her a wave yawning silently and closed the door behind him a few seconds later margaret was back in her bed the covers pulled up to her chin despite the warmth of the night her mouth was still achingly dry she realized she had never managed to get a drink somehow she drifted into a restless sleep her alarm went off at seventhirty she sat up and thought about school then she remembered there was no school for the next two days because of some kind of teachers conference she turned off the dock radio slumped back onto her pillow and tried to go back to sleep but she was awake now thoughts of the night before pouring back into her mind flooding her with the fear she had felt just a few hours earlier she stood up and stretched and decided to go talk to her father to confront him first thing to ask all the questions she wanted to ask if i dont hell disappear down to the basement and ill sit around thinking these frightening thoughts all day she told herself i dont want to be terrified of my own father i dont she pulled a light cotton robe over her pajamas found her slippers in the cluttered closet and stepped out into the hallway it was hot and stuffy in the hall almost suffocating pale morning light filtered down from the skylight overhead she stopped in front of caseys room wondering if she should wake him so that he could ask their father questions too no she decided the poor guy was up half the night ill let him sleep taking a deep breath she walked the rest of the hall and stopped at her parents bedroom the door was open dad no reply dad are you up she stepped into the room dad he didnt seem to be there the air in here was heavy and smelled strangely sour the curtains were drawn the bedclothes were rumpled and tossed down at the foot of the bed margaret took a few more steps toward the bed dad no she had missed him he was probably already locked in his basement workroom she realized unhappily he must have gotten up very early and what was that in the bed margaret clicked on a dresser lamp and stepped up beside the bed oh no she cried raising her hands to her face in horror the bedsheet was covered with a thick layer of dirt clumps of dirt margaret stared down at it not breathing not moving the dirt was black and appeared to be moist and the dirt was moving moving it cant be margaret thought thats impossible she leaned down to take a closer look at the layer of dirt no the dirt wasnt moving the dirt was filled with dozens of moving insects and long brown earthworms all crawling through the wet black clumps that lined her fathers bed casey didnt come downstairs until tenthirty before his arrival margaret had made herself breakfast managed to pull on jeans and a tshirt had talked to diane on the phone for half an hour and had spent the rest of the time pacing back and forth in the living room trying to decide what to do desperate to talk to her dad she had banged a few times on the basement door timidly at first and then loudly but he either couldnt hear her or chose not to he didnt respond when casey finally emerged she poured him a tall glass of orange juice and led him out to the backyard to talk it was a hazy day the sky mostly yellow the air already stifling hot even though the sun was still hovering low over the hills walking toward the block of green shade cast by the hedges she told her brother about their dads green blood and about the insectfilled dirt in his bed casey stood openmouthed holding the glass of orange juke in front of him untouched he stared at margaret and didnt say anything for a very long time finally he set the orange juice down on the lawn and said what should we do in a voice just above a whisper margaret shrugged i wish mom would call would you tell her everything casey asked shoving his hands deep into the pockets of his baggy shorts i guess margaret said i dont know if shed believe it but its so scary casey said i mean hes our dad weve known him our whole lives i mean i know margaret said but hes not the same hes maybe he can explain it all casey said thoughtfully maybe theres a good reason for everything you know like the leaves on his head we asked him about that margaret reminded her brother he just said it was a side effect not much of an explanation casey nodded but didnt reply i told some of it to diane margaret admitted casey looked up at her in surprise well i had to tell somebody she snapped edgily diane thought i should call the police huh casey shook his head dad hasnt done anything wrong has he what would the police do i know margaret replied thats what i told diane but she said theres got to be some kind of law against being a mad scientist dad isnt a mad scientist casey said angrily thats stupid hes just hes just just what margaret thought what is he a few hours later they were still in the backyard trying to figure out what to do when the kitchen door opened and their father called them to come in margaret looked at casey in surprise i dont believe it he came upstairs maybe we can talk to him casey said they both raced into the kitchen dr brewer his dodgers cap in place flashed them a smile as he set two soup bowls down on the table hi he said brightly lunchtime huh you made lunch casey exclaimed unable to conceal his astonishment dad weve got to talk margaret said seriously afraid i dont have much time he said avoiding her stare sit down try this new dish i want to see if you like it margaret and casey obediently took their places at the table what is this stuff casey cried the two bowls were filled with a green pulpy substance it looks like green mashed potatoes casey said making a face its something different dr brewer said mysteriously standing over them at the head of the table go ahead taste it ill bet youll be surprised dad youve never made lunch for us before margaret said trying to keep the suspicion out of her voice i just wanted you to try this he said his smile fading youre my guinea pigs we have some things we want to ask you margaret said lifting her spoon but not eating the green mess your mother called this morning their father said when margaret asked eagerly just a short while ago i guess you were outside and didnt hear the phone ring what did she say casey asked staring down at the bowl in front of him aunt eleanors doing better shes been moved out of intensive care your mom may be able to come home soon great margaret and casey cried in unison eat dr brewer instructed pointing to the bowls uh arent you going to have some casey asked rolling his spoon around in his fingers no their father replied quickly i already ate he leaned with both hands against the tabletop margaret saw that his cut hand was freshly bandaged dad last night she started but he cut her off eat will you try it but what is it casey demanded whining it doesnt smell too good i think youll like the taste dr brewer insisted impatiently it should taste very sweet he stared at them urging them to eat the green stuff staring into the bowl at the mysterious substance margaret was suddenly frozen with fear hes too eager for us to eat this she thought glancing up at her brother hes too desperate hes never made lunch before why did he make this and why wont he tell us what it is whats going on here she wondered and caseys expression revealed that he was wondering the same thing is dad trying to do something to us is this green stuff going to change us or hurt us or make us grow leaves too what crazy thoughts margaret realized but she also realized that she was terrified of whatever this stuff was he was trying to feed them whats the matter with you two their father cried impatiently he raised his hand in an eating gesture pick up your spoons come on what are you waiting for margaret and casey raised their spoons and dropped them into the soft green substance but they didnt raise the spoons to their mouths they couldnt eat eat dr brewer screamed pounding the table with his good hand what are you waiting for eat your lunch go ahead eat it hes giving us no choice margaret thought her hand was trembling as she reluctantly raised the spoon to her mouth go ahead youll like it dr brewer insisted leaning over the table casey watched as margaret raised the spoon to her lips the doorbell rang who could that be dr brewer asked very annoyed at the interruption ill be right back kids he lumbered out to the front hall saved by the bell margaret said dropping the spoon back into the bowl with a sickening plop this stuff is disgusting casey whispered its some kind of plant food or something yuck quick margaret said jumping up and grabbing the two bowls help me they rushed to the sink pulled out the wastebasket and scooped the contents of both bowls into the garbage then they carried both bowls back to the table and set them down beside the spoons lets go see whos at the door casey said they crept into the hall in time to see a man carrying a black briefcase step into the front entranceway and greet their father with a short handshake the man had a tanned bald head and was wearing large bluelensed sunglasses he had a brown mustache and was wearing a navy blue suit with a redandwhite striped tie mr martinez their father exclaimed what a surprise thats dads old boss from polytech margaret whispered to casey i know casey replied peevishly i said weeks ago id come check up on how your work is coming along martinez said sniffing the air for some reason wellington gave me a lift my car is in the garage for a change well im not really ready dr brewer stammered looking very uncomfortable even from margarets vantage point behind him i wasnt expecting anyone i mean i dont think this is a good time no problem ill just have a quick look martinez said putting a hand on dr brewers shoulder as if to calm him ive always been so interested in your work you know that and you know that it wasnt my idea to let you go the board forced me they gave me no choice but im not giving up on you i promise you that come on lets see what kind of progress youre making well dr brewer couldnt hide his displeasure at mr martinezs surprise appearance he scowled and tried to block the path to the basement steps at least it seemed that way to margaret who watched silently beside her brother mr martinez stepped past dr brewer and pulled open the basement door hi guys mr martinez gave the two kids a wave hoisting his briefcase as if it weighed two tons their father looked surprised to see them there did you kids finish your lunch yeah it was pretty good casey lied the answer seemed to please dr brewer adjusting the brim of his dodgers cap he followed mr martinez into the basement carefully closing and locking the door behind him maybe hell give dad his job back casey said walking back into the kitchen he pulled open the refrigerator to look for something for lunch dont be stupid margaret said reaching over him to pull out a container of egg salad if dad really is growing plants that are part animal hell be famous he wont need a job yeah i guess casey said thoughtfully is that all there is just egg salad ill make you a sandwich margaret offered im not really hungry casey replied that green stuff made me sick why do you think he wanted us to eat it i dont know margaret said she put a hand on caseys slender shoulder im really scared casey i wish mom were home me too he said quietly margaret put the egg salad back into the refrigerator she closed the door then leaned her hot forehead against it casey what do you think dad is telling us the truth about what about anything i dont know casey said shaking his head then his expression suddenly changed theres one way to find out he said his eyes lighting up huh what do you mean margaret pushed herself away from the refrigerator the first chance we get the first time dad is away casey whispered lets go back down in the basement and see for ourselves what dad is doing they got their chance the next afternoon when their father emerged from the basement red metal toolchest in hand i promised mr henry next door id help him install a new sink in his bathroom he explained adjusting his dodgers cap with his free hand when are you coming back casey asked glancing at margaret not very subtle casey margaret thought rolling her eyes it shouldnt take more than a couple of hours dr brewer said he disappeared out the kitchen door they watched him cut through the hedges in the backyard and head to mr henrys back door its now or never margaret said glancing doubtfully at casey think we can do this she tried the door locked as usual no problem casey said a mischievous grin spreading across his face go get a paper clip ill show you what my friend kevin taught me last week margaret obediently found a paper clip on her desk and brought it to him casey straightened the clip out then poked it into the lock in a few seconds he hummed a triumphant fanfare and pulled the door open now youre an expert lock picker huh your friend kevin is a good guy to know margaret said shaking her head casey grinned and motioned for margaret to go first okay lets not think about it lets just do it margaret said summoning her courage and stepping onto the landing a few seconds later they were in the basement knowing a little of what to expect down here didnt make it any less frightening they were hit immediately by a blast of steamy hot air the air margaret realized was so wet so thick that droplets immediately clung to her skin squinting against the sudden bright light they stopped in the doorway to the plant room the plants seemed taller thicker more plentiful than the first time they had ventured down here long sinewy tendrils drooped from thick yellow stalks broad green and yellow leaves bobbed and trembled shimmering under the white light leaves slapped against each other making a soft wet sound a fat tomato plopped to the ground everything seemed to shimmer the plants all seemed to quiver expectantly they werent standing still they seemed to be reaching up reaching out quaking with energy as they grew long brown tendrils snaked along the dirt wrapping themselves around other plants around each other a bushy fern had grown to the ceiling curved and started its way back down again wow casey cried impressed with this trembling glistening jungle are all these plants really brandnew i guess so margaret said softly they look prehistoric they heard breathing sounds loud sighing a low moan coming from the direction of the supply closet against the wall a tendril suddenly swung out from a long stalk margaret pulled casey back look out dont get too close she warned i know he said sharply moving away from her dont grab me like that you scared me the tendril slid harmlessly to the dirt sorry she said squeezing his shoulder affectionately its just well you remember last time ill be careful he said margaret shuddered she heard breathing steady quiet breathing these plants are definitely not normal she thought she took a step back letting her eyes roam over the amazing jungle of slithering sighing plants she was still staring at them when she heard caseys terrified scream help its got me its got me margaret uttered a shriek of terror and spun away from the plants to find her brother help casey cried gripped with fear margaret took a few steps toward casey then saw the small gray creature scampering across the floor she started to laugh casey its a squirrel what his voice was several octaves higher than normal it it grabbed my ankle and look margaret said pointing its a squirrel look how scared it is it must have run right into you oh casey sighed the color began to return to his ashgray face i thought it was a plant right a furry gray plant margaret said shaking her head her heart was still thudding in her chest you sure gave me a scare casey the squirrel stopped several yards away turned stood up on its hind legs and stared back at them quivering all over how did a squirrel get down here casey demanded his voice still shaky margaret shrugged squirrels are always getting in she said and remember that chipmunk we couldnt get rid of then she glanced over to the small groundlevel window at the top of the opposite wall that window its open she told casey the squirrel must have climbed in over there shoo casey yelled at the squirrel he started to chase it the squirrels tail shot right up in the air and then it took off running through the tangled plants get out get out casey screamed the terrified squirrel with casey in close pursuit circled the plants twice then it headed to the far wall leapt onto a carton then onto a higher carton then bounded out the open window casey stopped running and stared up at the window good work margaret said now lets get out of here we dont know what anything is we have no idea what to look for so we cant tell if dad is telling the truth or not she started toward the stairs but stopped when she heard the bumping sound casey did you hear that she searched for her brother but he was hidden by the thick leaves of the plants casey yeah i heard it he answered still out of her view its coming from the supply closet the loud thumping made margaret shudder it sounded to her exactly like someone banging on the closet wall casey lets check it out she said no reply the banging got louder casey why wasnt he answering her casey where are you youre frightening me margaret called moving closer to the shimmering plants another tomato plopped to the ground so near her foot it made her jump despite the intense heat she suddenly felt cold all over casey margaret come here ive found something he finally said he sounded uncertain worried she hurried around the plants and saw him standing in front of the worktable beside the supply closet the banging from the closet had stopped casey whats the matter you scared me margaret scolded she stopped and leaned against the wooden worktable look her brother said holding up a dark foldedup bundle i found this on the floor shoved under this worktable huh what is it margaret asked casey unfolded it it was a suit jacket a blue suit jacket a redstriped necktie was folded inside it its mr martinezs casey said squeezing the collar of the wrinkled jacket between his hands its his jacket and tie margarets mouth dropped open into a wide o of surprise you mean he left it here if he left it why was it bundled up and shoved back under the table casey asked margaret stared at the jacket she ran her hand over the silky striped tie did you see mr martinez leave the house yesterday afternoon casey asked no margaret answered but he must have left i mean his car was gone he didnt drive remember he told dad he got a lift margaret raised her eyes from the wrinkled jacket to her brothers worried face casey what are you saying that mr martinez didnt leave that he was eaten by a plant or something thats ridiculous then why were his coat and tie hidden like that casey demanded margaret didnt have a chance to respond they both gasped as they heard loud footsteps on the stairs someone was hurrying down to the basement hide margaret whispered where casey asked his eyes wide with panic margaret leapt up onto the carton then pulled herself through the small open window a tight squeeze but she struggled out onto the grass then she turned around to help casey that squirrel turned out to be a friend she thought tugging her brothers arms as he scrambled out of the basement it showed us the only escape route the afternoon air felt quite cool compared to the steamy basement breathing hard they both squatted down to peer into the window who is it casey whispered margaret didnt have to answer they both saw their father step into the white light his eyes searching the plant room why did dad come back casey asked sshhh margaret held a finger to her lips then she climbed to her feet and pulled casey toward the back door come on hurry the back door was unlocked they stepped into the kitchen just as their father emerged from the basement a concerned expression on his face hey there you are he exclaimed hi dad margaret said trying to sound casual whyd you come back had to get more tools he answered studying their faces he eyed them suspiciously where were you two out in the backyard margaret said quickly we came in when we heard the back door slam dr brewer scowled and shook his head you never used to lie to me before he said i know you went down into the basement again you left the door wide open we just wanted to look casey said quickly glancing at margaret his expression fearful we found mr martinezs jacket and tie margaret said what happened to him dad huh the question seemed to catch dr brewer by surprise why did he leave his jacket and tie down there margaret asked im raising two snoops her father griped martinez got hot okay i have to keep the basement at a very high tropical temperature with lots of humidity martinez became uncomfortable he removed his jacket and tie and put them down on the worktable then he forgot them when he left dr brewer chuckled i think he was in a state of shock from everything i showed him down there its no wonder he forgot his things but i called martinez this morning im going to drive over and return his stuff when i finish at mr henrys margaret saw a smile break out on caseys face she felt relieved too it was good to know that mr martinez was okay how awful to suspect my own father of doing something terrible to someone she thought but she couldnt help herself the fear returned every time she saw him id better get going dr brewer said carrying the tools he had picked up he started toward the back door but he stopped at the end of the hall and turned around dont go back in the basement okay it really could be dangerous you could be very sorry margaret listened to the screen door slam behind him was that a warning or a threat she wondered margaret spent saturday morning hiking up in the golden hills with diane the sun burned through the morning smog and the skies turned blue a strong breeze kept them from getting too hot the narrow road was lined with red and yellow wildflowers and margaret felt as if she were traveling somewhere far far away they had lunch at dianes house tomato soup and avocado salad then wandered back to margarets house trying to figure out how to spend the rest of a beautiful afternoon dr brewer was just backing the station wagon down the drive as margaret and diane rode up on their bikes he rolled down the window a broad smile on his face good news he shouted your mom is on her way home im going to the airport to get her oh thats great margaret exclaimed so happy she could almost cry margaret and diane waved and pedaled up the driveway im so happy margaret thought itll be so good to have her back someone i can talk to someone who can explain about dad they looked through some old copies of sassy and people in margarets room listening to some tapes that margaret had recently bought at a little past three diane suddenly remembered that she had a makeup piano lesson that she was late for she rushed out of the house in a panic jumped on her bike yelled say hi to your mom for me and disappeared down the drive margaret stood behind the house looking out at the rolling hills wondering what to do next to make the time pass before her mother got home the strong swirling breeze felt cool against her face she decided to get a book and go sit down with it under the shady sassafras tree in the middle of the yard she turned and pulled open the kitchen door and casey came running up where are our kites he asked out of breath kites i dont know why margaret asked hey she grabbed his shoulder to get his attention moms coming home she should be here in an hour or so great he cried just enough time to fly some kites its so windy come on want to fly em with me sure margaret said it would help pass the time she thought hard trying to remember where they put the kites are they in the garage no casey told her i know theyre in the basement on those shelves the string too he pushed past her into the house ill jimmy the lock and go down and get them hey casey be careful down there she called after him he disappeared into the hallway margaret had second thoughts she didnt want casey down there by himself in the plant room wait up she called ill come with you they made their way down the stairs quickly into the hot steamy air into the bright lights the plants seemed to bend toward them to reach out to them as they walked by margaret tried to ignore them walking right behind casey she kept her eyes on the tall metal shelves straight ahead the shelves were deep and filled with old unwanted toys games and sports equipment a plastic tent some old sleeping bags casey got there first and started rummaging around on the lower shelves i know theyre here somewhere he said yeah i remember storing them here margaret said running her eyes over the top shelves casey down on his knees started pulling boxes off the bottom shelf suddenly he stopped whoa margaret huh she took a step back what is it look at this casey said softly he pulled something out from behind the shelves then stood up with it bundled in his hands margaret saw that he was holding a pair of black shoes and a pair of blue trousers blue suit trousers his face suddenly pale his features drawn casey let the shoes drop to the floor he unfurled the trousers and held them up in front of him hey look in the back pocket margaret said pointing casey reached into the back pocket and pulled out a black leather wallet i dont believe this margaret said caseys hands trembled as he opened the wallet and searched inside he pulled out a green american express card and read the name on it it belongs to mr martinez he said swallowing hard he raised his eyes to margarets this is mr martinezs stuff dad lied casey said staring in horror at the wallet in his hands mr martinez might leave without his jacket but he wouldnt leave without his pants and shoes but what happened to him margaret asked feeling sick casey slammed the wallet shut he shook his head sadly but didnt reply in the center of the room a plant seemed to groan the sound startling the two kids dad lied casey repeated staring down at the pants and shoes on the floor dad lied to us what are we going to do margaret cried panic and desperation in her voice weve got to tell someone whats happening here but who the plant groaned again tendrils snaked along the dirt leaves clapped against each other softly wetly and then the banging began again in the supply closet next to the shelves margaret stared at casey that thumping what is it they both listened to the insistent banging sounds a low moan issued from the closet followed by a higherpitched one both mournful both very humansounding i think someones in there margaret exclaimed maybe its mr martinez casey suggested still gripping the wallet tightly in his hand thud thud thud do you think we should open the closet casey asked timidly a plant groaned as if answering yes i think we should margaret replied suddenly cold all over if its mr martinez in there weve got to let him out casey set the wallet down on the shelf then they moved quickly to the supply closet across from them the plants seemed to shift and move as the two kids did they heard breathing sounds another groan scurrying noises leaves bristled on their stalks tendrils drooped and slid hey look casey cried i see margaret said the closet door wasnt just locked a twobyfour had been nailed over it thud thud thud thud thud theres someone in there i know it margaret cried ill get the hammer casey said keeping close to the wall and as far away from the plants as he could he edged his way toward the worktable a few seconds later he returned with a claw hammer thud thud working together they pried the twobyfour off the door it clattered noisily to the floor the banging from inside the supply closet grew louder more insistent now what do we do about the lock margaret asked staring at it casey scratched his head they both had perspiration dripping down their faces the steamy hot air made it hard to catch their breaths i dont know how to unlock it casey said stumped what if we tried to pry the door off the way we pulled off the twobyfour margaret asked thud thud thud casey shrugged i dont know lets try working the claw of the hammer into the narrow crack they tried prying the door on the side of the lock when it wouldnt budge they moved to the hinged side of the door and tried there its not moving casey said mopping his forehead with his arm keep trying margaret said here lets both push it digging the claw in just above the lower hinge they both pushed the handle of the hammer with all their strength it it moved a little margaret said breathing hard they kept at it the wet wood began to crack they both pushed against the hammer wedging the claw into the crack finally with a loud ripping sound they managed to pull the door off huh casey dropped the hammer they both squinted into the dark closet and screamed in horror when they saw what was inside look margaret cried her heart thudding she suddenly felt dizzy she gripped the side of the closet to steady herself i dont believe this casey said quietly his voice trembling as he stared into the long narrow supply closet they both gaped at the weird plants that filled the closet were they plants under the dim ceiling bulb they bent and writhed groaning breathing sighing branches shook leaves shimmered and moved tall plants leaned forward as if reaching out to margaret and casey look at that one casey cried taking a step back stumbling into margaret it has an arm ohh margaret followed caseys stare casey was right the tall leafy plant appeared to have a green human arm descending from its stalk margarets eyes darted around the closet to her horror she realized that several plants seemed to have human features green arms a yellow hand with three fingers poking from it two stumpy legs where the stem should be she and her brother both cried out when they saw the plant with the face inside a cluster of broad leaves there appeared to grow a round green tomato but the tomato had a humanshaped nose and an open mouth from which it repeatedly uttered the most mournful sighs and groans another plant a short plant with clusters of broad oval leaves had two green nearly human faces partly hidden by the leaves both wailing through open mouths lets get out of here casey cried grabbing margarets hand in fear and tugging her away from the closet this is gross the plants moaned and sighed green fingerless hands reached out to margaret and casey a yellow sicklooking plant near the wall made choking sounds a tall flowering plant staggered toward them thin tendrillike arms outstretched wait margaret cried pulling her hand out of caseys she spotted something on the closet floor behind the moaning shifting plants casey whats that she asked pointing she struggled to focus her eyes in the dim light of the closet on the floor behind the plants near the shelves on the back wall were two human feet margaret stepped cautiously into the closet the feet she saw were attached to legs margaret lets go casey pleaded no look theres someone back there margaret said staring hard huh a person not a plant margaret said she took another step a soft green arm brushed against her side margaret what are you doing casey asked his voice high and frightened i have to see who it is margaret said she took a deep breath and held it then ignoring the moans the sighs the green arms reaching out to her the hideous greentomato faces she plunged through the plants to the back of the closet dad she cried her father was lying on the floor his hands and feet tied tightly with plant tendrils his mouth gagged by a wide strip of elastic tape margaret casey was beside her he lowered his eyes to the floor oh no their father stared up at them pleading with his eyes mmmmm he cried struggling to talk through the gag margaret dived to the floor and started to untie him no stop casey cried and pulled her back by the shoulders casey let go of me whats wrong with you margaret cried angrily its dad he it cant be dad casey said still holding her by the shoulders dad is at the airport remember behind them the plants seemed to be moaning in unison a terrifying chorus a tall plant fell over and rolled toward the open closet door mmmmmmm their father continued to plead struggling at the tendrils that imprisoned him ive got to untie him margaret told her brother let go of me no casey insisted margaret look at his head margaret turned her eyes to her fathers head he was bareheaded no dodgers cap he had tufts of green leaves growing where his hair should be weve already seen that margaret snapped its a side effect remember she reached down to pull at her fathers ropes no dont casey insisted okay okay margaret said ill just pull the tape off his mouth i wont untie him she reached down and tugged at the elastic tape until she managed to get it off kids im so glad to see you dr brewer said quick untie me how did you get in here casey demanded standing above him hands on his hips staring down at him suspiciously we saw you leave for the airport that wasnt me dr brewer said ive been locked in here for days huh casey cried but we saw you margaret started it wasnt me its a plant dr brewer said its a plant copy of me dad casey said please theres no time to explain their father said urgently raising his leafcovered head to look toward the closet doorway just untie me quick the father weve been living with hes a plant margaret cried swallowing hard yes please untie me margaret reached for the tendrils no casey insisted how do we know youre telling the truth ill explain everything i promise he pleaded hurry our lives are at stake mr martinez is in here too startled margaret turned her eyes to the far wall sure enough mr martinez also lay on the floor bound and gagged let me out please her father cried behind them plants moaned and cried margaret couldnt stand it anymore im untying him she told casey and bent down to start grappling with the tendrils her father sighed gratefully casey bent down and reluctantly began working at the tendrils too finally they had loosened them enough so their father could slip out he climbed to his feet slowly stretching his arms moving his legs bending his knees man that feels good he said giving margaret and casey a grim smile dad should we untie mr martinez margaret asked but without warning dr brewer pushed past the two kids and made his way out of the closet dad whoa where are you going margaret called you said youd explain everything casey insisted he and his sister ran through the moaning plants following their father i will i will breathing hard dr brewer strode quickly to the woodpile against the far wall margaret and casey both gasped as he picked up an axe he spun around to face them holding the thick axe handle with both hands his face frozen with determination he started toward them dad what are you doing margaret cried swinging the axe onto his shoulder dr brewer advanced on margaret and casey he groaned from the effort of raising the heavy tool his face reddening his eyes wide excited dad please margaret cried gripping caseys shoulder backing up toward the jungle of plants in the center of the room what are you doing she repeated hes not our real father casey cried i told you we shouldnt untie him he is our real father margaret insisted i know he is she turned her eyes to her father looking for an answer but he stared back at them his face filled with confusion and menace the axe in his hands gleaming under the bright ceiling lights dad answer us margaret demanded answer us before dr brewer could reply they heard loud rapid footsteps clumping down the basement steps all four of them turned to the doorway of the plant room to see an alarmedlooking dr brewer enter he grabbed the bill of his dodgers cap as he strode angrily toward the two kids what are you two doing down here he cried you promised me heres your mother dont you want to mrs brewer appeared at his side she started to call out a greeting but stopped freezing in horror when she saw the confusing scene no she screamed seeing the other dr brewer the capless dr brewer holding an axe in front of him with both hands no her face filled with horror she turned to the dr brewer that had just brought her home he glared accusingly at margaret and casey what have you done you let him escape hes our dad margaret said in a tiny little voice she barely recognized im your dad the dr brewer at the doorway bellowed not him hes not your dad hes not even human hes a plant margaret and casey both gasped and drew back in terror youre the plant the bareheaded dr brewer accused raising the axe hes dangerous the other dr brewer exclaimed how could you have let him out caught in the middle margaret and casey stared from one father to the other who was their real father thats not your father dr brewer with the dodgers cap cried again moving into the room hes a copy a plant copy one of my experiments that went wrong i locked him in the supply closet because hes dangerous youre the copy the other dr brewer accused and raised the axe again margaret and casey stood motionless exchanging terrified glances kids what have you done mrs brewer cried her hands pressed against her cheeks her eyes wide with disbelief what have we done margaret asked her brother in a low voice staring wideeyed from one man to the other casey seemed too frightened to reply i i dont know what to do casey managed to whisper what can we do margaret wondered silently realizing that her entire body was trembling he has to be destroyed the axewielding dr brewer shouted staring at his lookalike across the room beside them plants quivered and shook sighing loudly tendrils slithered across the dirt leaves shimmered and whispered put down the axe youre not fooling anyone the other dr brewer said you have to be destroyed dr brewer with no cap repeated his eyes wild his face scarlet moving closer the axe gleaming as if electrified under the white light dad would never act like this margaret realized casey and i were idiots we let him out of the closet and now hes going to kill our real dad and mom and then us what can i do she wondered trying to think clearly even though her mind was whirring wildly out of control what can i do uttering a desperate cry of protest margaret leapt forward and grabbed the axe from the imposters hands he gaped in surprise as she steadied her grip on the handle it was heavier than shed imagined get back she screamed get back now margaret wait her mother cried still too frightened to move from the doorway the capless dr brewer reached for the axe give it back to me you dont know what youre doing he pleaded and made a wild grab for it margaret pulled back and swung the axe stay back everyone stay back thank goodness dr brewer with the dodgers cap exclaimed weve got to get him back in the closet hes very dangerous he stepped up to margaret give me the axe margaret hesitated give me the axe he insisted margaret turned to her mother what should i do mrs brewer shrugged helplessly i i dont know princess dont do it the capless dr brewer said softly staring into margarets eyes he called me princess margaret realized the other one never had does this mean that the dad in the closet is my real dad margaret give me the axe the one in the cap made a grab for it margaret backed away and swung the axe again get back both of you stay back she warned im warning you dr brewer in the cap said hes dangerous listen to me margaret get back she repeated desperately trying to decide what to do which one is my real dad which one which one which one her eyes darting back and forth from one to the other she saw that each of them had a bandage around his right hand and it gave her an idea casey theres a knife on the wall over there she said still holding the axe poised get it for me fast casey obediently hurried to the wall it took him a short while to find the knife among all the tools hanging there he reached up on tiptoes to pull it down then hurried back to margaret with it margaret lowered the axe and took the longbladed knife from him margaret give me the axe the man in the dodgers cap insisted impatiently margaret what are you doing the man from the supply closet asked suddenly looking frightened i i have an idea margaret said hesitantly she took a deep breath then she stepped over to the man from the supply closet and pushed the knife blade into his arm ow he cried out as the blade cut through the skin margaret pulled the knife back having made a tiny puncture hole red blood trickled from the hole hes our real dad she told casey sighing with relief here dad she handed him the axe margaret youre wrong the man in the baseball cap cried in alarm hes tricked you hes tricked you the capless dr brewer moved quickly he picked up the axe took three steps forward pulled the axe back and swung with all his might the dr brewer in the cap opened his mouth wide and uttered a hushed cry of alarm the cry was choked off as the axe cut easily through his body slicing him in two a thick green liquid oozed from the wound and as the man fell his mouth locking open in disbelief and horror margaret could see that his body was actually a stem he had no bones no human organs the body thudded to the floor green liquid puddled around it princess were okay dr brewer cried flinging the axe aside you guessed right it wasnt a guess margaret said sinking into his arms i remembered the green blood i saw it late at night one of you was in the bathroom bleeding green blood i knew my real dad would have red blood were okay mrs brewer cried rushing into her husbands arms were okay were all okay all four of them rushed together in an emotional family hug one more thing we have to do their father said his arms around the two kids lets get mr martinez out of the closet by dinnertime things had almost returned to normal they had finally managed to welcome their mother home and tried to explain to her all that had happened in her absence mr martinez had been rescued from the supply closet not too much the worse for wear he and dr brewer had had a long discussion about what had happened and about dr brewers work he expressed total bewilderment as to what dr brewer had accomplished but he knew enough to realize that it was historic perhaps you need the structured environment the lab on campus offers ill talk to the board members about getting you back on staff martinez said it was his way of inviting their father back to work after mr martinez was driven home dr brewer disappeared into the basement for about an hour he returned grimfaced and exhausted i destroyed most of the plants he explained sinking into an armchair i had to they were suffering later ill destroy the rest every single plant mrs brewer asked well there are a few normal ones that i can plant out back in the garden he replied he shook his head sadly only a few at dinner he finally had the strength to explain to margaret casey and mrs brewer what had happened down in the basement i was working on a super plant he said trying to electronically make a new plant using dna elements from other plants then i accidentally cut my hand on a slide i didnt realize it but some of my blood got mixed in with the plant molecules i was using when i turned on the machine my molecules got mixed in with plant molecules and i ended up with something that was part human part plant thats gross casey exclaimed dropping a forkful of mashed potatoes well im a scientist dr brewer replied so i didnt think it was gross i thought it was pretty exciting i mean here i was inventing an entirely new kind of creature those plants with faces margaret started her father nodded yes those were things i made by inserting human materials into plant materials i kept putting them in the supply closet i got carried away i didnt know how far i could go how human i could make the plants i could see that my creations were unhappy suffering but i couldnt stop it was too exciting he took a long drink of water from his glass you didnt tell me any of this mrs brewer said shaking her head i couldnt he said i couldnt tell anyone i i was too involved then one day i went too far i created a plant that was an exact copy of me in almost every way he looked like me he sounded like me and he had my brain my mind but he still acted like a plant in some ways margaret said he ate plant food and he wasnt perfect dr brewer said leaning forward over the dinner table talking in a low serious voice he had flaws but he was strong enough and smart enough to overpower me to lock me in the closet to take my place and to continue my experiments and when martinez arrived unexpectedly he locked martinez in the closet too so that his secret would be safe was the head full of leaves one of the flaws casey asked dr brewer nodded yes he was almost a perfect clone of me almost a perfect human but not quite but dad margaret said pointing you have leaves on your head too he reached up and pulled one off i know he said making a disgusted face thats really gross huh everyone agreed well when i cut my hand some of the plant materials mixed with my blood got into my system he explained and then i turned on the machine the machine created a strong chemical reaction between the plant materials and my blood then my hair fell out overnight and the leaves immediately started to sprout dont worry guys the leaves are falling out already i think my hair will grow back margaret and casey cheered i guess things will return to normal around here mrs brewer said smiling at her husband better than normal he said smiling back if martinez convinces the board to give me my job back ill tear out the basement and turn it into the best game room you ever saw margaret and casey cheered again were all alive and safe dr brewer said hugging both kids at once thanks to you two it was the happiest dinner margaret could remember after they had cleaned up they all went out for ice cream it was nearly ten oclock when they returned dr brewer headed for the basement hey where are you going his wife called suspiciously im just going down to deal with the rest of the plants dr brewer assured her i want to make sure that everything is gone that this horrible chapter in our lives is over by the end of the week most of the plants had been destroyed a giant pile of leaves roots and stalks were burned in a bonfire that lasted for hours a few tiny plants had been transplanted outside all of the equipment had been dismantled and trucked to the university on saturday all four brewers went to select a pool table for the new basement rec room on sunday margaret found herself standing in back by the garden staring up at the golden hills its so peaceful now she thought happily so peaceful here and so beautiful the smile faded from her face when she heard the whisper at her feet margaret she looked down to see a small yellow flower nudging her ankle margaret the flower whispered help me please help me im your father really im your real father
