the beatles yeah i remember em especially the little one what was his name oh yeah ringo the stones sure i booked em that mick whatshisname was a strange one let me tell you kiss led zepplin the who eddie and the cruisers ive booked em all at one time or another after awhile they all kind of fade together in your memory in fact theres just one group that stands out strange too since they never made any kind of a splash ever hear of vlad and the impalers i didnt think so hell theres no reason why you should have i never heard of em either until benny hes not exactly my partner but we kind of cooperate together from time to time calls me up one day and says hes picked up a group and do i have any holes in the schedule so i look at the calander and i see a couple of gigs that are open and i say yeah what the hell send their agent over and maybe we can do a little business benny says they dont have an agent that this guy vlad handles all the details himself now if youve ever had to deal with one of these jokers you know why i wasnt exactly thrilled but the lead guitarist from this futuristic buckets of gor band has been hauled in for possession and i dont see anyone racing to make his bale so i tell benny ive got half an hour open at three in the afternoon no good murray he says the guys a late sleeper most guys in this business are i say but three in the afternoon is almost tomorrow hows about you two have dinner together maybe around seven or so says benny out of the question baby i answer i got a hot date and i just bought a new set of gold chains that figure to impress her right into the sack this vlad guy dont like to be kept waiting says benny well if he wants a booking he can damn well learn to wait okay okay let me check his schedule says benny he pauses for a minute so hows three oclock i thought you just said he couldnt make it at three i mean three oclock in the morning what is this guy an insomniac i ask but then i remember that powderblue mercedes sl with the sun roof that i saw the other day and i figure what the hell maybe this guys group can earn my down payment for me so i say that three in the am is okay and as it turns out i could have met him at seven after all because this broad throws a bowl of soup at me and walks out of the restaurant just because i try to play a little bit of itsybitsyspider on her thigh under the table so i go back to the office and lay down on the couch and take a nap and when i wake up theres this skinny guy dressed all in black sitting down on a chair and staring at me i figure hes strung out on something because his eyes have got like walltowall pupils and his skin is white as a sheet and i try to remember how much cash i have lying around the place but then he bows his head and speaks good evening mr barron he says i believe you were expecting me i was i say sitting up and trying to focus my eyes your associate said that i was to meet you here he continues i am vlad oh right i say as my head starts to clear i am pleased to make your acquaintence mr barron he says extending his hand call me murray i answer taking his hand which is cold as a dead fish and much the same texture well vlad i say dropping his hand as soon as i can and leaning back on the couch tell me a little something about you and your group where have you played mostly overseas he says and i realize that hes got an accent though i cant quite place it well nothing wrong with that i say some of our best groups started in liverpool one of em anyway i add with a chuckle he just stares at me without smiling which kind of puts me off since if theres one thing i cant stand its a guy with no sense of humor you will book my group then he says thats what im here for vlad bubby i say starting to relax as i get used to those eyes and that skin matter of fact theres an opening on a cruise ship going down to acapulco six days and out five bills a night and all the waitresses you can grab i smile again so hell know hes dealing with a man of the world and not just some little schmuck who doesnt understand whats going on he shakes his head nothing on water you get seasick i ask something like that well i say scratching my head and then making sure my hairpiece is still in place theres a wedding party thats looking for some entertainment at the reception what is their religion he asks it makes a difference i say i mean theyre looking for a rock group nobodys asking you to play have nagila no churches he says for a guy whos looking for work bubby you got a lot of conditions i say you want to work with me you got to meet me halfway we will work in any venue that is not a church or a boat he says we work only at night and we require total privacy during the day well at this point i figure im wasting my time and im about to show him the door and then he says the magic words if you will do as i ask we will pay you of our fee rather than your usual commission vlad sweetheart i say i have the feeling that this is the beginning of a long and beautiful relationship i walk to the wetbar behind my desk and pull out a bottle of bubbley shall we make it official i ask reaching for a couple of glasses i dont drink champagne he says i shrug okay name your poison bubby i dont drink poison either okay im game i say how about a bloody mary he licks his lips and his eyes seem to glow what goes into it youre kidding right i say i never kid vodka and tomato juice i dont drink vodka and i dont drink tomato juice well i figure we could spend all night playing guess what the fruitcake drinks so instead i pull out a contract out of my center drawer and ask tell him to hancock it vlad dracule i read as he scrawls his name dracule dracule thats got a familiar ring to it he looked sharply at me it does yeah i say im sure you are mistaken he says and i can see hes suddenly kind of tense didnt the pirates have a third baseman named dracule back in the s i ask i really couldnt say he answers when and where will we be performing ill get back to you on that i say where can i reach you i think it is better that i contact you he says fine i say give me a call tomorrow morning i am not available in the mornings okay then tomorrow afternoon i look into those strange dark eyes and finally i shrug all right heres my card i scribble my home number on it call me tomorrow night he picks up my card turns on his heel and walks out the door suddenly i remember that i dont know how big his group is and i race into the hall to ask him but when i get there hes already gone i look high and low for him but all i see if some black bird that seems to have flown into the building by mistake and finally i go back and spend the rest of the night on my couch thinking about dinner and wondering if my timing is just a little bit off well pride and prejudice the blackandwhite girls band that ends every concert with a fist fight gets picked up for pederasty and suddenly ive got a hole to fill at the palace so i figure what the hell is and i book vlad and the impalers there for friday night i stop by their dressing room about an hour before show time and theres skinny old vlad surrounded by three chicks in white nightgowns and hes giving each of them hickeys on their necks and i decide that if this is the kinkiest he gets hes a lot better than most of the rockers i deal with hows it going sweetheart i say and the chicks back away real fast you ready to knock em dead theyre no use to me if theyre dead he answers without cracking a smile so i decide hes got a sense of humor after all though a kind of dull deadpan one what can i do for you mr barron he goes on call me murray i correct him the pr guy wants to know where you played most recently chicago kansas city and denver i give him my most sophisticated chuckle you mean there are people between la and the big apple not as many as there were he says which i figure is his way of telling me that the band wasnt exactly doing sro well not to worry bubby i said youre gonna do just fine tonight someone knocks on the door and i open it and in comes a delivery boy carrying a long flat box what is that asks vlad as i tip the kid and send him on his way i figured you might need a little energy food before you get up on stage i answer so i ordered you a pizza pizza he says with a frown i have never had one before youre kidding right i say i told you once before i never jest he stares at the box what is in it just the usual i say what is the usual he asks suspiciously sausage cheese mushrooms olive onions anchovies that was very thoughtful of you murray but we dont i sniff the pizza and garlic i add he screams and covers his face with his hands take it away he shouts well i figure maybe hes allergic to garlic which is a goddamned shame because whats a pizza without a little garlic but i call the boy back and tell him to take the pizza back and see if he can get me a refund and once its out of the room vlad starts recovering his composure then a guy comes by and announces that theyre due on stage in minutes and i ask if hed like me to leave so they can get into their costumes costumes he asks blankly unless you plan to wear what you got on i say in point of fact that is precisely what we intend to do answers vlad vlad bubby sweetie i say youre not just singers youre entertainers you got to give em their moneys worth and that means giving em something to look at as well as something to listen to no one has ever objected to our clothing before he says well maybe not in chicago or kc but this is la baby they didnt object in saigon or beirut or chernobyl or kampala he says with a frown well you know these little midwestern cowtowns bubby i say with a contemptuous shrug youre in the major leagues now we will wear what we are wearing he says and something about his expression tells me i should just take my money and not make a federal case out of it so i go back to my office and call denise the chick who dumped the soup on me and tell her i forgive her and see if shes busy later that night but she has a headache and i can hear the headache moaning and whispering sweet nothings in her ear so i tell her what i really think of notalent broads who just want to get close to major theatrical booking agents and then i walk into the control booth and wait for my new act to appear onstage and after about ten minutes out comes vlad still dressed in black though hes added a cloak to his suit and the three impalers are in their white nightgowns and even from where im sitting i can see that theyve used too much lipstick and powder because their lips are a bright red and their faces are as white as their gowns vlad waits until the audience quiets down and then he starts singing and i practically go crazy because what hes doing is a rap song and worse still hes doing it in some foreign language so no one can understand the words but just about the time i think the audience will tear the place apart i realize that theyre sitting absolutely still and i decide that theyre either getting into it after all or else theyre so bored that they havent got the energy to riot and then the strangest thing happens from somewhere outside the building a dog starts howling and then another and a third and a cat screeches and pretty soon it sounds like a barnyard symphony and it keeps on like that for maybe half an hour every animal within ten miles or so baying the moon and then vlad stops and bows and suddenly the kids jump to their feet and begin screaming and whistling and applauding and i start thinking that maybe its liverpool all over again i go backstage to congratulate him and when i get there hes busy giving hickeys to a couple of girls who snuck past the security forces which isnt as bad as sharing a snort with them i suppose and then he turns to me we will expect our money before we leave he says out of the question snookie i say we wont have a count until the morning he frowns all right he says at last i will send an associate of mine to your office to collect our share whatever you say vlad bubby i tell him his name is renfield says vlad dont let his appearance startle you as if appearances could startle me after twenty years of booking rock acts fine i say ill expect him at say ten oclock that is acceptable says vlad oh one more thing yes i say that scarab ring you wear on the small finger of your left hand i hold it up yeah its a beaut isnt it i strongly advise you to takle it off and hide it in your desk before mr renfield makes his appearance a klepto huh i say something like that answers vlad well thanks for the tip sweetheart i say then a western union girl enters the room and unloads a bushel of telegrams on vlad what is this he asks it means youre a hit baby i said oh open em up and read em i encourage him he opens the first of them scans it and drops it like its a hot potato then he backs into a corner hissing like hes a tire losing air whats the problem i say picking up the telegram and reading it i love you and want to have your baby love and xxx kathy crosses he whispers crosses i repeat trying to figure out whats bugging him at the bottom he says pointing to the telegram with a trembling finger those are xs i say they stand for kisses youre sure he asks still huddled in the corner they look like crosses to me no i say pulling out a pen and scribbling on the telegram a cross looks like this he shrieks and curls into a fetal ball and i decide that maybe he snorts a little nose candy after all or that he just doesnt know how to handle success so i kiss each of the girls goodbye their cheeks are as cold as his hand and i make a note to complain about the heating system and then i go home counting all the millions were going to make in the next couple of years well renfield shows up the next morning right on schedule and i wonder what vlad was so concerned about because compared to most of the heavy metal types i deal with hes actually a mild unprepossessing little fellow we get to talking and i find out that his hobby is entomology and i can see that hes really into his subject because his homely little face lights up like a christmas tree whenever he discusses bugs and finally he takes the money and leaves right about then i am figuring that a mercedes is really too small and i am seriously considering getting a rolls royce silver spirit instead but the fact of the matter is that i never see vlad and the impalers again pride and prejudice makes bail and buckets of gor beats their rap on a technicality and suddenly the only thing ive got for my new superstar is a gig sponsered by a local church group and he turns it down and i call his hotel to explain and hes checked out with no forwarding address i check variety and billboard for the next year and i see that hes shown up in some minor league towns like soweto and lusaka and the last i hear of him hes heading off to kuwait city and i think of what a waste it is and how much money we could have made for each other but i never did understand rock stars and this guy was a little harder to understand than most of them well youll have to excuse me but i gotta be off now im auditioning a new group igor and the graverobbers and i dont want to be late the word i get is that theyre talented but kind of lifeless but what the hell you never know where lightning will strike next
