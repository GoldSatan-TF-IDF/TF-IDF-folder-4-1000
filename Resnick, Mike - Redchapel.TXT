redchapel by mike resnick an alternate history in which theodore roosevelt esq encounters the hideous fiend known only as jack the ripper from hell mr lusk sir i send you half the kidne i took from one woman prasarved it for you tother piece i fried and ate it was very nise i may send you the bloody knif that too it out if you only wate a whil longer signed catch me when yu can mishter lusk jack the ripper october i have not a particle of sympathy with the sentimentality as i deem it the mawkishness which overflows with foolish pity for the criminal and cares not at all for the victim of the criminal theodore roosevelt autobiography the date was september a hand reached out of the darkness and shook roosevelt by the shoulder he was on his feet in an instant his right hand shot out crunching against an unseen jaw and sending his assailant crashing against a wall he crouched low peering into the shadows trying to identify the man who was clambering slowly to his feet what the devil happened muttered the man my question precisely said roosevelt reaching for his pistol and training it on the intruder who are you and what are you doing in my room a beam of moonlight glanced off the barrel of the gun dont shoot mr roosevelt said the man holding up his hands its me john hughes roosevelt lit a lamp keeping the gun pointed at the small dapper man you havent told me what youre doing here besides losing a tooth said hughes bitterly as he spit a tooth into his hand amid a spray of blood i need your help what is this all about demanded roosevelt looking toward the door of his hotel room as if he expected one of hughes confederates to burst through the door at any moment dont you remember said hughes we spoke for more than an hour last night after you addressed the royal ornithological society what has this got to do with birds said roosevelt and youd better come up with a good answer im not a patient man when im rudely awakened in the middle of the night you dont remember said hughes accusingly remember what hughes pulled out a badge and handed it to the american i am a captain of the london metropolitan police after your speech we talked and you told me how you had singlehandedly captured three armed killers in your wild west roosevelt nodded i remember i was most favorably impressed said hughes i hope you didnt wake me just to tell me that no but it was the fact that you have personally dealt with a trio of brutal killers that made me think hope actually that you might be able to help me hughes paused awkwardly as the american continued to stare at him you did say that if i ever needed your assistance did i say to request it in the middle of the night growled roosevelt finally putting his pistol back on his bedtable try to calm yourself then ill explain this is as calm as i get under these circumstances roosevelt took off his nightshirt tossed it on the fourposter bed then walked to an ornate mahogany armoire pulled out a pair of pants and a neatlyfolded shirt and began getting dressed start explaining theres something i want you to see at this hour said roosevelt suspiciously where is it its not far said hughes perhaps a twentyminute carriage ride away what is it a body and it couldnt wait until daylight asked roosevelt hughes shook his head if we dont have her in the morgue by daylight there will be panic in the streets im certainly glad youre not given to exaggeration remarked roosevelt sardonically if anything replied the small englishman seriously that was an understatement all right tell me about it i would prefer that you saw it without any preconceptions except that it could cause a riot if seen in daylight i said a panic not a riot answered hughes still without smiling roosevelt buttoned his shirt and fiddled with his tie what time is it anyway am the suns not an early riser in london is it not at this time of year hughes shifted his weight awkwardly now whats the matter we have a crisis on our hands mr roosevelt i realize that i have no legal right to enlist your help but we are quite desperate enough hyperbole muttered roosevelt slipping on his coat you really hunted down those murderers in a blizzard said hughes suddenly the winter of the blue snow said roosevelt nodding his head briskly doubtless exaggerated by every dime novelist in america but you did bring them back alone and unarmed persisted the englishman as if roosevelts answer was the most important thing in his life yes but i knew the territory and i knew who and where the killers were i dont know london and i assume the identity of the killer youre after is unknown so to speak i dont understand said roosevelt adjusting his hat in front of a mirror we dont know who he is all we know is that he calls himself saucy jack the two men approached the police line behind the black swan the night fog had left the pavement damp and there was a strong smell of human waste permeating the area chimneys spewed thick smoke into the dawn sky and the sound of a horses hooves and a carts squeaking wheels could be heard in the distance sir asked one of the constables looking from hughes to roosevelt its all right jamison said hughes this is theodore roosevelt a colleague from america he is the man who brought billy the kid and jesse james to justice constable jamison stepped aside immediately staring at the young american in awe now why did you say that john asked roosevelt in low tones it will establish respect and obedience much faster than if i told him you were an expert on birds the american sighed i see your point he paused just what am i supposed to be looking at its back here said hughes leading him behind the building to an area that had been temporarily lit by flaming torches they stopped when they were about ten feet away there was a mound beneath a blooddrenched blanket steel yourself mr roosevelt said hughes after all the monographs ive written on taxidermy i dont imagine you can show me anything that can shock me answered roosevelt he was wrong the blanket was pulled back revealing what was left of a middleaged woman her throat had been slit so deeply that she was almost decapitated a bloody handkerchief around her neck seemed to be the only thing that stopped her head from rolling away her belly was carved open and her innards were pulled out and set on the ground just above her right shoulder various internal organs were mutilated others were simply missing what kind of creature could do something like this said roosevelt resisting the urge to retch i was hoping you might be able to tell us said hughes roosevelt tore his horrified gaze from the corpse and turned to hughes what makes you think ive ever encountered anything like this before i dont know of course said hughes but you have lived in americas untamed west you have traveled among the aboriginal savages you have rubbed shoulders with frontier cowboys and shootists americans are a simpler more brutal people barbaric in ways and i had hoped i take it youve never been to america no i havent then i shall ignore the insult and only point out that americans are the boldest bravest most innovative people on the face of the earth i assure you i meant no offense said hughes quickly its just that we are under enormous pressure to bring saucy jack to justice i had hoped that you might bring some fresh insight some different methodology im not a detective said roosevelt walking closer to the corpse there was never any question about the identities of the three killers i went after as for this murder theres not much i can tell you that you dont already know wont you try said hughes practically pleading roosevelt squatted down next to the body she was killed from behind of course she probably never knew the murderer was there until she felt her jugular and windpipe being severed why from behind if i were trying to kill her from in front id stab her in a straightforward way it would give her less time to raise her hand to deflect the blade but the throat was slit not punctured and it had to be the first wound because otherwise she would have screamed and someone would have heard her what makes you think someone didnt roosevelt pointed to the gaping hole in the womans abdomen he wouldnt have had the leisure to do that unless he was sure no one had seen or heard the murder the american stood up again but you know all that yes we do said hughes can you tell us anything we dont know probably not the only other obvious fact is that the killer had some knowledge of anatomy this hardly looks like the work of a doctor mr roosevelt said hughes i didnt say that it was but it was done by someone who knew where the various internal organs belonged or else hed never have been able to remove them in the dark take a look theres no subcutaneous fat on the ground and he didnt waste his time mutilating muscle tissue interesting said hughes now that is something we didnt know he smiled i think we should be very grateful that you are a taxidermist as well as an ornithologist he covered the corpse once more then summoned another constable have her taken to the morgue use the alleyways and discourage onlookers the constable saluted and gathered a team of policemen to move the body i assume were through here said roosevelt grateful that he no longer had to stare at the corpse yes thank you for coming roosevelt pulled his timepiece out of a vest pocket and opened it no sense going back to sleep why dont you come back to the savoy with me and ill buy breakfast ive quite lost my appetite but i will be happy to join you for a cup if tea and some conversation mr roosevelt call me theodore he shook his head poor woman i wonder who she was hughes pulled a notebook out of his pocket her name was annie chapman she was a whitechapel prostitute whitechapel whitechapel is the section of the city we are in roosevelt looked around truly seeing it for the first time as the sun began burning away the fog i hope new york never has a slum like this he said devoutly wait until new york has been around as long as london and it will have this and worse hughes assured him not if i have anything to say about it said roosevelt his jaw jutting out pugnaciously as he looked up and down the street hughes was surprised by the intensity of the young mans obvious belief in himself as they stared at the broken and boarded windows the drunks lying in doorways and on the street the mangy dogs and spavined cats and fat aggressive rats the endless piles of excrement from cart horses the englishman found himself wondering what kind of man who could view a womans mutilated corpse with less distaste than he displayed toward surroundings that hughes took for granted they climbed into hughes carriage and the driver set off for the savoy at a leisurely trot before long they were out of whitechapel and roosevelt noted the air instantly seemed to smell fresher roosevelt had eaten the last of his eggs and was concentrating on his coffee when an officer entered the dining room and approached hughes im sorry to interrupt sir he said apologetically but they said at the yard that this is of the utmost urgency he handed a small envelope to hughes who opened it and briefly looked at what it contained thank you said hughes will there be anything else sir asked the officer any reply no that will be all the officer saluted and when he left hughes turned back to roosevelt what are your plans now theodore i have two more speeches to give on ornithology answered roosevelt and one on naval warfare and then i board the boat for home on friday let me tell you something about the murder you saw today began hughes thank you for letting me finish my breakfast first said roosevelt wryly we have a madman loose in whitechapel theodore continued hughes that much is obvious we knew that before today said hughes roosevelt looked up this wasnt his first victim it was at least his second hughes paused its possible that hes killed as many as five women how can he still be at large we cant watch every whitechapel prostitute every minute of the day and night he only kills prostitutes thus far were they all this brutally mutilated the last one a girl named polly nichols was the first three suffered less grievous damage which is why we cannot be sure they were all killed by the same hand well youve got your work cut out for you said roosevelt i certainly dont envy you he paused have you any suspects so far hughes frowned not really what does that mean nothing roosevelt shrugged as you wish but the subject of saucy jack is closed either you confide in me or i cant help hughes looked around the halfempty dining room then lowered his voice all right he said in little more than a whisper but what i tell you must go no farther than this table it is for you and you alone roosevelt stared at him with open curiosity all right he said i can keep a secret as well as the next man i hope so you sound like youre about to name queen victoria this is not a joking matter whispered hughes angrily i am convinced that the man who has been implicated is innocent but if word were to get out roosevelt waited patiently there are rumors undoubtedly spread about by anarchists that are little short of sedition continued hughes scandalous behavior within ones own class is one thing but murders such as you witnessed this morning i simply cannot believe it he paused started to speak then stopped finally he looked around the room to make certain no one was listening i cant give you his name theodore without proof that would be tantamount to treason he lowered his voice even more he is a member of the royal family every familys got its black sheep said roosevelt with a shrug hughes stared at him aghast dont you understand what im telling you you think royalty cant go berserk just as easily as common men its unthinkable snapped hughes he quickly glanced around the room and lowered his voice again this is not rome and our royals are not caligula and nero he struggled to regain his composure you simply do not comprehend the gravity of what i am confiding in you if even a hint that we were investigating this slander were to get out the government would collapse overnight do you really think so asked roosevelt absolutely the small dapper policeman stared at roosevelt i would like to enlist your aid in uncovering the real murderer before these vile rumors reach a member of the force who cannot keep his mouth shut i dont believe you were listening to me said roosevelt my ship leaves on friday morning without you im afraid roosevelt frowned what are you talking about hughes handed the envelope hed been given across the table to roosevelt what is this demanded roosevelt reaching for his glasses a telegram from your president cleveland offering us your services in the hunt for the madman roosevelt read the telegram twice then crumpled it up in a powerful fist and hurled it to the floor grover cleveland doesnt give a tinkers damn about your murderer he exploded hughes looked nervously around the room and gestured the american to keep his voice down he just wants to keep me from campaigning for his republican opponent surely you will not disobey the request of your president i can if i choose to thundered roosevelt hes my president not my king a difference that i gather was lost on you when you manipulated him into sending this he glowered at the telegram that lay on the floor i knew he was worried about harrison but this is beyond the pale i apologize said hughes i wanted a fresh outlook so badly i seem to have overstepped my oh be quiet roosevelt interrupted him im staying but i thought you said americans rise to challenges ill rise to this one im just annoyed at the way you went about securing my services he frowned again ill show that corrupt fool in the white house ill solve your murder and get back to the states in time to help ben harrison defeat him in the election youll stay said hughes i cant tell you what this means and of course ill help you in any way i can you can start by checking me out of this palace and finding me a room in whitechapel in whitechapel repeated hughes with obvious distaste my dear theodore it simply isnt done well its about to get done said roosevelt i saw the way the onlookers stared at you as if you were the enemy or at least a foreign power if theyre going learn to trust me then ive got to live like they do i cant look for a killer until dinnertime then come back to the savoy don a tuxedo and mingle with the rich and the powerful until the next morning if you insist i do i just want time to send a wire to my wife edith explaining why i wont be on the ship when it docks we can send for her if american men do not put their wives in harms way said roosevelt severely no of course not said hughes getting hastily to his feet ill send my carriage by for you in an hour is there any other way i can assist you yes gather all the newspaper articles and anything else you have on these murders once ive got a room in whitechapel ill want all the material sent there you can have everything weve got on saucy jack some name snorted roosevelt contemptuously well he does seem to have acquired another one though its not clear yet whether he chose it himself or the press gave it to him oh jack the ripper much more fitting said roosevelt nodding his head vigorously my dearest edith im having mr carlson hand deliver this letter to you to explain why im not aboard the ship let me first assure you that im in perfect health my extended stay here is due to a pair of conscienceless culprits the president of the united states and someone known only as jack the ripper the latter has embarked on a rampage of murder that would shock even our own western shootists such as doc holliday and johnny ringo you do not need to know the details but believe me when i say that this fiend must be brought to justice an officer from scotland yard has read of my experiences in the dakota bad lands and asked grover cleveland to loan me to the british until these murders have been solved and cleveland pounced on such an excuse to remove me from the upcoming campaign with luck ill have things sorted out and solved in time to see ben harrison give his victory speech in a little less than two months my best to alice and little ted your theodore roosevelt sat on a rickety wooden chair his back to the window thumbing through hughes files it was clear that polly nichols was a ripper victim he doubted that the three who preceded her emma smith ada wilson and martha tabram were theyd been brutally murdered but the modus operandi differed appreciably from the two most recent killings the files were very circumspect about the royal who had come under suspicion but roosevelt deduced that it was prince eddy more formally albert victor son of the prince of wales and quite possibly the future king of england roosevelt put the papers down leaned back on his chair and closed his eyes it just didnt make any sense it would be as if grover cleveland had walked into a washington slum and killed a pair of women and no one had recognized him it was true that prince eddy was a dissolute and depraved man and roosevelt held him in total contempt but there was just no way he could walk fifty yards in any direction in or out of whitechapel without being recognized he removed his spectacles rubbed his eyes and then stood up it was time to stop hypothesizing and go out and meet the residents of the area he needed to talk to them get to know them and learn their opinions which he was sure would be worth more than the polices he walked over to a decrepit coat rack then paused and smiled he crossed the room to his steamer trunk opened it and a few moments later was dressed in the fringed buckskin he wore at his dakota ranch he took off his shining black shoes and pulled on a pair of wellworn boots then he tucked a knife and a pistol into his belt he considered a coonskin hat but decided to wear a stetson instead he looked at himself in the flyspecked mirror and grinned in approval as long as he was going to be identified as an american the moment he opened his mouth he might as well dress like one he walked out the door of his shabby building and was immediately aware that he had become an object of notoriety every pedestrian within sight stopped to stare at him even horsedrawn carriages slowed down as they passed by he grinned at them waved and began making his way to the black swan next to where annie chapmans body had been found a number of curious onlookers had followed him and most of them entered the tavern when he did he walked up to the bar staring approvingly at his image in the mirror that faced him i didnt know the circus had come to whitechapel laughed a burly man who was standing a few feet away roosevelt smiled and extended his hand theodore roosevelt pleased to meet you hey youre a yank said the man aint never met one before he paused and frowned dont rightly know if i like yanks them the duds you fight indians in guv asked another we dont fight indians any more answered roosevelt killed em all did you no now we live side by side with them i heard they was all killers said the burly man they go around cuttin peoples heads off most of them are pretty decent people said roosevelt seeing an opportunity to bring up the subject he wanted to discuss and even the bad ones couldnt hold a candle to your saucy jack old jack said the burly man with a shrug hes off the deep end he is mad as a hatter and ten times as vicious has anyone here seen him asked roosevelt the only people whats seen him is lying in the morgue chopped up in bits and pieces said a woman they say he eats their innards offered another looking scared as she downed her drink he only goes after women added the burly man men either fight too hard or dont taste so good maybe your women should go armed suggested roosevelt what good would it do responded a woman if youre with a john you dont need no weapon and if you find youre with old jack you aint got time to use it thats muddled thinking said roosevelt who are you to come in here and tell us how to think said the burly man pugnaciously im a friend who wants to help not if you dont live in whitechapel you aint said the man we aint got no friends except for them whats stuck here you didnt give me a chance to answer said roosevelt yes i live in whitechapel i aint never seen you around said a man from the back of the tavern me neither chimed in another i just arrived this aint a place where you arrive yank said the burly man its a place where you get dumped while the rest of london pisses on you bloody right said another of the women ill bet the coppers are probably cheering for old jack every time he strikes theres less of us for them to worry about if the police wont hunt him down well have to do it ourselves said roosevelt what do you mean ourselves said the burly man you aint one of us what do you care all rightthinking men should care responded roosevelt theres a crazed killer out there we have to protect society and bring him to the bar of justice what kind of man dresses like a dandy and wants to hunt down jack the ripper it just dont make no sense he glared at the american you sure you aint a writer for one of them magazines them penny dreadfuls here to make a hero out of old jack i told you i want to hunt him down and when he jumps you youll point out that its not fair to hit a man with spectacles guffawed the burly man roosevelt removed his glasses folded them carefully and set them down on the bar there are many things i dont need glasses for he said jutting out his chin youre one of them are you challenging me to a fight yank said the burly man surprised personally id much rather fight the ripper said roosevelt but its up to you the man suddenly laughed and threw a huge arm around roosevelts shoulders i like your nerve yank my names colin shrank and you and me are going to be great friends roosevelt grinned that suits me just fine let me buy you a drink a pint of ale shrank yelled to the bartender he turned back to roosevelt youre here too early yank old jack he only comes out at night but i see a number of ladies here and at least some of them must be prostitutes said roosevelt they aint hardly ladies said shrank with a laugh and theyre here because hes got em too scared to work at night which is the proper time for their particular business too bloody true chimed in one of the women you aint gettin me out after dark i dont even feel safe in the daylight said another did anyone here know polly nichols or annie chapman asked roosevelt i knew annie said the bartender came here near every night to find a new bloke nice lady she was why would she go off with the ripper asked roosevelt well she didnt know it was the ripper now did she answered the bartender roosevelt shook his head everyone in whitechapel knows that prostitutes are at risk so why would annie go out with someone she didnt know theres thousands of men come here every night answered one of the prostitutes maybe tens of thousands whatre the odds any one of them is jack the ripper it aint our fault said another were just out to make a living its the police and the press and all them others they dont care what happens here theyd burn whitechapel down and us with it if they thought they could get away with it a heavyset woman entered the tavern walked right up to the bar and thumped it with her fist yeah irma said the bartender whatll it be a pint she said in a deep voice hard night four of em she shook her head disgustedly youd think theyd learn they never do thats what theyve got you for said the bartender she grimaced and took her beer to a table what was that all about asked roosevelt irma shes a midwife answered shrank she delivered four babies last night shrank seemed amused she cut four of em out before they became a bother a midwife performs abortions said roosevelt surprised dont you have doctors for that look around you yank theres ten times as many rats as people down here a gents got to be as wellarmed as you if he dont want to get robbed women are being sliced to bits by a monster and no one does nothing about it so you tell me why would a doctor work here if he could work anywhere else no one cares about whitechapel said irma bitterly well theyd better start caring said roosevelt because if this butcher isnt caught youre going to be so awash in blood that you might as well call it redchapel redchapel repeated shrank i like that hell if we change the name maybe theyd finally pay attention to whats going on down here why do you think hes going to kill again asked the bartender if his motive is to kill prostitutes there are still hundreds of them left in whitechapel but everyone knows hes crazy said shrank so maybe he never had no motive at all all the more reason for him to strike again said roosevelt if he had no reason to start then he also has no reason to stop never thought of that admitted shrank he gave roosevelt a hearty slap on the back you got a head on your shoulders yank what do you do back in america a little of everything answered roosevelt ive been a politician a rancher a deputy marshall a naturalist an ornithologist a taxidermist and an author thats a hell of a list for such a young bloke well i have one other accomplishment that im glad you didnt make me show off said roosevelt what was that roosevelt picked his glasses up from the bar and flashed shrank another grin i was lightweight boxing champion of my class at harvard my dearest edith i must be a more formidable figure than i thought no sooner do i agree to help apprehend jack the ripper than he immediately goes into hiding i have spent the past two weeks walking every foot of the shabby slum known as whitechapel speaking to everyone i meet trying to get some information any information about this madman who is making headlines all over the world it hasnt been productive though in another way it has for it has shown me how not to govern a municipality and i suspect the day will come when that will prove very useful knowledge indeed i know america has its rich and its poor its leaders and its followers but any man can through his own sweat and skills climb to the top of whatever heap he covets i find englands class system stifling and i keep wondering where america would be if for example abraham lincoln had been forced to remain the penniless frontiersman he had been born we have negroes who were born into slavery who will someday hold positions of wealth and power and while slavery is a shameful blot on our history it was a system that men of good will and reason eventually destroyed i see no such men attempting to bring about the necessary changes in british society i walk through whitechapel and i can envision what a handful of americans with american knowhow and american values could do to it in five years time and yet i fear it is doomed to remain exactly what it is until the buildings finally collapse of their own decrepitude i have made some friends among the residents many of whom have been extremely hospitable to an alien one special friend is a day laborer named colin shrank who has been my guide down the fogshrouded streets and filthy alleys of whitechapel as i say weve discovered no useful information but at least i now feel i have a reasonably thorough working knowledge of the geography of the place a knowledge i will be only too happy to expunge the moment i return to our beloved sagamore hill my best to alice and little ted your theodore roosevelt opened a letter tossing the envelope carelessly on the bar of the black swan another note from your pal hughes asked shrank roosevelt nodded hes through asking who the ripper is now he just wants to know if hes through killing women shrank shrugged could be roosevelt shook his head i doubt it i think he takes too much joy in killing and disemboweling helpless women up against a man with a knife like that theyre all helpless offered shrank not so colin roosevelt looked around the tavern and his gaze came to rest on irma the burly midwife the women hes attacked have all been on the slender side if he went after someone like irma here he might have a real battle on his hands im no prostitute snapped irma indignantly i honor the bible and the commandments no offense intended said roosevelt quickly i was just suggesting that perhaps being a prostitute is not the rippers sole criterion that maybe he goes after women he knows he can dispatch quickly why quickly if hes having such a good time asked the bartender secrecy is his ally answered roosevelt he cant butcher them unless he kills them before they can scream that means they cant struggle for more than a second or two ever been anything like him in america asked shrank not to my knowledge certainly not in our cities where such crimes would not go unnoticed and unreported they gets noticed and reported all right said a woman just no one cares is all roosevelt looked out the window its starting to get dark he walked to the door come on colin its time to make our rounds you go alone tonight said shrank taking a drink of his ale arent you feeling well i feel fine but i been walking those damned bloody streets with you every night since he chopped annie chapman its been raining all day and the wind bites right through my clothes to my bones so im staying here if you spot him give a holler and ill join you stick around theodore added the bartender he aint out there hell hes probably got his throat sliced on the waterfront roosevelt shook his head if i can save a single life by patrolling the streets then i have no choice but to do it thats the coppers job insisted shrank its the job of every civicminded citizen who cares about the safety of whitechapel replied roosevelt that lets you out you aint no citizen enough talk said roosevelt standing at the door hands on hips youre sure you wont come with me i cant even keep up with you in good weather said shrank roosevelt shrugged well i cant stand here talking all night he turned and walked out into the fog for another fruitless night of hunting for the ripper roosevelt felt a blunt object poking his shoulder he sat up swinging wildly at his unseen assailant stop theodore cried a familiar voice its me john hughes roosevelt swung his feet to the floor youre lucky i didnt floor you again i learned my lesson the first time said hughes displaying a broom the handles two meters long all right im awake said roosevelt why are you here jack the ripper has struck again what yelled roosevelt leaping to his feet you heard me what time is it asked roosevelt as he threw his clothes on about in the morning its sunday right thats correct damn i only went to bed about half an hour ago where did it happen in a little court off berner street said hughes and this time he was interrupted by whom were not sure that doesnt make sense come with me and ill explain roosevelt finished dressing lets go there it is said hughes as he and roosevelt stared at the womans body the head lay in a pool of blood he cut her throat and slashed her face but theres no other damage hed pulled her dress up and was just about to cut her belly open when he was interrupted what makes you think he was interrupted asked roosevelt why couldnt he just have stopped for some other reason because those two gentlemen hughes pointed at a pair of locals who were speaking with two officers heard the scuffle and approached from different directions we dont know which one startled him for all we know he might have heard them both but he suddenly took flight they saw the body realized what had happened and gave chase for how long hughes shrugged three or four blocks before they knew for sure theyd lost him did they get a glimpse of him persisted roosevelt any kind of description at all hughes shook his head but one of them mr packer alerted us and the body was still warm and bleeding when we found it we couldnt have missed him by five minutes he paused weve got a hundred men scouring every street and alley in whitechapel with a little luck we may find him may i speak to the two witnesses asked roosevelt certainly hughes accompanied roosevelt as the american approached the men this is mr roosevelt he announced please answer his questions as freely as you would answer mine roosevelt walked up to the taller of the two men i only have a couple of questions for you the first is how old are you said the man surprised and how long have you lived in whitechapel all my life guv thank you thats all you want to know asked the man thats all said roosevelt he turned to the smaller man could you answer the same two questions please im aint never been nowhere else he paused well i took the missus to the zoo once thank you i have no further questions he shook the smaller mans hand then walked back to look at the corpse again have you identified her yet hughes nodded elizabeth stride long liz they called her a prostitute of course yes when was the last time anyone saw her alive she was seen at bricklayers tavern just before midnight answered hughes with a customer yes but shed already serviced him he has an alibi for the time of the murder which was when about minutes ago hughes looked off into the fog i wonder if hes still out there if he is im sure that he was interrupted by a womans scream where did that come from demanded hughes i dont know sir said one of the policemen either straight ahead or off to the left its difficult to tell he turned back to roosevelt what do you theodore but the american was already racing into the fog gun in hand follow him shouted hughes to his men but hes a hunter i trust his instincts they fell into stride behind roosevelt who ran through the darkness until he reached church passage he leaned forward in a gunfighters crouch and peered into the fog it came from somewhere near here he whispered as hughes finally caught up with him where does this thing lead he asked indicating the narrow passage to mitre street lets go said roosevelt moving forward silently he traversed the passage emerged on mitre street spotted a bulky object in an open yard and quickly ran over to it damn muttered hughes as he joined the american another one post a man to watch the body and make sure no one touches anything said roosevelt the ripper cant be more than a minute ahead of us he trotted off down mitre street the police began using their whistles to identify each other and soon the shrill noise became almost deafening roosevelt had gone a short distance when he heard a faint moaning coming from a recessed doorway he approached the source warily gun in hand who are you he demanded thank god its you sir said a familiar voice and as he moved closer he realized that it was irma the midwife he lit a match and saw a large bruise over her left temple what happened i was coming back from elsie baynes when i heard a woman scream then a bloke dressed all in black run down the street and bowled me over she was overcome by a sudden dizziness did you see his features he had crazy eyes said irma the kind what gives you nightmares what color were they i dont know she said helplessly its dark how tall was he taller than you sir she replied much taller and thin like a skeleton he was was there anything however small that you can remember demanded roosevelt think hard its important all i know is he wore black gloves no distinguishing marks just the wound wound said roosevelt pouncing on the word what wound on his cheek it was dripping blood it was which cheek i dont remember please try she frowned as if trying to recall then whimpered in pain i dont know sir she looked down the street where some bobbies were approaching them he done sliced another one didnt he sir the american nodded not far from here these poor women sobbed irma starting to cry when will it stop roosevelt stood up youre our only eyewitness he said the police artist may want to speak to you later but i done told you what i know other details may come back to you try to cooperate with him she nodded her head while rubbing her tears away with a filthy coat sleeve and roosevelt turned to the nearest officer when she feels strong enough take her to the nearest hospital he turned and walked rapidly back to the latest victim he really did a job on this one sir said one of the policemen staring down at the corpse the womans throat had been slit from ear to ear the ripper had then opened her up from neck to groin and gutted her like a fish each of her internal organs lay on the ground neatly arranged in a seemingly meaningless pattern a piece of her apron had been cut away the ripper had evidently use it to wipe his knife jesus said another officer staring in fascination i never saw anyone sliced up like this youre the taxidermist theodore said hughes joining them can you tell if anythings missing roosevelt studied the organs a kidney i think ill have the police surgeon make sure said hughes he paused if youre right then we have to ask the question as crazy as he is why would he steal her kidney id hate to know the answer to that one sir said one of the policemen does anyone know who she is asked roosevelt if shes got any identification on her its too bloodsoaked to read it replied hughes well ask around we should know by morning roosevelt walked away from the corpse then signaled hughes to join him what is it theodore i wanted to speak where we couldnt be overheard replied roosevelt im sure youll be happy to know that we can definitely eliminate prince eddy from the list of suspects i am of course said hughes but how do you know ive met him said roosevelt hes a weak man ravaged by disease he could barely grip my hand are you saying hes too weak to have killed these women asked hughes looking unconvinced anyone can kill an unsuspecting victim with a knife responded the american well then your two witnesses said roosevelt they were and years old in the prime of life they were healthy and neither was carrying any excess weight and they know their way around whitechapel roosevelt paused how could such an ill man especially one who doesnt know the area outrun them remember they said they chased him for three or four blocks the albert victor i met couldnt have run for one block let alone four thank you theodore said hughes obviously relieved youve lifted an enormous burden from me forget about him and concentrate on what we do know said the american for example we know that the ripper has an intimate knowledge of whitechapel or he couldnt have evaded his pursuers in fact he evaded pursuit twice in one night because we couldnt have been seconds behind him at the site of this murder and he vanished like an apache in the arizona hills he probably ducked into a building after he bumped into the midwife said hughes how would he know which ones were unlocked if he didnt know the area like the back of his hand whatever else he may or may not be the ripper is a resident of whitechapel blast muttered hughes that probably clears a second suspect as well oh a dr thomas neill cream but he wouldnt know whitechapel any better than prince eddy furthermore hes quite fat i doubt that he could have outrun anyone roosevelt stared off into the distance frowning is something wrong theodore of course somethings wrong said roosevelt irritably that madman has butchered two more women right under our noses he continued looking into the fog and frowning and im missing something what he frowned again i dont know but its something i should know something im sure ive overlooked can i be of any assistance asked hughes roosevelt remained motionless for another moment then shrugged and shook his head the morgue wagon arrived hughes began supervising the removal of the corpse and roosevelt went back to his room where he replayed the events of the evening over and over in his mind looking for the detail he had missed my dearest edith they identified the evenings second victim a poor prostitute named catherine eddowes i know i said i would be coming home shortly but i cannot leave while this fiend remains at large there is no question that he will strike again but when and where is almost impossible to predict there seems to be no pattern to his murders until after he has dispatched his victim and then the pattern is one that i shall not distress you by describing there was absolutely nothing i could do to prevent the four murders but i have the uneasy feeling that i have the ability right now to prevent any further killings if i could but see the tree rather than the forest i am certain i know something that might lead to his apprehension yet i have no idea what that knowledge may be ah well there is no need to worry you with my problems i shall be on the first ship home after this dreadful affair has been brought to a successful conclusion hopefully in time to make a speech or two on ben harrisons behalf and then perhaps well take alice and little ted on a vacation to yosemite or the yellowstone your theodore where were you last night demanded roosevelt when he entered the black swan on the morning of october right here answered colin shrank you think i sliced them two women i just want to know what time you went home said roosevelt two oclock or so the first of them wasnt killed until almost three well it werent me snapped shrank i didnt kill no bloody women i never said you did said roosevelt then why all the questions because the one night you didnt make the rounds with me the ripper claimed two more victims i think i should at least inquire after your whereabouts where was you shot back shrank i was in bed when elizabeth stride was murdered but i was in captain hughes company when catherine eddowes was killed replied roosevelt so are you saying i done it or not said shrank belligerently his hands balled into massive fists roosevelt stared long and hard at the man then sighed no im not good said shrank and just to show theres no hard feelings ill let you buy me a pint of ale roosevelt nodded to the bartender and ill take a cup of coffee aint got no coffee mr roosevelt said the bartender how about a cup of tea thatll do said roosevelt walking over to a table and sitting down now were friends again what made you decide i aint the ripper asked shrank your education what education laughed shrank i aint never been to school in my life that education said roosevelt if you killed someone could you find the spleen whats a spleen how about the pancreas never heard of them point to where you think my lungs are shrank pointed theres your answer said roosevelt the ripper knows where those organs are how do you know im not lying said shrank where would you have learned maybe i read it in a book can you read suddenly shrank laughed aloud not a word roosevelt smiled one more reason why youre not the ripper one more repeated shrank what was the first ive seen you get winded walking three blocks the ripper ran for at least half a mile last night and eluded some very fit pursuers then whyd you come in asking questions like that im just being thorough i thunk we was friends mates you might say said shrank we are but if you were the ripper that wouldnt stop me from putting you away at least you give a damn i cant say as much for the rest of em you mean the police responded roosevelt you misjudge them theyve got hundreds of men working on the case only because the press keeps goading em said shrank but they dont care about us or whitechapel theyll catch the ripper and then cross us off the map again what do you think would make them do something about whitechapel asked roosevelt itll sound balmy but as long as saucy jacks around they pay attention to us maybe having him aint such a bad thing after all shrank laughed bitterly he slices up another or women they might clean this place up and turn it into hyde park no said the bartender with a smile mayfair you really think so asked roosevelt nobody paid no attention to us before the ripper mr roosevelt and thats a fact said the bartender thats a very interesting outlook said roosevelt but ill keep trying to catch him anyway maybe old jack is really your pal hughes offered shrank yknow hes always the first one at the body roosevelt shook his head i was with him when the second woman was killed last night its a puzzle all right there are a lot of puzzles in this case said roosevelt you mean besides who is he said shrank yes said roosevelt he frowned again for example he thought why would he have walked off with catherine eddowes kidney it took days for roosevelt to get his answer then hughes summoned him and showed him a crudelyscrawled message that had been sent to george lusk the head of the whitechapel vigilance committee from hell mr lusk sir i send you half the kidne i took from one woman prasarved it for you tother piece i fried and ate it was very nise i may send you the bloody knif that too it out if you only wate a whil longer signed catch me when yu can mishter lusk jack the ripper october well at least now we know why the kidney was missing said hughes a look of disgust crossed his face do you really think he ate it roosevelt shrugged who knows hes certainly capable of eating it he stared at the letter does the handwriting match the previous messages hughes nodded its the same man all right roosevelt lowered his head in thought for a moment all right he said heres what you must do make copies of that letter and give it to every newspaper in london we cant do that theodore there would be widespread panic i hope so i beg your pardon said hughes heatedly try to understand john said roosevelt everyone in whitechapel has been aware of the ripper for more than a month prostitutes know that theyre his quarry and yet they continue to ply their trade and put themselves at risk maybe if they read this if they get a brief peek into the mind of this madman we can keep them off the streets until hes apprehended keep prostitutes off the streets laughed a nearby policeman you might as well try to keep the sun from rising its that or prepare yourselves for more murders its not my decision to make replied hughes youve been working on this case at my request and ive been your sole contact so you can be forgiven for thinking that im in charge but in point of fact we have more than police officers working around the clock on the ripper murders ill have to go through channels before we can get it published what if i just took it to the papers and said that i hadnt told you what id planned youd be on the first ship back to america and i doubt that your presence would ever be tolerated in england again thats no great loss in a land that worships royalty and allows something like whitechapel to exist thought roosevelt aloud he said all right john but hurry the sooner this is made known to the press the better hughes picked up the letter and stared at it ill do what i can he said so will we all replied roosevelt nothing happened a day passed then a week then three the police again began suggesting that the ripper might have been killed by some other member of the criminal class there were enough stabbings and bludgeonings in whitechapel and on the waterfront to write fini to a dozen rippers even roosevelt relaxed his guard he spent a day birding in the cotswolds he made a speech to the royal zoological society and another to parliament he found the time to write three articles and more than one hundred letters and still he couldnt rid himself of the nagging feeling that this was the calm before the storm and that he possessed some small but vital piece of the puzzle that could help him prevent another murder on the evening of november he sat down to write a letter to his wife my dearest edith it has been almost six weeks since the fiend last struck and most of the authorities here have convinced themselves that he is dead possibly by his own hand possibly murdered i dont agree there was no pattern of regularity to his prior killings the first and second were separated by nine days the second and third by days the third and fourth by no more than an hour since there has been no pattern i dont see how they can conclude that hes broken one as i mentioned in previous letters some of the police still lean toward prince albert victor which is simply beyond the realm of possibility all of their other suspects also seem to come from the upper classes a doctor a lawyer a shipbuilder they mean well the london metropolitan police but they simply lack american practicality as they go about this most important and onerous task i may not send this letter to you at all because i do not want the details to cause you dismay but i need to clarify my thinking by putting things down on paper i begin with the question what do we know about jack the ripper its true that there is an eyewitness account that makes him a head taller than myself and thoroughly emaciated but it was made by an hysterical woman whose veracity cannot be relied upon still its all the police have to go on and that is the man they are searching for but that is all we know empirically the rest comes from logic or the science of deduction to borrow from sherlock holmes the fictional detective who has made such an impact here in the past year and what can i deduce first he has at least a rudimentary knowledge of anatomy the nature of the mutilations implies that he takes pleasure in removing certain internal organs and he was able to tell a kidney from other organs in neartotal darkness on the night of september second he is trying to delude us into thinking he is illiterate that letter of his is a masterpiece of misdirection for if he is a doctor or if he has even studied medicine for a year how could his spelling diction and penmanship be so indicative of a barely literate man third he must possess an intimate knowledge of whitechapel the only time he was seen he eluded his pursuers and being unseen the other times also implies familiarity with his surroundings fourth these murders must be planned in advance a theory i have not shared with the police because none of them would accept such a notion but damn it he had to know when and where he would kill each of his victims because if he didnt then how did he get fresh clothing and without fresh clothing how did this man who must have been soaked in the blood of his victims escape detection as he walked through the streets of whitechapel on his way back to wherever he goes when his foul work is done he must have had a clean set of clothes hidden within yards of his victim and that implies premeditation fifth and this is the one that i cannot begin to answer even though they have been alerted even though they know the ripper is lurking in the darkness he is nonetheless able to approach his victims with complete impunity do they know him does he appear so wealthy that they feel it is worth the risk what leads otherwise cautious women to allow this fiend to approach them there has been no sign of a struggle at any of the murder scenes no victim has tried to run from him why roosevelt pulled out his timepiece and opened it it was am and he realized that he had fallen asleep he looked at the letter read it over frowned and began writing again why why why suddenly there was a pounding on his door theodore wake up shouted hughes hes struck again its the worst yet room dorset street was a scene straight out of hell marie jeanette kelly or what remained of her lay on a bloodsoaked bed her throat has been slashed her abdomen was sliced open both her breasts were cut off her liver and entrails had been ripped out and placed between her feet flesh from her thighs and her breasts had been put on a nearby table her right hand was stuck in her belly my god exclaimed hughes covering his mouth and nose with a handkerchief he was crazy to begin with but this is past all imagining said another officer he didnt cut her organs out like the others he reached in and pulled them out with his hands he had to be drenched in blood said roosevelt surely someone saw him if not here then walking the street or trying to hide until he could change into a clean outfit nobody saw a thing sir said the officer they had to exclaimed roosevelt they couldnt have missed him he frowned and muttered but why didnt it register roosevelt paused motionless and then slowly a grin crossed the americans face the officer stared at him as if he might soon start running amuck the american turned and walked to the door where are you going theodore asked hughes back to my room answered roosevelt theres nothing more to see here ill be seeing it in my nightmares for the next thirty years said hughes grimly roosevelt went to his desk opened a drawer pulled out his pistol filled it with cartridges and put it in the pocket of his buckskin coat then he took his pen out and added a few lines to the letter he had been writing to edith i curse my own blindness i could have prevented this latest atrocity i knew everything i had to know more than a month ago but i didnt put it together until tonight i am going out now to make sure this fiend never kills again roosevelt sat in the dark his pistol on his lap waiting finally the knob turned and a short burly figure entered the room hello jack said roosevelt pointing his pistol at the figure jack whos jack we both know what im talking about said roosevelt calmly i just come back from helping poor liza willoughby no said roosevelt shaking his head you just got back from murdering marie jeanette kelly youre daft and youre jack the ripper youve done lost your bloody mind yelled irma the midwife finally stepping out of the shadows the ripper had to live in whitechapel said roosevelt never lowering the pistol he had to know the area intimately who knows it better than a woman who lives and works here and makes dozens of house calls every week he watched her reaction then continued the ripper had to have some knowledge of anatomy not much but enough to know one organ from another your letter fooled me for awhile i thought it was the misdirection but i was wrong you need no formal schooling for your work he paused are you following me so far she glared at him silently there were two things that bothered me continued roosevelt why would these women let the ripper approach them when they knew he was killing prostitutes in whitechapel theyd been warned repeatedly to watch out for strange men but then i realized that youre a trusted even a necessary member of the community they were all looking for jack not jane the other thing i couldnt figure out he said was how the ripper could walk around in bloodspattered clothing without drawing everyones attention i made the false assumption that the killer had picked the spots for his murders and hidden fresh clothing nearby roosevelt grimaced i was wrong those murders were so deranged i should have known there couldnt be anything premeditated about them then when i was at marie kellys apartment tonight i saw how you ripped out her intestines with your hands and i knew how much blood you had to have splashed on yourself it occurred to me that ive never seen you when you werent wearing bloodstained clothes after all you do nothing all day but deliver babies and perform abortions theres nothing unusual about a midwifes clothing being bloody so maybe a midwife killed all them women yelled irma do you know how many midwives there are in whitechapel why pick on me thats whats been haunting me for six weeks answered roosevelt i knew everything i had to know right after you killed catherine eddowes and yet i couldnt piece it together until i realized that a midwife was the likely killer you made a major blunder and it took me until tonight to realize what it was what are you talking about demanded irma curiosity mingling with hatred on her chubby face you told me you heard a woman scream and then the ripper knocked you over while he was escaping from the scene of the crime he did said irma he come running out of the darkness and youre lying said roosevelt i should have known it immediately its gods own truth he shook his head i found you on the ground less than a minute after we heard catherine eddowes scream the ripper knocked you down just before i got there right yeah right roosevelt grinned in triumph thats what i missed it would have taken the ripper five minutes or more to disembowel poor catherine and arrange her innards on the ground the way he did surely she couldnt have screamed four minutes into that she was dead before he started the grin vanished that was you screaming what better way to escape from the scene of a murder than to have a solicitous policeman escort you to a hospital if there were any contradictions in your statements we would write it off to hysteria after all youd just come face to face with jack the ripper she glared at him balefully before we put an end to this perhaps youll tell me why you did it i told you before said the midwife i honor the commandments they broke em all they were all sinners and god told me to rid the world of em did god tell you to disembowel them too asked roosevelt or was that your own idea suddenly a butcher knife appeared in her hand she held it above her head screamed something unintelligible and leaped toward him roosevelt never flinched he kept the pistol trained on her and pulled the trigger she fell backward a new red blotch appearing on the front of her bloodstained dress she tried to get up and he fired once more this time she lay still my dearest edith please destroy this letter after you have read it i have faked the symptoms of the malaria i contracted some years ago on a trip to the everglades and have been relieved of my unofficial duties here i will be put aboard the next ship to america and within a very few days i will once again be able to hold you and the children in my arms and im pleased to see that harrison defeated that fool cleveland without my help my work here is done i would have preferred to arrest the fiend but i was given no choice in the matter jack the ripper is no more if i make that fact public two things will happen first i will probably be arrested for murder second whitechapel will remain a blight upon the face of england whereas a conversation i had a few days ago has convinced me that as long as the british authorities think the madman is still at large they might do something positive about eradicating whitechapels intolerable conditions if that is so then it may actually be serendipitous that only i know that the ripper is dead at least i hope that is the outcome one would like to think that if ones life didnt count for much at least ones death did and if whitechapel can either be cleansed or razed to the ground then perhaps just perhaps these five unfortunate women did not die totally in vain your theodore theodore roosevelt returned to london years later in on the way home from the yearlong safari that followed his presidency whitechapel remained unchanged
