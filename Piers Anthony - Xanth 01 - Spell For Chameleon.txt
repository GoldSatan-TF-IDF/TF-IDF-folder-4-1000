spell for chameleon by piers anthony chapter xanth a small lizard perched on a brown stone feeling threatened by the approach of human beings along the path it metamorphosed into a stingray beetle then into a stenchpuffer then into a fiery salamander bink smiled these conversions werent real it had assumed the forms of obnoxious little monsters but not their essence it could not sting stink or bum it was a chameleon using its magic to mimic creatures of genuine threat yet as it shifted into the form of a basilisk it glared at him with such ferocity that binks mirth abated if its malice could strike him he would be horribly dead then abruptly a silent moth hawk swooped down from the sky and caught the chameleon in its beak there was a thin scream of anguish as the lizard convulsed then it dangled limply as the hawk ascended the chameleon despite all its pretensions was dead even while trying to threaten bink it had been destroyed by another agency this retaliation continued to percolate through binks emotion the chameleon was harmless but most of untamed xanth was not was this some twisted omen a small suggestion of a dire fate awaiting him omens were serious business they always came true but usually were misinterpreted until too late was bink fated to die brutally or was some enemy of his he had so far as he knew no enemies the golden sun of xanth shone through the magic shield striking sparkles from the trees all plants had their enchantments but no spell could eliminate the need for light water and healthy soil instead magic was used to make these necessities of the vegetable kingdom more available and to protect the plants from destruction unless they were overpowered by stronger magic or simple bad luck like the chameleon bink looked at the girl beside him as she stepped through a slanting sunbeam he was no plant but he too had needs and oven the most casual inspection of her made him aware of this sabrina was absolutely beautiful and her beauty was completely natural other girls managed to enhance their appearance by cosmetics or padding or specialized spells but beside sabrina all other females looked somewhat artificial she was no enemy they came to lookout rock this was not a particularly lofty promontory but its situational magic made it seem more elevated than it was so that they could look down on a quarter slice of xanth this was a land of multicolored vegetation small pretty lakes and deceptively quiet fields of flowers ferns and crops even as bink watched one of the lakes expanded slightly making itself seem cooler and deeper a better place for a swim bink wondered briefly about this as he often did he had an unruly mind which constantly pestered him with questions for which there were no ready answers as a child he had driven parents and friends almost to distraction with his why is the sun yellow why do ogres crunch bones why cant sea monsters cast spells and similarly infantile prattle no wonder he had soon been hustled away to centaur school now he had learned to control his mouth but not his brain and so he let it run on in silence animate spells he could understand such as those of the unfortunate chameleon they facilitated comfort survival or image for living creatures but why should inanimate things have magic did a lake care who swam in it well maybe so a lake was an ecological unit and the community of living things within it might have a mutual interest in promoting it or a freshwater dragon might be responsible luring in prey dragons were the most varied and dangerous life forms of xanth species occupied air earth and water and a number breathed fire one thing they all had in common good appetite pure chance might not bring in enough fresh meat but what about lookout rock it was bare without even lichen and hardly beautiful why should it want company and if it did why not make itself more handsome instead of remaining gray and drab people did not come here to admire the rock but to admire the rest of xanth such a spell seemed selfdefeating then bink stubbed his toe on a sharp fragment of stone he was standing on a crackedrock terrace formed generations ago by the breaking up of a prettycolored boulder and there it was that other boulder which must have been close to lookout rock and of similar size had been fragmented to make this path and terrace losing its identity lookout rock had survived nobody would break it up because it would make an ugly path and its unselfish magic made it useful as it stood one minor mystery solved still there were philosophical considerations his insatiable mind insisted how could an inanimate thing think or have feelings what was survival to a rock a boulder was merely the fragment of a prior layer of rock why should it have a personal identity if the bedrock didnt still the same question could be asked of a man he had been formed from the tissues of the plants and animals he consumed yet he had a separate what did you wish to talk to me about bink sabrina inquired demurely as if she didnt know but as his mind formed the necessary words his mouth balked he knew what her answer had to be no one could remain in xanth after his twentyfifth birthday unless he demonstrated a magic talent binks own critical birthday was barely a month away he was no child now how could she marry a man who was so soon to be exiled why hadnt he thought of that before bringing her out here he could only embarrass himself now he had to say something to her or suffer further embarrassment making it awkward for her as well i just wanted to see your your see my what she inquired with an arch lift of eyebrow he felt the heat starting up his neck your holograph he blurted there was much more of her he longed to see and to touch but that could come only after marriage she was that sort of girl and it was part of her appeal the girls who had it didnt need to put it on casual display well not quite true he thought of aurora who certainly had it yet who bink there is a way sabrina said he glanced sidelong at her then quickly away confused she couldnt be suggesting the good magician humfrey she continued blithely what he had been on quite a different track no credit to his willful mind humfrey knows a hundred spells maybe one of themim sure he could find out what your talent is then everything would be all right oh but he charges a years service for a single spell bink protested i have only a month but that was not quite accurate if the magician identified a talent for bink then he would not be exiled and he would have a year available he was deeply touched by sabrinas faith in him she did not say what others said that he had no magic she did him the immense courtesy of choosing to believe that his magic merely remained undiscovered perhaps it was that faith that had first attracted him to her certainly she was beautiful and intelligent and talented a prize by any definition but she could have been much less in all categories and still been his a year is not so long sabrina murmured i would wait bink stared down at his hands pondering his right hand was normal but he had lost the middle finger of his left hand in a childhood accident it had not even been the result of inimical magic he had been playing with a cleaver holding down a stalk of coilgrass while he chopped pretending it was the tail of a dragon after all a boy could not start to practice too early for the serious side of life the grass had twitched out of grip as he swung and he had grabbed for it and the cleaver had come down hard on his extended finger it had hurt but the worst of it was that because he was not supposed to play with the cleaver he had not dared scream or tell of his injury he had controlled himself with extreme effort and suffered in silence he had buried the finger and managed to hide his mutilation by keeping his hand closed for several days when the truth finally came out it was too late for a restorative spell the finger was rotted and could not be reattached a strongenough spell could have attached itbut it would have remained a zombie finger he had not been punished his mother bianca believed he had learned his lessonand he had he had next time he played with a cleaver on the sly he would watch where his fingers were his father seemed privately pleased that bink had shown so much courage and tenacity in adversity even in his wrongdoing the lads got nerve roland had said now if only he had magic bink jerked his eyes away from the hand that had been fifteen years ago suddenly a year seemed short indeed one year of service in exchange for a lifetime with sabrina it was a bargain yet suppose he had no magic was he to pay a year of his life to verify the certainty of being thrust into the drear realm of the nulltalented or would it be better to accept exile preserving the useless hope that he did have a latent talent sabrina respecting his flurry of contemplation began her holograph a haze of blue appeared before her hanging over the slope it expanded thinning at the edges intensifying in the center until it was two feet in diameter it looked like thick smoke but did not dissipate or drift now she began to hum she had a good voicenot a great one but right for her magic at the sound the blue cloud quivered and solidified becoming roughly spherical then she changed her pitch and the outer rim turned yellow she opened her mouth singing the word girl and the colors assumed the shape of a young lass in a blue dress with yellow frills the figure was threedimensional visible from all sides with differing perspective it was a fine talent sabrina could sculpt anythingbut the images vanished the moment her concentration stopped and never had any physical substance so this was strictly speaking useless magic it did not improve her life in any material fashion yet how many talents really did help their people one person could make a leaf of a tree wither and die as he looked at it another could create the odor of sour milk another could make insane laughter bubble up from the ground these were all magic no question about itbut what use were they why should such people qualify as citizens of xanth while bink who was smart strong and handsome was disqualified yet that was the absolute rule no nonmagical person could remain beyond his quartercentury mark sabrina was right he had to identify his talent he had never been able to find it on his own so he should pay the good magicians price not only would this preserve him from exile which really might be a fate worse than death since what was the point in life without magicand win him sabrina a fate considerably better than death it would also redeem his battered selfrespect he had no choice oh sabrina exclaimed clapping her hands to her pert derriere the holograph dissolved the bluedressed girl distorting grotesquely before she vanished im on fire bink stepped toward her alarmed but even as he moved there was loud juvenile laughter sabrina whiffed furiously numbo you stop that she cried she was one of those girls who was as appealing in anger as in joy its not funny it was of course numbo who had given her a magical hotseat a fiery pain in the posterior talk about a useless talent bink his fists clenched so tightly that his thumb jammed into the stub of his missing finger strode toward the grinning youth standing behind lookout rock numbo was fifteen cocky and annoying he needed a lesson but binks foot struck a loose rock which turned his ankle long enough to cost him his balance it didnt hurt but it interrupted his forward progress his hand swung forward and his fingers touched an invisible wall there was another shout of laughter bink hadnt crashed headlong into the wall thanks to the providential stone under his foot but evidently someone thought he had you too chilk sabrina said that was chilks talent the wall it was a kind of complement to sabrinas talent instead of being visible without substance it had substance without visibility it was only six feet square and like so many talents it was strictly temporarybut it was hard as steel in the first few moments bink could dodge around it and run the kid downbut he was sure to get caught several times by that remanifesting wall and suffer more damage than be could do to the boy it wasnt worth it if only he had a talent of his own such as numbos hotseat he could make the joker sorry regardless of the wall but he didnt and chilk knew it everyone knew it that was binks big problem he was fair game for all the pranksters because he couldnt strike backnot magically and it was deemed crass to do it physically right now he was quite ready to be crass however lets get out of here bink sabrina said there was disgust in her voice nominally directed at the intruders but bink suspected part of it applied to him an impotent kind of rage began building upone he had felt many times before and had never gotten used to he had been balked from proposing to her by the lack of a talent and he could not stay here for the same reason not here at lookout rock or here in xanth because he didnt fit they walked back down the path the jokers getting no further rise from their prey went in search of other mischief the landscape no longer seemed so lovely maybe hed be better off away from here maybe he should take off now not waiting to be officially exiled if sabrina really loved him shed come with him even outside into mundania no he knew better than that sabrina loved himbut she loved xanth too she had such a sweet shape such kissable lips that she could find another man much more easily than she could adjust to the rigors of life among the nonmagical for that matter he could find another gift more easily than what he faced so probably objectively hed be better off going alone so why didnt his heart agree they passed the brown stone where the chameleon had perched and he shuddered why dont you ask justin sabrina suggested as they approached the village it was dusk closing in faster here than up at lookout rock the village lamps were coming on bink glanced across at the unique tree she indicated there were many kinds of trees in xanth a number of them vital to the economy beerbarrel trees were tapped for drink and oilbarrel trees for fuel and binks own footwear came from a mature shoe tree east of the village but justin tree was something special a species never sprouted from seed its leaves were shaped like flat hands and its trunk was the hue of tanned human flesh this was scarcely surprising since it had once been human in an instant that history flashed across binks mindpart of the dynamic folklore of xanth twenty years ago there had been one of the greatest of the evil magicians a young man named trent he had possessed the power of transformationthe ability to change any living thing into any other living thing instantly not satisfied with his status of magician granted in recognition of the awesome strength of his magic trent had sought to use his power to preempt the throne of xanth his procedure had been simple and most direct he transformed anyone who opposed him into something that could not oppose him the worst threats he converted to fish on dry land allowing them to flop until they died the mere nuisances he changed to animals or plants thus several intelligent animals owed their status to him though they were dragons twoheaded wolves and landoctopi they retained the intelligence and perspective of their human origins trent was gone nowbut his works remained for there was no other transformer to change them back holographs hotseats and invisible walls were qualifying talents but transformation was of a different order only once in a generation did such power manifest in an individual and it seldom manifested twice in the same form justin had been one of magician trents annoyancesno one remembered exactly what he had doneso justin was a tree no one had the ability to change him back into a man justins own talent had been voice projectionnot the parlor trick that was ventriloquism or the trivial talent of insane laughter but genuine comprehensible utterance at a distance without the use of vocal cords he retained this talent as a tree and as he had a great deal of time for thought villagers often came to this tree for advice often it was good advice justin was no genius but a tree had greater objectivity about human problems it occurred to bink that justin might actually be better off as a tree than he had been as a man he liked people but it was said that in his human form he had not been handsome as a tree he was quite stately and no threat to anyone they veered to approach justin suddenly a voice spoke directly in front of them do not approach friends ruffians are lurking bink and sabrina drew up short is that you justin she asked who is lurking but the tree could not hear as well as it could speak and did not answer wood did not seem to make the best ears bink angry took a step toward it justin is public scenery he muttered nobody has a right to please bink sabrina urged pulling back on arm we dont want any trouble no she never wanted any trouble he would not go so far as to call this a fault in her but at times it became annoyingly inconvenient bink himself never let trouble bar him from a matter of principle still sabrina was beautiful and he had caused her trouble enough already tonight he turned to accompany her away from the tree hey no fair a voice exclaimed theyre going away justin mustve tattled another cried then lets chop down justin bink halted again they wouldnt he said of course they wouldnt sabrina agreed justin is a village monument ignore them but the voice of the tree came again a bit misplaced in relation to bink and sabrina evidence of poor concentration friends please fetch the king quickly these ruffians have an axe or something and theyve been eating locoberries an axe sabrina exclaimed in sheer horror the king is out of town bink muttered anyway hes senile and he hasnt summoned more than a summer shower in years sabrina agreed kids didnt dare make so much mischief when he had his full magic we certainly didnt bink said remember the hurricane flanked by six tornadoes he summoned to put down the last wiggle spawning he was a real storm king then he there was the ringing sound of metal biting into wood a scream of sheer agony erupted from the air bink and sabrina jumped thats justin she said theyre doing it no time for the king anyway bink said he charged toward the tree bink you cant sabrina cried after him you dont have any magic so the truth came out in this moment of crisis she didnt really believe he had a talent ive got muscle though he yelled back you go for help justin screamed again as the blade struck a second time it was an eerie wooden noise there was laughterthe merry mirth of kids out on a lark having no care at all what consequences their actions might have loco this was mere insensitivity then bink was there andhe was alone just when he was in the mood for a good fight the malicious pranksters had scattered he could guess their identitiesbut he didnt have to jama zink and potipher justin tree said oooo my foot bink squatted to inspect the cut the white woodwound was clearly visible in contrast to the shoelike bark of the base of the tree trunk driblets of reddish sap were forming very much like blood not too serious for a tree this size but surely extremely uncomfortable ill get some compresses for that bink said theres some coral sponge in the forest near here yell if anyone bothers you while im gone i will justin said hurry then as an afterthought youre a great guy bink much better than some whouh than some who have magic bink finished for him thanks for trying to spare my feelings justin meant well but sometimes spoke before he thought it came from having a wooden brain it isnt fair that louts like jama are called citizens while you thanks bink said gruffly moving off he agreed completely but what was the use talking about it he watched out for anyone lurking in the bushes waiting to bother justin when the tree was unprotected but saw nobody they were really gone jama zink and potipher he thought darklythe village troublemakers jamas talent was the manifestation of a sword and that was what had chopped justins trunk anyone who could imagine that such vandalism was funny bink remembered one of his own bitter experiences with that bunch not so many years ago intoxicated by locoberries the three had lurked in ambush along one of the paths beyond the village just looking for mischief bink and a friend had walked into that trap and been backed up against the cloud of poison gas that was potiphers magic talent while zink made mirageholes near their feet and jama materialized flying swords for them to duck some sport binks friend had used his magic to escape animating a golem from a stick of wood that took his place the golem had resembled him exactly so that it fooled the pranksters bink had known the difference of course but he had covered for his friend unfortunately though the golem was immune to poison gas bink was not he had inhaled some of it and lost consciousness even as help arrived his friend had brought binks mother and father bink had found himself holding his breath again as the poison cloud enveloped him he saw his mother tugging at his fathers arm pointing binks way biancas talent was replay she could jump time back five seconds in a small area this was very limited but deviously powerful magic for it enabled her to correct a justmade mistake such as binks breath of poison gas then his breath had whooshed out again making biancas magic useless she could keep replaying the scene indefinitely but everything was replayed including his breath but roland looked piercinglyand bink had frozen rolands talent was the stun gaze one special glance and what he looked at was frozen in place alive but immobile until released in this manner bink had been prevented from breathing the gas a second time until his rigid body had been carried out as the stun abated he had found himself in his mothers arms oh my baby she cried cradling his head against her bosom did they hurt you bink came to an abrupt stop by the bed of sponge his face flushing even now with the keen embarrassment of the memory had she had to do that certainly she had saved him from an early deathbut he had been the laughingstock of the village for an interminable time thereafter everywhere he went kids exclaimed my baby in falsetto and sniggered he had his lifeat the expense of his pride yet he knew he could not blame his parents he had blamed jama and zink and potipher bink had no magic but perhaps for that reason he was the huskiest boy in the village he had had to fight as long as he could remember he was not especially well coordinated but he had a lot of raw power he had gone after jama privately and demonstrated convincingly that the fist was swifter than the magic sword then zink and finally potipher bink had hurled him into his own gas cloud forcing him to dissolve it very suddenly those three had not sniggered at bink thereafter in fact they tended to avoid himwhich was why they had scattered when he charged the tree together they could have overcome him but they had been well conditioned by those separate encounters bink smiled his embarrassment replaced by grim pleasure perhaps his manner of dealing with the situation had been immature but there had been a lot of satisfaction in it down underneath he knew it had been his irritation at his mother that motivated him displaced to people like jamabut he did not regret it he did love his mother after all but in the end his only chance to redeem himself had been to find his own magic talent a good strong one like that of his father roland so no one would dare to tease him or laugh at him or baby him ever again so that pure shame would not drive him from xanth and that had never happened he was known contemptuously as the spellless wonder he stooped to gather several good strong sponges these would abate justin trees discomfort for that was their magic they absorbed agony and spread a healing comfort a number of plants and animalshe was not quite sure in which category the sponges fithad similar properties the advantage of the sponges was that they were mobile plucking them would not kill them they were tough they had migrated from the water when the corals did and now thrived on land probably their magic healing properties had been developed to facilitate their lives in the new medium or maybe before the migration since coral was cutting stuff talents tended to run in schools with one overlapping another thus many variants of each type of magic showed up in the plant and animal kingdoms but among people magic varied extremely widely it seemed that individual personality had more to do with it than heredity though the strongest magic tended to turn up in particular family lines as if strength of magic was hereditary while type of magic was environmental yet there were other factors bink could fit a lot of reflection into a passing moment if reflection were magic hed be a magician but right now hed better concentrate on what he was doing or hed be in trouble dusk was intensifying dismal shapes were rising out of the forest hovering as if seeking prey eyeless and formless they nevertheless conducted themselves with a disquieting awareness orienting on bink or seeming to more magic was unexplained than was safely catalogued a willothewisp caught binks nervous eye he started to follow the halfglimpsed light then abruptly caught himself the lure of the wisp was sheer mischief it would lead him into the wilderness and lose him there prey to the hostile magic of the unknown one of binks childhood friends had followed the wisp and never returned warning enough night transformed xanth regions like this one that were innocent by day became horrors as the sun sneaked down specters and shades came out questing for their ghastly satisfactions and occasionally a zombie ripped free of its grave and marched clumsily about no sensible person slept outdoors and every house in the village had repulsion spells against the supernatural bink did not dare use the shortcut back to justin tree he would have to go the long way following the looping but magically protected trails this was not timidity but necessity he rannot from fear for there was no real danger on this charmed route and he knew the paths too well to stray accidentally from them but in order to reach justin more swiftly justins flesh was wood but it hurt every bit as much as normal flesh how anyone could be so crass as to chop at justin tree bink passed a field of sea oats hearing the pleasant swish and gurgle of their oceanic tides when harvested they made excellent foamy broth except that it tended to be rather salty the bowls could only be filled halfway otherwise the broths continuing sea waves slopped over he remembered the wild oats he had planted as an adolescent sea oats were restless but their cousins the wild oats were hyperactive they had fought him savagely their stems slashing across his wrists as he tried to harvest a ripe ear he had gotten it but had been uncomfortably scratched and abraded before getting clear of the patch he had planted those few wild seeds in a secret plot behind his house and watered them every day the natural way he had guarded the badtempered shoots from all harm his anticipation growing what an adventure for a teenaged male until his mother bianca had discovered the plot alas she had recognized the species instantly there had been a prompt family hassle how could you bianca demanded her face flaming but roland had labored to suppress his admiring smile sowing wild oats he murmured the lads growing up now roland you know that dear it isnt as if theres any real harm in it no harm she exclaimed indignantly it is a perfectly natural urge for a young man but her furious expression had halted binks father who feared nothing in xanth but was normally a peaceable man roland sighed and turned to bink i gather you do know what you were doing son bink felt excruciatingly defensive wellyes the nymph of the oats bink bianca snapped warningly he had never seen her so angry before roland held up his hands making peace dearwhy dont you let us work this out mantoman the boys got a right and so roland had betrayed his own bias when his mantoman chat was with bink it was with a boy without another word bianca had stalked out of the house roland turned to bink shaking his head in a gesture that was only nominally negative roland was a powerful handsome man and he had a special way with gestures genuine wild oats culled thrashing from the stem sown by the full moon watered with your own urine he inquired frankly and bink nodded his face at half heat so that when the plants mature and the oat nymph manifests she will be bound to you the fertilizer figure bink nodded grimly son believe me i comprehend the attraction i sowed wild oats myself when i was your age got me a nymph too with flowing green hair and a body like the great outdoorsbut i had forgotten about the special watering and so she escaped me i never saw anything so lovely in my lifeexcept your mother of course roland had sown wild oats bink had never imagined such a thing he remained silent afraid of what was coming i made the mistake of confessing about the oats to bianca roland continued i fear she became somewhat sensitized on the subject and you caught the brunt these things happen so his mother was jealous of something that had happened in his fathers life before he married her what a pitful of concepts bink had stumbled into unwittingly rolands face became serious to a young man inexperienced the notion of a lovely nude captive nymph may be phenomenally tempting he continued all the physical attributes of a real woman and none of the mental ones but son this is a juvenile dream like finding a candy tree the reality really would not be all you anticipated one quickly becomes surfeited tired of unlimited candy and so it also is withwith a mindless female body a man can not love a nymph she might as well be air his ardor rapidly turns to boredom and to disgust still bink dared not comment he would not have become bored he was sure roland understood him too well son what you need is a real live girl he concluded a figure with a personality who will talk back to you it is far more challenging to develop a relationship with a complete woman and often extremely frustrating he glanced meaningfully at the door through which bianca had departed but in the long run it is also far more rewarding what you sought in the wild oats was a shortcut but in life there are no shortcuts he smiled though if it had been up to me id have let you try the shortcut no harm in it no harm at all but your motherwell we have a conservative culture here and the ladies tend to be the most conservativeespecially the pretty ones its a small village smaller than it used to beso everybody knows his neighbors business so we are circumscribed know what i mean bink nodded uncertainly when his father laid down the law however circumspectly that was final no more oats your motherwell she was caught by surprise by your growing up the oats are outshes probably rooting them up right this instantbut you still have a lot of good experience ahead of you bianca might like to think of you as a little boy forever but even she cant balk nature not for more than five seconds so shell simply have to go along with it roland paused but bink was silent again unsure of what his father was leading up to theres a girl due to move here from one of the lesser villages roland continued theoretically this is for proper schooling since we have the best centaur schoolmaster in xanth but i suspect the underlying reason is that there simply arent many eligible boys in her village i understand she has not yet discovered her magic talent and shes about your age he paused to glance meaningfully at bink i think she could use a handsome healthy young man to show her around and warn her of local hazards i understand she is extremely smart and pretty and softspokena rare combination then bink began to understand a girla real girlfor him to get to know one who would not be prejudiced by his lack of magic and bianca would not be able to disapprove though privately she might dislike the fact of binks newly masculine drives his father had given him a viable option suddenly he realized he could do without wild oats her name is sabrina roland said a light ahead brought bink back to the present someone was standing by justin tree holding a magic lamp it is all right bink justins voice said in the air beside him sabrina brought help but it wasnt needed did you get the sponge i got it bink said so his little adventure had been no adventure at all just like his life as sabrina helped him pack the sponge around justins wound bink realized that he had decided he could not go on this way a nonentity he would go to see the good magician humfrey and learn what his own magic talent was he glanced up his eyes caught those of sabrina glowing by the light of the lamp she smiled she was even more lovely now than she had been when he first met her so many years ago when they had both been adolescents and she had always been true to him there was no question binks father had been correct about the advantages and frustrations of a real live girl now it was up to bink to do what he had to doto become a real live man chapter centaur bink set off on foot wearing a stuffed knapsack and bearing a good hunting knife and a homecut staff his mother had urged him to let them hire a guide for him but bink had had to refuse the guide would really be a guard to keep him safe how world he ever live that down yet the wilderness beyond the village had its hazards for the traveler unfamiliar with it few people hiked it alone he really would have been better off with a guide he could have had transport on a winged steed but that would have been expensive and risky in its own fashion griffins were often surly creatures he preferred to make his own way on the secure ground if only to prove that he could despite the fancied snickers of the village youths jama wasnt snickering much at the momenthe was laboring under the mortification spell the village elders had put on him for his attack on justin treebut there were other snickerers at least roland had understood one day youll discover that the opinions of worthless people are worthless he had murmured to bink you have to do it your own way i comprehend that and wish you wellon your own bink had a map and knew which path led to the castle of the good magician humfrey rather which path had led there the truth was that humfrey was a crotchety old man who preferred isolation in the wilderness periodically he moved his castle or changed the approaches to it by magical means so that one never could be sure of finding it regardless bink intended to track the magician to his lair the first leg of his journey was familiar he had spent his whole life in the north village and explored most of its surrounding bypaths hardly any dangerous flora or fauna remained in the immediate vicinity and those that were potential threats were well known he stopped to drink at a water hole near a huge needle cactus as he approached the plant quivered making ready to fire on him hold friend bink said commandingly i am of the north village the cactus restrained by the pacification formula withheld its deadly barrage the key word was friend the thing certainly was not a friend but it had to obey the geis laid on it no genuine stranger would know this so the cactus was an effective guard against intruders animals below a certain size it ignored since most creatures had to have water sooner or later this was a convenient compromise some areas had been ravaged occasionally by wild griffins and other large beasts but not the north village one experience with an irate needler more than sufficed as a lesson for the animal lucky enough to survive it another hours swift march brought him to lessfamiliar territory by definition less safe what did the people of this area use to guard their water holes unicorns trained to impale strangers well he would find out soon enough the rolling hills and small lakes gave way to rougher terrain and strange plants appeared some had tall antennas that swiveled to orient on him from a distance others emitted subtly attractive crooning noises but had branches bearing powerful pincers bink walked at a safe distance around them taking no unnecessary risks once he thought he spied an animal about the size of a man but it had eight spiderlike legs he moved on rapidly and silently he saw a number of birds but these were of little concern since they could fly they had little need for defensive magic against man so he had no cause to be wary of themunless he saw any big birds those might consider him prey once he spied the monstrous form of a roc in the distance and cowered down letting it wing on without seeing him so long as the birds were small he actually preferred their company for the insects and bugs were at times aggressive in fact a cloud of gnats formed around his head casting a mass sweat spell that made him even more uncomfortable insects had an uncanny ability to discern those with no magic for defense maybe they merely used trial and error getting away with whatever they could bink looked about for bugrepellent weeds but found none weeds were never where one wanted them his temper was getting short as the sweat streamed down his nose and into his eyes and mouth then two little suckersaps swooped in sucking up the gnats and he had relief yes he liked little birds he made about ten miles in three hours and was tiring he was in good condition generally but was not used to sustained marching with a heavy pack every so often he got a twinge from the ankle he had turned at lookout rock not a bad twinge for it turned out to be a minor hurt just enough to keep him cautious he sat on a hillock first making sure it contained no itch ants though it did have a needle cactus he approached this very cautiously uncertain as to whether it had been tamed by the spell friend he said and just to make sure he spilled a few drops of water from his canteen onto the soil for its roots to taste apparently it was all right it did not let fly at him even wild things often responded to common courtesy and respect he broke out the lunch lovingly packed by his mother he had food for two daysenough to get him to the magicians castle under ordinary circumstances not that things in xanth were usually ordinary he hoped to extend that by staying overnight with some friendly farmer he would need food for the return trip too and in any event did not relish the notion of sleeping outdoors night brought out special magic and it could be ugly he did not want to find himself arguing cases with a ghoul or ogre since the case would most likely be the proper disposition of his human bones whether they should be consumed live while the marrow was fresh and sweet or crunched after being allowed to age for a week after death different predators had different tastes he bit into the cressmato sandwich something crunched startling him but it was not a bone just a flavorstem bianca certainly knew how to make a sandwich roland always teased her about that claiming she had mastered the art under the tutelage of an old sandwitch yet it was unfunny to bink for it meant he was still dependent on heruntil he finished what she had prepared and foraged for himself a crumb dropped and vanished bink looked around and spied a chipmouse chewing busily it had conjured the crumb ten feet avoiding the risk of close approach bink smiled i wouldnt hurt you chip then he heard something the pounding of hooves some big animal was charging or a mounted man approached either could mean trouble bink stuffed a chunk of wingcow cheese into his mouth suffering a brief vision of the cow flying up to graze on the treetops after being relieved of her load of milk he closed up his pack and shrugged his arms into the straps he took his long staff in both hands he might have to fight or run the creature came into sight it was a centaur the body of a horse with the upper torso of a man he was naked in the manner of his kind with muscular flanks broad shoulders and an ornery visage bink held his staff before him ready for defense but not aggressively so he had little confidence in his ability to outfight the massive creature and no hope of outrunning him but maybe the centaur was not unfriendly despite appearances or did not know that bink had no magic the centaur pulled up close he held his bow ready an arrow nocked he looked formidable indeed bink had developed a lot of respect for centaurs in school this was obviously no elder sage however but a youthful brute you are trespassing the centaur said move off this range now wait bink said reasonably im a traveler following the established path its a public rightofway move off the centaur repeated his bow swinging around menacingly bink was normally a goodnatured fellow but he had a certain ornery streak that manifested in times of stress this journey was vitally important to him this was a public path and he had had his fill of deferring to magical menaces the centaur was a magical creature having no existence in the mundane world beyond xanth by all accounts thus binks aggravation against magic was stirred up again and he did something foolish go soak your tail he snapped the centaur blinked now he looked even huskier his shoulders broader his chest deeper and his equine body even more dynamic than before obviously he was not accustomed to such language at least not directed at him and the experience startled him in due course however he made the requisite mental and emotional adjustments signaled by an aweinspiring knotting of oversized muscles a deep red almost purple wash of color ascended from the hairy horse base up through the bare stomach and scarred chest accelerating and brightening as it funneled into the narrower neck and finally dying the head and ugly face explosively as that inexorable tide of red rage ignited his ears and penetrated to his brain the centaur acted his bow swung about the nocked arrow drawing back as it bore on bink the arrow let fly naturally bink wasnt there he had had ample opportunity to read the storm signals as the bow moved he ducked under then he straightened up right under the centaurs nose and brought his staff around in a hard swing it fetched the creature a smart rap on the shoulder doing no actual harm but it had to sting severely the centaur emitted a bellow of sheer impassioned rage he whipped his bow around with his left hand while his right hand dived for the quiver of arrows hanging on his equine shoulder but now binks staff was tangled in his bow the creature threw down the bow the action ripped the staff out of binks hands the centaur made a huge fist bink scurried around to the rear as that fist swung at him but the rear of the centaur was no safer than the front one leg licked back violently through a freak of timing it missed bink and clubbed into the trunk of the needle cactus the cactus responded with a barrage of flying needles even as the hoof struck bink threw himself flat on the ground the needles overshot him and plunked into the handsome posterior of the centaur once more bink had lucked out he was miraculously untouched by either hoof or needles the centaur neighed with truly amazing volume those needles hurt each one was two inches long and barbed and a hundred of them decorated the glistening surface tacking the tail to the donkey as it were had the creature been facing the cactus he could have been blinded or killed as the barbs punctured his face and neck he was lucky too though he hardly seemed to appreciate his fortune at the moment now there were no bounds to the centaurs anger an unholy contortion of utter rage ravaged his homely face he did a massive prance his hindquarters rising and descending in an arc bringing his front part abruptly adjacent to bink two crushingly powerful arms shot out and two horny hands closed about binks relatively puny neck slowly they tightened with viselike deliberation bink lifted off the ground so that his feet dangled was helpless he knew he was about to be strangled he could not even plead for mercy for his air and much of his blood were cut off chester a female voice cried the centaur stiffened this did bink no good chester you put that man down this instant the voice said peremptorily do you want an interspecies incident but cherie chester protested his color abating several shades hes an intruder and he asked for it hes on the kings path cherie said travelers are immune to molestation you know that now let him go the lady centaur hardly seemed to be in a position to enforce her demand but chester slowly bowed to her authority cant i just squeeze him a little he begged squeezing a little binks eyeballs almost popped out of their sockets if you do ill never run with you again down aaaww reluctantly chester eased off bink slid to the ground reeling what a fool he had been to tangle with this brute the female centaur caught him as he swayed poor thing she exclaimed cushioning his head against a plush pillow are you all right bink opened his mouth gagged and tried again it seemed that his crushed throat would never unkink yes he croaked who are you what happened to your hand did chester no bink said hastily he didnt bite off my finger thats a childhood injury see its long since healed over she inspected it carefully running her surprisingly delicate fingers over it yes i see still ii am bink of the north village he said he turned his head to face herand discovered the nature of the pillow he rested against oh no not again he thought will i always be babied by women centaur females were smaller than the males but still stood somewhat taller than human beings their humanoid portions were somewhat better endowed he jerked his head away from her bare front it was bad enough being babied by his mother let alone a lady centaur i am traveling south to see the magician humfrey cherie nodded she was a beautiful creature both as horse and as human with glossy flanks and a remarkable human forefigure her face was attractive only very slightly long of nose in the equine manner her brown human hair trailed all the way down to her saddle region balancing her similarly flowing tail and this ass waylaid you well bink looked at chester again noting the rippling muscle beneath the deadly glower what would happen when the filly departed it wasit was a misunderstanding ill bet cherie said but chester relaxed a trifle evidently he did not want to tangle with his girlfriend bink could readily appreciate why if cherie was not the loveliest and spunkiest centaur of the herd she was surely close to it ill just be moving on now bink said he could have done this at the outset allowing chester to run him off in a southerly direction he had been as much to blame for the altercation as the centaur sorry about the problem he held out his hand to chester chester showed his teeth which were more like horses teeth than human ones he made a big fist chester cherie snapped then as the centaur guiltily relaxed his fist what happened to your flank the males complexion darkened again but not precisely with rage this time he trotted his damaged posterior around to avoid the inquiring gaze of the female bink had almost forgotten about the needles they must still be hurtingand it would hurt more to yank them all out what a pain in the tail a most awkward locale to discuss in mixed company he almost felt sympathy for the surly creature chester suppressed his assorted reactions and with fine discipline took binks hand i hope everything comes out all right in the end bink said with a smile that became a bit broader than intended in fact he feared it resembled a smirk and abruptly he knew he shouldnt have chosen those particular words or that particular expression on this particular occasion something homicidal reddened the whites of the centaurs eyes quite all right he gritted through the grinding of clenched teeth his hand began to squeezebut his eyes were not yet so bloodshot as to miss the fillys glare the fingers relaxed unwillingly another close call bink could have had his fingerbones pulped in that grip ill give you a lift cherie decided chester put him on my back chester put his hands under binks elbows and hoisted him like a feather for a moment bink feared he would be thrown fifty feet but cheries fair eye was still on them and so he landed safely and gently on the ladys back is that your staff she inquired glancing at the tangled staff and bow and chester without even being directed lifted the staff and returned it to bink who tucked it slantwise between his back and his pack for easy transport put your arms around my waist so you wont fall off when i move cherie said good advice bink was inexperienced at riding and there was no saddle very few honest horses remained in xanth unicorns were very touchy about being mounted and the winged horses were almost impossible to catch or tame once when bink was a child a horsefly had been singed by a dragon losing its flight feathers and had had to prostitute itself so far as to give the villagers short rides in exchange for food and protection the moment it had recovered it had flown away that had been binks only prior riding experience he leaned forward the staff interfered preventing him from bending his back sufficiently he reached back to draw it outand it fell out of his hands to the ground there was a snort from chester that sounded suspiciously like humor but the centaur picked it up and returned it to him bink tucked it under his arm this time leaned forward again and hugged cheries slender waist heedless of chesters renewed glower some things were worth the risk such as getting out of here in a hurry you go to the vet and get those needles out of your cherie began speaking over her shoulder to the male right away chester interrupted he waited for her to start then turned and cantered off in the direction he had come from a little awkwardly probably each motion inflamed his hindquarters more cherie trotted down the path chester is really a good creature at heart she said apologetically but he does tend to be a bit arrogant and he gets his tail all knotted up when balked weve had some trouble with outlaws recently and human outlaws bink asked yes kids from the north doing mischief magic gassing our livestock shooting swords into trees making dangerous pits seem to appear under our feet that sort of thing so naturally chester assumed i know the culprits bink said i had a scrape with them myself theyve been grounded now if i had known they were coming down here there just doesnt seem to be much discipline on the range these days she said according to the covenant your king is supposed to keep order but recently our king is getting old bink explained hes losing his power and theres a lot of trouble cropping up he used to be a major magician a storm brewer we know she agreed when the fireflies infested our oatfields he generated a storm that rained five days and drowned them all of course it also ruined our crops but the flies were doing that already every day new fires at least we were able to replant without further molestation we are not forgetting the help he rendered so we dont want to make an issue of itbut i dont know how much longer stallions like chester are going to put up with these annoyances thats why i wanted to talk with youmaybe when you go home if you could call things to the attention of the king i dont think that would work im sure the king wants to keep order he just doesnt have the power any more then perhaps it is time for a new king hes getting senile that means he hasnt got the sense to step down and wont admit theres any problem yes but problems dont go away by being ignored she made a delicate feminine snort something has to be done maybe i can get some advice from magician humfrey bink said its a serious business deposing a king i dont think the elders would go for it he did do good work in his prime and theres really nobody to replace him you know that only a great magician can be king yes of course we centaurs are all scholars you know sorry i forgot our village school is run by a centaur i just wasnt thinking of that in the wilderness understandablethough id call this range not wilderness i specialize in humanoid history and chester studies horsepower applications others are legal scholars experts in natural sciences philosophers she broke off now hang on theres a trench up ahead ive got to hurdle bink had been relaxing but now he leaned forward again and clasped his hands tightly around her waist she had a sleek comfortable back but it was too easy to slide off however if she werent a centaur he would never have had the nerve to assume such a position cherie picked up speed galloping down the hill and the motion made him bounce alarmingly peering ahead under her arm he saw the trench trench it was a gorge some ten feet across rushing up at them now he was more than alarmed he was frightened his hands became sweaty and he began to slide off the side then she leaped with a single mighty spasm of her haunches and sailed up and across bink slipped further he had a glimpse of the stony bottom of the trench then they landed the jolt caused him to slide around even more his arms scrambled desperately for a more secure holdand wandered into distinctly awkward territory yet if he let go cherie caught him around the waist and set him on the ground easy she said we made it bink blushed iim sorry i started to fall and just grabbed i know i felt your weight shift as i leaped if you had done it on purpose id have dropped you into the trench and in that instant she looked uncomfortably like chester he believed her she could drop a man into a trench if she had reason to centaurs were tough creatures maybe id better walk now notheres another trench theyve been opening up recently well i could climb down one side and up the other carefully it would take longer but nothere are nickelpedes at the bottom bink quailed nickelpedes were like centipedes but about five times as large and considerably more deadly their myriad legs could cling to vertical rock faces and their pincers could gouge out disks of flesh an inch across they inhabited shadowed crevices not liking direct sunlight even dragons hesitated to walk through ditches known to be infested by nickelpedes and for good reason the cracks have been opening up recently cherie continued as she kneeled to permit bink to mount her again he picked up his dropped staff and used it to help him climb im afraid theres big magic brewing somewhere spreading throughout xanth causing discord in animal vegetable and mineral ill get you across that next trench then its beyond centaur territory it hadnt occurred to him that there would be such barriers they didnt show on his map the trail was supposed to be clear and reasonably safe throughout but the map had been made years ago and these cracks in the ground were new cherie said nothing in xanth was permanent and travel was always somewhat risky he was lucky he had obtained the lady centaurs help the landscape changed as if the trench separated one type of place from another before it had been rolling hills and fields now it was forest the path became narrower crowded by huge mockpine trees and the forest floor was a redbrown carpet of mock needles here and there were patches of light green ferns which seemed to thrive where weeds could not and regions of dark green moss a cold wind gusted through tousling cheries hair and mane carrying strands back against bink it was quiet here and there was a pleasant piney smell he felt like dismounting and lying down in a bed of moss just appreciating this peaceful spot dont do it cherie warned bink jumped i didnt know centaurs practiced magic magic she inquired and he knew she was frowning you read my mind she laughed hardly we do no magic but we do know the effect these woods have on humans its the peace spell the trees make to protect themselves from getting chopped nothing wrong in that bink said i wasnt going to chop them anyway they dont trust in your good intentions ill show you she stepped carefully off the beaten trail her hooves sinking into the soft pineneedle floor she threaded her way between several daggerspoked buckspruce trees passed a thin snake palm which didnt even bother to hiss at her and stopped near a tangle willow not too near everyone knew better than that there she murmured bink looked where her hand pointed a human skeleton lay on the ground murder he asked shivering no just sleep he came to rest here as you wished to do just now and never got up the gumption to depart complete peace is an insidious thing yes he breathed no violence no distressjust loss of initiative why bother to work and eat when it was so much easier merely to relax if a person wanted to commit suicide this would be the ideal manner but he had reason to live so far thats part of why i like chester cherie said hell never succumb to anything like this that was a certainty there was no peace in chester cherie herself would never succumb bink thought though she was considerably more gentle bink felt the lassitude despite the sight of the skeleton but she was evidently able to resist the spell maybe the biology of the centaurs differed enough or maybe she had savagery in her soul that her angelic form and pleasant words masked most likely a bit of both lets get out of here she laughed dont worry ill see you safely through it but dont come back this way alone travel with an enemy if you can find one thats best better than a friend friends are peaceful she explained oh that did make sense hed never relax under a pine tree if he were with someone like jama hed be too afraid of getting a sword in his gut but what an ironic necessity to locate an enemy to accompany one to walk through a peaceful forest magic makes strange companions he murmured this peace spell also explained why there was so little other magic here the plants did not need individual defensive spells no one was going to attack even the tangle tree had seemed quiescent though he was sure it would make a grab when it had the chance since that was the way it fed interesting how quickly magic faded when the immediate imperative of survival abated no there was magic strong magic it was the communal magic of the entire forest with each plant contributing its modicum if a person could figure out a way to nullify the effect in himself perhaps with a countercharm he could live here in absolute safety that was worth remembering they threaded their way back to the path and resumed travel bink almost slid off his perch twice falling asleep each time awakening with a shock he would never have made it out of here alone he was glad to see the pine forest thin shifting into hardwoods he felt more alert more violent and that was good harder wood harder feelings i wonder who that was back there bink mused oh i know cherie answered he was one of the last wave who got lost wandered in here and decided to rest forever but the lastwavers were savage bink said they slaughtered indiscriminately all waves were savage when they came with one exception she said we centaurs know we were here before the first wave we had to fight all of you until the covenant you didnt have magic but you had weapons and numbers and vicious cunning many of us died my ancestors were first wave bink said with a certain pride we always had magic and we never fought the centaurs now dont get aggressive human just because i took you out of the peace pines she cautioned you do not have our knowledge of history bink realized that hed better moderate his tone if he wanted to continue the ride and he did want to continue cherie was pleasant company and she obviously knew all the local magic so that she was able to avoid all threats last and most she was giving his tired legs a good rest while bearing him forward rapidly already she had taken him a good ten miles im sorry it was a matter of family pride well thats no bad thing she said mollified she made her way delicately across a wooden trestle over a bubbling brook suddenly bink was thirsty may we stop for a drink he asked she snorted again a very horselike sound not here anyone who drinks from that water becomes a fish a fish suddenly bink was twice as glad to have this guide he surely would have drunk otherwise unless she was merely telling him that to tease him or trying to scare him away from this area why the river is trying to restock itself it was cleaned out by the evil magician trent twentyone years ago bink remained a bit skeptical about inanimate magic especially of that potency how could a river desire anything still he remembered how lookout rock had saved itself from being broken up better to play it safe and assume that some features of the landscape could cast spells meanwhile the reference to trent preempted his attention the evil magician was here i thought he was a phenomenon of our own village trent was everywhere she said he wanted us centaurs to support him and when we balkedbecause of the covenant you know not to interfere in human businesshe showed us his power by changing every fish in this river into a lightning bug then he departed i think he figured that those shocking buggers would force us to change our minds why didnt he change the fish into a human army and try to conquer you that way no good bink they might have had the bodies of men but their minds would have remained fish they would have made very wishywashy soldiers and even if they had been good soldiers they would hardly have served the man who had put them under that enchantment they would have attacked trent um yes i wasnt thinking so he transformed them into lightning bugs and got well away from there so they couldnt shock him so they went for the next best thing yes it was a bad time for us oh those bugs were a pain they pestered us in clouds scorching us with their little lightning bolts ive still got scars on my she paused grimacing on my tail it was obviously a euphemism what did you do bink inquired fascinated glancing back to see whether he could locate the scars what he could see seemed flawless trent was exiled soon after that and we got humfrey to abate the spell but the good magician isnt a transformer no but he told us where to find repellent magic to drive off the flies denied our electrocooked flesh the scourge soon died out good information is as good as good action and the good magician certainly had the information thats why im going to him bink agreed but he charges a years service for a spell youre telling us three hundred head of centaur one year each what a job all of you had to pay what did you have to do we are not permitted to tell she said diffidently now bink was doubly curious but he knew better than to ask again a centaurs given word was inviolate but what could humfrey have needed done that he could not do himself via one of his hundred spells or at least by means of his good information humfrey was basically a divinator anything he didnt know he could find out and that gave him enormous power probably the reason the village elders had not asked the good magician what to do about their senile king was that they knew what he would answer depose the king and install a new young fresh magician instead that they obviously werent ready to do even if they could find such a young magician to serve well there were many mysteries and many problems in xanth and it was hardly given to bink to know of them all or to solve any he had learned long ago to bow however ungraciously to the inevitable they were past the river now and climbing the trees were closing in more thickly their great round roots ridging across the path no hostile magic threatened either the centaurs had cleaned out the area the way the villagers had cleaned out binks home region or cherie knew this path so well that she avoided spells automatically without seeming to probably some of both life itself he thought involved many alternate explanations for perplexing questions and was generally some of both few things were hard and fast in xanth what was that history you know that i dont bink inquired becoming bored by the trail about the waves of human colonization we have records of them all since the shield and the covenant things have quieted down the waves were terrors not the firstwavers bink said loyally we were peaceful thats what i mean you are peaceful now except for a few of your young hoodlums so you assume your ancestors were peaceful then but my ancestors found it otherwise they would have been happier had man never discovered xanth my teacher was a centaur bink said he never said anything about hed have been fired if he had told you the truth bink felt uneasy youre not teasing me are you im not looking for any trouble i have a very curious mind but ive already had more trouble than i care for she turned her head around to fix him with a gentle stare her torso twisted from the human waist to facilitate the motion the torque was impressive her midsection was more limber than that of a human girl perhaps because it was harder for a centaur to turn her whole body around but if she had a human lower section to match the upper section what a creature she would be your teacher didnt lie to you a centaur never lies he merely edited his information on orders from the king so as not to force on the impressionable minds of children things their parents did not want them to hear education has ever been thus oh i wasnt implying any slight on his integrity bink said quickly i liked him as a matter of fact he was the only one who didnt get fed up with all my questions i learned a lot from him but i guess i didnt ask about history much i was more preoccupied with something he couldnt tell mebut at least he did tell me about the magician humfrey what is your question for humfrey if i may ask what difference did it make i have no magic he confessed at least i seem to have none all through my childhood i was at a disadvantage because i couldnt use magic to compete i could run faster than anybody else but the kid who could levitate still won the race stuff like that centaurs get along perfectly well without magic she pointed out we wouldnt take magic if it were offered bink did not believe that but did not make an issue of it humans have a different attitude i guess when i got older it got worse now i will be exiled if i dont show some magic talent im hoping magician humfrey canwell if i do have magic it means i can stay and marry my girl and have some pride finally cherie nodded i suspected it was something like that i suppose if i were in your situation i could choke down the necessity of having magic though i really think your cultures values are distorted you should base your citizenship on superior qualities of personality and achievement not on exactly bink agreed fervently she smiled you really should have been a centaur she shook her head so that her hair flung out prettily you have undertaken a hazardous journey not more hazardous than the one to the mundane world that will otherwise be forced on me she nodded again very well you have satisfied my curiosity ill satisfy yours ill tell you the whole truth about the human intrusion into xanth but i dont expect you to like it much i dont expect to like the truth about myself much bink said ruefully i might as well know whatever there is to know for thousands of years xanth was a comparatively peaceful land she said assuming the somewhat pedantic tone he remembered from his school days probably every centaur was at heart a teacher there was magic very strong magic but no unnecessary viciousness we centaurs were the dominant species but as you know we have absolutely no magic we are magic i suppose we migrated here from mundania originallybut that was so long ago it is lost even to our records something tripped over in binks mind i wonder if that really is trueabout magic creatures not being able to work spells i saw a chipmouse conjure a crumb of bread oh are you sure it wasnt a chipmunk that is a natural creature according to our taxonomy so it might work magic you tax animals bink asked amazed taxonomy she repeated with an indulgent smile the classification of living things another centaur specialty oh bink considered embarrassed i thought it was a chipmouse but im not quite certain now actually were not quite certain either she admitted it may be that some magical creatures can work magic but as a general rule a creature either does magic or is magic not both which is just as wellthink of the havoc a dragon magician could make bink thought of it he shuddered lets get back to the history lesson he suggested about a thousand years ago the first human tribe discovered xanth they thought it was just another peninsula they moved in and cut down the trees and slaughtered the animals there was more than enough magic here to repulse them but xanth had never been subjected to such callous systematic ravage before and we did not quite believe it we thought the humans would leave soon but then they realized that xanth was magic they saw the animals levitating and the trees moving their branches they hunted the unicorns and griffins if you wonder why those big animals hate people let me assure you they have good reason their ancestors would not have survived if theyd tried to be friendly the firstwavers were nonmagical creatures in a land of spells and after they got over the initial shock they liked it now thats wrong bink exclaimed humans have the very strongest magic look at all the great magicians you yourself told me just now how evil magician trent changed all the fish pipe down before i buck you off cherie snapped her tail swished menacingly past binks ear you dont know the quarter of it of course humans have magic now thats part of their problem but not at the start bink backed down again it was increasingly easy to do he liked this centaur lady very well she was answering questions he hadnt even thought to ask yet sorry this is new to me you remind me of chester ill bet youre awful stubborn too yes bink said contritely she laughed and it sounded a bit like neighing i do like you human i hope you find your she pursed her lips distastefullymagic then she flashed a sunny smile and as quickly sobered those firstwavers had no magic and when they found out what magic could do they were fascinated but a bit afraid of it a number of them perished in a lake that had a drown spell and some ran afoul of dragons and when they met the first basilisk are there still basilisks bink inquired worriedly abruptly remembering the omen of the chameleon it had stared at him in the guise of a basilisk just before it died as if its spell had backfired he had yet to be sure of the meaning of that sequence yes there are but not many she answered both humans and centaurs labored to stamp them out their glance is fatal to us too you know now they hide because they know that the first intelligent creature killed that way will bring an avenging army of mirrormasked warriors down on them a basilisk is no match for a forewarned man or centaur its just a small winged lizard you know with the head and claws of a chicken not very intelligent not that it usually needs to be say bink exclaimed maybe thats the missing factorintelligence a creature can do magic or be magic or be smart or any two of the three but never all three so a chipmouse might conjure but not a smart dragon she turned her head about again to face him thats a novel idea youre pretty smart yourself ill have to think about it but until we verify it dont go into the central wilderness unprotected there just might be a smart spellthrowing monster in there i wont go into the wilderness bink promised at least i wont stray from the cleared path through it until i get to the magicians castle i dont want any lizards looking death at me your ancestors were more aggressive cherie remarked thats why so many of them died but they conquered xanth and formed an enclave where magic was banned they liked the country and the uses of magic you see but they didnt want it too close to home so they burned the forest there killed all magical animals and plants and built a great stone wall the ruins bink exclaimed i thought those old stones were from an enemy camp they are from the first wave she insisted but i am descended from i said you wouldnt like this i dont he agreed but i want to hear it how can my ancestors have they settled in their walled village and planted mundane crops and herded mundane cattle you knowbeans and wingless cows they married the women they had brought along or that they could raid from the closest mundane settlements and had children xanth was a good land even in that region expunged of magic but then something amazing happened cherie turned to face him again glancing obliquely in a manner that would have been most fetching in a human girl in fact it was fetching in a centaur girl especially if he squinted so as to see only her human portion splendidly fetching despite his knowledge that centaurs lived longer than humans so that she was probably fifty years old she looked twentya twenty that few humans ever achieved no halter would hold this filly what happened he asked catering to her evident desire for an intellectual response centaurs were good storytellers and they did like a good audience their children came up magic she said aha so the firstwavers were magic no they were not the land of xanth is magic its an environmental effect but it works much better with children who are more formative and it works best with babies conceived and birthed here adults even of long residence tend to suppress the talents they have because they know better but children accept what is so not only do they have more natural talent they use it with more enthusiasm i never knew that he said my folks have much more magic than i do some of my ancestors were magicians but me he sobered im afraid i was a terrible disappointment to my parents by rights i should have had very strong magic maybe even have been a magician myself instead cherie discreetly did not comment at first the humans were shocked but soon they accepted it and even encouraged the development of special talents one of the youngsters had the ability to transform lead into gold they ravaged the hills searching for lead and finally had to send a mission to obtain it from mundania it was almost as if lead had become more valuable than gold but xanth has no dealings with the mundane world you keep forgetting this is ancient history sorry again i wouldnt interrupt so much if i werent so interested you are an excellent audience she said and he felt pleased most humans would refuse to listen at all because it is not a complimentary history not to your kind id probably be less openminded if i didnt face exile myself he admitted about all i have to work with is my brain and body so id better not fool myself a commendable philosophy you are incidentally getting a longer ride than i planned because you pay such good responsive attention at any rate they got the lead outbut paid a hideous price because the mundanes of mundania learned about the magic they were true to their type greedy and rapacious the notion of cheap gold sent them into a frenzy they invaded stormed the wall and killed all the first wave men and children but bink protested horrified these were the secondwavers cherie said gently they saved the firstwaver women you see because the second wave was an allmale army they thought there was a machine to convert the lead into gold or an alchemical process organized by a secret formula they didnt really believe in magic that was just a convenient term to describe the unknown so they didnt realize that the lead was converted into gold by the magic of a childuntil too late they had destroyed what they had come for horrible bink said you mean i am descended from from the rape of a first wave mother yes there is no other way you can authenticate your lineage we centaurs had never liked the firstwavers but we were sorry for them then the secondwavers were worse they were literal pirates rapacious had we known we would have helped the firstwavers fight them off our archers could have ambushed them she shrugged centaur archery was legendary no need to belabor the point now the invaders settled she continued after a pause they sent their own archers all over xanth killing she broke off and bink knew how keenly she felt the irony of her kind being prey to the inferior archery of human beings she gave a little shudder that almost dislodged him and forced herself to continue killing centaurs for meat not until we organized and ambushed their camp putting shafts through half of them did they agree to let us alone even after that they did not honor their agreement very well for they had precious little sense of honor and their children had magic bink continued seeing it now and so the thirdwavers invaded and killed off the secondwavers yes this happened after several generations though it was every bit as vicious when it came the secondwavers had become tolerably good neighbors all things considered by then again only the women were savedand not many of them because they had been in xanth all their lives their magic was strong they used it to eliminate their rapist husbands one by one in ways that could not be directly traced to the women but their victory was their defeat for now they had no families at all so they had to invite in more mundanes this is ghastly bink said i am descended from a thousand years of ignominy not entirely the history of man in xanth is brutal but not without redeeming values even greatness the second wave women organized and brought in only the finest men they could locate strong just kind intelligent men who understood the background but came more from principle than from greed they promised to keep the secret and to uphold the values of xanth they were mundanes but they were noble ones the fourthwavers bink exclaimed the finest of them all yes the xanth women were widows and victims of rape and finally murderesses some were old or scarred physically and emotionally by the campaign but they all had strong magic and iron determination they were the survivors of the cruel upheaval that had wiped out all other humans in xanth these qualities were quite evident when the new men learned the whole truth some turned about and returned to mundania but others liked marrying witches they wanted to have children with potent magic and they thought it might be hereditary so they regarded youth and beauty as secondary they made excellent husbands others wanted the potentials of the unique land of xanth developed and protected they were the environmentalists and magic was the most precious part of the environment and not all the fourthwavers were men some were carefully selected young women brought in to marry the children so that there would not be too much inbreeding so it was a settlement not an invasion and it was not rooted in murder but based on sound commercial and biological principles i know bink said that was the wave of the first great magicians so it was of course there were other waves but none so critical the effective dominance of human beings in xanth dates from that fourth wave other invasions killed many and drove more into the backwoods but the continuity was never broken just about every truly intelligent or magical person traces his ancestry to the fourth wave im sure you do too yes bink agreed i have ancestors from the first six waves but i always thought the first wave lineage was the most important the institution of the magic shield finally stopped the waves it kept all mundane creatures out and all xanth creatures in it was hailed as the salvation of xanth the guarantor of utopia but somehow things didnt improve much it is as if the people exchanged one problem for anothera visible threat for an invisible one in the past century xanth has been entirely free from invasionbut other threats have developed like the fireflies and the wiggles and bad magician trent bink agreed magical hazards trent was not a bad magician cherie corrected him he was an evil magician theres a distinctiona crucial one um yes he was a good evil magician lucky they got rid of him before he took over xanth certainly but suppose another evil magician appears or the wiggles manifest again who will save xanth this time i dont know bink admitted sometimes i wonder whether the shield was really a good idea it has the net effect of intensifying the magic in xanth preventing dilution from outside as if that magic were building up toward an explosion point yet i certainly wouldnt want to return to the days of the waves bink had never thought of it that way somehow i find it hard to appreciate the problems of the concentration of magic in xanth he said i keep wishing there were just a little more enough for me for my talent you might be better off without it she suggested if you could just obtain a dispensation from the king ha bink said id be better off living like a hermit in the wilderness my village wont tolerate a man without a talent strange inversion she murmured what oh nothing i was just thinking of herman the hermit he was exiled from our herd some years back for obscenity bink laughed what could be obscene to a centaur what did he do cherie drew up abruptly at the edge of a pretty field of flowers this is as far as i go she said tersely bink realized that he had said the wrong thing i didnt mean to offendi apologize for whatever cherie relaxed you couldnt know the odor of these flowers makes centaurs do crazy things i have to stay clear except in real emergencies i believe magician humfreys castle is about five miles south keep alert for hostile magic and i hope you find your talent thanks bink said gratefully he slid off her back his legs were a bit stiff from the long ride but he knew she had gained him a days travel time he walked around to face her and held out his hand cherie accepted it then leaned forward to kiss hima motherly kiss on his forehead bink wished she had not done that but he smiled mechanically and started walking he heard her hooves cantering back through the forest and suddenly he felt lonely fortunately his journey was nearly over but still he wondered what had herman the hermit done that the centaurs considered obscene chapter chasm bink stood at the brink appalled the path had been sundered by another trenchno not a trench but a mighty chasm half a mile across and seemingly of bottomless depth cherie the centaur could not have known of it or she would have warned him so it must be of very recent formationperhaps within the past month only an earthquake or cataclysmic magic could have formed such a canyon so rapidly since there had been no earthquakes that he knew of it had to be magic and that implied a magicianof phenomenal power who could it be the king in his heyday might have been able to fashion such a chasm by using a rigidly controlled storm a channeled hurricanebut he had no reason to and his powers had faded too much to manage anything like this now evil magician trent had been a transformer not an earthmover good magician humfreys magic was divided into a hundred assorted divinatory spells some of those might tell him how to create such a gross channel but it was hardly conceivable that humfrey would bother to do it humfrey never did anything unless there was a fee to be earned from it was there another great magician in xanth waithe had heard rumors of a master of illusion it was far easier to make an apparent chasm than a genuine one that could he an amplification of zinks pretendhole talent zink was no magician but if a real magician had this type of talent this was the kind of effect he might create maybe if bink simply walked out into this chasm his feet would find the path continuing on he looked down he saw a small cloud floating blithely along about five hundred feet down a gust of cool dank wind came up to brush him back he shivered that was extraordinarily realistic for an illusion he shouted hallooo he heard the echo following about five seconds after allooo he picked up a pebble and flipped it into the seeming chasm it disappeared into the depths and no sound of its landing came back at last he kneeled and poked his finger into the air beyond the brim it met no resistance he touched the edge and found it material and vertical he was convinced unwillingly the chasm was real there was nothing to do but go around it which meant he was not within five miles of his destination but within fifty or a hundred depending on the extent of this amazing crevice should he turn back the villagers certainly should be advised of this manifestation on the other hand it might be gone by the time he brought anyone else back here to see it and he would be labeled a fool as well as a spellless wonder worse he would be called a coward who had invented a story to explain his fear of visiting the magician and gaining absolute proof of his talentlessness what had been created magically could be abolished magically so he had better try to get around it bink looked somewhat wearily at the sky the sun was low in the west he had an hour or so of diminishing daylight left hed better spend it trying to locate a house in which to spend the night the last thing he wanted was to sleep outside in unfamiliar territory at the mercy of strange magic he had had a very easy trip so far thanks to cherie but with this emergency detour it would become much more difficult which way to turn east or west the chasm seemed to run interminably in both directions but the lay of the land was slightly less rugged to the east making a gradual descent maybe it would approach the bottom of the chasm enabling him to cross it farmers tended to build in valleys rather than on mountains so as to have ready sources of water and be free of the hostile magic of high places he would go east but this region was sparsely settled he had seen no human habitations along the path so far he walked increasingly swiftly through the forest as dusk came he saw great black shapes rising out of the chasm vastly spreading leathery wings cruelly bent beaks glinting small eyes vultures perhaps or worse he felt horribly uneasy it was now necessary to conserve his rations for he had no way of knowing how far they would have to stretch he spotted a breadfruit tree and cut a loaf from it but discovered the bread was not yet ripe he would get indigestion eating it he had to find a farmhouse the trees became larger and more gnarled of trunk they seemed menacing in the shadows a wind was rising causing the stiff twisted branches to sigh nothing ominous about that these effects werent even magical but bink found his heart beating more rapidly and he kept glancing back over his shoulder he was no longer on the established trail so his comparative security was gone he was going deeper into the hinterland where anything could happen night was the time of sinister magic and there were diverse and potent kinds the peace spell of the pines was only an example there were surely fear spells and worse if only he could find a house some adventurer he was the moment he had to go a little out of his way the instant it got dark he started reacting to his own toocreative imagination the fact was this was not the deep wilderness there would be few real threats to a careful man the true wilds were beyond the good magicians castle on the other side of the chasm he forced himself to slow down and keep his gaze forward just keep walking swinging the staff over to touch anything suspicious no foolish the end of the staff touched an innocuous black rock the rock burst upward with a loud whirring noise bink scrambled back falling on the ground arms thrown up protectively before his face the rock spread wings and flapped away koo it protested reproachfully it had been only a stone dove folded into its rock shape for camouflage and insulation during the night naturally it had reacted when pokedbut it was quite harmless if stone doves nested here it was bound to be safe for him all he had to do was stretch out anywhere and sleep why didnt he do just that because he was foolishly terrified of being alone at night he answered himself if only he had some magic then he would feel more secure even a simple confidence spell would serve he spied a light ahead relief it was a yellow square nearly certain indication of human habitation he was almost tearfully pleased he was no child no adolescent but he might as well be here in the forest and off the bounds of his map he needed the comfort of human companionship he hurried toward the light hoping it would not turn out to be some illusion or trap sponsored by an inimical being it was real it was a farm at the edge of a small village now he could see other squares of light farther down the valley almost joyfully he knocked on the door it opened grudgingly to show a homely woman in a soiled apron she peered at him suspiciously i dont know you she grumped edging the door closed again i am bink of the north village he said quickly i have traveled all day and was balked by the chasm now i need lodging for the night i will perform some reasonable service for the favor im strong i can chop wood or load hay or move rocks you dont need magic to do those things she said not with magic with my hands i how do i know youre not a wraith she demanded bink held out his left hand wincing prick me i bleed it was a standard test for most nocturnal supernatural creatures had no blood unless they had recently fed on some living creature even then they had none that would flow oh come on martha a mans gruff voice called from inside there hasnt been a wraith in these parts for a decade and they dont do no harm anyway let him in if he eats hes human ogres eat she muttered but she cracked the door open far enough for bink to squeeze through now bink saw the farms guardian animal a small werewolf probably one of their children there were no true werewolves or other weres that he knew of all were humans who had developed the talent such changelings were increasingly frequent it seemed this one had the large head and flattish face typical of the type a real werewolf would have been indistinguishable from a canine until it changed then it would have been a wolfish man bink put out a hand as it slunk up to sniff him then patted it on the head the creature metamorphosed into a boy about eight years old did i scare you huh he begged terrified bink agreed the lad turned toward the man hes clean paw he announced no smell of magic on him thats the trouble bink murmured if i had magic i wouldnt be traveling but i meant what i said i can do good physical work no magic the man inquired as the woman poured bink a steaming bowl of stew the farmer was in his midthirties as homely as his wife but possessed of a few deep smilelines around his mouth and eyes he was thin but obviously sturdy hard physical labor made for tough men he flexed purple as he talked then green his whole body changing color smoothly his talent howd you make it all the way from north village in one day then a lady centaur gave me a lift a filly ill bet she did whered you hang on to when she jumped bink smiled ruefully well she said shed drop me in a trench if i did it again he admitted haw haw haw the man brayed farmers being relatively uneducated tended to have an earthy sense of humor bink noticed that the homely wife wasnt laughing and the boy merely stared uncomprehendingly now the farmer got down to business listen i dont need no hand labor nowsabout but ive got a part in a hearing coming up and i dont want to go upsets the missus you know bink nodded though he did not understand he saw the wife nod grim agreement what sort of thing was this so if you want to work off your lodging you can stand in for me the farmer continued wont only take bout an hour no work to it cept to agree to anything the bailiff says softest job you can find and easy for you too cause youre a stranger playing opposite a cute young thing he caught the grim look of his wife and aborted that line how bout it anything i can do bink said uncertainly what was this about playing opposite a cute young thing hed never find out while the wife was present would sabrina object fine theres hay in the loft and a bucket so you wont have to go outside just dont snore too loudthe missus dont like it the missus didnt like a lot of things it seemed how did a man ever come to marry a woman like that would sabrina turn shrewish after marriage the idea made him uneasy i wont bink agreed the stew was not very tasty but it was filling good stuff to travel on he slept comfortably in the hay with the wolf curled up beside him he did have to use the pot and it stank all night having no coverbut that was much better than going into the magic night after that initial expression of objection to the stew his innards settled down bink really had no complaint he had gruel for breakfast heated without fire that was the wifes talent a useful one for a farmstead then he reported to the neighbors house a mile on down along the chasm for the hearing the bailiff was a big bluff man above whose head a small cloud formed when he concentrated on anything too intently know anything about it he inquired after bink explained nothing bink admitted youll have to tell me what to do good its just a sort of little playlet to settle a problem without ruining anybodys reputation we call it surrogate magic mind you dont use any actual magic i wont bink said you just agree to whatever i ask you thats all bink began to get nervous i dont believe in lying sir this aint exactly lying boy its in a good cause youll see im sprised you folk dont practice it in north village bink was uneasily silent he hoped he had not gotten himself into something ugly the others arrived two men and three young women the men were ordinary bearded farmers one young one middleaged the girls ranged from indifferent to ravishing bink forced his eyes away from the prettiest one lest he stare she was the most voluptuous striking blackhaired beauty he had ever seen a diamond in the mud of this region now the six of you sit down across from each other at this table the bailiff said in his official voice ill do the talking when the judge comes mind you this is a playbut its secret when i swear you in its for keepsabsolutely no blabbing about the details after you get out understand they all nodded bink was becoming more perplexed he now understood about playing opposite a sweet young thingbut what kind of play was this with an audience of one that no one was permitted to report on later well so be it maybe it was a kind of magic the three men sat in a row on one side of the table and the three girls faced them bink was opposite the beautiful one her knees touched his for the table was narrow they were silky smooth sending a shiver of appreciation up his legs remember sabrina he told himself he was not ordinarily swayed by a pretty face but this was an extraordinary face it didnt help that she wore a tight sweater what a figure the judge entered a portly man with impressive paunch and sideburns all stand the bailiff said they all stood respectfully the judge took a seat at the end of the table and the bailiff moved to the far side they all sat down do you three ladies swear to tell no truth other than that presented in this hearing any time anywhere and to shut up about that the bailiff demanded we do the girls chorused and do you three louts swear the same we do bink said with the others if he was supposed to lie here but never to talk about it outside did that mean it wasnt really a lie the bailiff knew what was true and what was false presumably so in effect now this is the hearing for an alleged rape the bailiff announced bink shocked tried to conceal his dismay were they supposed to act out a rape among these present the bailiff continued is the girl who says she was rapedand the man she charges he says it happened but it was voluntary that right men bink nodded vigorously along with the others brother he would rather have chopped wood for his nights lodging here he was possibly lying about a rape he never committed this is done anonymously to protect the reputations of those involved the bailiff said sos to have an advisory opinion in the presence of the first parties without advertising it to the whole community bink was beginning to understand a girl who had been raped could be ruined though it was no fault of her own many men would refuse to marry her for that reason alone thus she could win her case but lose her future a man guilty of rape could be exiled and a man accused of rape would be viewed with suspicion complicating his own future it was almost he thought grimly as serious a crime as having no magic getting at the truth could be a very delicate matter not something either party would want to advertise in a public trial win or lose reputations would suffer grievously yet how could justice be done if it never came to trial thus this private semianonymous hearing would it suffice she says she was walking down by the gap the bailiff said glancing at his notes he came up behind her grabbed her and raped her right girls the three girls nodded each looking hurt and angry the vigorous head motion caused the knee of the girl facing bink to shake and another ripple of suggestion traveled up his leg what an opposite lady in what a play he says he was standing there and she came up and made a suggestion and he took her up on it right men bink nodded with the others he hoped his side won this was nervous business now the judge spoke was it close to a house bout a hundred feet the bailiff said then why did she not scream he said hed push her off the brink if she made a sound the bailiff replied she was frozen in terror right girls they noddedand each looked momentarily terrified bink wondered which of the three had actually been raped then he corrected his thought hastily which one had made the accusation he hoped it wasnt the one opposite him were the two known to each other prior to the occasion yes your honor then i presume she would have fled him at the outset had she disliked himand that he would not have forced her if she trusted him in a small community like this people get to know each other very well and there are few actual surprises this is not conclusive but it strongly suggests she had no strong aversion to contact with him and may have tempted him with consequence she later regretted i would probably were this case to come up in formal court find the man not guilty of the charge by virtue of reasonable doubt the three men relaxed bink became aware of a trickle of sweat on his forehead generated while he listened to the judges potential decision okay you have the judges ifso said the bailiff you girls still want to bring it to open trial grimfaced looking betrayed the three girls shook their heads no bink felt sorry for his opposite how could she avoid being seductive she was a creature constructed for no other visible purpose than ra than love then take off the bailiff said rememberno talking outside or well have a real trial for contempt of court the warning seemed superfluous the girls would hardly be talking about this one the guiltyuh innocentman would also shut up and bink himself just wanted to get clear of this village that left only one man who might want to talkbut if he breathed a word all the others would know who had blabbed there would be silence so it was over bink stood and filed out with the others the whole thing had taken less than the promised hour so he was well off hed had a nights lodging and was well rested all he needed now was to find a route past the chasm to the good magicians castle the bailiff emerged and bink approached him could you tell me if there is any way south from here boy you dont want to cross the gap the bailiff said firmly the little cloud forming over his head not unless you can fly im on foot theres a route but the gap dragon youre a nice boy young handsome you did a good job in the hearing dont risk it everybody thought he was so damned young only good strong personal magic would give him real manhood in the eyes of xanth i have to risk it the bailiff sighed well i cant tell you no then son im not your father he sucked in his paunch which was almost as impressive as that of the judge and contemplated the cloud over his head momentarily the cloud seemed about to shed a tear or two again bink winced inwardly now he was getting fathered as well as mothered but its complicated better have wynne show you wynne your opposite the one you almost raped the bailiff smiled making a signal with one hand and his cloud dissipated not that i blame you the girl approached apparently in answer to the signal wynne honey show this man to the southern slope of the gap mind you keep clear of the dragon sure she said smiling the smile did not add to her splendor because that was impossible but it tried bink had mixed emotions after this hearing suppose she accused him of the bailiff glanced at him understandingly dont worry about it son wynne dont lie and she dont change her mind you behave yourself difficult as that may be and therell be no trouble embarrassed bink accepted the girls company if she could show him a quick safe route past the chasm he would be well ahead they walked east the sun beating into their faces is it far bink asked still feeling awkward for assorted reasons if sabrina could see him now not far she said her voice was soft somehow sending an involuntary thrill through him maybe it was magic he hoped so because he didnt like to think that he could be so easily subverted by mere beauty he didnt know this girl they continued in silence for a while bink tried again what is your talent she looked at him blankly uhoh after the hearing she could not be blamed for taking that the wrong way your magic talent he clarified the thing you can do a spell or she shrugged noncommittally what was with this girl she was beautiful but she seemed somewhat vacuous do you like it here he asked she shrugged again now he was almost certain wynne was lovely but stupid too bad she could have made some farmer a marvelous showpiece no wonder the bailiff had not been concerned about her she was not much use they walked in silence again as they rounded a bend they almost stumbled over a rabbit nibbling a mushroom in the path startled the creature jumped straight into the air and hung there levitating its pink nose quivering bink laughed we wont hurt you magic bunny he said and wynne smiled they passed on under it but the episode minor as it was bothered bink in retrospect and for a familiar reason why should a common gardenvariety rabbit possess the magic power of floating while bink himself had nothing it simply wasnt fair now he heard the strains of a lovely melody seeming to punctuate his thoughts he looked about and saw a lyrebird playing its strings the music carried through the forest filling it with a pseudo joy ha he felt the need to talk so he did when i was a kid they always teased me because i had no magic he said not caring whether she understood i lost footraces to others who could fly or put walls in my way or pass through trees or who could pop out in one place and in at another place he had said as much to cherie the centaur he was sorry to be stuck in this groove but some unreasonable part of his mind seemed to believe that if he repeated it often enough he would find some way to alleviate it or who could cast a spell on the path ahead of them making it all downhill while i had to cover the honest lay of the land remembering all those indignities he began to feel choked up can i go with you wynne asked abruptly uhoh maybe she figured he could regale her with more stories indefinitely the other rigors of travel did not occur to her in a few miles her shapely body obviously not constructed for brute work would tire and hed have to carry her wynne im going a long way to see the magician humfrey you dont want to come along no her marvelous face clouded up still conscious of the rape hearing and wary of any possible misunderstanding he phrased it carefully they were now descending a tortuous path into a low section of the chasm winding around tufts of clatterweed and clutchroot saplings he had taken the lead bracing with his staff so as to be able to catch her if she lost her footing and fell when he glanced up at her he caught distracting glimpses of her exquisite thighs there seemed to be no part of her body that was not perfectly molded only her brain had been neglected it is dangerous much bad magic i go alone alone she was still confused though she was handling the path very well nothing wrong with her coordination bink found himself a bit surprised that those legs could actually be used for climbing and walking i need help magic the magician charges a years service youwould not want to pay the good magician was male and wynne had only one obvious coin no one would be interested in her mind she looked at him in perplexity then she brightened standing upright on the path above him you want payment she put one hand to the front of her dress no bink yelled almost dislodging himself from the steep slope he already visualized a reenactment of the hearing and a different verdict who would believe he had not taken advantage of the lovely idiot if she showed him any more of her body no he repeated more to himself than to her but she said clouding up again he was rescued by another distraction they were near the bottom now and bink could see across the base to the more gentle rise of the south slope no problem about climbing that he was about to tell wynne she could go home when there was an uncomfortable sound a kind of slidebump it was repeatedvery loud and shuddersome without being precisely definable whats that he asked nervously wynne cupped her ear listening though the noise was plainly audible with the shift in her balance her feet lost purchase and she began to slide down he jumped to catch her and eased her to the chasm floor what an armful she was all softness and resilience and slenderness in miraculous proportions she turned her face to him brushing back her slightly disarrayed hair as he stood her back on her feet the gap dragon she said for a moment he was confused then he remembered that he had asked her a question now she was answering it with the singlemindedness of the meager intellect she had is it dangerous yes she had been too stupid to tell him before he asked and he had not thought to ask before he heard it maybe if he hadnt been looking at her so muchyet what man would not have looked already he saw the monster coming from the westa smoking reptilian head low to the ground but large very large run he bawled she started to runstraight ahead into the chasm no he yelled sprinting after her he caught her by one arm and spun her about her hair swirled winsomely a black cloud about her face you want payment she asked brother run that way he cried shoving her back toward the northern slope since it was the closest escape he hoped the dragon was not a good climber she obeyed moving fleetly over the ground but the glaring eyes of the gap dragon followed her orienting on the motion the creature swerved to intercept her bink saw she could not reach the path in time the monster was whomping along at gallopingcentaur velocity bink sprinted after her again caught her and half hurled her back toward the south even in this desperate moment her body had a limber appealing quality that threatened to distract his mind that way he cried its catching up he was acting as foolishly as she changing his mind while doom closed in he had to divert the monster somehow hey steamsnoot he bawled waving his arms wildly look at me the dragon looked so did wynne not you bink yelled at her get on across get out of the gap she ran again no one could be so stupid as not to understand the danger here now the dragons attention was on bink it swerved again bearing down on him it had a long sinuous body and three sets of stubby legs the legs lifted the torso and whomped it forward causing it to slide several feet the process looked clumsybut the thing was traveling disconcertingly fast time for him to run bink took off down the chasm toward the east the dragon had already cut him off from the north slope and he didnt want to lead it in the direction wynne was going for all its awkward mode of propulsion it could run faster than he no doubt its speed was enhanced by magic it was after all a magical creature but what of his theory about no creature having magic and intelligence if it was magical in itself if that was valid this thing would not be very smart bink hoped so hed rather try to outwit a dumb dragon than a smart one especially when his life depended on it so he ranbut already he knew this course was hopeless this was the dragons hunting ground the factor that stopped people from crossing the chasm on foot he should have known that a magically constructed chasm would not be left unattended someone or something did not want people crossing freely from north xanth to south xanth especially nonmagical people like him bink was puffing now out of breath and a pain was developing in his side he had underestimated the speed of the dragon it was not a little faster than he was it was substantially faster the huge head snapped forward and steam gushed around him bink inhaled the stuff it wasnt as hot as he had feared and it smelled faintly of burning wood but it was still uncomfortable he choked gaspedtripped on a stone and fell flat his staff flew out of his hands that fatal moment of distraction the dragon whomped right over him unable to stop so rapidly it was so long and low that it couldnt fall the metallic body shot past inertia carrying the head beyond range if magic enhanced the things speed then there was no magic to help it brake for what that small blessing was worth binks breath was momentarily knocked out of him by the fall he was already desperately short of air he gasped for more unable to concentrate on anything else at the moment not even on escape while he lay effectively paralyzed the middle set of legs came downright at him they came together as though yoked ready to heave the heavy body up and forward again he couldnt even roll aside in time he would be crushed but the massive claws of the right foot landed squarely on the rock that had tripped him it was a big rock bigger than it looked and he had fallen on the lower side after stumbling on its builtup upper side he was sprawled in a kind of erosion gully the three claws were splayed by the rock so that one missed him to the left another to the right and the middle one arched right over him hardly touching the ground perhaps a ton of dragonweight on that one foot none of it touching him a lucky placement that could never have happened by design now he had some of his breath back and the foot was gone already lifted for the next whomp had bink been able to roll aside he would have been caught squarely by one of the claws and squished but one freak break did not mean he was out of trouble the dragon was curling around to find him again steaming back along its own long torso it was marvelously supple able to bend in a tight uturn bink would have admired this quality more from a safe distance snakelike the monster could convolute into knots if it had to reaching him wherever he tried to hide no wonder it whomped it had no rigid backbone knowing it was futile bink still found himself trying to escape he dashed under the treetrunkthick tail the head followed him the nostrils pursuing his scent as accurately as the eyes traced his motion bink reversed course and leaped up over the tail scrambling for handholds on the scales he was in luck some dragons had scales with serrated edges that sliced the flesh of anything that touched them this ones scales were innocuously rounded it was probably a survival trait in a chasm like this though bink wasnt sure why did sharp scales tend to snag on things slowing the velocity of a lowtotheground monster he tumbled over the tailand the dragons head followed smoothly no steam now maybe the monster didnt want to heat up its own flesh it was already savoring its conquest and repast playing cat and mouse with him though hed never seen a werecat do that possibly real cats did play that way though there werent many of thoseor micearound these days for some reason but he was letting his mind run away with his attention again and he couldnt afford it could he lead the dragons head such a merry chase around its own body that it actually did tie itself in a knot he doubted it but might have to give it a try anyway it was better than just getting swallowed he was back at the rock he had stumbled over now its position was changed the moving weight of the dragon had dislodged it there was a crack in the ground where it had been a deep dark hole bink didnt like holes in the ground no telling what might lurk in there nickelpedes stinglice hoopworms lepermudugh but he had no chance at all here amid the coils of the gap dragon he jumped feet first into the hole the earth crumbled beneath his weight but not quite enough he sank in up to his thighs and stuck the dragon seeing him about to escape blasted a torrent of steam but again it was warm vapor not burning hot actually little more than coalesced breath this was not after all a fire dragon but a pseudo fire dragon few people were likely to get close enough to know the difference the mist bathed bink soaking him down thoroughly and turned the dirt around him to mud thus lubricated he began to move again down the dragon snatched at himbut bink popped through the constriction with a sucking sound that complemented the futile clicking of the dragons teeth he dropped about two feet to solid rock his feet stung especially the ankle that had been turned but he was unhurt he ducked his head down and felt about him in the darkness he was in a cave what luck but he still wasnt safe the dragon was clawing at the ground gouging out huge chunks of dirt and rock steaming the remainder into rivulets of mud gooey chunks splatted against the cave floor the opening was widening letting in more light soon it would be big enough for the dragons head binks doom had only been postponed this was no occasion for caution bink strode ahead hands touching each other before him arms bowed in a horizontal circle if he hit a wall he would only bruise his forearms better a bruise than the crunch of dragons teeth he did not hit a wall he struck a mud slick instead his foot shot out from under and he took a bellyflop there was water herereal water not dragons breatha trickle wending down down down where surely to an underground river that could account for the sudden canyon the river could have been tunneling for centuries and suddenly the ground above collapsed forming the chasm one phenomenal sinkhole now the river was working againand he would surely drown if he splashed into it for there was no guarantee that its current was slow or that there was air in its passage even if he swam well he could be consumed by river monsters the especially vicious kind that frequented dark cold waters bink clawed his way back up the slope he found a branching passage leading up and followed it as rapidly as possible soon he saw a shaft of light from above safe safe not while the dragon still lurked bink dared not dig his way out until it left he would have to wait hoping the predator didnt dig this far he hunkered down trying not to get any more mud on him the sounds of the dragons digging diminished then ceased altogether there was silencebut bink wasnt fooled dragons were of the hideandpounce variety generally at least the landbound ones were they could move fast when they moved but could not keep it up long a dragon would never successfully run down a deer for example even if the deer lacked escapist magic but dragons were very good at waiting bink would have to stay low until he actually heard it move off it was a long wait complicated by the cold discomfort of the mud and dark and his prior wetting by the dragons breath plus the fact that he could not be quite sure the dragon was there this might all be for nothing and the dragon could be emitting steamy chuckles as it retreated silentlythey could be very quiet when they wanted to and hunted elsewhere no that was what the predator wanted him to think he dared not emerge or even move lest the thing hear him that was why it was so quiet now it was listening dragons had excellent senses perhaps that was why they were so common in the wilderness regions and so feared they were a survival type apparently his scent had suffused the area issuing from stray vents so that it did not give away his precise location the dragon was not about to wear itself out digging up the entire cave system but sound or sight would do him in now that he was absolutely still he was cold this was summer in xanth and it really did not get very cold even in winter for many plants had heat magic local weather control or other mechanisms for comfort but the chasm was sparsely vegetated and sheltered from much of the sun and the cool air tended to settle and be trapped it had taken awhile for the heat of his exertions to dissipate but now he was shivering he could not afford to shiver too violently his legs and feet hurt becoming cramped to top it off he felt a scratchiness in his throat he was coming down with a cold this present discomfort would hardly help him to throw that off and he could not go to the village doctor for a medicinal spell he tried to distract himself by thinking of other things but he did not care to rehearse yet again the assorted indignities of his bitter childhood or the frustration of having but not being able to hold a lovely girl like sabrina because of his lack of magic the notion of lovely girls reminded him of wynne he would not be human if he didnt react to her fantastic face and body but she was so abysmally stupid and anyway he was engaged already so he had no business thinking of her his efforts at selfdistraction came to nothing it was better to suffer in mental silence then he became aware of something more insidious it had been in evidence for some time but he had not been consciously aware of it because of his other concerns even unsuccessful distractions did some good it was a peripheral almost subliminal thing a kind of flickering which vanished when he looked directly at it but became insistent at the fringe of his vision what was it something naturalor something magic innocent or sinister then he recognized it a shade a halfreal spirit ghost or some unquiet dead doomed to skulk in shadow and night until its wrongs were righted or its evil exonerated because the shades could not go abroad by day or enter light or intrude in populous places they represented no threat to ordinary folk in ordinary circumstances most were bound to the place of their demise as roland had advised bink long ago if a shade bothers you walk away from it they were easy to escape this was called pulling the shade only if an unwary person foolishly slept near the abode of a shade was he in trouble it took a shade about an hour to infiltrate a living body and a person could move away at any time and be free of it once roland in a fit of uncharacteristic ire had threatened to stun an annoying trespasser and leave him in the nearest shade barrow the man had quickly departed now bink was neither stunned nor asleep but if he moved the gap dragon would pounce if he did not move the shade would infiltrate his body that could be a fate worse than death really all because he had tried to rescue a beautiful vacuous girl from a dragon in folklore such a hero always received a most intriguing reward in reality the hero was as likely as not to find himself in need of rescue as now well such was reallife justice in xanth the shade grew bolder thinking him helpless or inattentive it did not glow it was merely a lesser darkness than that of the cave he could see it fairly well now by not looking at it a vague mannish outline very sad bink wanted to leap away but he found the dank wall close behind him and in any event he could not afford to take a step no matter how silently he did it the dragon would hear he could walk forward right through the shade and all he would feel would be a momentary chill like that of the grave it had happened on occasion to him before unpleasant but hardly critical but this time the dragon would be on him maybe he could run being fully rested and get a head start before the dragon woke the dragon must surely be sleeping getting its rest while its keen ears were attuned to the quarry the shade touched him bink jerked his arm awayand the dragon stirred above it was there all right bink froze and the dragon lost him again the mere jerk had not been quite enough the dragon circled trying to sniff him out its huge nose passed over the upper crack steam jetted down the shade retreated in alarm then the dragon settled in place giving up the chase for the moment it knew its prey would give itself away sooner or later when it came to waiting the dragon was much better equipped than the human one more reptilian twitchand the end of the tail dropped through the crack dangling almost to the floor in order to escape bink would have to brush past it now what were his chances suddenly bink had an idea the dragon was a living it magical animal why shouldnt the shade take over its body a shadedominated dragon would probably have other things on its mind than eating a hiding person if he could just move over so as to place the dangling tail between him and the shade he tried shifting his balance with tedious slowness trying to lift one foot so as to put it forward silently but the moment it lifted it hurt and he flinched the dragons tail twitched and bink had to freeze this was extremely awkward because his balance in this semisquatting position was at best tenuous and now both feet and ankles felt as if they were on fire the shade advanced again bink tried to ease his foot farther forward so as to achieve a more comfortable balance without falling over away from the shade again agony shot through him and again the tail twitched once more he froze in even more discomfort and yet again the shade moved in he could not go on this way the shade touched his shoulder this time bink steeled himself not to flinch he would certainly have lost his balance and then his life the touch was hideously cool not cold it made his skin crawl what was he to do he controlled himself with continuing effort it would take an hour or so for the shade to take over his body he could break the spell at any time before it was complete the dragon would gobble him down in seconds appalling as the notion was the shade was the better risk at least it was slow maybe in half an hour the dragon would have gone away maybe the moon would fall out of the sky and squish the dragon under green cheese too why wish for the impossible if the dragon did not go then what bink just didnt know but so far he didnt see much choice the shade moved in inexorably cooling his shoulder through to chest and back bink felt the intrusion with barely suppressed loathing how would it be possible to submit to this invasion of the dead yet he had to do it at least for a while lest the dragon quickly convert him to a shade himself or would that be preferable at least he would die a man the ghastly cool essence impinged slowly on his head now bink was terrified yet frozen he could not lean his head away any farther the horror crept through and he felt himself sinking slipping being blotted up by and then he was eerily calm peace the shade said in his mind the peace of the pine forest where the sleepers never woke bink could not protest aloud because of the dragons ears but he gathered himself for a final effort to leap away from this dread possession he would crash past the dragons tail before the monster could react and take his chance with the subterranean river no friend i can help you the shade cried louder but still silently somehow insidiously bink began to believe the spirit actually seemed sincere perhaps it was just in contrast to the alternatives consumption by dragon or drowning in river fair exchange the shade persisted permit me for one hour i will save your life then dissipate my onus abated it had the ring of conviction bink faced death anyway if the shade could somehow save him it would certainly be worth an hour of possession it was true that shades dissipated once their burden was lifted but not all shades were honest the criminal ones sometimes were recalcitrant choosing not to atone for their crimes in life instead they added to them in death under cover of the new identity ruining the reputation of the unlucky person they controlled after all the shade had little to lose he was already dead absolution would merely consign him to oblivion or to his place in the infernal regions depending on his faith small wonder some chose never to die completely my wife my child the shade pleaded they go hungry they sorrow ignorant of my status i must tell them where the silver tree grows that i died to locate the silver tree bink had heard of the like a tree with leaves of pure silver incredibly valuablefor silver was a magic metal it tended to repel evil magic and armor made from it resisted magic weapons and of course it could even be used as money no it is for my family the shade cried that they may never again dwell in poverty do not take it for yourself that convinced bink a dishonest shade would have promised him everything this one promised only life not riches agreed bink thought hoping he was not making a dreadful mistake trust unwisely given wait until merging is complete the shade said gratefully i cannot help you until i become you bink hoped it was no deception but what really did he have to lose and what did the shade have to gain by a lie if it did not save bink it would only share the sensation of being eaten by the dragon then they would both be shadesand bink would be an angry one he wondered what one shade could do to another meanwhile he waited at last it was done he was donald the prospector a man whose talent was flying we go donald cried through binks lips exultantly he put his arms up as if diving and rose straight up through the crack in the ceiling with such power that the edges of rock and dirt were flung aside the sheer brightness of day blinded them as they emerged the gap dragon took a moment to orient on this strange occurrence then pounced but donald made another effort and shot up so swiftly that the huge teeth snapped on air he kicked the monster on the snout hard ha gaptooth he yelled chew on this and he stomped on the tender portion of the dragons nose the jaws gaped open and a cloud of steam shot out but donald was already zooming out of reach the dragon had no chance to catch them before they were too high up up they sailed straight out of the canyon above the trees and slopes there was no effort other than mental for this was magic flight they leveled off proceeding north across xanth in delayed reaction bink realized that he had a magic talent by proxy certainlybut for the first time in his life he was experiencing what every other citizen of xanth experienced he was performing now he knew how it felt it felt wonderful the sun bore down from almost straight overhead for it was now midday they were up amid the clouds bink felt discomfort in his ears but an automatic reaction by his other self popped them making the pain abate before it intensified he didnt know why flying should hurt his ears maybe it was because there wasnt enough to hear up here for the first time too he saw the full upper contours of the clouds from beneath they were generally flat but from above they were elegantly if randomly sculptured what seemed like tiny puffballs from the ground were big masses of fog in person donald flew through them with equanimity but bink didnt like the loss of vision he was nervous about banging into something why so high he inquired i can hardly see the ground this was an exaggeration what he meant was that he could not make out the details he was accustomed to also it would have been nice to have some of the people see him flying he could buzz around the north village astounding the scoffers qualifying for his citizenship no that would not be honest too bad the most tempting things were not right to do i dont want to advertise donald said it could complicate things if people thought i was alive again oh perhaps so there could be renewed expectations maybe debts to be paid ones that mere silver would not abate the shades business was necessarily anonymous at least so far as the community was concerned see that glint donald inquired pointing down between two clouds thats the silver oak tree its so well hidden it can be spotted only from above but i can tell my boy exactly where to find it then i can rest i wish you could tell me where to find a magic talent bink said wistfully you dont have one every citizen of xanth has magic thats why im not a citizen bink said glumly they both spoke through the same mouth im going to the good magician it he cant help me ill be exiled i know the feeling i spent two years exiled in that cave what happened to you i was flying home after discovering the silver tree and a storm came up i was so excited by the thought of riches that i couldnt wait i risked the trip in high winds and got blown into the gap the impact was so great i landed in the cavebut i was already dead i didnt see any bones you didnt see any hole in the ground either the dirt filled in over me and then my body got washed away by the river but dont you know anything its the place of death that anchors the shade not the place of the corpse oh sorry i hung on though i knew it was hopeless then you came donald paused look youve done me such a favorill share the silver with you theres enough on that tree for both my family and you only promise not to tell anyone else where it is bink was tempted but a moments reflection changed his mind i need magic not silver without magic ill be exiled from xanth so i wont be able to share the silver with magic i dont care about wealth so if you want to share it share it with the tree dont take all its leaves but just a few at a time and some of the silver acorns that drop so the tree can go on living in health and perhaps reproduce itself in the long run that will be more productive anyway it was a fortunate day for me when you dropped into my cave donald said he banked into a curve going down binks ears popped again as they descended they dropped into a forest glade then walked half a mile to an isolated rundown farm it took that much motion to completely eliminate the fingering cramps in binks legs isnt it beautiful donald inquired bink looked at the rickety wooden fence and sagging roof a few chickens scratched among the weeds but to a man who had love invested here love enough to sustain him two years after violent death it must be the fairest of ranches um he said i know it isnt muchbut after that cave it is like heaven itself donald continued my wife and boy have magic of course but it isnt enough she cures feather fade in chickens and he makes little dust devils she brings in barely enough to feed them but shes a good wife and lovely beyond belief now they entered the yard a sevenyearold boy looked up from the picture he was making in the dirt he reminded bink briefly of the werewolf boy he had leftwas it only six hours ago but that impression was destroyed when this boy opened his mouth go way he yelled better i dont tell him donald said slowly a bit taken aback two yearsthats a long time for that age he doesnt recognize this body but see how hes grown they knocked on the door a woman answered plain in a dingy dress her hair swept back under a soiled kerchief in her heyday she might have been ordinary now hard work had made her old before her time she hasnt changed a bit donald thought admiringly then aloud sally the woman stared at him with uncomprehending hostility sallydont you know me im back from the dead to wrap up my affairs don she exclaimed her pale eyes lighting at last then binks arms enfolded her and his lips kissed hers he saw her through donalds overwhelming emotionand she was good and lovely beyond belief donald drew back staring into the splendor of her love as he spoke mark this darling thirteen miles northnortheast of the small millpond beside a sharp eastwest ridge there is a silver tree go harvest ita few leaves at a time so as not to damage it market the metal as far away as you can or get a friend to do it for you tell no one the source of your wealth remarryit will make a fine dowry and i want you to be happy and the boy to have a father don she repeated tears of grief and joy in her eyes i dont care about silver now that youre back im not back im dead returning only as a shade to tell you of the tree take it use it or my struggle has been for nothing promise but she started then saw the look on his face all right don i promise but ill never love any other man my onus is abated my deed is done donald said one more time beloved he bent to kiss her againand dissipated bink found himself kissing another mans wife she knew it immediately and jerked her face away oh sorry bink said mortified i have to go now she stared at him suddenly hardeyed what little joy remained in her had been wrung out by the brief manifestation of her husband what do we owe you stranger nothing donald saved my life by flying us away from the gap dragon in the chasm the silver is all yours i will never see you again she softened comprehending that he was not going to take away the silver thank you stranger then on obvious impulse you could share the silver if you wanted he told me to remarry marry her i have no magic bink said i am to be exiled it was the kindest way he could think of to decline not all the silver of xanth could make this situation attractive to him on any level will you stay for a meal he was hungry but not that hungry i must be on my way do not tell your son about donald he felt it would only hurt the boy farewell farewell she said momentarily he saw a hint of the beauty donald had seen in her then that too was lost bink turned and left on the way out of the farm he saw a whirling dust devil coming toward him product of the boys minor malice toward strangers bink dodged it and hurried away he was glad he had done this favor for the prospector but also relieved that it was done he had not properly appreciated before what poverty and death could mean to a family chapter illusion bink resumed his journey on the wrong side of the chasm if only donalds farm had been to the south strange how everyone here knew about the chasm and took it for grantedyet nobody in the north village did could it be a conspiracy of silence that seemed unlikely because the centaurs didnt seem to know about it either and they were normally extremely well informed it had been present for at least two years since the shade had been there that long and probably much longer since the gap dragon must have spent its whole life there it must be a spellan ignorance spell so that only those people in the immediate vicinity of the chasm were aware of it those who departedforgot obviously there had never been a clear path from the north to the south of xanthnot in recent years well that was not his concern he just had to get around it he was not going to attempt to cross it again only a phenomenal series of coincidences had saved his skin bink knew that coincidence was an untrustworthy ally the land here was green and hilly with headhigh candystripe ferns sprouting so thickly that it was impossible to see very far ahead he had no beaten trail now he got lost once apparently thrown off by an aversion spell some trees protected themselves from molestation by causing the traveler to veer aside so as to pass some distance from them maybe that was how the silver oak had remained undiscovered so long if someone got into a patch of such trees he could be bounced far afield or even routed in a perpetual circle it could be difficult indeed to break out of that sort of trap because it was not at all obvious the traveler thought he was going where he wanted to go another time he encountered a very fine path going right his way so fine that natural caution made him avoid it there were a number of wilderness cannibal plants that made access very attractive right up until the moment their traps sprung thus it was three days before he made significant progressbut he remained in good form apart from his cold he found a few nosegays that helped clear his nose and a pillbox bush with headache pills at irregular intervals there were colorfruit trees bearing greens yellows oranges and blues he had fair luck finding lodging each night for he was obviously a fairly harmless type but he also had to spend some hours in labor earning his board the people of this hinterland were minimally talented their magic was of the spot on a wall variety so they lived basically mundane lives and always needed chores done at last the land wound down to the sea xanth was a peninsula that had never adequately been mappedobviously the unmarked chasm proved thatso its precise dimensions were unknown perhaps unknowable in general it was an oval or oblong stretching northsouth connected to mundania by a narrow bridge of land on the northwest probably it had been an island at one time and so evolved its distinct type of existence free from the interference of the outside world now the shield had restored that isolation cutting off the land bridge by its curtain of death and wiping out the personnel of invading ships if that werent enough there was said to be a number of ferocious sea monsters offshore no mundania did not intrude any more bink hoped the sea would permit him to get around the chasm the gap dragon probably could not swim and the sea monsters should not come too close to land there should be a narrow section where neither dragon nor sea monster prevailed maybe a beach he could walk across plunging into the water if the terror of the chasm charged and onto land if magic threatened from the sea there it was a beautiful thread of white sand stretching from one side of the chasm to the other no monsters were in sight he could hardly believe his luckbut he acted before it could change bink hit the beach running for ten paces everything was fine then his foot came down on water and he fell into the brine the beach was illusion he had fallen for a most elementary trap what better way for a sea monster to catch its prey than a vanishing beach converting to deep water bink stroked for the real shoreline which he now saw was a rocky waste upon which the waves broke and spumed not a safe landing at all but his only choice he could not go back on the beach he had come along it no longer seemed to exist even in illusion either he had somehow been borne across the water or he had been swimming without knowing it either way it was not magic he cared to get tangled up in again better to know exactly where he was something cold and flat and immensely powerful coiled around one ankle bink had lost his staff when the gap dragon ran him down and had not yet cut a new one all he had was his hunting knife it was a puny resource against a sea monster but he had to try he drew the knife from its sheath held his breath and lashed in the vicinity of his ankle what held him felt like leather he had to saw at it to sever it these monsters were tough all over something huge and murky loomed at him under the water reeling in the tongue he sawed at yardlong teeth flashed as the giant jaws opened bink lost what little nerve he had left he screamed his head was underwater the scream was a disaster water rushed into his mouth his throat firm hands were pressing his back rhythmically forcing the water out the air in bink choked and hacked and coughed he had been rescued iim okay he gasped the hands eased off bink sat up blinking he was on a small yacht the sails were of brightly colored silk the deck of polished mahogany the mast was gold gold gold plate maybe solid gold would have been so heavy as to overbalance the ship belatedly he looked at his rescuer and was amazed again she was a queen at least she looked like a queen she wore a platinum crownlet and a richly embroidered robe and she was beautiful not as lovely as wynne perhaps this woman was older with more poise precise dress and manner made up for the sheer voluptuous innocence of youth that wynne had the queens hair was the richest red he had ever seen and so were the pupils of her eyes it was hard to imagine what a woman like this would be doing boating in monsterinfested surf i am the sorceress iris she said uh bink he said awkwardly from the north village he had never met a sorceress before and hardly felt garbed for the occasion fortunate i happened by iris remarked you might have had difficulties the understatement of the year bink had been finished and she had given him back his life i was drowning i never saw you just a monster he said feeling inane how could he thank this royal creature for sullying her delicate hands on something like him you were hardly in a position to see anything she said straightening so that her excellent figure showed to advantage he had been mistaken she was in no way inferior to wynne just different and certainly more intelligent more on a par with sabrina the manifest mind of a woman he realized made a great deal of difference in her appeal lesson for the day there were sailors and servants aboard the yacht but they remained unobtrusively in the background and iris adjusted the sails herself no idle female she the yacht moved out to sea soon it bore upon an islandand what anisland it was lush vegetation grew all around it flowers of all colors and sizes polkadot daisies the size of dishes orchids of exquisite splendor tiger lilies that yawned and purred as the boat approached neat paths led from the golden pier up toward a palace of solid crystal which gleamed like a diamond in the sun like a diamond bink suspected it was a diamond from the way the light refracted through its myriad faces the largest most perfect diamond that ever was i guess i owe you my life bink said uncertain as to how to handle the situation it seemed ridiculous to offer to chop wood or pitch animal manure to earn his keep for the night there was nothing so crude as firewood or animal refuse on this fair island probably the best favor he could do her was to remove his soaking bedraggled presence as rapidly as possible i guess you do she agreed speaking with a surprising normality he had somehow expected her to be more aloof as befitted pseudoroyalty but my life may not be worth much i dont have any magic i am to be exiled from xanth she guided the yacht to the pier flinging a fine silver chain to its mooring post and tying it tight bink had thought his confession would disturb her he had made it at the outset so as not to proceed under false pretenses she might have mistaken him for someone of consequence but her reaction was a surprise bink im glad you said that it shows you are a fine honest lad most magic talents arent worthwhile anyway what use is it to make a pink spot appear on a wall it may be magic but it doesnt accomplish anything you with your strength and intelligence have more to offer than the great majority of citizens amazed and pleased by this gratuitous and probably unjustified praise bink could make no answer she was correct about the uselessness of spotonwall magic certainly he had often thought the same thing himself of course it was a standard remark of disparagement meaning that a given person had picayune magic so this really was not a sophisticated observation still it certainly made him feel at ease come iris said taking him by the hand she guided him across the gangplank to the pier then on along the main path to the palace the smell of flowers was almost overwhelming roses abounded in all colors exhaling their perfumes plants with swordshaped leaves were even more common their flowers were like simplified orchids also of all colors what are those he inquired irises of course she said he had to laugh of course too bad there was no flower named bink the path passed through a flowering hedge and looped around a pool and fountain to the elaborate front portico of the crystal palace not a true diamond after all come into my parlor the sorceress said smiling binks feet balked before the significance penetrated to his brain he had heard about spiders and flies had she saved his life merely to oh for gods sake she exclaimed are you superstitious nothing will hurt you his recalcitrance seemed foolish why should she revive him then betray him she could have let him choke to death instead of pumping the water out of him the meat would have been as fresh or she could have tied him up and had the sailors bring him ashore she had no need to deceive him he was already in her powerif that was the way it was still i see you distrust me iris said what can i do to reassure you this direct approach to the problem did not reassure him very much yet he had better face it or trust to fate youyou are a sorceress he said you seem to have everything you need iwhat do you want with me she laughed not to eat you i assure you but bink was unable to laugh some magicsome people do get eaten he suffered a vision of a monstrous spider luring him into its web once he entered the palace very well sit out there in the garden iris said or wherever you feel safe if i cant convince you of my sincerity you can take my boat and go fair enough it was too fair it made him feel like an ungrateful lout now it occurred to bink that the whole island was a trap he could not swim to the mainlandnot with the sea monsters thereand the yachts crew might grab him and tie him up if he tried to sail across well it wouldnt hurt to listen all right now bink she said persuasivelyand she was so lovely in her intensity that she was very persuasive indeed you know that though every citizen of xanth has magic that magic is severely limited some people have more magic than others but their talents still tend to he confined to one particular type or another even magicians obey this law of nature yes she was making sensebut what was the point the king of xanth is a magicianbut his power is limited to weather effects he can brew a dust devil or a tornado or a hurricane or make a drought or a tenday downpourbut he cant fly or transmute wood into silver or light a fire magically hes an atmospheric specialist yes bink agreed again he remembered donald the shades son who could make dust devils those evanescent swirls of dust the boy had an ordinary talent the king had a major oneyet they differed in degree not type of course the kings talent had faded with age perhaps all he could conjure now would be a dust devil it was a good thing the shield protected xanth so if you know a citizens talent you know his limitations iris continued if you see a man make a storm you dont have to worry about him forming a magical pit under you or changing you into a cockroach nobody has multiple fields of talent except maybe magician humfrey bink said he is a powerful magician she agreed but even he is restricted his talent is divination or information i dont believe he actually looks into the future just the present all his socalled hundred spells relate to that none of them are performance magic bink did not know enough about humfrey to refute that but it sounded correct he was impressed with how the sorceress kept up with the magic of her counterpart was there professional rivalry among those of strong magic yes talents run in schools but my talent is illusion she said smoothly this rose she plucked a handsome red one and held it under his nose what a sweet smell this rose in reality is the rose faded in her hand was a stalk of grass it even smelled grassy bink looked around chagrined all of this is illusion most of it i could show you the whole garden as it is but it would not be nearly as pretty the grass in her hand shimmered and became an iris flower this should convince you i am a powerful sorceress therefore i can make an entire region seem like something it is not and every detail will he authentic my roses smell like roses my apple pies taste like apple pies my body she paused with half a smile my body feels like a body all seems realbut it is illusion that is each thing has a basis in fact but my magic enhances it modifies it this is my complex of talents therefore i have no other talentand you can trust me to that extent bink was uncertain about that last point a sorceress of illusion was the last type of person to be trusted to any extent yet he comprehended her point now she had shown him her magic and it was unlikely that she would practice any other magic on him he had never thought of it this way before but it was certainly true that no one in xanth mixed types of magic talents unless she were an ogre using illusion to change her own appearance too no an ogre was a magical creature and magical creatures did not have magical talents probably their talents were their existence so centaurs dragons and ogres always seemed like what they were unless some natural person animal or plant changed them he had to believe that it was possible that iris was in collusion with an ogre but unlikely for ogres were notoriously impatient and tended to consume whatever they could get hold of regardless of the consequence iris herself would have been eaten by this time okay i trust you bink agreed dubiously good come into my palace and i will tend to all your needs that was unlikely no one could give him a magic talent of his own humfrey might discover his talent for himat the price of a years servicebut that would be merely revealing what was there not creating it he suffered himself to he led into the palace it was exquisite inside too rainbowhued beams of light dropped down from the prismatic roof formations and the crystal walls formed mirrors these might be illusionbut he saw his own reflection in them and he looked somehow healthier and more manly than he felt he was hardly bedraggled at all more illusion soft pretty pillows were piled in the comers in lieu of chairs or couches suddenly bink felt very tired he needed to lie down for a while but then the image of the skeleton in the pine forest returned to him he didnt know what to feel lets get you out of those wet clothes iris said solicitously uh ill dry bink said not wanting to expose his body before a woman do you think i want my cushions ruined she demanded with housewifely concern you were floundering in salt water youve got to rinse the salt off before you start itching go into the bathroom and change there is a dry uniform awaiting you a uniform awaiting him as though she had been expecting him what could that mean reluctantly bink went the bathroom was appropriately palatial the tub was like a small swimming pool and the commode was an elegant affair of the type the mundanes were said to employ he watched the water circle around the bowl and drain out into a pipe below disappearing as if by magic he was fascinated there was also a shower a spray of water like rain emerged from an elevated nozzle rinsing him off that was sort of fun though he was not sure he would want it as a regular thing there must be a big tank of water upstairs somewhere to provide the pressure for such devices he dried with a plush towel embroidered with images of irises the clothing was hung on a rack behind the door a princely robe and knickers knickers ah wellthey were dry and no one would see him here in the palace he donned the uniform and stepped into the ornate sandals awaiting him he strapped his hunting knife on concealing it beneath the overhang of the robe now he felt betterbut his cold was developing apace his sore throat had given way to a runny nose he had thought this was merely aggravation by the salt water he had taken in but now he was dry and it was apparent that his nose needed no external supply of fluid he didnt want to sniff overtly but he had no handkerchief are you hungry iris asked solicitously as he emerged i will fetch you a banquet bink certainly was hungry for he had eaten only sparingly from his pack since starting along the chasm depending on foraging along the way now his pack was soaked with salt water that would complicate future meals he lay half buried in cushions his nose tilted back so that it wouldnt dribble forward surreptitiously mopping it with the corner of a pillow when he had to he snoozed a bit while she puttered in the kitchen now that he knew this was all illusion he realized why she did so much menial work herself the sailors and gardeners were part of the illusion iris lived alone so she had to do her own cooking illusion might make for fine appearance texture and taste but it would not prevent her from starving why didnt iris marry or exchange her services for competent help much magic was useless for practical matters but her magic was extraordinary anyone could live in a crystal palace if he lived with this sorceress bink was sure many people would like that appearance was often more important than substance anyway and if she could make ordinary potatoes taste like a banquet and medicine taste like candyoh yes it was a marketable talent iris returned bearing a steaming platter she had changed into a housewifely apron and her crownlet was gone she looked less regal and a good deal more female she set things up on a low table and they sat crosslegged on cushions facing each other what would you like she inquired again bink felt nervous what are you serving whatever you like i meanreally she made a move if you must know boiled rice i have a hundredpound bag of the stuff i have to use up before the rats catch on to the illusory cat i have guarding it and chew into it i could make rat droppings taste like caviar of course but id rather not have to but you can have anything you wantanything at all she took a deep breath so it seemedand it occurred to bink that she was not restricting it to food no doubt she got pretty lonely here on her island and welcomed company the local farmers probably shunned hertheir wives would see to thatand monsters werent very sociable dragon steak he said with hot sauce the man is bold she murmured lifting the silver cover the rich aroma wafted out and there lay two broiled dragon steaks steeped in hot sauce she served one expertly onto binks plate and the other onto her own dubiously bink cut off a piece and put it to his mouth it was the finest dragon steak he had ever tastedwhich was not saying much since dragons were very difficult prey he had eaten it only twice before it was a truism that more people were eaten by dragons than dragons eaten by people and the saucehe had to grab for the glass of wine she had poured for him to quench the heat but it was a delicious burn converting to flavor still he doubted uhwould you mind she grimaced only for a moment she said the steak dissolved into dull boiled rice then back into dragon meat thanks bink said its still a bit hard to believe more wine uh is it intoxicating no unfortunately you could drink it all day and never feel it unless your own imagination made you dizzy glad to hear it he accepted the elegant glass of sparkling fluid as she refilled it and sipped he had gulped down the first too fast to taste it maybe it was actually water but it seemed to be perfect blue wine the kind specified for dragon meat fullbodied and delicately flavored much like the sorceress herself for dessert they had homebaked chocolatechip cookies slightly burned that last touch made it so realistic that he was hard put to it to preserve his disbelief she obviously knew something about cooking and baking even in illusion she cleared away the dishes and returned to join him on the cushions now she was in a lowcut evening gown and he saw in more than adequate detail exactly how wellformed she was of course that too could be illusionbut if it felt the same as it looked who would protest then his nose almost dripped onto the inviting gown and he jerked his head up he had been looking a mite too closely are you unhappy iris inquired sympathetically uh no my nose it have a handkerchief she said proffering a lovely lace affair bink hated to use such a work of art to honk his nose into but it was better than using the pillows uh is there any work i can do before i go he inquired uneasily you are thinking too small iris said leaning forward earnestly and inhaling deeply bink felt the flush rising along his neck sabrina seemed very far awayand she would never have dressed like this anyway i told youi have to go to the good magician humfrey to find my magic or be exiled i dont really think i have any magic so i could arrange for you to stay regardless she said nudging closer she was definitely making a play for him but why would such an intelligent talented woman be interested in a nobody like him bink mopped his nose again a nobody with a cold her appearance might be greatly enhanced by illusion but mind and talent were obviously genuine she should have no need of himfor anything you could perform magic that everyone would see she continued in that dismayingly persuasive way of hers nudging up against him she certainly felt realmost provocatively so i could fashion an illusion of performance that no one could penetrate he wished she hadnt said that while touching him so intimately i can do my magic from a distance too so there would be no way to tell i was involved but that is the least of it i can bring you wealth and power and comfortall genuine nonillusive i can give you beauty and love all that you might desire as a citizen of xanth bink grew more suspicious what was she leading up to i have a fiancйe even that iris agreed i am not a jealous woman you could have her as a concubine provided you were circumspect as a concubine bink exploded she was unshaken because you would be married to me bink stared at her aghast why should you want to marry a man with no magic so i could be queen of xanth she said evenly queen of xanth youd have to marry the king precisely but one of the quaint archaic laws and customs of xanth is that the nominal ruler must be male thus some perfectly capable magical females have been eliminated from consideration now the present king is old senile and without heir it is time for a queen but first there must be a new king that king could be you me i have no knowledge of governing yes you would naturally leave the dull details of government to me now at last it was coming clear iris wanted power all she needed was a suitable figurehead to get herself installed one sufficiently talentless and naive to be readily managed so he would never get delusions of actually being king if he cooperated with her he would be dependent on her but it was a fair offer it provided a viable alternative to exile regardless of the state of his own magic this was the first time he had seen his magic infirmity as a potential asset iris did not want an independent man or legitimate citizen she would have no lasting hold on that kind of person she needed a magic cripple like himbecause without her he would be nothing not even a citizen that diminished the romantic aspect considerably reality always did seem to be less enticing than illusion yet his alternative was to plunge back into the wilderness on a mission he suspected was futile his luck was already considerably overextended his chances of even making it as far as the castle of the magician humfrey were not ideal since he now had to trek through the fringe of the central wilderness he would be a fool not to accept the offer of the sorceress iris was watching him intently as he looked back at her her gown flickered becoming transparent illusion or not it was a breathtaking sight and what difference did it make if the flesh only seemed real he had no doubt now of what she was offering on the immediate personal level she would be glad to prove how good she could make it as she had with the meal because she needed his willing cooperation really it made sense he could have citizenship and sabrina since obviously the sorceress queen would never betray that aspect sabrina how would she feel about the arrangement he knew she would not buy it not for anything not for an instant sabrina was very straitlaced about certain things very proper in the forms no he said aloud iriss gown snapped opaque no suddenly she sounded like wynne when he had told that idiot gift she could not accompany him i dont want to be king now iriss voice was controlled soft you dont think i can do it i rather think you can but its not my sort of thing what is your sort of thing bink i just want to be on my way you want to be on your way she repeated with great control why my fiancйe wouldnt like it if i she wouldnt like it iris was working up a substantial head of steam like the gap dragon what does she offer you that i cannot better a hundredfold well selfrespect for one thing bink said she wants me for myself not to use me nonsense all women are the same inside they differ only in appearance and talent they all use men maybe so im sure you know more about that sort of thing than i do but i have to be going now iris reached out a soft hand to restrain him her gown disappeared entirely why not stay the night see what i can do for you if you still want to go in the morning bink shook his head im sure you could convince me overnight so i have to go now such candor she exclaimed ruefully i could give you an experience like none you have imagined in her artful nudity she already stimulated his imagination far more than was comfortable but he steeled himself you could never give me back my integrity you idiot she screamed with a startling shift of attitude i should have left you to the sea monsters they were illusions too he said you set up the whole thing to make me beholden to you the illusion beach the illusion threat all that was your leather strap that wrapped around my ankle my rescue was no coincidence because i never was in danger you are in danger now she gritted her lovely bare torso became covered by the military dress of an amazon bink shrugged and stood up he blew his nose goodbye sorceress she studied him appraisingly i underestimated your intelligence bink im sure i can improve my offer if you will only let me know what you want i want to see the good magician now her rage burst out anew ill destroy you bink walked away from her the crystal ceiling of the palace cracked fragments of glass broke off and dropped toward him bink ignored them knowing they were unreal he kept walking he was quite nervous but was determined not to show it there was a loud ominous crunching sound as of stone collapsing he forced himself not to look up the walls shattered and fell inward the remaining mass of the roof tumbled down the noise was deafening bink was buried in rubbleand pushed on through it feeling nothing despite the choking smell of dust and plaster and the continued rumble of shifting debris the palace was not really collapsing iris was a marvelous mistress of illusion though sight sound smell tasteeverything but touch because there had to be something to touch before she could convert it to feel like something else thus there was no solidity to this collapse he banged face first into a wall jarred more than physically he rubbed his cheek and squinted it was a wooden panel with flaking paint the real wall of the real house the illusion had concealed it but now reality was emerging doubtless she could have made it feel like gold or crystal or even like slimy slugs but the illusion was breaking down he could find his way out bink felt his way along the wall tuning out the terrifying sights and sounds of the collapse hoping she did not change the feel of the wall so that he would be deceived by that and led astray suppose it became a row of mousetraps or thistles forcing his hand away he found the door and pulled it invisibly open he had made it he turned and for a moment looked back there was iris standing in the splendor of her female fury she was a middleaged woman running slightly to fat wearing a worn housecoat and sloppy hair net she had the physical qualities she had shown him via her peekaboo outfit but they were much less seductive at age forty than at the illusion of age twenty he stepped outside lightning flared and thunder cracked making him jump but he reminded himself that iris was mistress of illusion not weather and walked out into it rain pelted him and hailstones he felt the cold splats of water on his skin and the stones stungbut they had no substance and he was neither wet nor bruised after the initial sensation iriss magic was in its prime but there were limits to illusion and his own disbelief in what he saw tended to reduce the impact suddenly there was the bellow of a dragon bink jumped again a firebelching winged beast was bearing down on him not a mere steamer like the gap dragon but a genuine flamer seemingly genuine was it real or illusion surely the latterbut he could not take the chance he dived for cover the dragon swooped low passing him he felt the wash of air from its motion the blast of heat he still didnt know for sure but he might be able to tell from its action real firebelchers were very stupid as dragons went because the heat shriveled their own brains if this one reacted intelligently it looped about almost immediately coming at him for a second run bink made a feint to the right then scooted left the dragon was not fooled it zeroed right in on him that was the intellect of the sorceress not the animal binks heart was thudding but he forced himself to stand upright and still facing the menace as it came he lifted one finger in an obscene gesture at it the dragon opened its jaws blowing out a tremendous cloud of fire and smoke that enveloped bink singeing the hair of his bodyand leaving him untouched he had gambled and won he had been almost certain but his body still trembled in reaction for none of his senses had doubted the illusion only his brain had defended him preventing him from being reduced to quivering acquiescence to the will of the sorceress or from being herded into some genuine hazard illusions could killif one heeded them bink moved out again with more confidence if there were a real dragon in the vicinity there would have been no need for an illusory one therefore all dragons here were illusion he stumbled illusion could hurt him another way thoughby covering up dangerous breaks in the terrain forcing him to misstep or fall or drop into a well he would have to watch his stepliterally as he concentrated on the region near his feet he was able to penetrate the illusion with greater facility iriss talent was phenomenal but in covering the entire island it was necessarily thinly spread his will could oppose hers in a localized area while her attention was distracted behind the facade of the flower gardens was the weedy wilderness of the island the palace was a rickety shack first cousin to the farmhouses he had met along the way why build a good house when illusion could do it so much easier his borrowed clothing too had changed now he wore a crude feminine shawl andhe verified with dismaypanties lacy silk girlstyle panties his fancy handkerchief was exactly what it appeared to be apparently the sorceress did indulge herself in some reality and lace hankies were what she could afford and panties he hesitated should he go back for his own clothing he didnt want to encounter iris again but to travel in the wilderness or meet people in this outfit he had a vision of walking up to the good magician humfrey to ask for his boon of information bink sir i have come across xanth at great peril to ask magician for a new dress a bra ho ho ho bink sighed feeling his face redden again he turned back iris spotted him as soon as he reentered the shack a flicker of hope lighted her faceand that briefly honest expression had more compulsion than all her illusion human values moved bink he felt like the supreme heel you changed your mind she asked suddenly her voluptuous youth was back and a section of the glittering palace formed around her that dashed it she was a creature of artifice and he preferred realityeven the reality of a shack among weeds most of the farmers of xanth had nothing better after all when illusion became an essential crutch to life that life lost value just want my own clothes bink said though his decision was firm he still felt like a heel for interfering with her splendid aspirations he proceeded to the bathroomwhich he now saw was an attached outhouse the fabulous toilet was merely the usual board with a hole sawed in it and flies buzzed merrily below it the bathtub was a converted horsewatering trough how had he taken a shower he saw a bucket had he dumped water on his own head not knowing it his clothing and pack were in a pile on the floor he started to changebut found that the facility was really only an opening in the back wall of the shack iris stood watching him had she watched him change before if so he had to take it as a compliment her approach had become much more direct and physical thereafter his eye fell on the bucket again someone had dumped water on him and he was sure now that he had not done it himself the only other person who could have done it ouch but he was not about to display himself so freely to her again though it was obvious that he had no physical secrets remaining he picked up his things and headed for the door bink he paused the rest of the house was dull wood with flaking paint straw on the floor and light showing through the cracks but the sorceress herself was lovely she wore very little and she looked a lush eighteen what do you want in a woman she asked him voluptuousness she became extremely well endowed with an exaggerated hourglass figure youth suddenly she looked fourteen very slender lineless and innocent maturity she was herself again but better dressed competence now she was conservatively dressed about twentyfive quite shapely but of a businesslike mien violence the amazon again robust but still lovely i dont know bink said id really hate to choose sometimes i want one thing sometimes another it can all be yours she said the alluring fourteenyearold reappeared no other woman can make this promise bink was suddenly forcefully tempted there were times when he wanted this though he had never dared admit it openly the sorceresss magic was potent indeedthe strongest he had ever experienced so it was illusionyet in xanth illusion abounded and was quite legitimate it was never possible to know precisely what was real in fact illusion was part of xanth reality an important part iris really could bring him wealth and power and citizenship and she could be for him any kind of woman he wanted or all kinds furthermore through her illusions applied politically she could in time create an identical reality she could build an actual crystal palace with all the trappings the powers of the queenship would make this possible in that light it was reality she offered with her magic simply a means to that end but what was actually in her scheming mind the reality of her inner thoughts might not be sweet at all he could never be sure he understood her completely and therefore could never trust her completely he was not at all sure she would make a good queen she was too interested in the trappings of power instead of the welfare of the land of xanth as a whole im sorry he said and turned away she let him go no more palace no more storm she had accepted his decisionand that perversely tempted him again he could not call her evil she was merely a woman with a need and she had offered a deal and was mature enough to accede to necessity once her temper cooled but he forced himself to keep going trusting his logic more than his meandering feeling he picked his way down to the sagging wharf where the rowboat was tied the craft looked insecure but it had brought him here so it could take him away he got into itand stepped into a puddle the boat leaked he grabbed a rusty pail and bailed it out somewhat then sat and took the oars iris must have performed quite a maneuver to row this boat while seeming to be an idle queen she had a lot of plain oldfashioned practical talent to supplement her magic she probably could make a good ruler of xanthif she ever found a man who would go along with her why hadnt he cooperated as he rowed he considered the matter more carefully looking back at the isle of illusion his superficial reasons were sufficient for the moment but not for an enduring decision he must have some underlying rationale to which he was true even though he gave himself some morepresentable justification it could not just be his memory of sabrina evocative as that was for iris was as much of a woman as sabrina and much more magical there had to be something else diffuse but immenseah he had it it was his love of xanth he could not allow himself to become the instrument of his homelands corruption though the present king was ineffective and many problems were developing still bink was loyal to the established order the days of anarchy or of brute might making right were over there were set procedures for the transfer of authority and these had to be honored bink would do anything to stay in xanth except to betray it the ocean was calm the devastating rocks of the shore had also been illusion there was after all a small beachbut it was not where it had seemed to be either when he thought he ran along it or after he was in the brine a long narrow pier angled out from the side of the chasm that was what he had run along at the beginning until he had simply run off the end splashing abruptly into deep water in more than one sense he beached his boat on the south shore nowhow was he to return the boat to the sorceress no way if she didnt have another boat she would simply have to swim for it he regretted that but he was not going back to that isle of illusion again with her powers she could probably scare away any sea creatures that threatened and he was sure she was an adequate swimmer he changed into his original clothes salty though they might be shrugged into his knapsack and turned his face to the west chapter spring the landscape south of the chasm was rougher than that to the north it was not hilly but mountainous the tallest peaks were enchanted with white snow the narrow passes were choked with almost impenetrable growth forcing bink to detour again and again ordinary nettles and itch bushes would have been bad but there was no telling what magic these strange plants had a lone tangle tree was well worth avoiding and there were whole groves of related species he could not risk it so whenever an aspect of the jungle balked him bink turned back and tried again farther along he avoided the most obvious paths also they were suspect thus he tramped through intermediate vegetationthe borderline between jungle and field often in the roughest terrain of all barren burning rock faces steep rocky slopes high windswept plateaus what even magic plants disdained was hardly worth any persons troubleexcept for the traveler who wanted to stay out of trouble one cleared area turned out to be the landing strip for a very large flying dragon no wonder there were no other predators in that region binks progress was so slow that he knew it would take him many days to reach the good magicians castle he fashioned himself a burrow in the ground with a pile of stones for a windshield and dead brush for a blanket and slept uncomfortably he wondered now why he hadnt at least accepted the sorceresss offer to stay the night it would surely have been much more comfortable than this no he knew why he had to go he might never have left the island after that night not as his own man and if he had sabrina would never have forgiven him the very fact that such a night tempted him in retrospect and not merely for the comfort of sleep meant that it was not a night he could have afforded he reminded himself of that several times before he shivered himself to sleep then he dreamed of a diamondcrystal palace woke with mixed emotions and had to shiver his way to sleep again turning down temptation certainly wasnt much pleasure when alone on the open trail tomorrow he would search diligently for a blanket tree and some hotsoup gourds on the third morning of his southchasm leg he trekked along a ridge his only feasible route westward he had cut himself a new staff after several tries the first saplings he went for magicked him off by using aversion spells of assorted types he had no doubt there were many suitable trees he never saw at all because of their passive do not notice me spells one used a physical repulsion charm directed at cutting objects every time he slashed at it his knife veered away about an hour on the way with his new staff he was still pondering the natural selectivity of magic the plants with the most effective spells survived best so became more common but how many times did stray travelers come by here with knives then he realized that he might make good use of that repulsion spell if he succeeded in cutting a staff from such a tree would it repel all attacks against him obviously this magic was for defense against the depredations of dragons beavers and such not actual knives and he would certainly feel safer with an antidragon staff no cutting the tree would kill it and its magic would abate but maybe a seed from it no sense consuming time going back he should be able to locate another such tree all he had to do was attempt to cut a new staff and note which tree repulsed his knife he might be able to dig up a small one and take it entire keeping it alive and effective he moved down the side of the ridge testing trees this proved to be more hazardous than anticipated the knifes approach toward their tender bark brought out the worst in them one dropped hard fruit on him barely missing his head another exhaled sleep perfume that almost stopped his journey right there but no cuttingaversion spells now one large tree had a dryad an inhabiting wood nymph who looked very fetching about like iris at fourteen but who cursed bink roundly in most unladylike language if you want to carve defenseless things go carve your own kind she screamed go carve the wounded soldier in the ditch you son of a fortunately she balked at completing the rhyme dryads were not supposed to know such language wounded soldier bink located the ditch and explored it carefully sure enough there lay a man in military apparel blood crusted on his back groaning piteously peace bink said i will help you if you permit xanth had once needed a real army but now the soldiers were mostly messengers for the king still their costumes and pride remained help me the man exclaimed weakly i will reward yousomehow now bink felt it safe to approach the soldier was severely wounded and had lost much blood he was burning with the fever of infection i cant do anything for you myself im no doctor and if i even move you you may expire i will return with medication bink said i must borrow your sword if the soldier gave up his sword he was really sick return soon or not at all the man gasped raising the hilt bink took the heavy weapon and climbed out of the ditch he approached the tree of the dryad i need magic he told her blood restoration wound healing fever abatementthat sort of thing tell me where i can get them quickly or i will chop your tree down you wouldnt she cried horrified bink hefted the sword menacingly at this moment he reminded himself of jama the village sword conjurer the image disgusted him ill tell ill tell she screamed okay tell he was relieved he doubted that he could actually have made himself chop down her tree that would have killed her and to no real purpose dryads were harmless creatures pretty to look at there was no point in molesting them or their cherished tree homes three miles to the west the spring of life its water will cure anything bink hesitated there is something youre not telling me he said hefting the sword again whats the catch i may not reveal it she cried anyone who tellsthe curse bink made as if to chop at the trunk of the tree the dryad screamed with such utter misery that he abated the effort he had fought to protect justin tree back at home he could not ravage this one all right ill risk the curse he said he set off westward he found a path leading his way it was not an inviting one merely an animal run so he felt justified in using it with caution it seemed others knew the route to the spring yet as he approached he became increasingly nervous what was the catch and what was the curse he really ought to know before he either risked himself or gave the water to the ailing soldier xanth was the land of magic but magic had its rules and its qualifications it was dangerous to play with magic unless the precise nature of the spell was understood if this water really could heal the soldier it was a most strongly enchanted spring for that sort of aid there had to be a price he found the spring it was in a depression under a giant spreading acorn tree the trees health augured well for the water it could hardly be poisoned but there could be some other menace associated with it suppose a river monster were hiding in it using the water as a lure for the unwary injured or dying creatures would be easy prey a false reputation for healing would attract them from many miles around bink didnt have time to wait and watch he had to help the soldier now or it would be too late so this was a risk he simply had to take he moved cautiously to the spring it looked cool and clear he dipped his canteen into it keeping his other hand on the sword but nothing happened no grim tentacle rose from the depths to challenge him viewing the filled canteen he had another thought even if the water were not poisoned it was not necessarily curative what use to take it to the soldier if it wouldnt do the job there was one way to find out he was thirsty anyway bink put the canteen to his mouth and sipped the water was chill and good he drank more deeply and found it supremely refreshing it certainly wasnt poisoned he dipped the canteen again and watched the bubbles rise they distorted the view of his left hand under the water making it seem as if he had all his fingers he did not think much about the digit he had lost in childhood but such a view of a supposedly complete hand teased him unpleasantly he lifted out the canteenand almost dropped it his finger was whole it really was the childhood injury had been eliminated he flexed it and touched it amazed he pinched it and it hurt no question his finger was real the spring really was magic if it could heal a fifteenyearold amputation so cleanly and painlessly and instantly it could heal anything how about a cold bink sniffedand discovered that his nose was clear it had cured his sniffles too no question about it he could recommend this spring of life a true description for a potent magic if this spring were a person it would be a full magician again binks natural caution came into play he still did not know the nature of the catch or of the curse why could no one tell the secret of this spring what was the secret obviously not the fact of its healing properties the dryad had told him that and he could tell it to others the curse could not be a river monster for none had struck now that bink was whole and well he would be much better able to defend himself scratch one theory but this did not mean there was no danger it merely meant the threat was more subtle than he had thought a subtle danger was the worst of all the man who fled from the obvious menace of a flaming dragon could succumb to the hidden menace of the peace spell of the pines the soldier was dying moments were precious yet bink delayed he had to ferret this out lest he put both the soldier and himself in greater peril than before it was said that a person should not look a gift unicorn in the mouth lest it prove to be enchanted but bink always looked he kneeled before the spring and stared deep into it looking it in the mouth as it were o spring of life he murmured i come on a mission of mercy seeking no profit for myself though i have indeed benefited i conjure you to reveal your rationale lest i inadvertently trespass he had little confidence in this formal invocation since he had no magic with which to enforce it but it was all he could think of he just couldnt accept such a wonderful gift without trying to ascertain the payment to be exacted there was always a price something swirled deep in the spring bink felt the potent magic of it it was as if he peered through a hole into another world oh yes this spring had its own consciousness and pride the field of its animus rose up to encompass him and his consciousness plunged through the depths bringing comprehension who imbibes of me may not act against my interest on pain of forfeiture of all that i bring him uhoh this was a selfpreservation spell plain and simple but enormously complicated in its execution who defined what was or was not contrary to the interests of the spring who but the spring itself there would obviously be no lumbering in this region for cutting trees could damage the environment and change the climate affecting rainfall no mining for that could lower the water table and pollute the spring even the prohibition against revealing the rationale made sense for people with minor injuries and complaints might not use the magic water if they knew the price in advance the loggers and miners certainly wouldnt but any action had extending if diminishing consequences like the ripples of a stone dropped in a pool in time such ripples could cover the whole ocean or the whole of xanth in this case suppose the spring decided that its interest was threatened indirectly by some action of the distant king of xanth such as levying a tax on lumber that caused the lumbermen to cut more wood in order to pay it would the spring force all its users to oppose the king perhaps assassinating him a person who owed his life to the spring might very well do it it was theoretically possible for this magic spring to change the whole society of xanth even to become its de facto ruler but the interests of one isolated spring were not necessarily the interests of the human society probably the magic of the spring could not extend to such extremes for it would have to be as strong as the massed powers of all the other entities of xanth but slowly given time it would have its effect which made this an ethical question i cannot accept your covenant bink said into the deep swirl i hold no animosity toward you but i cannot pledge to act only in your interest the interest of the whole of xanth is paramount take back your benefits i go my own way now there was anger in the spring the unfathomable depths of it roiled the field of magic rose up again enveloping him he would suffer the consequence of his temerity but it faded like a dissipating storm leaving him whole his finger remained healed and his cold was still cured he had called the springs bluff and won or had he maybe his benefits would not be revoked until he acted specifically against the interest of the spring well his benefits were minor he could afford the penalty he certainly would not be deterred from doing what he felt was right by fear of that consequence bink stood keeping the sword in his hand as he slung the strap of the canteen over his shoulder he turned a chimera was crawling toward him bink whipped his sword around though he was hardly expert in its use chimeras were dangerous but in a moment he saw that the creature was in dire straits the tongue was bonging out of its lions head its goats head was unconscious and the snakes head at the end of the tail was dragging on the ground the creature was scraping along on its stomach toward the spring trailing blood bink stood aside and let it pass he held no malice even for a chimera in this state he had never before seen a living creature suffering like this except the soldier the chimera reached the water and plunged its lion head in drinking desperately the change was immediate the goats head snapped erect and awake swiveling from its neck in the middle of the back to glare at bink the snake head hissed no doubt about it the chimera was healthy again but now it was dangerous for this class of monster hated all things human it took a step toward bink who held his sword tightly before him with both hands knowing that flight would be futile if he wounded it he might escape before it dragged itself back to the spring for a second restoration but abruptly the thing turned away without attacking bink sighed with relief he had put up a front but the last thing he wanted to do was to engage in combat with such a monster in the presence of an unfriendly spring there must be a general truce in this vicinity bink realized it was contrary to the interest of the spring to have predators lurk here so no hunting or fighting was permitted lucky for him he scrambled up the slope and headed east he hoped the soldier had survived the soldier had he was tough as soldiers tended to be he refused to gasp out his last until nature ripped it from him bink dribbled some magic water into his mouth then poured some over the wound suddenly the man was well what did you do he cried it is as if i never got stabbed in the back they walked up the hill together i fetched water from a magic spring bink explained he paused at the dryads tree this accommodating nymph very kindly directed me to it why thank you nymph the soldier said any favor i can do in return just move on she said tightly eyeing the sword in binks hands they moved on you cant act contrary to the interest of that spring bink said or tell anyone about the price you paid for its help if you do youll be right back where you started i figured the price was worth it for you ill say i was doing patrol duty guarding a patch of the kings eyeball ferns when somebodyhey one drink of this elixir and the kings eyes would be perfect without those ferns wouldnt they i should take he broke off i can show you where the spring is bink offered anybody can use it as far as i know no its not that i just suddenly got the feelingi dont think the king ought to have this water this simple comment had a profound impact on bink did it confirm his reasoning that the springs influence extended widely and selfishly revived health of the king might not be in the interest of the spring so but on the other hand if the king were cured by spring water then the king himself would serve the springs interest why should the spring object to that also why had bink himself not suffered the loss of his finger and restoration of his cold when he told the secret to the soldier he had defied the spring yet paid no penalty was the curse a mere bluff the soldier extended his hand im crombie corporal crombie you saved my life how can i repay you oh i just did what was right bink said i couldnt just let you die im on my way to the magician humfrey to see if i have any magic talent crombie put his hand to his beard pondering he was rather handsome in that pose i can tell you the direction he closed his eyes put out his right hand and slowly rotated when his pointing finger stabilized he opened his eyes magicians that way thats my talent direction i can tell you where anything is i already know the direction bink said west my main problem is getting through all this jungle theres so much hostile magic you said it crombie agreed heartily almost as much hostile magic as there is in civilized regions the raiders must have magicked me here figuring id never get out alive and my body would never be found my shade couldnt avenge me in the deep jungle oh i dont know about that bink said thinking of the shade donald in the chasm but now ive recovered thanks to you tell you what ill be your bodyguard until you reach the magician is that a fair return you really dont need to oh but i do soldiers honor you did me a good turn ill do you a good turn i insist i can help a lot ill show you he closed his eyes again extended his hand and rotated when he stopped he continued thats the direction of the greatest threat to your welfare want to verify it no bink said well i do danger never went away by being ignored you have to go out and conquer it give me back my sword bink gave it back and crombie proceeded in the direction he had pointed north bink followed disgruntled he did not want to seek out danger but he knew it was not right to let the soldier walk into it in his stead maybe it was something obvious like the gap dragon but that was no immediate threat so long as bink stayed out of the chasm he fully intended to stay out when crombie found himself balked by thick brush he simply slashed it away with his sword bink noticed that some of the vegetation gave way before the blade actually struck if providing a path was the best route to survival these plants took it but suppose the soldier hacked into a tangle tree that could be the danger he had pointed out noa tangler was deadly to the unwary but it did not move from the place it had rooted since bink had been going west not north no stationary thing was much of a threat to him unless it was west there was a scream bink jumped and crombie held his sword at the ready but it was only a woman cringing and frightened speak girl crombie roared flourishing his wicked blade what mischief do you intend dont hurt me she cried i am only dee lost and alone i thought you came to rescue me you lie crombie exclaimed you mean harm to this man my friend who saved my life confess and he lifted his sword again for gods sake let her be bink yelled you made a mistake shes obviously harmless my talents never been wrong before crombie said this is where it pointed your greatest threat maybe the threat is behind her beyond bink said she was merely in the line of sight crombie paused could be i never thought of that he was evidently a reasonable man under the violence wait ill verify the soldier withdrew somewhat stationing himself to the east of the girl he shut his eyes and rotated his pointing finger came to bear squarely on dee the girl burst into tears i mean you no harmi swear it dont hurt me she was a plain girl of strictly average face and figure no beauty this was in contrast to the several females bink had encountered recently yet there was something vaguely familiar about her and bink was always unnerved by feminine distress maybe its not physical danger he said does your talent differentiate no it doesnt crombie admitted a bit defensively it can be any kind of threat and she may not actually mean you harmbut sure as hell theres something bink studied the girl whose sniffles were drying up that familiaritywhere had he seen her before she was not from the north village and he really had not encountered many girls elsewhere somewhere on his current journey slowly the notion dawned on him a sorceress of illusion did not have to make herself beautiful if she wanted to keep track of him she could adopt a completely different appearance thinking he would never suspect yet the illusion would be easiest to maintain if it corresponded somewhat to her natural contours take off a few pounds here and there modify the voice could be if he fell for the ruse he could be in dire danger of being led into corruption only the soldiers special magic gave it away but how could he be sure even if dee represented some critical threat to him he had to be sure he had identified the right danger a man who stepped around a venom mouse could be overlooking a harpy on the other side snap judgments about magic were suspect a brilliant notion came to him dee you must be thirsty he said have a drink of water and he proffered his canteen oh thank you she said taking it gladly the water cured all ills an enchantment was an ill wasnt it so if she drank it might show herat least momentarilyin her true guise then he would know dee drank deeply there was no change oh this is very good she said i feel so much better the two men exchanged glances scratch one bright notion either dee was not iris or the sorceress had better control than he had supposed he had no way of knowing now be on your way girl crombie said curtly i am going to see the magician humfrey she said contritely i need a spell to make me well again bink and crombie exchanged glances dee had drunk the magic water she was well therefore she had no need to see the good magician on that score she had to be lying and if she were lying what was she concealing from them she must have picked this particular destination because she knew bink was going there yet this was still conjecture it could be pure coincidenceor she could be an ogre in female forma healthy ogrewaiting for the expedient moment to strike crombie seeing binks indecision made a decision of his own if you let her go with you then im coming too with my hand ever on my sword watching herall the time maybe thats best bink agreed reluctantly i bear you no malice dee protested i would do nothing to hurt you even were i able why dont you believe me bink found it too complicated to explain you can travel with us if you want to he said dee smiled gratefully but crombie shook his head grimly and fingered the hilt of his sword crombie remained suspicious but bink soon discovered he enjoyed dees company she had no trace of the personality of the sorceress she was such an average girl that he identified with her to a considerable extent she seemed to have no magic at least she evaded that subject perhaps she was going to the magician in the hope of finding her talent maybe that was what she had meant by needing a spell to make her well who was in good shape in xanth without magic however if she were the sorceress iris her ruse would quickly be exposed by the divination of the magician so the truth wound be known they stopped at the spring of life to refill their canteen traveled half a day then got caught by a technicolor hailstorm it was magic of course or magicaugmented the colors gave it away which meant that there would not be any great melting or runoff all they had to do was take shelter from it until it passed but they happened to be on a barren ridge no trees for miles around no caves no houses the land went up and down cut away by erosion gullies strewn with boundersbut there was nothing to shield them effectively from the storm pelted by increasingly large hailstones the three scurried in the direction crombies magic pointed the route to safe shelter it came into view behind a bounder a monstrously spreading tentacular tree thats a tangler bink exclaimed in horror we cant go there crombie was brought up short peering through the hail so it is my talent never pointed wrong before except when it accused dee bink thought he wondered just how reliable the soldiers magic really was for one thing why hadnt it pointed out the soldiers danger to himself before he got stabbed in the back and left to die but bink did not say that out loud there were often complexities and confusion in magic and he was sure crombie meant well theres a hephalumph there dee cried half eaten sure enough the huge carcass lay near the trunk orifice of the tree its posterior was gone but the front end was untouched the tree had evidently caught it and consumed as much as it couldbut a hephalumph was so big that even a tangle tree could not polish it off in one meal now the tree was sated its tentacles dangling listlessly so its safe after all bink said wincing as an eggsized red hailstone just missed his head the hail was puffy and light but it still could hurt it will be hours before the tree revives enough to become aggressive maybe even days and even then itll start on the lumph first still crombie balked understandably could be an illusion that carcass he warned be suspicious of all things thats the soldiers motto a trap to make us think the trees docile how do you think it tempted the hephalumph in there telling point periodic hailstorms on the ridge to drive prey to cover and seemingly ideal cover waitingbeautiful system but well be knocked silly by hail if we dont get to cover soon bink said ill go dee said before bink could protest she plunged into the territory of the tree the tentacles quivered twitching toward herbut lacked the imperative to make a real effort she dashed up and kicked the hephalumph in the trunkand it was solid no mirage she cried come on in unless shes a shill crombie muttered i tell you shes a threat to you bink if she shilled for the tangler she could trick dozens of people into its clutches the man was paranoid perhaps this was another useful quality for soldiersthough again it didnt seem to have kept him out of trouble before i dont believe it bink said but i do believe this hailstorm im going in and he went he passed the outer fringe of tentacles nervously but they remained quiescent a hungry tangler was not a subtle plant it normally grabbed the moment its prey was grabable finally crombie followed the tree shuddered slightly as if irritated by its inability to consume them and that was all well i knew my talent told the truth it always does he said somewhat weakly it was actually very nice here the hailstones had grown to the size of clenched fists but they bounced off the trees upper foliage and piled up in a circle around it caught by a slight depression predator trees tended to sit in such depressions formed by the action of their tentacles while cleaning brush and rocks out of the way in order to have an attractive lawn for passing creatures the refuse was tossed beyond in a great circle so that in the course of years the land surface rose the tangle was a highly successful type of tree and some of them formed wells whose rims were fashioned from buried bones of past prey they had been cleaned out near the north village but all children were instructed in this menace theoretically a man pursued by a dragon could skirt a tangler leading the dragon within range of the tentacles if he had both courage and skill within the shielded area there was a fine greensward rising in soft hillocks rather like the torso of a woman sweet perfume odors wafted through and the air was pleasantly warm in short this was a seemingly ideal place to seek shelterand that was by design it had certainly fooled the hephalumph obviously this was a good location for the tangler had grown to enormous girth but right now they were here rentfree well my magic was right all the time crombie said i should have trusted it but by the same token he glanced meaningfully at dee bink wondered about that he believed in the soldiers sincerity and the location magic was obviously functional had it malfunctioned in dees case or was she really a bad if obscure threat if so what kind he could not believe she meant him harm he had suspected her of being iris the sorceress but now he didnt believe that she showed no sign of the temperament of the mistress of illusion and personality was not something that magic could conceal for very long why didnt your magic warn you of the stab in the back bink asked the soldier making another attempt to ascertain what was reliable and what was not i didnt ask it crombie said i was a damned fool but once i see you safely to your magician ill sure as hell ask it who stabbed me and then he fingered the blade of his sword meaningfully a fair answer the talent was not a warning signal it merely performed on demand crombie had obviously had no reason to suspect danger any more than bink had reason to feel threatened now where was the distinction between natural caution and paranoia the storm continued none of them were willing to sleep because they did not trust the tree to that extent so they sat and talked crombie told a tough story of ancient battle and heroism in the days of xanths fourth wave bink was no military man but he found himself caught up in the gallantry of it and almost wished he had lived in those adventurous times when men of no magic were considered men by the end of that story the storm had eased off but the hail was piled so high that it didnt seem worthwhile to go out yet usually the meltoff from a magic storm was quite rapid once the sun came out again so it was worth waiting for where do you live bink asked dee oh im just a country girl you know she said no one else was going to travel through the wilderness thats no answer crombie snapped suspiciously she shrugged its the only answer i have i cant change what i am much as i might like to its the same answer i have too bink said im just a villager nothing special i hope the magician will be able to make me into something special by finding out that i have some good magic talent no one ever suspected and im willing to work for him for a year for that yes she said smiling appreciatively at him suddenly he felt himself liking her she was ordinarylike him she was motivatedlike him they had something in common youre going for magic so your girl back home will marry you crombie asked sounding cynical yes bink agreed remembering sabrina with sudden poignancy dee turned away and so i can stay in xanth youre a fool a civilian fool the soldier said kindly well its the only chance i have bink replied any gamble is worthwhile when the alternative i dont mean the magic thats useful and staying in xanth makes sense i mean marriage marriage women are the curse of mankind crombie said vehemently they trap men into marriage the way this tangle tree traps prey and they torment them the rest of their lives now thats unfair dee said didnt you have a mother she drove my worthy father to drink and loco crombie asserted made his life hell on earthand mine too she could read our minds that was her talent a woman who could read mens minds hell indeed for a man if any woman had been able to read binks mindugh must have been hell for her too dee observed bink suppressed a smile but crombie scowled i ran off and joined the army two years before i was of age never regretted it dee frowned you dont sound like gods gift to women either we can all be thankful you never touched any oh i touch them crombie said with a coarse laugh i just dont marry them no one of thems going to get her hooks into me youre disgusting she snapped im smart and if binks smart hell not let you start tempting him either i wasnt she exclaimed angrily crombie turned away in evident repugnance ah youre all the same why do i waste my time talking with the likes of you might as well argue ethics with the devil well if you feel that way ill go dee said she jumped to her feet and stalked to the edge bink thought she was bluffing for the storm though abating was still in force with occasional flurries colored hailstones were mounded up two feet high and the sun was not yet out but dee plunged out into it hey wait bink cried he ran after her dee had disappeared hidden by the storm let her go good riddance crombie said she had designs on you i know how they work i knew she was trouble from the start bink put his arms up over his head and face against the hail and stepped out his feet slid out from under skidding on hailstones and he fell headlong into the pile hailstones closed in over his head now he knew what had happened to dee she was buried somewhere out here he had to close his eyes for powder from crushed stones was getting into them this was not tree ice but coalesced vapor magic the stones were dry and not really cold but they were slippery something caught his foot bink kicked violently remembering the sea monster near the island of the sorceress forgetting that it had been an illusion and that there could hardly be a sea monster here but its grip was tight it dragged him into an enclosure he scrambled to his feet as it let go he leaped on the troll shape he saw through the film of dust bink found himself flying through the air he landed hard on his back the creature drawing on his arm trolls were tough he squirmed around and tried to grab its legs but the thing dropped on top of him and pinned him firmly to the ground ease up bink it said its mecrombie bink did as much of a doubletake as he was able to considering his position and recognized the soldier crombie let him up i knew youd never find your way out of that mess so i hauled you out by the one part i could reach your foot you had magic dust in your eyes so you couldnt recognize me sorry i had to put you down magic dustof course it distorted the vision making men seem like trolls ogres or worse and vice versa it was an additional hazard of such storms so that people could not see their way out of them probably many victims had seen the tangle tree as an innocent blanket tree thats okay bink said you soldiers sure know how to fight all part of the business never charge a man who knows how to throw crombie raised one finger near his ear signifying an idea ill show you how to do it its a nonmagical talent you can use dee bink cried shes still out there crombie grimaced okay i made her walk out if it means so much to you ill help you find her so the man did have some decency even with regard to women do you really hate them all bink asked as he girded himself to wrestle with the hail again even the ones who dont read minds they all read minds crombie asserted most of them do it without magic is all but i wont swear as theres no girl in the whole of xanth for me if i found a pretty one who wasnt mean or nagging or deceitful he shook his head but if any like that exist they sure as hell wouldnt marry me so the soldier rejected all women because he felt they rejected him well it was a good enough rationale now the storm had stopped they went out into the piled hailstones stepping carefully so as not to take any more spills the colored storm clouds cleared dissipating rapidly now that their magic imperative was spent what caused such storms bink wondered they had to be inanimatebut the course of this journey had convinced him that dead objects did indeed have magic often very strong magic maybe it was in the very substance of xanth and it diffused slowly into the living and nonliving things that occupied the land the living things controlled their shares of magic channelizing it focusing it making it manifest at will the inanimate things released it haphazardly as in this storm there had to be a lot of magic here gathered from a large area all wasted in a pointless mass of hailstones yet not all pointless obviously the tangle tree benefited from such storms and probably there were other ways in which they contributed to the local ecology maybe the hail culled out the weaker creatures animals less fit to survive facilitating wilderness evolution and other inanimate magic was quite pointed such as that of lookout rock and the spring of life its magic distilled from water percolating through the entire region intensifying its potency perhaps it was the magic itself that made these things conscious of their individuality every aspect of xanth was affected by magic and governed by it without magic xanth would be the very notion filled him with horrorxanth would be mundane the sun broke through the clouds where the beams struck the hailstones puffed into colored vapor their fabric of magic could not withstand the beat of direct sunlight that made bink wonder again was the sun antipathetic to magic if the magic emanated from the depths the surface of the land was the mere fringe of it if someone ever delved down deep he might approach the actual source of power intriguing notion in fact bink wished that he could set aside his quest for his own personal magic and make that search for the ultimate nature of reality in xanth surely way down deep there was the answer to all his questions but he could not for one thing he had to locate dee in a few minutes all the hail was gone but so was the girl she must have slid down the slope into the forest crombie said she knows where we are she can find us if she wants to unless shes in trouble bink said worriedly use your talent point her out crombie sighed all right he closed his eyes rotated and pointed down the south side of the ridge they trotted downand found her tracks in the soft earth at the fringe of the jungle they followed them and soon caught up dee bink cried gladly were sorry dont risk the jungle alone she marched on determinedly leave me alone dee said i dont want to go with you but crombie didnt really mean bink said he meant you dont trust me so keep away from me id rather make it on my own and that was that she was adamant bink certainly wasnt going to force her well if you need help or anything call or something she went on without answering she couldnt have been very much of a threat bink said forlornly shes a threat all right crombie insisted but no threats as much of a threat when its somewhere else they ascended the ridge again and traveled on in another day they came in sight of the magicians castle thanks to the soldiers unerring magic directional sense and ability to avoid the dangers of the wilderness he had been a big help well thats it crombie said i have seen you to this point safely and i think that about squares us i have business of my own elsewhere before i report to the king for reassignment i hope you find your magic i hope so too bink said thanks for the throws you taught me it was little enough youll have to practice them a lot more before theyll really serve sorry i got the girl mad at you maybe my talent was wrong about her after all bink didnt care to discuss that aspect so he just shook hands and headed for the castle of the good magician chapter magician the castle was impressive it was not large but it was tall and well designed it had a deep moat a stout outer wall and a high inner tower girt with parapets and embrasures it must have been built by magic because it would have taken an army of skilled craftsmen a year to build it by hand yet humfrey was supposed to be a magician of information not of construction or illusion how could he have magicked such an edifice no matter the castle was here bink walked down to the moat he heard a horrible kind of galloping splash and around from behind the castle came a horse running on the water no not a horsea hippocampus or seahorse with the head and forefeet of a horse and the tail of a dolphin bink knew the dolphin only from old pictures it was a kind of magic fish that breathed air instead of water bink stepped back the thing looked dangerous it could not follow him out onto land but it could pulverize him in water how was he to cross the moat there did not seem to be any drawbridge then he noted that the hippocampus wore a saddle oh no ride the water monster yet it obviously was the way to go the magician did not want his time wasted by anyone who wasnt serious if he lacked the nerve to ride the seahorse he didnt deserve to see humfrey it made perverse sense did bink really want the answer to his question at the price of a years service the picture of beautiful sabrina came to his mind so real so evocative that all else became meaningless he walked up to the hippocampus waiting at the edge of the moat expectantly and climbed onto its saddle the creature took off it neighed as it sped around the moat instead of across it the steed was jubilant using the water as a veritable racetrack while bink clung desperately to the saddle horn the powerful front legs of the hippocampus terminated in flippers rather than hooves scooping gouts of water back on either side drenching him with the spray the tail curled in a muscular loop when the creature was stationary uncoiled and threshed the water with such vigor that the saddle whipped back and forth threatening to dislodge the rider momentarily neigh neeiigh the monster sounded gleefully it had him where it wanted him right in the saddle ripe for bucking off the moment he hit the water it would turn and devour him what a fool he had been waitso long as he remained in the saddle it could not get at him all he had to do was hang on and in time it would tire easier thought than done the hippocampus bucked and plunged first lifting him above the moat then immersing him in the frothing water it curled its tail into a spiral and rolled dunking him again and again bink was afraid it would stop with him on the bottom forcing him to let go or drown but the saddle was firmly fixed on its backside and its horses head projected the same direction binks head did so it had to hold its breath when he held his the monster was exercising while bink was merely hanging on it was using more energy than he and so it had to breathe sooner hence it could not drown himonce he had figured this out in fact all he needed to do was keep his head and he would win for whatever that was worth finally the creature gave up it flopped to the inner gate and lay still while bink dismounted he had conquered the first hurdle thank you hip he said making a little bow to the seahorse it snorted and splashed quickly out of reach now bink faced a giant wooden door it was closed and he pounded on it with one fist it was so solid that his hand hurt and the sound was minimized dinkdinkdink he drew his knife and rapped with the handle since he had lost his new staff in the moatwith no better result if a hollow partition made the most noise this was indubitably solid there was no way to force it maybe the magician was out there should still be servants attending to the castle bink was getting angry he had made a long hazardous journey to get here and he was ready to pay the exorbitant price for one piddling bit of informationand the damned good magician lacked the courtesy even to answer the door well he would get in despite the magician somehow he would demand his audience he studied the door it was a good ten feet tall and five feet wide it seemed to have been made of handhewn eightbyeight posts the thing must weigh a tonliterally it had no hinges which meant it had to open by sliding to one side no the portals were solid stone lifted out of the way there were no connecting ropes to haul it up no pulleys that he could see there might be hidden screws set into the wood but that seemed a lot of trouble and somewhat risky screws sometimes let go at inopportune moments maybe the whole door dropped into the floor but that too was stone so it seemed the whole mass simply had to be removed every time someone wanted access ridiculous it had to be a phony a dummy there would be a more sensible aperture for routine use either magical or physical all he had to do was find it in the stone no that would be unmanageably heavy if it were not it would represent a weakened place where an enemy could force entry no point in building a substantial castle with such a liability where then bink ran his fingers over the surface of the huge mockdoor he found a crack he traced it around in a square yes he placed both hands against the center and shoved the square moved it slid inward and finally dropped inside leaving a hole just big enough for a man to crawl through here was his entry bink wasted no time he climbed through the hole inside was a dimly illuminated hall and another monster it was a manticora a creature the size of a horse with the head of a man body of a lion wings of a dragon and tail of a scorpion one of the most ferocious magical monsters known welcome to lunch little morsel the manticora said arching its segmented tail up over its back its mouth was strange with three rows of teeth one inside anotherbut its voice was stranger it was something like a flute and something like a trumpet beautiful in its fashion but difficult to comprehend bink whipped out his knife i am not your lunch he said with a good deal more conviction than he felt the manticora laughed and now its tones were the sour notes of irony you are not anyone elses lunch mortal you have climbed nimbly into my trap he had indeed but bink was fed up with these pointless obstacles and also suspected that they were not pointless paradoxical as it might seem if the magicians monsters consumed all callers humfrey would never have any business never obtain any fees and by all accounts the good magician was a grasping man who existed principally to profit himself he needed those exorbitant fees to increase his wealth so probably this was another test like those of the seahorse and the door all bink had to do was figure out the solution i can walk back out of this cage any time i want to bink said boldly he willed his knees not to knock together with his shivering it isnt made to hold people my size it holds in monsters your size youre the prisoner molarface molarface the manticora repeated incredulously showing about sixty molars in the process why you pipsqueak mortal ill sting you into a billionyear suffering sleep bink made for the square portal the monster pounced its tail stabbing forward over its head it was horribly fast but bink had only feinted he was already ducking forward directly at the lions claws it was the opposite direction from that which the monster had expected and the thing could not reverse in midair its deadly tail stabbed into the wood of the door and its head popped through the square hole its lions shoulders wedged tightly against it unable to fit through the hole and its wings fluttered helplessly bink could not resist he straightened up turned and yelled you didnt think i came all the way here just to back out again did you you halfreared monster then he planted a swift hard kick on the creatures posterior just under the lifted tail there was a fluted howl of rage and anguish from the door then bink was away running down the hall hoping that there was a mansized exit otherwise the door seemed to explode there was a thump behind as the manticora fell free and rolled back to its feet it was really angry now if there were no way out there was the challenge had been to get around the monster not to kill it no man could kill such a creature with a knife bink scrambled through the barred gate as the manticora charged down the hall too late splinters of wood falling from its tail now bink was in the castle proper it was a fairly dark dank place with little evidence of human habitation where was the good magician surely there would be some way to announce his presence assuming that the ruckus with the manticora had not sufficed bink looked around and spied a dangling cord he gave it one good yank and stepped back lest something drop on him he did not quite trust this adorable castle a bell sounded dongdong dongdong a gnarled old elf trotted up who shall i say is calling bink of the north village drink of what bink b ink the elf studied him what shall i say is the business of your master bink i am bink my business is the quest for a magical talent and what recompense do you offer for the invaluable time of the good magician the usual scale one years service then in a lower tone its robbery but im stuck for it your master gouges the public horrendously the elf considered the magician is occupied at the moment can you comeback tomorrow come back tomorrow bink exploded thinking of what the hippocampus and manticora would do to him if they got a second chance does the old bugger want my business or doesnt he the elf frowned well if youre going to be that way about it come on upstairs bink followed the little man up a winding staircase the interior of the castle lightened with elevation and became more ornate more residential finally the elf showed the way into a paperfilled study the elf seated himself at a big wooden desk very well bink of the north village you have won your way through the defenses of this castle what makes you think your service is worth the old gouging buggers while bink started to make an angry exclamationbut cut himself off as he realized that this was the good magician humfrey he was sunk all he could do now was give a straight answer before he got kicked out i am strong and i can work it is for you to decide whether that is worth your while you are oinkheaded and doubtless have a grotesque appetite youd no doubt cost me more in board than id ever get from you bink shrugged knowing it would be futile to debate such points he could only antagonize the magician further he had really walked into the last trap the trap of arrogance perhaps you could carry books and turn pages for me can you read some bink said he had been a reasonably apt pupil of the centaur instructor but that had been years ago you seem to be a fair hand at insult too maybe you could talk intruders out of intruding with their petty problems maybe bink agreed grimly obviously he had really done it this time and after coming so close to success well come on we dont have all day humfrey snapped bouncing out of his chair bink saw now that he was not a tree elf but a very small human being an elf of course being a magical creature could not be a magician that was part of what had put him off at firstthough increasingly he wondered about the accuracy of that conjecture xanth continued to show him ramifications of magic he had not thought of before apparently the magician had accepted the case bink followed him to the next room it was a laboratory with magical devices cluttering the shelves and piled on the floor except for one cleared area stand aside humfrey said brusquely though bink hardly had room to move the magician did not have an endearing personality it would be a real chore to work for him a year but it just might be worth it if bink learned he had a magic talent and it was a good one humfrey took a tiny bottle from the shelf shook it and set it on the floor in the middle of a pentagram a fivesided figure then he made a gesture with both hands and intoned something in an arcane tongue the lid of the bottle popped off smoke issued forth it expanded into a sizable cloud then coalesced into the shape of a demon not a particularly ferocious demon this ones horns were vestigial and his tail had a soft tuft instead of a cutting barb furthermore he wore glasses which must have been imported from mundania where such artifacts were commonly used to shore up the weak eyes of the denizens there or so the myths had it bink almost laughed imagine a nearsighted demon beauregard humfrey intoned i conjure thee by the authority vested in me by the compact tell us what magic talent this lad bink of the north village of xanth possesses so that was the magicians secret he was a demonsummoner the pentagram was for containing the demons released from their magic bottles even a studious demon was a creature of hell beauregard focused his lenscovered eyes on bink step into my demesnes that i may inspect you properly he said nuhuh bink exclaimed youre a tough nut the demon said i didnt ask you for his personality profile humfrey snapped whats his magic the demon concentrated he has magicstrong magicbut strong magic binks hopes soared but i am unable to fathom it beauregard said he grimaced at the good magician sorry fathead ill have to renege on this one then get ye gone incompetent humfrey snarled clapping his hands together with a remarkably sharp report evidently he was used to being insulted it was part of his life style maybe bink had lucked out again the demon dissolved into smoke and drained back into his bottle bink stared at the bottle trying to determine what was visible within it was there a tiny figure hunched over a miniature book reading now the magician contemplated bink so you have strong magic that cannot be fathomed were you aware of this did you come here to waste my time no bink said i never was sure i had magic at all theres never been any evidence of it i hopedbut i feared i had none is there anything you know of that could account for this opacity a counterspell perhaps evidently humfrey was far from omnipotent but now that bink knew he was a demonconjurer that explained it nobody summoned a demon without good reason the magician charged heavily for his service because he took a heavy risk i dont know of anything bink said except maybe the drink of magic healing water i took beauregard should not have been deceived by that hes a pretty savvy demon a real scholar of magic do you have any of that water with you bink held out his canteen i saved some never can tell when it might be needed humfrey took it poured out a drop on his palm touched his tongue to it and grimaced thoughtfully standard formula he said it doesnt bollix up informational or divinatory magic ive got a keg of similar stuff in my cellar brewed it myself mine is free of the springs selfinterest geis of course but keep this it can be useful the magician set up a pointer attached to a string beside a wall chart with pictures of a smiling cherub and a frowning devil lets play twenty questions he moved his hands casting a spell and bink realized that his prior realization had been premature humfrey did do more than demonsummoningbut he still specialized in information bink of the north village he intoned have you oriented on him the pointer swung around to indicate the cherub does he have magic the cherub again strong magic cherub can you identify it cherub will you tell me its nature the pointer moved to cover the devil what is this humfrey demanded irritably no thats not a question idiot its an exclamation i cant figure why you spirits are balking angry he cast the release spell and turned to bink theres something mighty funny here but its become a challenge im going to use a truth spell on you well get to the heart of this the magician waved his stubby arms again muttered a vilesounding incantationand suddenly bink felt strange he had never experienced this odd type of magic before with its gestures words and assorted apparatus he was used to inherent talents that worked when they were willed to work the good magician seemed to be something of a scientistthough bink hardly understood that mundane term either what is your identity humfrey demanded bink of the north village it was the truthbut this time bink said it because the spell compelled him to not because he wanted to why did you come here to find out whether i have magic and what it might be so i shall not be exiled from xanth and can marry enough i dont care about the sordid details the magician shook his head so you were telling the truth all along the mystery deepens the plot thickens nowwhat is your talent bink opened his mouth compelled to speakand there was an animal roar humfrey blinked ohthe manticora is hungry spell abate wait here while i feed him he departed an inconvenient time for the manticora to get hungry but bink could hardly blame the magician for hastening to the feeding chore if the monster should break out of its cage bink was left to his own devices he walked around the room stepping carefully to avoid the litter not touching anything he came to a mirror mirror mirror on the wall he said playfully who is the fairest one of all the mirror clouded then cleared a gross fat warty toad peered out bink jumped then he realized this was a magic mirror it had shown him the fairest one of allthe fairest toad i mean the fairest female human being he clarified nowsabrina looked out at him bink had been joking at first but he should have realized that the mirror would take him seriously was sabrina really the fairest girl of all probably not objectively the mirror showed her because to binks prejudiced eye she was the one to some other man the picture changed now the girl wynne looked out yes she was pretty too though too stupid to be worthwhile some men would like that very well however on the other hand now the sorceress iris looked out in her most beguiling illusion well its about time you got around to me bink she said i can still enable you to no bink cried and the mirror went blank he calmed himself then faced the mirror again can you answer informational questions too of course it could otherwise it wouldnt be here the mirror clouded and cleared a picture of the cherub appeared meaning yes why are we having so much trouble discovering my talent the picture that formed this time was that of a foot a pawa monkeys paw bink looked at it for some time trying to figure out its meaning but it eluded him the mirror must have gotten confused and thrown in an irrelevant image what is my talent he asked at last and the mirror cracked what are you doing humfrey demanded behind him bink jumped guiltily iseem to have broken your mirror he said i was just you were just asking stupidly direct questions of an instrument designed for subtlety humfrey said angrily did you actually think the mirror could reveal what the demon beauregard balked at im sorry bink said lamely youre a lot more trouble than youre worth but you are also a challenge lets get on with it the magician made his gesture and incantation again restoring the truth spell what is your there was a crash the glass had fallen out of the cracked mirror i wasnt asking you humfrey yelled at it he returned to bink what there was a shudder the castle shook earthquake the magician exclaimed everything happens at once he crossed the room and peered out an embrasure no its only the invisible giant passing by humfrey returned once more to bink this time he squinted at him hard its not coincidence something is preventing youor anything elsefrom giving that answer some very powerful unidentified magic magiciancaliber enchantment i had thought there were only three persons of that rank alive today but it seems there is a fourth three humfrey iris trent but none of these have magic of this type trent the evil magician perhaps you call him evil i never found him so we were friends in our fashion there is a kind of comaraderie at our level but he was exiled twenty years ago humfrey looked slantwise at bink you equate exile with death he resides in mundania my information does not extend beyond the shield but i am sure he survives he is an exceptional man but without magic now oh bink had equated exile with death emotionally this was a good reminder there was life beyond the shield he still did not want to go there but at least it diminished the specter though it galls me exceedingly i dare not push the question further i am not properly protected against interference magic but why would anyone try to prevent me from knowing my own talent bink asked bewildered oh you know it you just cant tell iteven to yourself the knowledge is buried deep inside you and there it seems it is going to remain i simply am not prepared to take the risk involved for a mere oneyear service id almost certainly take a loss on that contract but why would a magiciani mean im nobody how could it benefit anybody else to stop me from it might not be a person at all but a thing placing a geis on you a geis of ignorance but why humfrey grimaced lad you grow repetitive your talent could represent some threat to some powerful special interest as a silver sword is a threat to a dragon even though it may not be near that dragon so that entity protects itself by blocking off your knowledge of your talent but if we knew that wed know your talent humfrey snapped answering the unformed question still bink persisted how can i demonstrate my talent then so i can stay in xanth you do seem to have a problem humfrey remarked as if it were of only academic importance he shrugged id answer if i could but i cant there is of course no charge for my service since i was unable to complete it i will send a note with you perhaps the king will allow you to remain after all i believe the bylaws specify that each citizen shall be possessed of magic not that he actually has to demonstrate it in public on occasion the demonstration is suspended i remember one young man who was able to change the color of his urine at will for example an affidavit was accepted in lieu of public display failure seemed to have mellowed the magician considerably he served bink a pleasant meal of brown bread and milkfrom his private breadfruit orchard and deerfly stable respectivelyand chatted almost sociably so many people come here and waste their questions he confided the trick is not necessarily to find the answer but to find the correct question yours is the first real challenge ive had in years the last one was let me thinkthe amaranth this farmer wanted to know how to develop a really superior plant for greens and grain so he could feed his family better and bring in a little income for the comforts of life i located the magic amaranth for him and now its use has spread all over xanth and beyond it too for all i know it is possible to make bread from it that is almost indistinguishable from the real thing the magician pulled out a drawer and brought out a special loaf see this has no stem it was baked not budded he broke off a chunk for bink who was glad to accept it now that was the kind of question to ask the answer benefited the whole country of xanth as well as the individual too many desires are of the monkeyspaw variety in contrast the monkeys paw bink exclaimed when i asked the magic mirror it showed me it would the image derives from a mundane story they thought it was fiction but here in xanth there is magic like that but what do you want to invest a years service after all uh no not for that bink concentrated on chewing the new bread it was tougher than true bread then have it free it simply means a type of magic that brings you more grief than good though it grants what you technically ask magic you are better off without was bink better off not knowing his talent that was what the mirror had seemed to tell him yet how could exile which would deprive him of it entirely be better than knowledge do many people come with questions stupid or otherwise not so many now that i built this castle and hid it only the really determined find their way here now like you how did you build it so long as the magician was talking the centaurs built it i told them how to rid themselves of a local pest and they served me for a year they are very skilled craftscreatures and did a fine job periodically i foul up the routes here applying spells of misdirection so as not to be pestered by casual querists its a good location the monsters bink exclaimed the hippocampus the manticoratheyre serving their years service discouraging idle questioners of course do you think theyd stay here for the mere pleasure of it bink wondered he remembered the unholy glee with which the seahorse had flung itself about still it would naturally prefer the open sea to a mere moat he had finished the bread it had been almost as good as real bread with your powers of information you couldwhy you could be king humfrey laughed and there was nothing whining or bitter about it who in his right mind would want to be king its a tedious strenuous job i am not a disciplinarian but a scholar most of my labor is in making my magic safe and specific refining it for greater applicability much remains to be done and i am getting old i cant waste time with diversions let those who wish the crown take it disconcerted bink cast about for someone who wanted to rule xanth the sorceress iris the trouble with dealing in illusion humfrey said seriously is that one begins to be deluded oneself iris doesnt need power half so much as she needs a good man even bink could see the truth in that but why doesnt she marry shes a sorceress a good one she has powers you have not yet glimpsed she requires a man she can respectone who has stronger magic than she does in all xanth only i have more magic than she and im of another generation really too old for her even if i had any interest in marriage and of course we would be a mismatch for our talents are opposite i deal in truth she in illusion i know too much she imagines too much so she conspires with lesser talents convincing herself that it can somehow work out he shook his head it is too bad really with the king fading and no heir apparent and this alternate requirement that the crown go only to a full magician it is entirely possible that the throne will be subject to her machinations not every young man has your integrity or loyalty to xanth bink felt a chill humfrey knew about iriss offer about their encounter the magician did not merely answer questions for a fee he kept track of what was going on in xanth but he did not it seemed bother to interfere he just watched maybe he investigated the background of specific seekers while the seahorse wall and manticora delayed them so that by the time one won through humfrey was ready maybe he saved the information in case someone came to ask what is the greatest danger facing xanth whereupon he could collect his fee for answering if the king dies will you take the crown bink asked as you said it will have to go to a powerful magician and for the good of xanth you pose a question almost as awkward as the one that brought you here the good magician said ruefully i do have a certain modicum of patriotism but i also have a policy against interfering with the natural scheme of things there is some substance to the concept of the monkeys paw magic does have its price i suppose if there were absolutely no alternative i would accept the crownbut first i would search most diligently for some superior magician to assume the chore we have not had a top talent appear in a generation one is overdue he gazed speculatively at bink there seems to be magic of that caliber associated with youbut we cannot harness it if we cannot define it so i doubt you are the heir to the throne bink exploded with incredulous embarrassed laughter me you insult the throne no there are qualities in you that would honor the throneif you only had identified controllable magic the sorceress may have chosen better than she knew or intended but evidently there is countermagic that balks youthough i am not sure the source of that countermagic would make a good king either it is a strange matter most intriguing bink was tempted by the notion of being a potent magician becoming king and ruling xanth oddly it quickly turned him off he knew deep inside that he lacked the qualities required despite humfreys remarks this was not merely a matter of magic but of basic life style and ambition he could never sentence a man to death or exile however justified that sentence might be or lead an army into battle or spend all day deciding the altercations of citizens the sheer responsibility would soon weigh him down youre right no sensible person would want to be king all i want is to marry sabrina and settle down you are a most sensible lad stay the night and on the morrow i will show you a direct route home with protections against the hazards on the way nickelpede repellent bink asked hopefully remembering the trenches cherie the centaur had hurdled precisely you will still have to keep your wits about you no route is safe for a stupid man but two days travel on foot will suffice bink stayed the night he found he rather liked the castle and its denizens even the manticora was affable now that the magician had given the word i would not really have eaten you though i admit to being tempted for a moment or three when you booted me in the tail it told bink it is my job to scare off those who are not serious see i am not confined it pushed against the bars and the inner gate swung open my year is almost up anyway ill almost be sorry to have it end what question did you bring bink inquired somewhat nervously trying not to brace himself too obviously for flight in an open space he was no possible match for the manticora i asked whether i have a soul the monster said seriously again bink had to control his reaction a years service for a philosophical question what did he tell you that only those who possess souls are concerned about them butbut then you never needed to ask you paid a year for nothing no i paid a year for everything possession of a soul means that i can never truly die my body may slough away but i shall be reborn or if not my shade will linger to settle unfinished accounts or i shall reside forever in heaven or hell my future is assured i shall never suffer oblivion there is no more vital question or answer yet that answer had to be in the proper form a simple yes or no answer would not have satisfied me it could be a blind guess or merely the magicians offhand opinion a detailed technical treatise would merely have obfuscated the matter humfrey phrased it in such a way that its truth was selfevident now i need never doubt again bink was moved considered that way it did make sense humfrey had delivered good value he was an honest magician he had shown the manticoraand bink himself something vital about the nature of life in xanth if the fierce conglomerate monsters had souls with all that implied who could condemn them as evil chapter exile the path was broad and clear with no impinging magic only one thing chilled bink a region with small wormlike holes in the trunks of trees and surrounding rocks holes that wiggled straight from one side to another the wiggles had been here but he calmed himself the wiggles had not passed recently of course that menace had been abolished but where they had infested it was horrible for the little flying worms had drilled magically through anything that got in their way including animals and people a tree could survive a few neat holes but a person could bleed to death assuming he did not die outright from the holing of some vital organ the mere thought made bink wince he hoped the wiggles never spawned again in xanthbut there was no certainty about that there was no certainty about anything where magic was involved he walked faster made nervous by the old wiggle scars in half an hour bink reached the chasmand there sure enough was the impossible bridge the good magician had told him of he verified its existence by tossing a handful of dirt and observing the pattern of its fall into the depths it guided around one section had he known of this on the way overbut of course that was the thing about information without it a person suffered enormous complications who would have thought there was an invisible bridge all the way across yet his long detour had not been an entire loss he had participated in the rape hearing and helped the shade and witnessed some fantastic illusions and rescued crombie the soldier and generally learned a lot more about the land of xanth he wouldnt care to do it all over again but the experience had made him grow he stepped out onto the bridge there was one thing about it the magician had warned him once he started across he could not turn back or it would dematerialize dropping him into the chasm it was a oneway ramp existing only ahead of him so he walked across boldly though the gulf opened out awesomely beneath him only his hand on the invisible rail reassured him he did risk a look down here the base of the chasm was extremely narrowa virtual crack rather than a valley the gap dragon could not run here but there seemed to be no way to climb down the steep cliffslope if the fall did not kill a person starvation and exposure would unless he managed to straddle the narrowest part of the crack and walk east or west to a better sectionwhere the dragon could then catch him bink made it across all it took was knowledge and confidence his feet safely on land he looked back there was no sign of the bridge of course and no obvious approach to it he was not about to risk another crossing the nervous release left him thirsty he saw a spring to one side of the path the path there had been none a moment ago he looked back toward the chasm and there was no path ohit led away from the bridge not toward it routine oneway magic he proceeded to the spring he had water in his canteen but it was spring of life water which he avoided drinking saving it for some future emergency a driblet of water emerged from the spring to flow along a winding channel and finally trickle down into the chasm the channel was richly overgrown with strange plants species that bink had never observed before a strawberry runner bearing beechnuts and ferns with deciduous leaves odd but no threat to his welfare bink looked around carefully for predator beasts that might lurk near a water hole then lay down to put his mouth to the waiting pool as he lowered his head he heard a fluting cry above him youll be sooorry it seemed to say he glanced up into the trees a birdlike thing perched there possibly a variety of harpy she had full womanbreasts and a coiled snake tail nothing to concern him so long as she kept her distance he bent his head againand heard a rustle too close he jumped up drew his knife moved a few paces and through the trees sighted an incredible thing two creatures were locked in combat a griffin and a unicorn one was male the other female and they werethey were not fighting they bink retreated profoundly embarrassed they were two different species how could they disgusted he returned to the spring now he noted the recent tracks of the creatures both unicorn and griffin had come to drink here probably within the hour maybe they had crossed the invisible bridge as he had and seen the spring so conveniently located so the water could hardly be poisoned suddenly he caught on this was a love spring anyone who drank of this water would become compellingly enamored of the first creature he encountered thereafter and he glanced over at the griffin and unicorn they were still at it insatiably bink backed away from the spring if he had drunk from it he shuddered he was no longer remotely thirsty aw go take a drink the harpy fluted bink swept up a rock and hurled it at her she squawked and fluttered higher laughing coarsely one of her droppings just missed him there was nothing more hateful than a harpy well the good magician had warned him that the path home was not entirely free of problems this spring must be one of the details humfrey hadnt thought important enough for specific mention once bink was back on the trail along which he had originally come the hazards would be familiar such as the peace pines how would he get through them he needed an enemy to travel with and he had none then he had a bright idea hey youbirdbrain he called up into the foliage stay away from me or ill stuff your tail down your filthy throat the harpy responded with a withering torrent of abuse what a vocabulary she had bink threw another rock at her im warning youdont follow me he cried ill follow you to the edge of the shield itself she screeched youll never get rid of me bink smiled privately now he had a suitable companion he hiked on dodging the occasional droppings the harpy hurled at him hoping her fury would carry her through the pines after thatwell first things first soon the path merged with the one he had taken south curious he sighted along the main path both ways it was visible north and south he looked back the way he had just comeand there was only deep forest he took a step back along where he knew he had passedand found himself kneedeep in glowbriers the weeds sparkled as they snagged on his legs and only by maneuvering with extreme caution did he manage to extricate himself without getting scratched the harpy laughed so hard she almost fell from her perch there was simply no path here this direction but the moment he faced about again there it was leading cleanly through the briers to join the main route ah wellwhy did he even bother to question such things magic was magic it had no rationale except its own everyone knew that everyone except himself at times he hiked all day passing the brook where to drink was to become a fishhave a drink harpybut she already knew of the enchantment and reviled him with double fury the peace pines have a nap harpy and the trench with the nickelpedesill fetch you something to eat harpybut actually he used the repellent the good magician had provided and never even saw a nickelpede at last he stopped at a farmhouse in the centaur territory for the night the harpy finally gave up her chase she dared not come within range of a centaur bow these were older centaurs unaggressive interested in the news of the day they listened avidly to the narration of his experiences across the chasm and considered this to suffice for his room and board their grandchild colt was staying with them a happygolucky prancing tyke of barely twentyfive years binks age but equivalent to a quarter that in human terms bink played with him and did handstands for him that was a trick no centaur could do and the colt was fascinated next day he traveled north again and there was no sign of the harpy what a relief he would almost have preferred to risk the peace pines alone his ears felt indelibly soiled after the day of her expletives he passed through the remainder of the centaur area without encountering anyone as evening approached he reached the north village hey the spellless wonder is back zink cried a hole appeared at binks feet causing him to stumble involuntarily zink would have made a wonderful companion for the pines bink ignored the other holes and proceeded toward his house he was back all right why had he bothered to hurry the examination was held next morningin the outdoor amphitheater the royal palms formed colonnades setting off the stage area the benches were formed from the projecting convoluted knees of a giant dryland cypress tree the back was braced by four huge honeymaple trees bink had always liked this formationbut now it was a place of discomfort his place of trial the old king presided since this was one of his royal offices he wore his jewelencrusted royal robe and his handsome gold crown and carried the ornate scepter symbols of his power all citizens bowed as the fanfare sounded bink could not help feeling a shiver of awe as the panoply of royalty manifested the king had an impressive white mane and a long beard but his eyes tended to drift aimlessly periodically a servitor would nudge him to prevent him from falling asleep and to remind him of the ritual at the start the king performed his ceremonial magic by generating a storm he held his palsied hands high and mumbled his invocation at first there was silence then just as it seemed the magic had failed entirely a ghostly gust of wind passed through the glade stirring up a handful of leaves no one said anything though it was evident that this manifestation could have been mere coincidence it was certainly a far cry from a storm but several of the ladies dutifully put up umbrellas and the master of ceremonies quickly proceeded to the business at hand binks parents roland and bianca were in the front row and so was sabrina fully as lovely as he had remembered her roland caught binks eye and nodded encouragingly and biancas gaze was moist but sabrinas eyes were downcast they were all afraid for him with reason he thought what talent do you proffer to justify your citizenship the master of ceremonies asked bink he was munly a friend of rolands bink knew the man would do everything he could to help but he was dutybound to follow the forms now it was upon him ii cant show it bink said but i have the good magician humfreys note that i do have magic he held out the note with a trembling hand the man took it glanced at it and passed it to the king the king squinted but his eyes wore so watery that he evidently could not read it as your majesty can see munly murmured discreetly it is a message from magician humfrey bearing his magic seal this was a picture of a flippered creature balancing a ball on its snout it states that this person possesses an undefined magical talent something like fire lighted the old monarchs ashy eye momentarily this counts for naught he mumbled humfrey is not king i am he let the paper drop to the ground but bink protested the master of ceremonies glanced at him warningly and bink knew it was hopeless the king was foolishly jealous of the magician humfrey whose power was still strong and would not heed the message but for whatever reason the king had spoken argument would only complicate things then he had an idea i have brought the king a present bink said water from a healing spring munlys eyes lighted you have magic water he was alert to the possibilities of a fully functional king in my canteen bink said i saved itsee it healed my lost finger he held up his left hand it also cured my cold and i saw it help other people it heals anything instantly he decided not to mention the attached obligation munlys talent was the conjuration of small objects with your permission granted bink said quickly the canteen appeared in the mans hand this is it yes for the first time bink had real hope munly approached the king again bink has brought a gift for your majesty he announced magic water the king took the canteen magic water he repeated hardly seeming to comprehend it heals all ills munly assured him the king looked at it one swallow and he would be able to read the magicians message to brew decent storms againand to make sensible judgments this could reverse the course of binks demonstration you imply i am sick the king demanded i need no healing i am as fit as i ever was and he turned the canteen upside down letting the precious fluid pour out on the ground it was as if binks life blood were spilling out not mere water he saw his last chance ruined by the very senility he had thought to alleviate on top of that now he had no healing water for his own emergencies he could not be cured again was this the retribution of the spring of life for his defiance of it to tempt him with incipient victory then withdraw it at the critical moment regardless he was lost munly knew it too he stooped to pick up the canteen and it vanished from his hand returned to binks house i am sorry he murmured under his breath then loudly demonstrate your talent bink tried he concentrated willing his magic whatever it might be to break its geis and manifest somehow but nothing happened he heard a sob sabrina no it was his mother bianca roland sat with stony face refusing by his code of honor to let personal interest interfere sabrina still would not look at him but there were those who did zink jama and potipher were all smirking now they had reason to feel superior none of them were spellless wonders i cannot bink whispered it was over again he hiked this time he headed westward toward the isthmus he carried a new staff and a hatchet and his knife and his canteen had been refilled with conventional water bianca had provided more excellent sandwiches flavored by her tears he had nothing from sabrina he had not seen her at all since the decision xanth law did not permit an exile to take more than he could conveniently carry and no valuables for fear of attracting unwanted attention from the mundanes though the shield protected xanth it was impossible to be too safe binks life was essentially over for he had been exiled from all that he had known he was in effect an orphan never again would he experience the marvels of magic he would be forever bound as it were to the ground the colorless society of mundania should he have accepted the offer of the sorceress iris at least he could have remained in xanth had he but known he would not have changed his mind what was right was right and wrong was wrong the strangest thing was that he did not feel entirely despondent he had lost citizenship family and fiancйe and faced the great unknown of the outside yet there was a certain quixotic spring to his step was it a counterreaction buoying his spirit so that he would not suicideor was he in fact relieved that the decision had at last been made he had been a freak among the magic people now he would be among his own kind nothat wasnt it he had magic he was no freak strong magic magiciancaliber humfrey had told him so and he believed it he merely was unable to utilize it like a man who could make a colored spot on the wallwhen there was no wall handy why he should be magically mute he did not knowbut it meant that he was right the decision of the king wrong those who had not stood by him were better off apart from him no not that either his parents had refused to compromise the law of xanth they were good honest people and bink shared their values he had refused a similar compromise when tempted by the sorceress roland and bianca could not help him by accompanying him into an exile they did not deserveor by trying to help him stay by cheating the system they had done what they felt was right at great personal sacrifice and he was proud of them he knew they loved him but had let him go his own way without interference that was part of his buried joy and sabrinawhat then of her she too had refused to cheat yet he felt she lacked the commitment of his parents to principle she would have cheated had she had sufficient reason her surface integrity was because she had not been moved strongly by binks misfortune her love had not been deep enough she had loved him for the magic talent she had been convinced he had as the son of strongly talented parents the loss of that potential talent had undercut that love she had not really wanted him as a person and his love for her was now revealed as similarly shallow sure she was beautifulbut she had less actual personality than say the girl dee dee had walked off because she had been insulted and stuck by her decision sabrina would do the same but for a different reason dee had not been posturing she had really been angry with sabrina it would have been more contrived with more art and less emotionbecause she had less emotion she cared more about appearances than the reality which reminded bink of the sorceress iris againthe ultimate creature of appearances what a temper she had bink respected temper it was a window to the truth at times when little else offered but iris was too violent that palacedestruction scene complete with storm and dragon even stupid whatshernamethe lovely girl of the rape hearingwynne that was her name she had feelings he had he hoped enabled her to escape from the gap dragon there had not been much artifice in her but sabrina was the perfect actress and so he had never really been sure of her love she had been a picture in his mind to be summoned in time of need just to look at he had not actually wanted to marry her it had taken exile to show him his own motives whatever it was that he wanted in a girl ultimately sabrina lacked she had beauty which he liked and personalitywhich was not the same as characterand attractive magic all these things were goodvery goodand he had thought he loved her but when the crisis came sabrinas eyes had been averted that said it all crombie the soldier had spoken truly bink would have been a fool to marry sabrina bink smiled how would crombie and sabrina have gotten along together the ultimately demanding and suspicious male the ultimately artful and protean female would the soldiers inherent ferocity constitute a challenge to the girls powers of accommodation would they after all have fashioned an enduring relationship it almost seemed they might they would either have an immediate and violent falling out or a similarly spectacular falling in too bad they couldnt meet and that he could not be present to observe such a meeting the whole of his xanth experience was passing glibly through his mind now that he was through with it nor the first time in his life bink was free he no longer needed magic he no longer needed romance he no longer needed xanth his aimlessly roving eye spotted a tiny dark spot on a tree he experienced a sudden shudder was it a wiggle wound no just a discoloration he felt reliefand realized that he had been fooling himself at least to this extent if he no longer needed xanth he would not care about things like the wiggles he did need xanth it was his youth buthe could not have it then he approached the station of the shield man and his uncertainty increased once he passed through the shield xanth and all its works would be forever behind him what are you up to the shield man asked him he was a big fat youth with pale features but he was part of the vital net of magic that formed the barrier to outside penetration of xanth no living creature could pass the shield either waybut since no inhabitant of xanth wanted to depart its net effect was to stop all mundane intrusions the touch of the shield meant deathinstant painless final bink didnt know how it workedbut he didnt know how any magic worked really it just was i have been exiled bink said you have to let me through the shield he would not of course attempt to cheat he would leave as directed had he been inclined to try to avoid exile it would not have worked one villagers talent was spot location of individuals and he was now tuned to bink he would know if bink remained on this side of the shield today the youth sighed why do all the complications have to come in my shift do you know how difficult it is to open up a mansized hole without bollixing the whole damn shield i dont know anything about the shield bink admitted but i was exiled by the king so oh very well now looki cant go with you to the shield i have to stay here at my station but i can make an opening spell that will cancel out one section for five seconds you be there and you step through on schedule because if it closes on you youre dead bink gulped for all his thoughts about death and exile now that it had come to the test he did want to live i know right the magic stone doesnt care who dies meaningfully the youth tapped the boulder he leaned against you mean that dingy old stone is it bink asked shieldstone sure the magician ebnez located it nearly a century ago and tuned it to form the shield without it wed still be subject to invasion by the mundanes bink had heard of the magician ebnez one of the great historical figures in fact ebnez was in binks family tree he had been able to adapt things magically in his hands a hammer could become a sledgehammer or a piece of wood could become a section of windowframe whatever existed became whatever was neededwithin certain limits he could not adapt air into food for example or make a suit of clothing out of water but it had been amazing what he could do so he had adapted a potent deathstone into the shieldstone killing at a set distance instead of up close and thereby he had fashioned the salvation of xanth what a proud achievement okay now the youth said heres a timestone he tapped it against the larger rock and the small piece fractured into two segments each fading from the original red to white he handed one fragment to bink when this goes red you step across theyre synched the opening will be right in front of the big beechnut treeand for only five seconds so you be ready and moveon red move on red bink agreed right now move sometimes these timestones heal fast ill be watching mine so as to time the spell you watch yours bink moved he ran along the path to the west usually a fractured timestone took half an hour or so to healbut it varied somewhat with the quality of the stone the surrounding temperature and assorted unknown factors maybe it was inherent in the original piece because the two fragments always changed color together precisely even if one were in the sunshine and the other buried in a well but again what use to seek a rationale for magic what was was and would be no morefor him none of this had meaning in mundania he hove in sight of the shieldor rather its effect the shield itself was invisible but there was a line of dead vegetation where it touched the ground end the corpses of animals that had been so foolish as to try to cross that line sometimes jumpdeer got confused and sprang through to the safe ground on the other side but they were already dead the shield was invisibly thin but absolute occasional mundane creatures blundered into it a detail walked the line each day on the xanth side checking for corpses hauling them out of the shield when they were partway across giving them safe burial it was possible to handle something that lay across the shield so long as the living person did not touch it himself nevertheless it was a grisly chore sometimes assigned as punishment there were never any human mundanes but there was always the fear that there might one day be some with all the complications that would entail ahead was the spreading beechnut tree one branch reached out toward the shieldand the tip of that branch was dead wind must have made it sway across it helped identify the spot where he should cross there was an odor associated with this line of death too probably it was the decay of many tiny creatures worms in the earth bugs flying through the shield rotting where they fell this was the region of death bink glanced down at the stone he heldand sucked in his breath in shock it was red had it just now changedor was he already too late his life depended on the answer bink launched himself at the shield he knew the sensible thing to do was return to the shield tender and explain why he had balkedbut he wanted this done with maybe it had been the actual change of the stones color that had attracted his attention in which case he did have time so he took the foolish course and tried for it one second two three hed better have the whole five because he wasnt there yet the shield seemed close but it took time to make the supposedly instant decision and abolish inertia and get up speed he was passing the beechnut tree at a dead runmaybe literally deadgoing too fast to stop four secondshe was crossing the line of death if it closed on his trailing leg would all of him die or just the leg fivehe felt a tingle sixno time was up stop counting start panting he was through was he alive he rolled in the dirt kicking up dry leaves and small bones of course he was alive how could he worry about it otherwise as with the manticora concerned about his soul if he had none he wouldnt bink sat up shaking something dead out of his hair so he had made it that tingle must have been an effect of the turnedoff shield since it hadnt hurt him now it was done he was free of xanth forever free to make his own life without being ridiculed or mothered or tempted free to be himself bink put his face in his hands and cried chapter trent after a time he got up and walked on into the dread world of the mundanes it really did not look much different the trees were similar the rocks unchanged and the ocean shore he paralleled was exactly like an ocean shore yet an intense nostalgia gripped him his prior euphoria had been but the swing of the pendulum providing a false buoyancy better if he had died in the crossing well he could still go back just step across the line death would be painless and he could be buried in xanth was that what other exiles had done he revolted against the notion he had called his own bluff he loved xanth and missed it terribly alreadybut he did not want to die he would simply have to make his way among the mundanes others had surely done it before him maybe he would even be happy there the isthmus was mountainous bink sweated as he climbed the steep pass was this the counterpart to the chasm a ridge that rose as high above the land as the chasm sank beneath it did a ridge dragon run along the heights no not in mundania but possibly such geography did have something to do with the magic if the magic quality washed down from the height concentrating in the depthno that didnt seem to make much sense most of it would have washed into the ocean and been hopelessly diluted for the first time he wondered what mundania was really like was it actually possible to survive without magic it would not be nearly as nice as xanth but the absence of spells should represent a formidable challenge and there should be some decent places in it the people should not be evil after all his ancestors had come from mundane stock indications were that language and many customs were the same he heaved himself over the rise of the pass braced for his first real glimpse of the new worldand suddenly he was surrounded by men an ambush bink whirled to run maybe he could trick them into plunging into the shield and be rid of them the easy waynot that he wanted to be responsible for their death anyhow he had to try to escape them but as he turned his body responding somewhat slower than his thoughts he found a man behind him blocking the way with drawn sword the sensible thing to do was to give up they had him outnumbered and surrounded and they could have put an arrow into his back if they had wanted to kill him outright if all they wanted to do was rob him he had almost nothing to lose but being sensible had never been binks strong point not when he was under pressure or surprised reflecting after the fact he was very sensible and intelligent but that wasnt much use at this stage if only hed had a talent like that of his mother only stronger so that he could turn time back a couple of hours and replay ail his crises to better advantage bink charged the man with the sword swinging his staff to block the blade but someone tackled him bringing him down hard before he took two steps binks face struck the dirt and he took a mouthful still he fought twisting about to get at the man who held him then they were all on him bearing him down bink had no chance in moments he was tied and gagged a man thrust his tough face close to binks eyes as two others held him erect now get this xanth you try any magic well knock you out and carry you magic they didnt know that bink had none he could useor that if he had it would be no good out here beyond the shield but he nodded showing he understood maybe they would treat him better if they thought he could somehow strike back they marched him down the other side of the pass and to a military camp on the mainland beyond the isthmus what was an army doing here if it were an invasion of xanth it could not succeed the shield would kill a thousand men as readily as one they brought him to the main tent here in a screened enclosure sat a handsome man in his forties wearing some sort of green mundane uniform a sword a neat mustache and an emblem of command here is the spy general the sergeant said respectfully the general glanced at bink appraising him there was dismaying intelligence in that cool study this was no bandit thug release him he said quietly he is obviously harmless yes sir the sergeant said respectfully he untied bink and removed his gag dismissed the general murmured and without a word the soldiers were gone they were certainly disciplined bink chafed at his wrists trying to rub the pain out amazed at the generals confidence the man was well formed but not large bink was younger and taller and surely stronger if he acted quickly he might escape bink crouched ready to jump at the man and knock him down suddenly the generals sword was in his hand pointing at bink the mans draw had been a blur the weapon had jumped to his hand as if by magic but that obviously could not be the case here i would not advise it young man the general said as if warning him not to step on a thorn bink staggered trying to brake without falling on the point of the sword he did not succeed but as his chest bore on that blade the sword retreated returning to its scabbard the general now on his feet caught bink by his elbows and stood him back upright there was such precision and power in the action that bink knew he had grossly underestimated this man he had no chance to overcome him with or without the sword be seated the general said mildly cowed bink moved awkwardly to the wooden chair and sat on it now he was conscious of his own dirty face and hands the disorganization of his apparel in contrast to the impeccable nearness of the general your name bink he did not give his village since he was no longer affiliated with it what was the purpose of this question anyway he was a nonentity regardless of his name i am the magician trent perhaps you know of me it took a moment for the import to register then bink didnt believe it trent hes gone he was exiled twenty years ago precisely but trent was ugly a monster crazy the magician smiled showing none of these traits what stories do they tell of me today in xanth bink thought of justin tree the fish of the stream turned to lightning bugs to harass the centaurs the opponents who had been transformed to water forms and left to die on land youhe was a powerhungry spellcaster who tried to usurp the throne of xanth when i was but a child an evil man whose evil still lives after him trent nodded this is a kinder repute than is normally accorded the loser in a political contest i was about your present age when i was banished perhaps our cases are similar no i never killed anyone they accuse me of that too i transformed many but i did that instead of killing i have no need to kill since i can render an enemy harmless by other means a fish on land still dies oh so that is how they put it that would indeed be murder i did transform enemies to fishbut always in water on land i utilized only land forms possibly some subsequently died but that was the doing of predators in the normal course of nature i never i dont care you abused your magic i am not at all like you ihad no magic the fair eyebrow lifted expressively no magic everybody in xanth has magic because they exile those who dont have it bink said with a flash of bitterness trent smiled and it was a surprisingly winning expression nevertheless our interests may be parallel bink how would you like to return with me to xanth for an instant wild hope flared in his breast return but immediately he quashed it there is no return oh i wouldnt say that to every act of magic there is a countermagic it is merely a matter of invoking it you see i have developed a counter to the shield again bink had to take stock of his reactions if you had that you could have gone into xanth already well there is a certain small problem of application you see what i have is an elixir distilled from a plant that grows on the very fringe of the magical zone the magic extends somewhat beyond the shield you understandotherwise the shield itself wouldnt work for it is magic and cannot operate beyond the magic demesnes this plant which seems to be of basically mundane stock competes at the fringe with the magical plants of xanth it is very difficult to compete with magic so it evolved a very special property it suppresses magic do you appreciate the significance suppresses magic maybe thats what happened to me trent studied him with that disquieting calculation so you feel you were wronged by the present administration we do have something in common bink wanted no common ground with the evil magician however winning the mans aspect might be he knew that evil could put on an extremely fair face otherwise how would evil ever have survived in the world so long what are you getting at the shield is magic therefore the elixir should nullify it but it does not because the source of the shield is not touched it is necessary to reach the shieldstone itself unfortunately we do not know precisely where that stone is now and there is not enough elixir to blanket the entire peninsula of xanth or even a significant fraction of it makes no difference bink said your knowing where the shieldstone is would not bring it within your reach ah but it would you see we have a catapult with a sufficient range to drop a bomb anywhere in nearby xanth we have it mounted on a ship that can sail fight around xanth so it is very likely that we could drop a container of elixir on the shieldstoneif we only had the precise coordinates now bink understood the shield would collapse and my army would overrun xanth of course the magicdamping effect would be temporary for the elixir dissipates readilybut a mere ten minutes would suffice to get the bulk of my army across the line i have been drilling the men in swift shortrange maneuvers after that it would be merely a matter of time until the throne was mine you would return us to the days of conquest and ravage bink said horrified the thirteenth wave worse than all the rest by no means my army is disciplined we shall exert precisely that force that is necessary no more my magic will probably eliminate most resistance anyway so there need be very little violence i do not wish to ruin the kingdom i am to rule so you havent changed bink said youre still hungry for illicit power oh i have changed trent assured him i have become less naive more educated and sophisticated the mundanes have excellent educational facilities and a broader world view and they are ruthless politicians i will not this time underestimate the determination of my opposition or leave myself foolishly vulnerable i have no doubt i will make a better king than i would have twenty years ago well count me out but i must count you in bink you know where the shieldstone is located the evil magician leaned forward persuasively it is important that the shot be precise we have only a quarter pound of elixir and that is the labor of two years work we have virtually denuded the fringe region of the source plants our supply is irreplaceable we dare not guess at the location of the shieldstone we require a precise mapa map that only you can draw so there it was trent had posted his men to ambush any travelers from xanth so that they could update him on the precise position of the shieldstone that was the only piece of information the evil magician needed to initiate his wave of conquest bink had merely happened to be the first exile to walk into the trap no i wont tell you i wont help overthrow the legitimate government of xanth legitimacy is commonly defined after the fact trent remarked had i been successful twenty years ago i would now be the legitimate king and the present monarch would be a reviled outcast noted for drowning people irresponsibly i presume the storm king still governs yes bink said shortly the evil magician might try to convince him that it all was merely palace politics but he knew better i am prepared to make you a very handsome offer bink virtually anything you might desire in xanth wealth authority women he had said the wrong thing bink turned away he would not want sabrina on that basis anyway and he had already turned down what amounted to a similar offer by the sorceress iris trent steepled his fingers even in that minor mannerism there was implied power and ruthlessness the magicians plans were too finely meshed to be balked by a willful exile you may wonder why i choose to return to xanth after two decades and evident success in mundania i have spent some time analyzing that myself no bink said but the man only smiled refusing to be ruffled and again bink had the uneasy feeling that he was being skillfully maneuvered that he was about to play into the hands of the magician no matter how he tried to fight it you should wonder lest you allow your outlook to be unconscionably narrow as mine was when i emerged from xanth every young man should go abroad into the mundane world for a period of a year or two at least it would make him a better citizen of xanth travel of any type tends to broaden one bink could not argue with that he had learned a great deal in his twoweek tour of xanth how much more would a year in mundania teach him in fact the magician continued when i assume power i shall institute such a policy xanth cannot prosper cut off from the real world in isolation is only stagnation bink could not restrain his morbid curiosity the magician had intelligence and experience that appealed insidiously to binks own intellect what is it like out there do not speak with such distaste young man mundania is not the evil place you may imagine that is part of the reason the citizens of xanth need more exposure to it the ignorance of isolation breeds unwarranted hostility mundania is in many respects more advanced more civilized than xanth deprived of the benefits of magic the mundanes have had to compensate in ingenious ways they have turned to philosophy medicine and science they now have weapons called guns that can kill more readily than an arrow or even a deadly spell i have trained my troops in other weapons because i do not wish to introduce guns into xanth they have carriages that carry them across the land as fast as a unicorn can run and boats that row across the sea as swiftly as a sea serpent can swim and balloons that take them as high in the air as a dragon can fly they have people called doctors who heal the sick and wounded without the use of a single spell and a device consisting of little beads on columns that multiplies figures with marvelous speed and accuracy ludicrous bink said even magic cant do figures for a person unless it is a golem and then it has really become a person this is what i mean bink magic is marvelous but it is also limited in the long run the instruments of the mundanes may have greater potential probably the basic life style of the mundanes is more comfortable than that of many xanths there probably arent as many of them bink muttered so they have no competition for good land on the contrary there are many millions of people there youre never going to convince me of anything telling such tall stories bink pointed out the north village of xanth has about five hundred people counting all the children and thats the largest one there cant be more than two thousand people in the whole kingdom you talk of thousands of thousands of people but i know the mundane world cant be much larger than xanth the evil magician shook his head in mock sadness bink bink none so blind as those who will not see and if they really have balloons flying through the air carrying people why havent they flown them over xanth bink demanded hotly knowing he had the magician on the run because they dont know where xanth isdont even believe it exists they dont believe in magic so dont believe in magic the humor had never been very funny and it was getting worse the mundanes never did know very much about magic trent said seriously it appears a great deal in their literature but never in their daily lives the shield has closed off the border as it were so no truly magic animal has been seen in mundania in about a century and it may be to our interest to keep them ignorant he continued frowning if they ever get the notion xanth is a threat to them they might use a giant catapult to lob in firebombs he broke off shaking his head as though at some horrible thought bink had to admire the perfection of the mannerism which was as apt as any his father roland employed he could almost believe there was some fantastic threat lurking no the magician concluded the location of xanth must remain secretfor now it wont remain secret if you send all xanth youths out into mundania for two years oh we would put an amnesia spell on them first and revoke it only after they returned or at least a geis of silence so no mundane could learn from them about xanth thus they would acquire mundane experience to augment their xanth magic some trusted ones would be permitted to retain their memories and freedom of speech outside so they could act as liaisons recruiting qualified colonists and keeping us informed for our own safety and progress but overall the fourth wave again bink said controlled colonization trent smiled you are an apt pupil many citizens choose not to comprehend the true nature of the original colonizations of xanth actually xanth never was very easy to locate from mundania because it seems to have no fixed geographic location historically people have colonized xanth from all over the world always walking across the land bridge directly from their own countriesand all would have sworn that they migrated only a few miles furthermore all comprehended one anothers speech in xanth though their original languages were entirely different so it would appear that there is something magical about the approach to xanth had i not kept meticulous notes of my route i would never have found my way back this far the mundane legends of the animals that departed from xanth in bygone centuries show that they appeared all over the world rather than at any specific site so it seems to work in reverse too he shook his head as if it were a great mystery and bink was hard put to it not to become hopelessly intrigued by the concept how could xanth be everywhere at once did its magic extend after all beyond the peninsula in some peculiar fashion it would be easy to get hooked by the problem if you like mundania so well why are you trying to get back into xanth bink demanded trying to distract himself from temptation by focusing on the magicians contradictions i dont like mundania trent said frowning i merely point out that it is not evil and that it has considerable potential and must be reckoned with if we do not keep aware of it it may become aware of usand that could destroy us right along with itself xanth represents a haven like none other known to man a provincial backward haven to be surebut there is no other place quite like it and ii am a magician i belong in my land with my people protecting them from the horrors arising which you are not equipped even to imagine he lapsed into silence well no mundane tales are going to make me tell you how to get into xanth bink said firmly the magicians eyes focused on bink as if only now was he becoming aware of his presence i would prefer not to have to employ coercion trent said softly you know my talent bink felt a shiver of extremely ugly apprehension trent was the transformerthe one who changed men into treesor worse the most potent magician of the past generationtoo dangerous to be allowed to remain in xanth then he felt relief youre bluffing he said your magic cant work outside xanthand im not going to let you into xanth it is not very much of a bluff trent said evenly the magic as i mentioned extends slightly beyond the shield i can take you to that border and transform you into a toad and i shall do itif i have to binks relief tightened back into a knot in his stomach transformationthe notion of losing his lifelong body without actually dying had an insidious horror it terrified him but he still could not betray his homeland no he said his tongue feeling thick in his mouth i dont understand bink you surely did not leave xanth voluntarily i offer you the chance to get your own back not that way trent sighed with seemingly genuine regret you are loyal to your principles and i cannot fault you for that i had hoped it would not come to this bink had hoped so too but he seemed to have no choice except to watch his chance to make a break for it risking his life to escape better a clean death in combat than to become a toad a soldier entered reminding bink faintly of crombie mainly a matter of bearing not appearanceand stood at attention what is it hastings trent inquired mildly sir there is another person through the shield trent hardly showed his elation really it seems we have another source of information bink felt a new emotion but hardly a comfortable one if there were another exile from xanth the magician could get his information without binks help would he let bink go or turn him into a toad anyway as an object lesson remembering trents reputation of past times bink had little confidence that he would be freed anyone who balked the evil magician in whatever trifling manner was in for it unless bink gave him the information now redeeming himself should he since it could make no difference to the future of xanth he saw trent pausing looking at him expectantly suddenly bink caught on this was a setup a fake announcement to make him talk and he had almost fallen for it well you wont he needing me then bink said one thing about being turned into a toadhe couldnt tell the magician anything at all in that form he imagined a potential dialogue between man and toad magician where is the shieldstone toad croak bink almost smiled trent would transform him only as a last resort now trent returned to the messenger bring the other one here i will question him immediately sirit is a woman a woman trent seemed mildly surprised but bink was amazed this was not what he expected in a bluff there was certainly no woman being exiledand no man either what was trent trying to do unless oh nounless sabrina had after all followed him out dismay tore at him if the evil magician had her in his power no it could not be sabrina did not really love him the exile and her reaction to it had proved that she would not give up all she had to follow him out it simply was not in her nature and he didnt really love her he had already decided that so this had to be a complex ruse on the part of the magician very well trent said bring her in it couldnt be a bluff then not if they actually brought her in and if it were sabrinait couldnt be he was quite absolutely positively certain of thator was he projecting attributing his own attitudes to her how could he really know what was in her heart if she had followed him he couldnt let her be changed into a toad yet with all of xanth at stake bink threw up his hands mentally he would just have to play it as it came if they had sabrina he was lost if it were an ingenious bluff he had won except that he would he a toad perhaps being a toad would not he so bad no doubt flies would taste very good and the lady toads would look as good as human girls did now maybe the great love of his life was waiting in the grass warts and all the ambush detail arrived half carrying a struggling woman bink saw with relief that it was not sabrina but a marvelously ugly female he had never seen before her hair was wild her teeth gnarled her body sexually shapeless stand trent said mildly and she stood responsive to his easy air of command your name fanchon she said rebelliously yours the magician trent never heard of you bink caught by surprise had to cough to conceal his snort of laughter but trent was unperturbed this puts us on an even footing fanchon i regret the inconvenience my men have caused you if you will kindly inform me of the location of the shieldstone i shall pay you well and send you on your way dont tell him bink cried he means to invade xanth she wrinkled her bulbous nose what do i care about xanth she squinted at trent i could tell youbut how do i know i can trust you you might kill me as soon as you had your information trent tapped his long aristocratic fingers together this is a legitimate concern you have no way of knowing whether my given word is good yet it should be obvious that i should bear no malice to those who assist me in the pursuit of my objectives all right she said makes sense the shieldstone is at traitor bink screamed remove him trent snapped soldiers entered and grabbed him and hustled him out he had accomplished nothing except to make it harder for himself but then he thought of another aspect what were the chances of another exile coming from xanth within an hour after him there couldnt be more than one or two exiles a year it was big news when anyone left xanth he had heard nothing about it and no second trial had been scheduled sofanchon was not an exile she was probably not from xanth at all she was an agent planted by trent just as bink had first suspected her purpose was to convince bink that she was telling trent the location of the shieldstone tricking him into confirming it well he had figured out the schemeand so he had won do what he might trent would not get into xanth yet there was a nagging uncertainty chapter transformer bink was thrown into a pit a pile of hay broke his fall and a wooden roof set on four tall posts shaded him from the sun other than that his prison was barren and bleak indeed the walls were of some stonelike substance too hard to dig into with his bare hands too sheer to climb the floor was packed earth he walked around it the wall was solid all around and too high for him to surmount he could almost touch the top when he jumped and reached up but a lattice of metal bars across the top sealed him in he might with special effort get high enough to catch hold of one of those barsbut then all he would be able to do would be to hang there it might represent exercise but it wouldnt get him out so the cage was tight he had hardly come to this conclusion before soldiers came to stand at the grate shaking rust onto him they stood in the shade of the roof while one of them squatted down to unlock the little door set in that grate and swing it up and open then they dropped a person through it was the woman fanchon bink jumped across wrapping his arms around her before she hit the straw breaking her fall they both sprawled in the hay the door slammed shut and the lock clicked now i know my beauty didnt overwhelm you she remarked as they disentangled i was afraid youd break a leg bink said defensively i almost did when they threw me in here she glanced down at her knobby knees showing beneath her dull skirt a break couldnt hurt the appearance of either leg not far off the mark bink had never seen a more homely girl than this one but what was she doing here why should the evil magician throw his stooge in the den with his prisoner this was no way to trick the captive into talking the proper procedure would be to tell bink she had talked and offer him his freedom for confirming the information even if she were genuine she still should not have been confined with him she could have been imprisoned separately then the guards would tell each one that the other had talked now if she had been beautiful they might have thought she could vamp him into telling but as she was not a chance it just didnt seem to make sense why didnt you tell him about the shieldstone bink inquired not certain with what irony he intended it if she were a fake she could not have told but she also should not have been dumped in here if she were genuine she must be loyal to xanth but then why had she said she would tell trent where the shieldstone was i told him she said she had told him now bink hoped she was phony yes she said looking him straight in the eye i told him how it was set under the throne in the kings palace in the north village bink tried to assess the ramifications of this statement it was the wrong locationbut did she know this or was she trying to trick him into a reaction a revelation of its real locationwhile the guards listened or was she a true exile who knew the location and had lied about it that would account for trents reaction because if trents catapult lobbed an elixir bomb on the palace of xanth not only would it fail to disrupt the shield it would alert the kingor at least the more alert ministers who were not foolsto the nature of the threat the damping out of magic in that vicinity would quickly give it away had trent actually lobbed his bomb and had he now lost all hope of penetrating xanth the moment the threat was known they would move the shieldstone to a new secret location so that no information from exiles would be valid no if that had happened trent would have turned fanchon into a toad and stepped on her and he would not have bothered to keep bink prisoner bink might have been killed or released but not simply kept so nothing that drastic had happened anyway there had not been time for all that i see you dont trust me fanchon said a fair analysis i cant afford to he admitted i dont want anything to happen to xanth why should you care since you got kicked out i knew the rule i was given a fair hearing fair hearing she exclaimed indignantly the king didnt even read humfreys note or taste the water from the spring of life bink paused again how would she know that oh come on she said i passed through your village only hours after your trial it was the talk of the town how the magician humfrey had authenticated your magic but the king okay okay bink said obviously she had come from xanth but he still wasnt sure how far he could trust her yet she must know the shieldstones locationand hadnt told it unless she had told it and trent didnt believe her so was waiting for corroboration from bink but she had announced the wrong location no purpose in that regardless bink could challenge her on it but that would still not give away the right location there were a thousand potential spots so probably she meant what she said she had tried to fool trent and had not succeeded so the balance in binks mind shifted now he believed she was from xanth and she had not betrayed it that was what the available evidence suggested how complex could trents machinations become maybe he had a mundane machine that could somehow pick up news from inside the shield ormore likelyhe had a magic mirror set up in the magic zone just outside the shield so he could learn interior news noin that case he could have ascertained the location of the shieldstone directly bink felt dizzy he didnt know what to thinkbut he certainly wasnt going to mention the key location i wasnt exiled if thats what youre thinking fanchon said they dont yet ban people for being ugly i emigrated voluntarily voluntarily why well i had two reasons what two reasons she looked at him im afraid you would not believe either one try me and see first the magician humfrey told me it was the simplest solution to my problem what problem bink was hardly in a good mood she gave him another straight look that mounted to a stare must i spell it out bink found himself reddening obviously her problem was her appearance fanchon was a young woman but she was not plain not homely but uglythe living proof that youth and health were not necessarily beauty no clothing no makeup could help her nearly enough only magic could do it which seemed to make her departure from xanth nonsensical was her judgment as warped as her body faced with the social necessity of changing the subject he fixed on another objection an aspect of his thought but theres no magic in mundania precisely again his logic stumbled fanchon was as difficult to talk with as to look at you meanmagic makes youwhat you are what a marvel of tact he demonstrated but she did not chide him for his lack of social grace yes more or less why didnt humfrey charge you his fee he couldnt stand the sight of me worse and worse uhwhat was your other reason for leaving xanth that i shall not tell you at this time it figured she had said he wouldnt believe her reasons and he had believed the first one so she wouldnt tell him the other typically female logic well we seem to be prisoners together bink said glancing around the pit again it remained as dismal as ever do you think theyre going to feed us certainly fanchon said trent will come around and dangle bread and water at us and ask which one would like to give him the information that one will be fed it will become increasingly difficult to turn him down as time passes you have a gruesomely quick comprehension i am gruesomely smart she said in fact it is fair to say i am as smart as i am ugly yes indeed are you smart enough to figure out how to get out of here no i dont think escape is possible she said shaking her head in a definite yes oh bink said taken aback her words said no her gesture said yes was she crazy noshe knew the guards were listening though they were out of sight so she sent them one message while sending bink another which meant she had figured out an escape already it was now afternoon a shaft of sunlight spilled through the grate finding its route past the edge of the roof just as well bink thought it would get unbearably dank in here if the sun never reached the bottom trent came to the grate i trust you two have made your acquaintance he said pleasantly are you hungry now it comes fanchon muttered i apologize for the inconvenience of your quarters trent said squatting down with perfect aplomb it was as if he were meeting them in a clean office if you both will give me your word not to depart these premises or interfere with our activities in any way i shall arrange a comfortable tent for you therein lies subversion fanchon said to bink once you start accepting favors you become obligated dont do it she was making extraordinary sense no deal bink said you see trent continued smoothly if you were in a tent and you tried to escape my guards would have to put arrows in you and i dont want that to happen it would be most uncomfortable for you and would imperil my source of information so it is vital that i have you confined by one means or another by word or bond as it were this pit has the sole virtue of being secure you could always let us go bink said since you arent going to get the information anyway if that ruffled the evil magician he did not show it here is some cake and wine trent said lowering a package on a cord neither bink nor fanchon reached for it though bink suddenly felt hungry and thirsty the odors of spice wafted through the pit temptingly obviously the package contained fresh good things please take it trent said i assure you it is neither poisoned nor drugged i want you both in good health for when you change us into toads bink asked loudly what did he have to lose really no i am afraid you have called my bluff on that toads do not speak intelligiblyand it is important to me that you speak could the evil magician have lost his talent in the course of his long mundane exile bink began to feel better the package touched the straw fanchon shrugged and squatted untying it sure enough cake and wine maybe one of us better eat now she said if nothing happens in a few hours the other eats ladies first bink said if the food were drugged and she were a spy she wouldnt touch it thank you she broke the cake in half pick a piece she said you eat that one bink said pointing very nice trent said from above you trust neither me nor each other so you are working out conventions to safeguard your interests but it really is unnecessary if i wanted to poison either of you i would merely pour it on your heads fanchon took a bite of cake this is very good she said she uncorked the wine and took a swig this too but bink remained suspicious he would wait i have been considering your cases trent said fanchon i will be direct i can transform you into any other life form even another human being he squinted down at her how would you like to be beautiful uhoh if fanchon were not a spy this would be a compelling offer the ugly one converted to beauty go away fanchon said to trent before i throw a mudball at you but then she thought of something else if youre really going to leave us here at least give us some sanitary facilities a bucket and a curtain if i had a lovely posterior i might not mind the lack of privacy but as it is i prefer to be modest aptly expressed trent said he gestured and the guards brought the items and lowered them through the hole in the grate fanchon set the pot in one corner and removed pins from her straggly hair to tack the cloth to the two walls forming a triangular chamber bink wasnt sure why a girl of her appearance should affect such modesty surely no one would gawk at her exposed flesh regardless of its rondure unless she really was extremely sensitive with her remarks making light of what remained a serious preoccupation in that case it did make sense a pretty girl could express shock and distress if someone saw her bare torso but privately she would be pleased if the reaction were favorable fanchon had no such pretense bink was sorry for her and for himself it would have made the confinement much more interesting if his companion had been scenic but actually he was grateful for the privacy too natural functions would otherwise have been awkward so he was full circle she had defined the problem before he ever started thinking it out she obviously did have a quicker mind hes not fooling about making you beautiful bink said he can it wouldnt work no trents talent i know his talent but it would only aggravate my problemeven if i were willing to betray xanth this was strange she did not want beauty then why her extraordinary sensitivity about her appearance or was this some other ploy to get him to tell the location of the shieldstone he doubted it she obviously was from xanth no outsider could have guessed about his experience with the water of the spring of life and the senile king time passed evening came fanchon suffered no ill effects so bink ate and drank his share of the meal at dusk it rained the water poured through the lattice the roof provided some shelter but enough slanted in to wet them down thoroughly anyway but fanchon smiled good she whispered the fates are with us tonight good bink shivered in his wet clothing and watched her wonderingly she scraped with her fingers in the softening floor of the pit bink walked over to see what she was up to but she waved him away make sure the guards dont see she whispered small danger of that the guards werent interested they had taken shelter from the rain and were not in sight even if they had been close it was getting too dark to see what was so important about this business she was scooping out mud from the floor and mixing it with the hay heedless of the rain bink couldnt make any sense of it was this her way of relaxing did you know any girls in xanth fanchon inquired the rain was slacking off but the darkness protected her secret workfrom binks comprehension as well as that of the guards it was a subject bink would have preferred to avoid i dont see what she moved over to him im making bricks idiot she whispered fiercely keep talkingand watch for any lights if you see anyone coming say the word chameleon ill hide the evidence in a hurry she glided back to her corner chameleon there was something about that wordnow he had it the chameleon lizard he had seen just before starting on his quest to the good magicianhis omen of the future the chameleon had died abruptly did this mean his time was come talk fanchon urged cover my sounds then in conversational tone you did know some girls uh some bink said bricks what for were they pretty her hands were blurred by the night but he could hear the little slaps of mud and rustle of hay she could be using the hay to contribute fiber to the mud brick but the whole thing was crazy did she intend to build a brick privy or not so pretty she prompted him oh pretty he said it seemed he was stuck with this topic if the guards were listening they would pay more attention to him talking about pretty girls than to her slapping mud well if that was what she wantedmy fiancйe sabrina was beautifulis beautifuland the sorceress iris seemed beautiful but i met others who werent once they get old or married they the rain had abated bink saw a light approaching chameleon he murmured again experiencing inner tension omens always were accurateif understood correctly women dont have to get ugly when they marry fanchon said the sounds had changed now she was concealing the evidence some start out that way she certainly was conscious of her condition this made him wonder again why she had turned down trents offer of beauty i met a lady centaur on my way to the magician humfrey bink said finding it difficult to concentrate even on so natural a subject as this in the face of the oddities of his situation imprisoned in a pit with an ugly girl who wanted to make bricks she was beautiful in a statuesque kind of way of course she was basically a horse bad terminology i mean from the rear she well i rode her back conscious of what the guards might think he was sayingnot that he should even care what they thoughthe eyed the approaching light he saw it mainly by reflections from the bars you know she was half equine she gave me a ride through centaur country the light diminished it must be a guard on routine patrol false alarm he whispered then in conversational tone but there was one really lovely girl on the way to the magician she washer name was he paused to concentrate wynne but she was abysmally stupid i hope the gap dragon didnt catch her you were in the gap for a while until the dragon chased me off i had to go around it im surprised you know of it i had thought there was a forget spell associated with it because it was not on my map and i never heard of it until i encountered it though how it is that i remember it in that case i lived near the gap she said you lived there when was it made what is its secret it was always there there is a forget spelli think the magician humfrey put it there but if your associations are really strong you remember at least for a while magic only goes so far maybe thats it ill never forget my experience with the dragon and the shade fanchon was making bricks again any other girls bink had the impression she had more than casual interest in the matter was it because she knew the people of the chasm region lets seethere was one other i met an ordinary girl dee she had an argument with the soldier i was with crombie he was a womanhater or at least professed to be and she walked out too bad i rather liked her oh i thought you preferred pretty girls lookdont be so damned sensitive he snapped you brought up the subject i liked dee better thanoh never mind id have been happier talking about plans to escape sorry she said ii knew about your journey around the chasm wynne and dee arefriends of mine so naturally im concerned friends of yours both of them pieces of a puzzle began to fit together what is your association with the sorceress iris fanchon laughed none at all if i were the sorceress do you think i would look like this yes bink said if you tried beauty and it didnt work and you still wanted power and figured you could somehow get it through an ignorant travelerthat would explain why trent couldnt tempt you with the promise of beauty that would only ruin your coverand you could be beautiful any time you wanted to be so you might follow me out in a disguise nobody would suspect and of course you would not help another magician take over xanth so id come right out here into mundania where there is no magic she finished therefore no illusion that gutted his case or did it maybe this is the way you actually look i may never have seen the real iris there on her island and how would i get back into xanth for that bink had no answer he responded with bluster well why did you come here obviously the nonmagic aspect has not solved your problem well it takes time time to cancel out magic certainly when dragons used to fly out over mundania before the shield was set up it would take them days or weeks to fade maybe even longer magician humfrey says there are many pictures and descriptions of dragons and other magic beasts in mundane texts the mundanes dont see dragons any more so they think the old texts are fantasy but this proves that it takes a while for the magic in a creature or person to dissipate so a sorceress could retain her illusion for a few days after all bink said she sighed maybe so but im not iris though i certainly wouldnt mind being her i had entirely different and compelling reasons to leave xanth yes i remember one was to lose your magic whatever it was and the other you wouldnt tell me i suppose you deserve to know youre going to have it out of me one way or another i learned from wynne and dee what sort of a person you were and so wynne did get away from the dragon yes thanks to you she a light was coming chameleon bink said fanchon scrambled to hide her bricks this time the light came all the way to the pit i trust you have not been flooded out down there trents voice inquired if we were wed swim away from here bink said listen magicianthe more uncomfortable you make us the less we want to help you i am keenly aware of that bink i would much prefer to provide you with a comfortable tent no bink i find it difficult to comprehend why you should be so loyal to a government that treated you so shabbily what do you know about that my spies have of course been monitoring your dialogues but i could have guessed it readily enough knowing how old and stubborn the storm king must be by now magic manifests in divers forms and when the definitions become too narrow well it doesnt make any difference here the magician persisted sounding quite reasonable in contrast to binks unreason it may be that you do lack magic bink though i hardly think humfrey would be wrong about a thing like that but you have other qualities to recommend you and you would make an excellent citizen hes right you know fanchon said you do deserve better than you were given which side are you on bink demanded she sighed in the dark she sounded very human it was easier to appreciate that quality when he couldnt see her im on your side bink i admire your loyalty im just not sure its deserved why dont you tell him where the shieldstone is thenif you know it because with all its faults xanth remains a nice place the senile king wont live forever when he dies theyll have to put in the magician humfrey and hell make things much better even if he does complain about the time its wasting him maybe some new or young magician is being born right now to take over after that itll work out somehow it always has before the last thing xanth needs is to be taken over by a cruel evil magician who would turn all his opposition into turnips trents chuckle came down from above my dear you have a keen mind and a sharp tongue actually i prefer to turn my opponents into trees they are more durable than turnips i dont suppose you could concede merely for the sake of argument that i might make a better ruler than the present king hes got a point you know bink said smiling cynically in the dark which side are you on fanchon demanded mimicking the tone bink had used before but it was trent who laughed i like you two he said i really do you have good minds and good loyalty if you would only give that loyalty to me i would be prepared to make substantial concessions for example i might grant you veto power over any transformations i made you could thus choose the turnips so wed be responsible for your crimes fanchon said that sort of power would be bound to corrupt us very soon until we were no different from you only if your basic fiber were not superior to mine trent pointed out and if it were not then you would never have been any different from me you merely have not yet been subjected to my situation it would be best if you discovered this so as not to be unconscious hypocrites bink hesitated he was wet and cold and he did not relish spending the night in this hole had trent been one to keep his word twenty years ago no he hadnt he had broken his word freely in his pursuit of power that was part of what had defeated him no one could afford to trust him not even his friends the magicians promises were valueless his logic was a tissue of rationalization designed only to get one of the prisoners to divulge the location of the shieldstone veto power over transformations bink and fanchon would be the first to be transformed once the evil one had no further need of them bink did not reply fanchon remained silent after a moment trent departed and so we weather temptation number two fanchon remarked but hes a clever and unscrupulous man it will get harder bink was afraid she was right next morning the slanting sunlight baked the crude bricks they were hardly hard yet but at least it was a start fanchon placed the items in the privacy cubicle so that they could not be seen from above she would set them out again for the afternoon sun if all went well trent came by with more food fresh fruit and milk i dislike putting it on this footing he said but my patience is wearing thin at any time they might move the shieldstone routinely rendering your information valueless if one of you does not give me the information i need today tomorrow i shall transform you both you bink will be a cockatrice you fanchon a basilisk you will be confined in the same cage bink and fanchon looked at each other with complete dismay cockatrice and basilisktwo names for the same thing a winged reptile hatched from a yolkless egg laid by a rooster and hatched by a toad in the warmth of a dungheap the stench of its breath was so bad that it wilted vegetation and shattered stone and the very sight of its face would cause other creatures to keel over dead basiliskthe little king of the reptiles the chameleon of his omen had metamorphosed into the likeness of a basiliskjust before it died now he had been reminded of the chameleon by a person who could not have known about that omen and threatened with transformation into surely death was drawing nigh its a bluff fanchon said at last he cant really do it hes just trying to scare us hes succeeding bink muttered perhaps a demonstration would be in order trent said i ask no person to take my magic on faith when it is so readily demonstrable it is necessary for me to perform regularly to restore my full talent after the long layoff in mundania so the demonstration is quite convenient for me he snapped his fingers allow the prisoners to finish their meal he said to the guard who reported then remove them from the cell he left now fanchon was glum for another reason he may be bluffingbut if they come down in here theyll find the bricks that will finish us anyway not if we move right out giving them no trouble bink said they wont come down here unless they have to lets hope so she said when the guards came bink and fanchon scrambled up the rope ladder the moment it was dropped were calling the magicians bluff bink said there was no reaction from the soldiers the party marched eastward across the isthmus toward xanth within sight of the shield trent stood beside a wire cage soldiers stood in a ring around him arrows nocked to bows they all wore smoked glasses it looked very grim now i caution you trent said as they arrived do not look directly at each others faces after the transformation i can not restore the dead to life if this were another scare tactic it was effective fanchon might doubt but bink believed he remembered justin tree legacy of trents ire of twenty years ago the omen loomed large in his mind first to be a basilisk then to die trent caught binks look of apprehension have you anything to say to me he inquired as if routinely yes how did they manage to exile you without getting turned into toads or turnips or worse trent frowned that was not precisely what i meant bink but in the interest of harmony i will answer an aide i trusted was bribed to put a sleep spell on me while i slept they carried me across the shield how do you know it wont happen again you cant stay awake all the time you know i spent much time pondering that whole problem in the long early years of my exile i concluded that i had brought the deception upon myself i had been faithless to others and so others were faithless to me i was not entirely without honor i breached my given word only for what i deemed to be sufficient cause yet thats the same as lying bink said i did not think so at the time but i dare say my reputation in that respect did not improve in my absence it is ever the privilege of the victor to present the loser as completely corrupt thus justifying the victory nevertheless my word was not my absolute bond and in time i realized that this was the fundamental flaw in my character that had been my undoing the only way to prevent repetition was to change my own mode of operation and so i no longer deceiveever and no one deceives me it was a fair answer the evil magician was in many respects the opposite of the popular image instead of being ugly weak and meanhumfrey fitted that description betterhe was handsome strong and urbane yet he was the villain and bink knew better than to let fair words deceive him fanchon stand forth trent said fanchon stepped toward him open cynicism on her face trent did not gesture or chant he merely glanced at her with concentration she vanished a soldier swooped in with a butterfly net slamming it down on something in a moment he held it up a struggling baleful lizardlike thing with wings it really was a basilisk bink quickly averted his eyes lest he look directly at its horrible face and meet its deadly gaze the soldier dumped the thing into the cage and another smokeglassprotected soldier shoved on the lid the remaining soldiers relaxed visibly the basilisk scrambled around seeking some escape but there was none it glared at the wire confinement but its gaze had no effect on the metal a third soldier dropped a cloth over the cage cutting off the view of the little monster now bink himself relaxed the whole thing had obviously been carefully prepared and rehearsed the soldiers knew exactly what to do bink stand forth trent said exactly as before bink was terrified but a comer of his mind protested its still a bluff shes in on it they have rigged it to make me think she was transformed and that im to be next all her arguments against trent were merely to make her seem legitimate preparing for this moment still he only half believed that the omen lent it a special awful conviction death hovered as it were on the silent wings of a moth hawk close yet he could not betray his homeland weakkneed he stepped forth trent focused on himand the world jumped confused and frightened bink scrambled for the safety of a nearby bush the green leaves withered as he approached then the net came down trapping him remembering his escape from the gap dragon he dodged at the last moment backtracking and the net just missed him he glared up at the soldier who startled had allowed his smoked glasses to fall askew their gazes metand the man tumbled backward stricken the butterfly net flew wide but another soldier grabbed it bink scooted for the withered bush again but this time the net caught him he was scooped inside wings flapping helplessly tail thrashing and getting its barb caught in the fabric claws snarled beak snapping at nothing then he was dumped out two shakes three and his claws and tail were dislodged he landed on his back wings outspread an anguished squawk escaped him as he righted himself the light dimmed he was in the cage and it had just been covered so that no one outside could see his face he was a cockatrice some demonstration not only had he seen fanchon transformed he had experienced it himself and killed a soldier merely by looking at him if there had been any skeptics in trents army there would be none now he saw the curling barbed tail of another of his kind a female but her back was to him his cockatrice nature took over he didnt want company angrily he pounced on her biting digging in with his talons she twisted around instantly the muscular serpents tail providing leverage for a moment they were face to face she was hideous frightful loathsome ghastly and revolting he had never before experienced anything so repulsive yet she was female and therefore possessed of a certain fundamental attraction the paradoxical repulsion and attraction overwhelmed him and he lost consciousness when he woke he had a headache he lay on the hay in the pit it was late afternoon it seems the stare of the basilisk is overrated fanchon said neither of us died so it had really happened not quite bink agreed but i feel a bit dead as he spoke he realized something that had not quite surfaced before the basilisk was a magical creature that could do magic he had been an intelligent cockatrice who had magically stricken an enemy what did that do to his theory of magic well you put up a good fight fanchon was saying theyve already buried that soldier it is quiet like death in this camp now like deathhad that been the meaning of his omen he had not died but he had killedwithout meaning to in a manner completely foreign to his normal state had the omen been fulfilled bink sat up another realization coming trents talent is genuine we were transformed we really were it is genuine we really were she agreed somberly i admit i doubtedbut now i believe he must have changed us back while we were unconscious yes he was only making a demonstration it was an effective one it was she shuddered binkii dont know whether i can take that again it wasnt just the change it was i know you made a hell of an ugly basilisk i would make a hell of an ugly anything but the sheer malignancy stupidity and awfulnessthose things are foul to spend the rest of my life like that i cant blame you bink said but still something nagged at his mind the experience had been so momentous that he knew it would take a long time for his mind to sift through all its aspects i didnt think anyone could make me go against my conscience but this this she put her face into her hands bink nodded silently after a moment he shifted the subject did you notice those creatures were male and female of course she said gaining control of herself now that she had something to orient on we are male and female the magician can change our forms but not our sexes but the basilisks should be neuter hatched of eggs laid by roosters there are no parent basilisks only roosters she nodded thoughtfully catching hold of the problem youre right if there are males and females they should mate and reproduce their own kind which means by definition they arent basilisks a paradox there must be something wrong with the definition bink said either theres a lot of superstition about the origins of monsters or we were not genuine basilisks we were genuine she said grimacing with renewed horror im sure now for the first time in my life im glad for my human form which was quite an admission for her that means trents magic is alltheway real bink said he doesnt just change the form he really converts things into other things if you see what i mean then the thing that had nagged at his mind before came clear but if magic fades outside xanth beyond the narrow magic band beyond the shield all we would have to do would be to go into mundania she exclaimed catching on in time we would revert to our proper forms so it would not be permanent so his transformation ability is a bluff even though it is real he said he would have to keep us caged right there or wed escape and get out of his power he has to get all the way into xanth or he really has very little power no more power than he already has as general of his armythe power to kill all he can get now is the tantalizing taste of real power she said ill bet he wants to get into xanth but meanwhile were still in his power she set out the bricks catching the limited sunlight what are you going to do she asked if he lets me go ill travel on into mundania thats where i was headed before i was ambushed one thing trent has shown me it is possible to survive out there but ill make sure to note my route carefully it seems xanth is hard to find from the other direction i meant about the shieldstone nothing you wont tell him no of course not he said now we know his magic cant really hurt us worse than his soldiers can some of the terror is gone not that it matters i dont blame you for telling him she looked at him her face was still ugly but there was something special in it now you know youre quite a man bink no im nothing much i have no magic you have magic you just dont know what it is same thing i followed you out here you know her meaning was coming clear she had heard about him in xanth the traveler with no spell she had known that would be no liability in mundania what better matchthe man with no magic the woman with no beauty similar liabilities perhaps he could get used to her appearance in time her other qualities were certainly commendable except for one thing i understand your position he said but if you cooperate with the evil magician i wont have anything to do with you even if he makes you beautiful not that it matters you can get your reward in xanth when he takes over if he honors his given word this time you restore my courage she said lets make a break for it how the bricks dummy theyre hard now as soon as its dark well make a pile the grate keeps us in its door is still locked a step wont make any difference if just getting up there were the only problem i could lift you there is a difference she murmured we pile the bricks stand on them and push the whole grate up its not anchored i checked that when they brought us in here gravity holds it down its heavy but youre strong bink looked up with sudden hope you could prop it up after i heave step by step until not so loud she whispered fiercely they may still be eavesdropping but she nodded youve got the idea its not a sure thing but its worth a try and well have to make a raid on the store of elixir so he cant use it even if someone else comes out to tell him where the shieldstone is ive been working it all out bink smiled he was beginning to like her chapter chase at night they piled up the bricks some crumbled for the scant sunlight had not been sufficient to bake them properly but on the whole they were surprisingly sturdy bink listened carefully for the guards waiting until they took what they called a break then he stepped to the top of the brick pile braced his hands against the edge of the grate and shoved as his muscles tightened he suddenly realized that this was fanchons real reason for demanding the privacy curtain of the privy it had not been to hide her unsightly anatomy but to hide the bricksso they would be preserved for this moment this effort to escape and he had never caught on the revelation gave him strength he shoved hardand the grate rose with surprising ease fanchon scrambled up beside him and jammed the privy pot under the lifted edge ugh maybe some year someone would develop a pot that smelled of roses but it did the job it supported the grate as he eased off now there was room to scramble out bink gave her a boost then hauled himself up no guards saw them they were free the elixir is on that ship fanchon whispered pointing into the darkness how do you know that bink asked we passed it on our way to thetransformation its the only thing that would be guarded so carefully and you can see the catapult aboard it she had certainly kept her eyes open ugly she might be but she was smart he hadnt thought to survey the premises with such an analytic eye now getting that elixir will be a problem she continued i think wed better take the whole ship can you sail ive never been on anything bigger than a rowboat in my life except maybe iriss yacht and that wasnt real id probably get seasick me too she agreed were landlubbers so theyll never look for us there come on well it was better than being changed into a cockatrice they crept down to the beach and entered the water bink looked back nervously and saw a light moving toward the pit hurry he whispered we forgot to put the grate back down theyll know were gone right away at least they were both reasonably good swimmers they shed their clothingwhat had happened to it during the transformations again no explaining the details of magicand stroked silently for the sailboat moored a quarter mile out bink was alarmed by the dark depths of the water beneath him what type of monsters dwelled in mundane seas the water was not cold and the exertion of swimming helped warm him but gradually bink tired and felt chilled fanchon suffered similarly the ship had not seemed far viewed from land but that had been walking distance swimming distance was quite another matter then the hue and cry commenced back at the prison pit lights flared everywhere moving around like fireflies but setting no fires bink had an infusion of new strength weve got to get there fast he gasped fanchon didnt answer she was too busy swimming the swim was interminable it drained strength from bink making him become more pessimistic but at last they came up to the ship a sailor was standing on the deck a silhouette in the light of the moon peering at the shore fanchon drew close to bink you goother side she gasped idistract she had guts the sailor might put an arrow in her but bink stroked laboriously around the keel moving to the far side the ship was about forty feet long large by xanth standards but if any part of what trent had said about mundania was true there were much larger ships there he reached up and put his fingers on the edge of the hull he tried to think of the name of this portion of a ships anatomy but could not he hoped there werent other sailors watching he had to haul himself up slowly over the gunwalethat was the name as not to rock the boat now fanchon with superlative timing made a clamor as of someone drowning the sailors went to the railfour of them in alland bink heaved himself up as silently as he could he scraped for his muscles felt leaden unresponsive his wet body slapped against the deck and the ship tilted back a bit under his weight but the sailors stood riveted to the other side watching the show bink got to his feet and slunk up to the mast the sails were furled so that it offered scant concealment they would see him when they turned with their lamps well he would have to act first he felt ill equipped to indulge in combat his arms and feet cold and heavy but it was necessary he walked silently up behind the four his heart pounding they were leaning over the rail trying to see fanchon who was still making a considerable commotion bink put his left hand against the back of the nearest sailor and caught the mans trouser with his right hand he heaved hard and suddenlyand the sailor went up and over with a cry of alarm bink swung immediately to the next grabbing and shoving the man had started to turn toward his companions exclamationsbut too late bink heaved and the sailor went over almost over one hand caught the rail the sailor clung twisting around to face inward bink knocked at his fingers and finally pried them loose and the man dropped into the water but the loss of time and momentum had been crucial now the other two were upon bink one wrapped an arm around binks shoulder trying to choke him while the other hovered behind what had crombie said to do in a situation like this bink concentrated and remembered he grabbed the man bent his knees leaned forward and heaved it worked beautifully the sailor sailed over binks shoulder and crashed on his back on the deck but the last one was stepping in fists swinging he caught bink on the side of the head with glancing but numbing force bink fell to the deck himself and the man dove on top of him to make things worse bink saw one of the others climbing back aboard he put up his feet to hold off his opponent but this was only partially effective the burly sailor was pushing him down pinning himand the other was about to join in the standing figure lifted a foot bink could not even flinch his arms were tangled his body held down the foot swungand struck the head of binks antagonist the man rolled off bink with a groan it was not fun being kicked in the head but how had the kicker missed the proper target at such close range the lamps had all gone into the water along with their owners maybe in the dark a mistake help me get him over the edge fanchon said weve got to secure this ship and he had mistaken her for a sailor though she was naked well blame the inadequate light again moonlight was pretty but in a situation like this but the remaining two sailors were already rising over the gunwale acting on a common impulse bink grabbed his erstwhile opponents shoulders and fanchon grabbed his feet onetwothree heave she gasped they heaved almost together the man swung up and into his two companions all three went over the edge to splash in the sea bink hoped they were all lively enough to swim the fourth one lay on the deck apparently unconscious pull up the anchor fanchon ordered ill get a pole she ran to the ships cabin a lean figure in the moonlight bink found the anchor chain and hauled on it the thing snagged infuriatingly because he did not know how to make it let go but finally he got it up what did you do to this guy fanchon demanded kneeling beside the fallen sailor i threw him crombie showed me how crombie i dont remember a soldier i met in xanth we got caught in a hailstorm and i was going back after dee butwell its complicated oh yesyou did mention the soldier she paused dee you went after her why she had run out into the storm andwell i liked her then to cover up what might have been taken as a slight to his present company who had shown extreme sensitivity about such things before he said what happened to the other sailors did they drown i showed them this she said pointing to a wickedlooking boathook they swam for shore instead wed better get moving if we can figure out the sail no the current is carrying us out winds the wrong way wed just mess it up trying to handle the sails when we dont know what were doing bink looked across at the other ship lights were on it those sailors didnt swim ashore he said they went next door theyll be coming after usunder sail they cant she said i told youthe wind but now it was unmistakable the other sail was being spread they were using the wind wed better find that elixir she said yes he had forgotten about it but for that they could have run across the land and been lost in mundania but could he have lived with himself buying his own freedom while leaving xanth subject to the siege of the evil magician well dump it overboard no but i thought well use it as hostage as long as we have it they wont close on us well take turns standing on the deck and holding the vial over the sea so they can see us if anything happens to beautiful he exclaimed i never would have thought of that first we have to find our hostage if we guessed wrong about the ship if they put the catapult on this one and the elixir on the other then they wouldnt be chasing us he said yes they would they need the catapult too and most of all they need us they searched the ship in the cabin was a chained monster of a type bink had never seen before it was not large but quite horrible in other respects its body was completely covered with hair white with black spots and it had a thin tail floppy black ears a small black nose and gleaming white teeth its four feet had stubby claws it snarled viciously as bink approachedbut it was chained by the neck to the wall its mad leaps cut brutally short by that tether what is it bink asked horrified fanchon considered i think its a werewolf now the creature looked halfway familiar it did resemble a werewolf fixed in its animal stage out here in mundania well it must be related if it had more heads it would be like a cerberus with only one head i think its a dog bink gaped a dog i think youre right ive never actually seen a dog before not in the flesh just pictures i dont think there are any in xanth today there used to be but they must have migrated out through the shield bink demanded before the shield was set up of coursethough id thought there were references to dogs and cats and horses within the past century i must have misremembered the dates well it seems we have one here now it looks vicious it must be guarding the elixir trained to attack strangers she agreed i suppose well have to kill it but its a rare creature maybe the only one left alive today we dont know that dogs might be common in mundania but it is rather pretty once you get used to it the dog had quieted down though it still watched them warily a small dragon might watch a person that way bink thought if the person were just outside its striking range with the proper break the person might come within range maybe we could revive the sailor and have him tame it bink said the animal must be responsive to members of this ships crew otherwise they could never get at the elixir good idea she agreed the sailor had finally recovered consciousness but he was in no condition to resume the fight well let you go fanchon told him if you tell us how to tame that dog we dont want to have to kill it you see who jennifer the man asked dazedly just speak her name pat her on the head and feed her he lay back i think my collarbones broke fanchon looked at bink cant make him swim then trent may be a monster but we arent she turned back to the sailor if you will give your word not to interfere with us in any way well help you recover as well as we can deal the sailor didnt hesitate i cant interfere with you i cant get up deal this bothered bink he and fanchon sounded just like trent offering better terms to a captive enemy in return for his cooperation were they any different from the evil magician fanchon checked the sailors body around the shoulders yow he cried im no doctor she said but i think youre right you have a broken bone are there any pillows aboard listen the sailor said as she worked on him he was obviously trying to divert his attention from the pain trents no monster you called him that but youre wrong hes a good leader hes promised you all the spoils of xanth fanchon asked with an edge to her voice no just farms or jobs for all of us he said no killing no rapine no loot her disbelief was evident none of that this aint the old days you know we just protect him and keep order in the territory we occupy and hell give us small land grants where nobodys settled yet he says xanths underpopulated and therell behell encourage the local gals to marry us so we can have families if there arent enough hell bring in gals from the real world and meanwhile hell transform some smart animals into gals i thought that was a joke but after what i hear about those cocks he grimaced i mean those basks he shook his head and grimaced again in pain keep your head still fanchon told him too late its true about the cockatrice and basilisk we were them but animal brides oh it wouldnt be so bad miss just temporary until real gals arrived if she looks like a gal and feels like a gal i wouldnt blame her for being a bitch before i mean some gals are bitches whats a bitch bink asked a bitch you dont know that the sailor grimaced again either he was in considerable pain or it was a natural expression a female dog like jennifer hell if jennifer had human form enough fanchon muttered well anyway well get homesteads and settle in and our kids will be magic i tell you its that last that recruited me i dont believe in magic understandor i didnt thenbut i remember the fairy tales from when i was a little tyke about the princess and the frog and the mountain of glass and the three wishes well look i was a metalworker for a crooked shop know what i mean and i really wanted out of the rat race bink shook his head silently he understood only part of what the sailor was saying but it did not make mundania look very good stores that were built off balance crooked rats that raced bink would want to get out of that culture too a chance to have a decent life in the country the sailor continued and there was no question about his dedication to his vision owning my own land making good things grow you know and my kids knowing magic real magici guess i still dont really believe that part but even if its a lie you know its sure nice to think about but to invade a foreign land to take what doesnt belong to you fanchon said she broke off evidently certain that it was pointless to debate that sort of thing with a sailor hell betray you the moment he doesnt need you hes an evil magician exiled from xanth you mean he really can do magic the man asked with happy disbelief i figured all this stuff was sleight of hand you know when i really thought about it i mean i believed some of the time but he sure as hell can do magic bink put in becoming acclimatized to the sailors language we told you how he changed us never mind about that fanchon said well hes still a good leader the sailor insisted he told us how he was kicked out twenty years ago because he tried to be king and how he lost his magic and married a gal from here and had a little boy trent has a family in mundania bink asked amazed we dont call our country that the sailor said but yeshe had a family until this mystery bug went aroundsome kind of flu i think or maybe food poisoningand they both got it and died he said science hadnt been able to save them but magic could have so he was going back to magicland xanth you call it but theyd kill him if he just walked in alone even if he got by the thing he called a shield so he needed an armyoooh fanchon had finished her work and heaved his shoulder up onto a pillow so they had the sailor as comfortable as was feasible his shoulder bound up in stray cloths bink would have liked to hear more of the mans unique viewpoint but time had passed and it was apparent that the other ship was gaining on them they traced its progress by its sail which moved laterally back and forth zigzagging against the windand with each pass it was closer they had been wrong about the capabilities of ships in adverse wind how much else were they wrong about bink went into the cabin he was feeling a bit seasick now but he held it down jennifer he said hesitantly proffering some of the dog food they had found the small spotted monster wagged her tail just like that they were friends bink screwed up his courage and patted her on the head and she did not bite him then while she ate he opened the chest she had guarded so ferociously and lifted out the vial of greenish fluid he found therein in a carefully padded box victory miss the sailor called as bink emerged with the vial the shield fanchon looked about nervously is the current carrying us into that yes miss i wouldnt interfere but if you dont turn this boat soon well all be dead i know that shield works ive seen animals try to go through it and get fried how can we tell where it is she asked theres a glimmer see he pointed with difficulty bink peered and saw it they were drifting toward a curtain of faint luminescence ghostly white the shield the ship progressed inexorably we cant stop it fanchon cried were going right through throw down the anchor the sailor said what else was there to do the shield was certain death yet to stop meant capture by trents forces even bluffing them back by means of the vial of elixir would not suffice the ship remained a kind of prison we can use the lifeboat fanchon said give me the vial bink gave it to her then threw over the anchor the ship slowly turned as the anchor took hold the shield loomed uncomfortably closebut so did the pursuing ship now it was clear why it was using the wind instead of the current it was under control in no danger of drifting into the shield they lowered the lifeboat a reflector lamp from the other ship bathed them in its light fanchon held the vial aloft ill drop it she screamed at the enemy hit me with an arrowthe elixir drowns with me give it back trents voice called from the other ship i pledge to let you both go free ha she muttered bink can you row this boat yourself im afraid to set this thing down while were in range of their arrows i want to be sure that no matter what happens to us they dont get this stuff ill try bink said he settled himself grabbed the oars and heaved one oar cracked into the side of the ship the other dug into the water the boat skewed around push off fanchon exclaimed you almost dumped me bink tried to put the end of one oar against the ship to push but it didnt work because he could not maneuver the oar free of its oarlock but the current carried the boat along until it passed beyond the end of the ship were going into the shield fanchon cried waving the vial row row turn the boat bink put his back into it the problem with rowing was that he faced backward he could not see where he was going fanchon perched in the stem holding the vial aloft peering ahead he got the feel of the oars and turned the boat and now the shimmering curtain came into view on the side it was rather pretty in its fashion its ghostly glow parting the nightbut he recoiled from its horror go parallel to it fanchon directed the closer we stay the harder itll make it for the other ship maybe theyll give up the pursuit bink pulled on the oars the boat moved ahead but he was unused to this particular form of exertion and not recovered from his fatigue of the swim and he knew he couldnt keep it up long youre going into the shield fanchon cried bink looked the shield loomed closer yet he was not rowing toward it the current he said carrying us sideways he had naively thought that once he started rowing all other vectors ceased row away from the shield she cried quickly he angled the boatbut the shield did not retreat the current was bearing them on as fast as he could row to make it worse the wind was now changingand rising he was holding even at the moment but he was tiring rapidly i cantkeep thisup he gasped staring at the glow theres an island fanchon said angle toward it bink looked around he saw a black something cutting the waves to the side island it was no more than a treacherous rock but if they could anchor to it he put forth a desperate effortbut it was not enough a storm was developing they were going to miss the rock the dread shield loomed nearer ill help fanchon cried she set down the vial crawled forward and put her hands on the oars opposite his hands she pushed synchronizing her efforts with his it helped but bink fatigued was distracted in the erratic moonlight blotted out intermittently by the thickening fastmoving clouds above her naked body lost some of its shapelessness and assumed the suggestion of more feminine contours shadow and imagination could make her halfway attractive and that embarrassed him because he had no right to think of such things fanchon could be a good companion if only the boat smashed into the rock it tiltedrock or craft or both get hold get hold fanchon cried as water surged over the side bink reached out and tried to hang on to the stone it was both abrasive and slippery a wave broke over him filling his mouth with its salty spume now it was black the clouds had completed their engulfment of the moon the elixir fanchon cried i left it in the she dived for the flooded stem of the boat bink still choking on sea water could not yell at her he clung to the rock with his hands his fingers finding purchase in a crevice anchoring the boat with his hooked knees he suffered a foolish vision if a giant drowning in the ocean grabbed on to the land of xanth for support his fingers would catch in the chasm the gap maybe that was the purpose of the gap did the tiny inhabitants of this isolated rock resent the crevice that binks giant fingers had found did they have forget spells to remove it from their awareness there was a distant flash of lightning bink saw the somber mass of ragged stone no miniature people on it but there was a glint as of light reflecting from a knob in the water he stared at it but the lightning was long since gone and he was squinting at the mere memory trying to make out the surrounding shape for it had been a highlight from something larger lightning flashed again closer bink saw briefly but clearly it was a toothy reptilian creature the highlight had been from its malignant eye a sea monster he cried terrified fanchon labored at an oar finally extricating it from its lock she aimed it at the monster and shoved thunk the end of the oar struck the armored green snout the creature backed off weve got to get away from here bink cried but as he spoke another wave broke over them the boat was lifted and wrenched away from his feet he put one arm about fanchons skinny waist and hung on it seemed the fingers of his other hand would breakbut they remained wedged in the crevice and he held his position in the next trough the lightning showed small saillike projections moving in the water what were they then another monster broke water right beside him he saw it in the phosphorescence that the complete darkness had attuned his eyes to it seemed to have a single broad eye across its face and a round truncated snout huge wattles were at the sides bink was transfixed by terror though he knew that most of the details were really from his imagination he could only stare at the thing as the lightning permitted and the lightning confirmed his imagination it was a hideous monster bink struggled with his terror to form some plan of defense one hand clung to the rock the other held fanchon he could not act but maybe fanchon could your oar he gasped the monster acted first it put its hands to its face and lifted the face away underneath was the face of evil magician trent you fools have caused enough trouble give me the elixir and ill have the ship throw us a line bink hesitated he was bone weary and cold and knew he could not hold out much longer against storm and current it was death to stay here theres a crocodile sniffing around trent continued and several sharks those are just as deadly as the mythical monsters you are familiar with i have repellentbut the current is carrying it away as rapidly as it diffuses into the water so its not much help on top of that sometimes whirlpools develop around these rocks especially during storms we need help nowand i alone can summon it give me that vial never fanchon cried she dived into the black waves trent snapped the mask back over his face and dived after her as he moved bink saw that the magician was naked except for his long sword strapped to a harness bink dived after him not even thinking of what he was doing they met in a tangle underwater in the dark and bubbly swirl there was nothing but mutual mischief bink tried to swim to the surface uncertain as to what foolishness had prompted him to dive here but sure that he could only drown himself but someone had a death grip on him he had to get up to get his head in air so he could breathe the water had hold of them all carrying them around and around it was the whirlpoolan inanimate funnel monster it sucked them down spinning into the depth of its maw for the second time bink felt himself drowningand this time he knew no sorceress would rescue him chapter wilderness bink woke with his face in sand around him lay the inert tentacles of a green monster he groaned and sat up bink fanchon cried gladly coming across the beach to him i thought it was night he said youve been unconscious this cave has magic phosphorescence or maybe its mundane phosphorescence since there was some on the rock too but its much brighter here trent pumped the water out of you but i was afraid whats this bink asked staring at a green tentacle a kraken seaweed trent said it pulled us out of the drink intending to consume us but the vial of elixir broke and killed it thats all that saved our lives if the vial had broken earlier it would have stopped the kraken from catching us and we all would have drowned later and we would already have been eaten as fortuitous a coincidence of timing as i have ever experienced a kraken weed bink exclaimed but thats magic were back in xanth fanchon said but i conjecture that the whirlpool drew us down below the effective level of the shield trent said we passed under it perhaps the presence of the elixir helped a freak accidentand im certainly not going to try to reverse that route now i lost my breathing apparatus on the way in lucky i got a good dose of oxygen first were in xanth to stay i guess so bink said dazedly he had gradually become accustomed to the notion of spending the rest of his life in mundania it was hard to abandon that drear expectation so suddenly but why did you save me once the elixir was gone it was the decent thing to do the magician said i realize you would not appreciate such a notion from my lips but i can offer no better rationale at the moment i never had any personal animus against you in fact i rather admire your fortitude and personal ethical code you can go your way nowand ill go mine bink pondered he was faced with a new unfamiliar reality back in xanth no longer at war with the evil magician the more he reviewed the details the less sense any of it made sucked down by a whirlpool through monsterinfested waters through the invisible but deadly shield to be rescued by a maneating plant which was coincidentally nullified at precisely the moment required to let them drop safely on this beach no he said i dont believe it things just dont happen this way it does seem as if were charmed fanchon said though why the evil magician should have been included trent smiled naked he was fully as impressive as before despite his age he was a fit and powerful man it does seem ironic that the evil should be saved along with the good perhaps human definitions are not always honored by nature but i like you am a realist i dont pretend to understand how we got herebut i do not question that we are here getting to land may be more problematical however we are hardly out of danger yet bink looked around the cave already the air seemed close though he hoped that was his imagination there seemed to be no exit except the water through which they had come in one nook was a pile of clean bonesthe refuse of the kraken it began to seem less coincidental what better place for an ocean monster to operate than at the exit to a whirlpool the sea itself collected the prey and most of it was killed on the way in by the shield the kraken weed had only to sieve the fresh bodies out of the water and this highly private cave was ideal for leisurely consumption of the largest living animals they could be deposited here on the beach and even given food so that they would remain more or less healthy until the krakens hunger was sufficient a pleasant little larder to keep the food fresh and tasty any that tried to escape by swimming past the tentacles ugh so the kraken could have dropped the human trio here then been hit by the elixir instead of splitsecond timing it became severalminute timing still a coincidence but a much less extreme one fanchon was squatting by the water flicking dry leaves into it the leaves had to be from past seasons of the kraken weed why it needed them here with no sunlight bink didnt understand maybe it had been a regular plant before it turned magicor its ancestors had been regularand it still had not entirely adapted or maybe the leaves had some other purpose there was a great deal yet to be understood about nature at any rate fanchon was floating the leaves on the water and why she wasted her time that way was similarly opaque she saw him looking im tracing surface currents she said seethe water is moving that way there has to be an exit under that wall bink was impressed again with her intelligence every time he caught her doing something stupid it turned out to be the opposite she was an ordinary if ugly girl but she had a mind that functioned efficiently she had plotted their escape from the pit and their subsequent strategy and it had nullified trents program of conquest now she was at it again too bad her appearance fell down of course trent agreed the kraken cant live in stagnant water it needs a constant flow that brings in its food supply and carries away its wastes we have an exitif it leads to the surface quickly enough and does not pass through the shield again bink didnt like it suppose we dive into that current and it carries us a mile underwater before it comes out wed drown my friend trent said i have been pondering that very dilemma we can not be rescued by my sailors because we are obviously beyond the shield i do not like to gamble on either the current or what we may discover within it yet it seems we must eventually do so for we can not remain here indefinitely something twitched bink lookedand saw one green tentacle writhing the krakens reviving he exclaimed it isnt dead uhoh trent said the elixir has thinned out in the current and dissipated the magic is returning i had thought that concentration would be fatal to a magic creature but apparently not fanchon watched the tentacles now others were quivering i think wed better get out of here she said soon but we dont dare plunge into the water without knowing where it goes bink objected we must be well below the surface id rather stay here and fight than drown i propose we declare a truce between us until we get free trent said the elixir is gone and we cannot go back the way we came from mundania we shall probably have to cooperate to get out of hereand in the present situation we really have no quarrel fanchon didnt trust him so we help you get outso then the truce ends and you change us into gnats since were inside xanth well never be able to change back again trent snapped his fingers stupid of me to forget thank you for reminding me i can use my magic now to get us out he looked at the quivering green tentacles of course ill have to wait until all the elixir is gone for it voids my magic too that means the kraken will be fully recovered i cant transform it because its main body is too far away the tentacles lifted bink dive for it fanchon cried we dont want to be caught between the kraken and the evil magician she plunged into the water the issue had been forced she was right the kraken would eat them or the magician would transform them right now while the lingering elixir blunted both threats was the time to escape still he would have hesitated if fanchon had not already taken action if she drowned there would be no one on his side bink charged across the sand tripped over a tentacle and sprawled reacting automatically the tentacle wrapped itself around his leg the leaves glued themselves to his flesh with little sucking noises trent drew his sword and strode toward him bink grabbed a handful of sand and threw it at the magician but it was ineffective then trents sword slashed downand severed the tentacle you are in no danger from me bink the magician said swim if you wish bink scrambled up and dived into the water taking a deep breath he saw fanchons feet kicking ahead of him as she swam down and saw the dark tube of the nether exit it terrified him and he balked his head popped through the surface there was trent standing on the beach parrying the converging tentacles with his sword fighting off the coils of the monster the man was the very picture of heroism yet the moment the combat was over trent would be a more dangerous monster than the kraken bink decided he took a new breath and dived again this time he stroked right into the somber eye and felt the current take him now there was no turning back the tunnel opened out almost immediatelyinto another glowing cavern bink had gained on fanchon and their heads broke the surface almost together probably she had been more cautious about navigating the exit heads turned their way human heads on human torsosvery nice feminine ones their faces were elfin their tresses flowing in magical iridescence over slender bare shoulders and perfectly erect breasts but the lower quarters merged into fishs tails these were mermaids what are you doing in our cave one of the maids cried indignantly just passing through bink said naturally mermaids spoke the common language of xanth he would not have thought anything of it had trent not remarked on how xanth language merged with all mundane languages magic operated in so many ways tell us the shortest way to the surface that way one said pointing left that way another said pointing right no that way a third cried pointing straight up there was a burst of girlish laughter several mermaids plunged into the water tails flashing and swam toward bink in a moment he was surrounded up closethe creatures were even prettier than from afar each one had a perfect complexion resulting from the natural action of the water and their breasts floated somewhat making them seem fuller maybe he had been exposed to fanchon too long the sight of all this loveliness gave him strange sensations of excitement and nostalgia if he could grab them all at once but no they were mermaids not his type at all they paid no attention to fanchon hes a man one cried meaning bink was human not merman look at his split legs no tail at all suddenly they were diving under to view his legs bink naked found this distinctly awkward they began to put their hands on him kneading the unfamiliar musculature of his legs a great curiosity to them yet why werent they looking at fanchons legs too there seemed to be more mischief than curiosity here trents head broke the water behind them mermaids he commented well get nothing from them so it seemed it also seemed that the magician could not be avoided i think wed better make the truce bink said to fanchon we have to extend some trust sometime she looked at the mermaids then at trent very well she said ungraciously for what its worthwhich isnt much a sensible decision trent said our longrange objectives may differ but our shortrange one matches survival see here come the tritons as he spoke a group of mermen appeared swimming in from another passage this seemed to be a labyrinth of caves and waterfilled apertures ho a triton cried brandishing his trident skewer the mermaids screamed playfully and dived out of sight bink avoided fanchons gaze the ladies had been having entirely too much fun with him and obviously not because of his split legs too many to fight trent said the elixir is gone with your acquiescence under our truce i will change you both into fish or perhaps reptiles so that you can escape however how will we change back fanchon demanded that is the key i can not change myself therefore you will have to rescue meor remain transformed so we shall survive together or suffer apart fair enough she looked at the tritons who were swimming determinedly toward the three surrounding them tridents raised they did not look at all playful this was obviously a gang of bullies showing off for the applauding spectatorsthe mermaids who had now reappeared on shore taking time to put on a flashy show why not change them into fish that would abate the immediate threat could i get them all in time trent agreed but it still would not free us from the cave i suspect we shall have to resort to magic on ourselves at some point regardless and we are intruders in their cave there is a certain proprietary ethic all right she cried as a triton heaved his threepointed fork do it your way suddenly she was a monster one of the worst bink had seen she had a huge greenish sheath around her torso from which arms legs head and tail projected her feet were webbed and her head was like that of a serpent the tritons fork struck the fanchonmonsters shelland bounced off suddenly bink saw the sense of this transformation this monster was invulnerable sea turtle trent murmured mundane harmless normallybut the merfolk dont know that ive made a study of nonmagical creatures and have developed much respect for them oops another trident was flying then bink was also a sea turtle suddenly he was completely comfortable in the water and he had no fear of the pronged spears if one came at his face he would simply pull in his head it would not retract all the way but the armor of the shell around it would intercept almost anything something tugged at his carapace bink started dive trying to dislodge itthen realized in his reptilian brain that this was something that had to be tolerated not a friend but an allyfor now so he dived but allowed the dragging weight to persist bink stroked slowly but powerfully for the underwater passage the other turtle had already entered it bink didnt worry about air he knew he could hold his breath for as long as it took it did not take long this passage slanted up to the surface bink could see the moon as he broke through the storm had abated abruptly he was human againand swimming was harder why did you change me back he asked we werent to shore yet when you are a turtle you have the brain of a turtle and the instincts of a turtle trent explained otherwise you would not be able to survive as a turtle too long and you might forget you ever were a man if you headed out to sea i might not be able to catch you and so would never be able to change you back justin tree retained his human mind bink pointed out justin tree one of the men you changed into trees in the north village his talent was throwing his voice oh i remember now he was a special ease i made him into a sapient tree really a man in tree form not a true tree i can do that when i put my mind to it for a tree it can work but a turtle needs turtle reflexes to deal with the ocean bink didnt follow all that but he didnt care to debate it obviously cases differed then fanchon reappeared in human form well you honored the truce she said grudgingly i didnt really think you would reality must intrude sometime trent said what do you mean by that she demanded i said we are not out of danger yet i believe that is a sea serpent on its way bink saw the huge head and there was no question the monster had seen them it was big the head was a yard across maybe the rocks bink cried orienting on the outcropping that marked the exit from the tritons cave that things a huge long snake fanchon said it could reach right down into the cave or coil right around the rocks we cant escape it in this form i could change you into poisonous jellyfish that the serpent would not eat trent said but you might get lost in the shuffle it also may not be wise to be transformed more than once a day i have not been able to verify this during my exile for obvious reasons but i am concerned that your systems may suffer a shock each time besides which the monster could still eat you fanchon said you have a very quick mind trent agreed equably therefore i shall have to do something i disliketransform the monster you dont want to transform the sea serpent bink asked surprised the thing was now quite close its small red eyes fixed on the prey saliva dripped from its giant teeth it is merely an innocent creature going about its business trent said we should not enter its waters if we do not wish to participate in its mode of existence there is a balance of nature whether magical or mundane that we should hesitate to interfere with you have a weird sense of humor fanchon said sourly but i never claimed to understand the nuances of evil magic if you really want to protect its life style transform it into a little fish until we get to shore then transform it back and hurry bink cried the thing was now looming over them orienting on its specific targets that would not work trent said the fish would swim away and be lost i must be able to identify the particular creature i mean to transform and it must be within six feet of me however your suggestion has merit six feet bink said well be inside it before we get that close he was not trying to be funny the monsters mouth was much longer than it was wide so that as it opened to its full aperture the upper front teeth were a good twelve feet from the lower teeth nevertheless i must operate within my limits trent said unperturbed the critical region is the head the seat of identity when i transform that the rest naturally follows if i tried it when only the tail was within range i would botch the job so when it tries to take me in its mouth it comes into my power what if it goes for one of us first fanchon demanded suppose were more than six feet from you i suggest you arrange to be within that radius trent said dryly hastily bink and fanchon splashed closer to the evil magician bink had the distinct impression that even if trent had had no magic they would have been in his power he was too selfassured too competent in his tactics he knew how to manage people the sea monsters body convulsed its head struck down teeth leading spittle sprayed out from it in obscene little clouds fanchon screamed hysterically bink felt an instant and pervading terror that sensation was becoming all too familiar he simply was no hero but as the awful jaws closed on them the sea serpent vanished in its place fluttered a glowing brightly colored insect trent caught it neatly in one hand and set it on his own hair where it perched quiveringly a lovebug trent explained they are not good fliers and they hate water this one will stay close until we emerge from the sea now the three swam for shore it took them some time for the sea remained choppy and they were tired but no other creatures bothered them apparently no lesser predators intruded on the fishing territory of the sea monster an understandable attitudebut probably within hours a host of aggressive forms would converge if the sea monster did not return as trent had remarked there was always a balance of nature the phosphorescence became stronger in the shallows some of it was from glowing fish flashing in colors to communicate with their respective kinds most of it was from the water itself washes of pale green yellow orangemagic of course but for what purpose there was so much bink saw wherever he went that he did not understand at the bottom he saw shells some lighted around the fringes some glowing in patterns a few vanished as he passed over them whether they had become truly invisible or merely doused their lights he could not tell regardless they were magic and that was familiar belatedly he realized that he was glad to be back among the familiar threats of xanth dawn was coming as they reached the beach the sun pushed up behind the clouds over the jungle and finally burst through to bounce its shafts off the water it was a thing of marvelous beauty bink clung to that concept because his body was numb with fatigue his brain locked onto the torture of moving limbs over and over on and on at last he crawled upon the beach fanchon crawled beside him dont stop yet she said we must seek cover lest other monsters come from the beach or jungle but trent stood kneedeep in the surf his sword dangling from his handsome body he was obviously not as tired as they were return friend he said flicking something into the sea the sea monster reappeared its serpentine convolutions much more impressive in the shallow water trent had to lift his feet and splash back out of the way lest he be crushed by a hugely swinging coil but the monster was not looking for trouble now it was extremely disgruntled it gave a single honk of rage or of anguish or of mere amazement and thrashed its way toward deeper pastures trent walked up the beach it is not fun to be a defenseless love bug when you are accustomed to being the king of the sea he said i hope the creature does not suffer a nervous breakdown he was not smiling there was something funny bink thought about a man who liked monsters that well but of course trent was the evil magician of the contemporary scene the man was strangely handsome mannerly and erudite possessed of strength skill and courage but his affinities were to the monsters more than to the men it would be disastrous ever to forget that odd that humfrey the good magician was an ugly little gnome in a forbidding castle selfishly using his magic to enrich himself while trent was the epitome of hero material the sorceress iris had seemed lovely andsexy but was in fact nondescript humfreys good qualifies were manifest in his actions once a person really got to know him but trent so far had seemed good in both appearance and deed at least on the purely personal level if bink had met him for the first time in the krakens cave and hadnt known the mans evil nature he would never have guessed it now trent strode across the beach seeming hardly tired despite the grueling swim the nascent sunlight touched his hair turning it bright yellow he looked in that instant like a god all that was perfect in man again bink suffered fatigued confusion trying to reconcile the mans appearance and recent actions with what he knew to be the mans actual nature and again finding it so challenging as to be virtually impossible some things just had to be taken on faith ive got to rest to sleep bink muttered i cant tell evil from good right now fanchon looked toward trent i know what you mean she said shaking her head so that her ratty hair shifted its wet tangles evil has an insidious way about it and there is some evil in all of us that seeks to dominate we have to fight it no matter how tempting it becomes trent arrived we seem to have made it he said cheerfully it certainly is good to be back in xanth by whatever freak of fortune ironic that you who sought so ardently to prevent my access instead facilitated it ironic fanchon agreed dully i believe this is the coast of the central wilderness region bounded on the north by the great gap i had not realized we had drifted so far south but the contour of the land seems definitive that means we are not yet out of trouble binks an exile youre banished and im ugly fanchon muttered well never be out of trouble nevertheless i believe it would be expedient to extend our truce until we are free of the wilderness the magician said did trent know something bink didnt bink had no magic so he would be prey to all the sinister spells of the deep jungle fanchon had no apparent magicstrange she claimed her exile had been voluntary not forced yet if she really had no magic she should have been banished too anyway she would have a similar problem but trentwith his skills with sword and spell he should have no reason to fear this region fanchon had similar doubts as long as youre with us were in constant danger of being transformed into toads i cant see that the wilderness is worse trent spread his hands i realize you do not trust me and perhaps you have reason i believe your security and mine would be enhanced if we cooperated a little longer but i shall not force my company on you he walked south along the beach he knows something bink said he must be leaving us to die so he can be rid of us without breaking his word why should he care about his word fanchon asked that would imply he is a man of honor bink had no answer he crawled to the shade and concealment of the nearest tree and collapsed in the downy sward he had been unconscious during part of the last night but that was not the same as sleep he needed genuine rest when he woke it was high noonand he was fixed in place there was no pain only some itching but he couldnt lift his head or hands they were fastened to the ground by myriad threads as if the very lawn had oh no in the numbness of fatigue he had been so careless as to lie in a bed of carnivorous grass the root blades had grown up into his body infiltrating it so slowly and subtly that it had not disturbed his sleepand now he was caught once he had happened on a patch of the stuff near the north village with an animal skeleton on it the grass had consumed all the flesh he had wondered how any creature could have been so stupid as to be trapped by such a thing now he knew he was still breathing therefore he could still yell he did so with a certain gusto help there was no response fanchon he cried im tied down the grass is eating me up actually that was an exaggeration he was not hurt merely bound to the ground but the tendrils continued to grow into him and soon they would start to feed drawing the life proteins from his flesh still nothing he realized she would not or could not help him probably something had put a sleep spell on her it was obvious in retrospect that there were plenty of deadly threats right here at the edge of the beach she must have fallen into another she might be dead already help anybody he screamed desperately that was another mistake all around him in the forest and along the beach things were stirring he had advertised his helplessness and now they were coming to take advantage of it had he struggled with the grass in silence he might have managed in time to work his way free he had awakened before it was ready for the kill luckily maybe he had tried to turn over in his sleep and his body had objected to the resistance strongly enough to throw off the stasis spell the grass was applying if he struggled and failed his demise at least would have been fairly comfortablejust a slow sinking into eternal sleep now by his noise he had summoned much less comfortable menaces he could not see them but he could hear them from the nearby tree came a rustle as of meateating squirrels from the beach came a scrape as of hungry acid crabs from the sea came a horrible kind of splashing as of a small sea monster who had sneaked into the territory of the big sea monster trent had transformed now this little one struggled to get out of the water and cross to the prey before it was gone but the most dreadful sound of all was the poundpoundpound of the footfalls of something deep in the forest large and far away but moving extremely rapidly a shadow fell on him hi a shrill voice cried it was a harpy cousin to the one he had met on the way back to the north village she was every bit as ugly smelly and obnoxiousand now she was dangerous she descended slowly her talons reaching down twitching the other harpy had seen him healthy so had stayed well out of reachthough she might have descended had he actually drunk from the spring of love ugh this one saw him helpless she had a human face and human breasts so was in that sense female like the mermaids but in lieu of arms she had great greasy wings and her body was that of a gross bird and she was a dirty bird not only were her face and breasts grotesquely shaped grime was caked on them it was a wonder she could fly at all bink had not had the opportunityor desire to appreciate the qualifies of the prior harpy at close range now he had a really excellent nether view double agh the mermaids had represented much that was lovely in the female form this harpy was the ugly aspect she made fanchon look halfway decent in comparison at least fanchon was clean she dropped on him claws clutching and unclutching in air in anticipation of the glob of entrails they were about to rip out of his exposed gut some of the nails were broken and jagged he caught the odor of her a stink like none he remembered oooh you big handsome hunk of meat she screeched you look good enough to eat i can hardly choose what to take first and she burst into maniacal laughter bink absolutely horrified put forth the supreme effort of his life and wrenched one arm free of the grass little roots trailed from it and the separation was painful he was lying partly on his side one cheek anchored so he had a very limited field of vision but his ears continued to bring him the dreadful news of the threats about him he struck at the harpy scaring her off for the moment she was of course a coward her character matched her appearance her wings fluttered heavily a soiled feather drifted down oooh you naughty boy she screeched she seemed to be unable to converse in anything less than a screech her voice was so harsh as to be almost incomprehensible ill goozle your gizzard for that and she emitted her horrible cackle again but now a shadow fell on bink from something he could not seebut the outline was awful he heard heavy breathing as of some great animal and smelled its carrioncoated breath which for the moment overrode the stench of the harpy it was the thing from the sea its feet dragging as it hunched forward it sniffed himand the other creatures stopped moving in afraid to stand up to this predator all except the harpy she was ready to heap vilification on anything from the safety of the air get away argus she screeched hes mine all mine especially his gizzard and she dropped down again forgetting binks free arm for once bink didnt mind he could fight off the dirty bird but this other thing was too much for him let her interfere all she wanted the unseen thing snorted and leaped passing right over binks body with amazing agility now he saw it body and tail of a large fish four stout short legs terminating in flippers tusked head of a boar no neck three eyes were set along its torso the middle one set lower than the others bink had never seen a monster quite like this before a landwalking fish the harpy flew up out of the way just in time narrowly missing being gored by the things semicircular horns another stinking feather fell she screeched some really disgusting insults in her ire and let fly with a gooey dropping but the monster ignored her and turned to concentrate on bink it opened its mouth and bink made a fist to punch it in the snoutfor what little good that might dowhen abruptly it paused gazing balefully over binks shoulder now youll get it argus the harpy screeched gleefully even a fishy lout like you cant ignore catoblepas bink had never heard of either argus or catoblepas but another quake of deep misgiving went through him he felt the muzzle of the hidden monster nudge him it was oddly softbut such was its power that it ripped him half out of the grass then the pigsnouted argus charged furious that its meal should be taken away bink dropped flat again letting the slimy flippers pass over him and their impact dislodged more of his body he was getting free the two brutes collided sic em monsters the harpy screeched hovering overhead in her excitement over this mischief she let fall another large squishy dropping which just missed binks head if only he had a rock to throw at her he sat up one leg remained anchoredbut now he had anchorage to rip out of the clutch of the demon weed it didnt even hurt this time he looked at the battling monstersand saw the snakelike hair of the catoblepas twined around the head of the argus gripping it by horns ears scales and eyeballsanything available the body of the catoblepas was covered with reptilian scales from its gorgon head to its cloven hooves invulnerable to the attack of the argus in overall shape it was like any quadruped not all that remarkable but that deadly writhing prehensile head hairwhat a horror had he really wanted to return to magic xanth he had so conveniently forgotten its uglier aspect magic had as much evil as good maybe mundania would really have been better fools the harpy cried seeing bink loose hes getting away but the monsters were now enmeshed in their own struggle and paid her no attention no doubt the winner would feast on the loser and bink would be superfluous she darted down at bink forgetting all caution but he was on his feet now and able to fight he reached up and caught her by one wing trying to get his hands around her scrawny throat he would gladly have strangled her in a sense strangling all the meanness of xanth but she squawked and fluttered so violently that all he got was a handful of gummy feathers bink took advantage of his luck and ran away from the fray the harpy fluttered after him for a moment screeching such hideously foul insults that his ears burned but soon gave up she had no chance of overcoming him by herself harpies were basically carrion feeders and thieves not hunters it was their fashion to snatch food from the mouths of others there was now no sign of the other creatures that had rustled and scraped toward him they too were predators only of the helpless where was fanchon why hadnt she come to help him she surely must have heard his cries for help if she still lived there was no way she could have been unaware of the recent fracas so this must mean no she had to be somewhere maybe down by the sea catching fish out of hearing she had been invaluable during the past two days and unswervingly loyal to the welfare of xanth without her he could never have escaped the power of the evil magician for intelligence and personality she had it all over the other girls he had met too bad she wasnt he saw her resting against a tree fanchon he cried gladly hello bink she said now his worry and speculation translated into ire didnt you see me being attacked by those monsters didnt you hear i saw i heard she said quietly bink was baffled and resentful why didnt you help me you could at least have grabbed a stick or thrown rocks i was almost eaten alive im sorry she said he took another step toward her youre sorry you just rested here doing nothing and he cut off losing the words to continue maybe if you moved me from the tree she said ill dump you in the sea he cried he strode up to her leaned over to grab her roughly by the arm and felt a sudden wash of weakness now he understood the tree had put a lethargy spell on her and was starting in on him as with the carnivorous grass it took time to take full effect she must have settled here to sleep as careless in her fatigue as he had been in his and was now far gone there was no actual discomfort to alert potential prey just a slow insidious draining of vitality of strength and will until it all was gone very similar to the grass actually only this was less tangible he fought it off he squatted beside her sliding his arms under her back and legs he really wasnt too weak yet if he acted fast he started to lift herand discovered that his squatting posture had given him a false sense of wellbeing he could not raise her up in fact he wasnt sure he could stand alone he just wanted to lie down and rest a moment no that would be the end he dared not yield to it sorry i yelled at you he said i didnt realize what you were in thats all right bink take it easy she closed her eyes he let go of her and backed away on his hands and knees goodbye she said listlessly reopening one eye she was almost done for he took hold of her feet and pulled another surge of weakness came making the job seem impossible it was as much emotional as physical there was no way he could haul her weight he tried anyway his stubbornness prevailing over even this magic but he failed she was too heavy for him here he backed farther awayand as he left the environs of the tree his energy and will returned but now she was beyond his reach he stood up and took another step toward herand lost his strength again so that he fell to the ground he would never make it this way again he hauled himself back sweating with the effort of concentration were he less stubborn he would not have gotten this far i cant get you out and im only wasting time he said apologetically maybe i can loop you with a rope but there was no rope he walked along the trees of the edge of the jungle and spied a dangling vine that would do nicely if he could get it loose he grabbed it in one handand screamed the thing writhed in his grasp and looped about his wrist imprisoning it more vines dropped from the tree swinging toward him this was a land kraken a variant of the tangle tree he was still being fatally careless walking directly into traps that should never have fooled him bink dropped yanking on the vine with his full weight it stretched to accommodate him twining more tightly about his arm but now he spied a pointed bit of bone on the ground remnant of prior prey he swept it up with his free hand and poked at the vine with it puncturing it thick orange sap welled out the whole tree shivered there was a high keening of pain reluctantly the vine loosened and he drew his arm free another close call he ran on down the beach searching for whatever would help him maybe a sharpedged stone to cut off a vineno the other vines would get him give up that idea maybe a long pole no similar problem this peacefulseeming beach was a morass of danger really coming alive anything and everything was suspect then he saw a human body trent sitting crosslegged on the sand looking at something it seemed to be a colorful gourd maybe he was eating it bink paused trent could help him the magician could change the fatigue tree into a salamander and kill it or at least render it harmless but trent himself was a greater longterm threat than the tree which should he choose well he would try to negotiate the known evil of the tree might not be as bad as the uncertain evil of the magician but it was more immediate trent he said hesitantly the man paid him no attention he continued to stare at his gourd he did not actually seem to be eating it what then was its fascination bink hesitated to provoke the man but he did not know how long he could afford to wait fanchon was slowly dying at what point would she be too far gone to be revived even if rescued from the tree some risk had to be taken magician trent he said more firmly i think we should extend the truce fanchon is caught and he stopped for the man was still ignoring him binks fear of the magician began to change much as had his attitude toward fanchon when he thought she was malingering it was as if the charge of emotion had to be spent one way or another whatever the cost listen shes in trouble he snapped are you going to help or arent you still trent paid no attention bink still weary from the rigors of the night and unnerved by his recent experiences suffered a lapse of sanity damn it answer me he cried knocking the gourd from the magicians hands the thing flew six feet landing in the sand and rolling trent looked up there was no sign of anger in his countenance just mild surprise hello bink he said what is your concern my concern bink cried i told you three times trent looked at him puzzled i did not hear you the magician paused thoughtfully in fact i did not see you arrive i must have been sleeping though i had not intended to you were sitting here looking at the gourd bink said hotly now i remember i saw it lying on the beach and it looked intriguing he broke off glancing at shadow by the sun that was an hour ago where did the time go bink realized that something was amiss he went to pick up the gourd hold trent barked thats hypnotic bink stopped in place what hypnotic thats a mundane term meaning it puts you into a trance a walking sleep it usually takes some time to dobut of course a magicspell hypnosis could be instant dont look too closely at the gourd its pretty colors must be intended to attract the eye then it hasyes i remember nowa peephole a single glance into its fascinating innards becomes eternal very nice device but whats the point bink asked averting his gaze i mean a gourd cant eat a man but the gourd vine might trent pointed out or it may be that a quiescent living body might be excellent food for its seeds to grow on there are wasps in mundania that sting other creatures stunning them and lay their eggs in the bodies we can be sure it makes some sort of sense still bink was bemused how is it that you a magician magicians are human too bink we eat sleep love hate and err i am as vulnerable to magic as you are i merely have a more potent weapon with which to protect myself if i wanted to be entirely secure i would lock myself within a stone castle like my friend humfrey my chances of survival in this wilderness would be greatly enhanced by the presence of one or two alert loyal companions this is why i proposed the extension of our truceand i still feel it is a good idea it is apparent that i need help even if you dont he looked at bink why did you help me just now i bink was ashamed to admit the accidental nature of that assistance i think we should extend the truce excellent does fanchon agree she needs help now ashe is in thrall to a lethargy tree oho then i shall repay your favor by rescuing the damsel then we shall talk of truce and trent jumped up on the way up the beach bink pointed out the vine tree and trent whipped out his sword and neatly lopped off a length of vine again bink was reminded of the skill this man had with his physical weapon if trents magic were taken away entirely he would still be dangerous in fact he had risen to the generalship of an army in mundania the vine twisted into shuddering convolutions like a dying serpent oozing orange sap from the end but it was now harmless the tree keened again cowed bink almost felt sorry for it they took this vine to fanchon looped it about her foot and hauled her unceremoniously away from the tree so simple with the right equipment now trent said briskly as fanchon slowly recovered her vital energy i propose an extended trace between us until we three escape the wilderness of xanth we seem to have problems separately this time fanchon acquiesced chapter chameleon the first thing fanchon did when she recovered was fetch the magic gourd bink had told her about this could be useful she said wrapping it in a great leaf from a blanket plant now we must plan the best route out of here trent said i believe we are south of the chasm so that will balk us if we go northunless we remain on the coast i dont think that is wise bink remembered his experience crossing the chasm at the other side no we dont want to stay on the beach he agreed the sorceress iris had complicated things therebut there could be equivalent menaces here our alternative is to cut inland trent said i am not familiar with this specific locale but i believe humfrey was building a castle due east of here he completed it fanchon said fine bink said you can change us into big birds maybe rocs and well carry you there trent shook his head negatively this is not feasible but you changed us before and we helped you we made the truce we wouldnt drop you trent smiled it is not a question of trust bink i trust you i have no question at all about your basic integrity or fanchons but we are in a peculiar circumstance fancy the evil magician paying a call on the good magician fanchon said what a scene that would make no you would be disappointed trent said humfrey and i have always gotten along well we leave each other alone professionally i should be happy to meet him again but he would be obliged to convey the news of my return to xanth to the king and once he knew my general whereabouts he would use his magic to keep track of me yes i see the problem she said no sense tipping your hand to the enemy but we could fly somewhere else we can fly nowhere trent insisted i can not afford to advertise my presence in xanthand neither can you thats right bink agreed were exiles and the penalty for violating exile is death fanchon finished i never thoughtwere all in trouble if you had forgotten such details two days ago trent observed wryly we would not be here now fanchon looked unusually sober as if there were some special significance to the remark oddly the expression made her look less ugly than usual probably bink thought he was merely getting used to her what are we going to do bink asked the whirlpool brought us in under the shield weve already agreed we cant go back that way we cant stay here on the beachand we cant let the citizens know were back even though we entered only by freak accident well have to conceal our identities fanchon decided there are places in xanth where we would be unknown that doesnt sound like much of a life bink said always in hidingand if anyone asked magician humfrey where we were whod do that fanchon demanded one years service just to check up on someone in exile that is our only present margin of security trent said the fact that humfrey will not bother to cheek without a potential fee however we can worry about such things after we escape the wilderness perhaps by then some new avenues will have appeared i can change you into unrecognizable forms if necessary and camouflage myself it may all prove to be academic because they might never make it through the wilderness bink thought they traveled along the beach until they found a region of sparse forest and field that seemed less hazardous than the rest they spaced themselves out somewhat whenever anything dangerous appeared so that they would not all be caught together the selection worked well enough at first the magic they encountered was largely innocuous as if the concentration were all at the beach there were spells designed to make passing animals sheer off or color shows whose purpose was unclear bink had been through worse on his trip to the good magicians castle maybe the wilderness was overrated fanchon spotted a fabric plant and efficiently fashioned togas for them all the men tolerated this with good humor having become accustomed to nudity had fanchon been a provocatively proportioned woman there might have been more reason and less desire for bodily concealment still bink remembered how she had professed modesty in the prison pit so as to gain a private section in which to hide the bricks she probably had her reasons this time too there were several patches of spellcast coldness and one of heat the clothing would have helped protect against these but they were easy to avoid the assorted carnivorous trees were readily spotted and bypassed staying off attractive paths was second nature to them all now one region was distinctly awkward however it was dry and sandy with little apparent nutrient in the soil yet it was covered by luxuriant waisthigh broadleaved plants the region seemed harmless so they strode straight through the center then all three travelers felt a sudden and almost uncontrollable call of nature they had to scatter barely getting separated in time to perform these were very practical plants bink abruptly realized their spells compelled passing animals to deposit nutritious fluids and solids on the soil greatly promoting plant growth fertilizer magic farther along one animal neither fled their approach nor acted hostile this was a kneehigh snuffling quadruped with a greatly extended snout trent drew his sword as it ambled toward them but fanchon stopped him i recognize that one she said its a magicsniffer it smells by magic bink asked it smells magic she said we used to use one on my folks farm to sniff out magic herbs and things the stronger the magic the more it reacts but its harmless what does it feed on trent asked keeping his hand on his sword magic berries other magic doesnt seem to affect it one way or the other it is just curious it doesnt differentiate by type of spell just intensity they stood and watched fanchon was nearest to the sniffer so it approached her first it snorted making a flutelike sound see i have some magic it likes me she said what magic bink wondered she had never shown any talent and never actually told him what she could do there was still too much he did not know about her satisfied the sniffer moved on to trent this time its reaction was much stronger it danced around emitting a medley of notes sure enough trent said with a certain justified pride it knows a magician when it smells one then it came to binkand frisked almost as much as it had for trent so much for perception bink said laughing with embarrassment but trent did not laugh it believes you are almost as strong a magician as i am he said his fingers tapping his sword with unconscious significance then he caught himself and seemed to be at ease again i wish i were bink said but i was banished for lack of magic yet the magician humfrey had told him he had very strong magic that could not be brought out now his curiosity and frustration were increased by this happenstance what kind of a talent could he have that hid itself so determinedlyor was it hidden by some outside spell they trudged on they cut poles with which to poke the ground ahead for invisible barriers and pitfalls and other suspiciously unsuspect aspects of the wild this made progress slowbut they dared not hurry actually they had no reason to hurry their only purposes were concealment and survival food turned out to be no problem they did not trust the various fruit and candy trees they saw some might be magic and serve the interests of their hosts rather than the interests of the consumers though they looked similar to crop trees but trent merely turned a hostile thistle tree into a luxuriant multifruit tree and they feasted on apples pears bananas blackberries and tomatoes it reminded bink how great was the power of a true magician for trents talent really embraced that of food conjuration as a mere subtalent properly exploited the reach of his magic was enormous but they were still heading into the wilderness not out of it illusions became bolder more persistent and harder to penetrate there were more sounds louder more ominous now and then the ground shuddered and there were great nottoodistant bellowings trees leaned toward them leaves twitching i think fanchon said we have not begun to appreciate the potency of this forest its whole innocuous permeability may have been merely to encourage us to get more deeply in bink looking nervously about agreed we picked the safestseeming route maybe thats where we went wrong we should have taken the most threatening one and gotten consumed by a tangle tree fanchon said lets try going back bink suggested seeing their doubt he added just to test they tried it almost immediately the forest darkened and tightened more trees appeared blocking the way they had come were they illusions or had they been invisible before bink was reminded of the oneway path he had walked from the good magicians castle but this was more ominous these were not nice trees they were gnarled colossi bearing thorns and twitching vines branches crisscrossed one another leaves sprouting to form new barriers even as the trio watched thunder rumbled in the distance no doubt about it trent said we failed to see the forest for the trees i could transform any in our direct path but if some started firing thorns at us we would be in trouble regardless even if we wanted to go that way fanchon said looking west wed never have time to retrace it all through that resistance not before night nightthat was the worst time for hostile magic but the alternative is to go the way it wants us to go bink said alarmed that may be easy now but it surely is not our best choice perhaps the wilderness does not know us well enough trent said with a grim smile i do feel competent to handle most threats so long as someone watches behind me and stands guard as i sleep bink thought of the magicians powers of magic and swordplay and had to agree the forest might be one giant spider webbut that spider might become a gnat unexpectedly maybe we should gamble that we can handle it bink said at least well find out what it is for the first time he was glad to have the evil magician along yes there is always that fanchon agreed sourly now that they had made the decision progress became easier the threatenings of the forest remained but they assumed the aspect of background warnings as dusk came the way opened out into a clearing within which stood an old rundown stone fortress oh no fanchon exclaimed not a haunted castle thunder cracked behind them a chill wind came up cutting through their tunics bink shivered i think we spend the night thereor in the rain he said could you transform it into a harmless cottage my talent applies only to living things trent said that excludes buildings and storms glowing eyes appeared in the forest behind them if those things rush us fanchon said you could only transform a couple before they were on us since you cant zap them from a distance and not at night trent said rememberi have to see my subject too all things considered i think we had better oblige the local powers that be and enter the castle carefullyand once inside we should sleep in shifts it is likely to be a difficult night bink shuddered the last place he wanted to spend the night was there but he realized they had come far too deeply into the trap to extricate themselves readily there was powerful magic here the magic of an entire region too much to fight directlynow so they yielded goaded by the looming storm the ramparts were tall but covered by moss and clinging vines the drawbridge was down its oncestout timbers rotting in place yet there was an ancient lingering rugged magnificence about it this castle has style trent observed they tapped the planks locating a reasonably solid section on which to cross the moat was overgrown with weeds and its water was stagnant shame to see a good castle get run down trent said it is obviously deserted and has been for decades or centuries bink added why would a forest herd us into a derelict castle fanchon asked even if something really horrible lurks herewhat would our deaths profit the forest we were only passing throughand we would make it much faster if the forest just left us alone we intend it no harm there is always a rationale trent said magic does not focus without purpose they approached the front portcullis as the storm broke that encouraged them to step inside though the interior was almost black maybe we can find a torch fanchon said feel along the walls usually a castle will have something near the entrance crash the raised portcullis which they had assumed was corroded in place crashed down behind them the iron bars were far too heavy to lift the three were trapped inside the jaws close trent remarked not seeming perturbed but bink could see that his sword was in his hand fanchon made a halfmuffled scream clutching at binks arm he looked ahead and saw a ghost there was no question about it the thing was a humped white sheet with deadblack eyeholes it made a mouthless moan trents sword whistled as he stepped forward the blade sliced through the sheetwith no visible effect the ghost floated away through a wall this castle is haunted no question trent said matteroffactly if you believed that you wouldnt be so calm fanchon said accusingly on the contrary it is physical menaces i fear trent replied the thing to remember about ghosts is that they have no concrete manifestation and lack also the ability of shades to animate living creatures therefore they cannot directly affect ordinary people they act only through the fear they inspire so it is merely necessary to have no fear in addition this particular ghost was as surprised to see us as we were to see it it was probably merely investigating the fall of the portcullis it certainly meant no harm it was obvious that trent was not afraid he had not used his sword in panic but to verify that it was a genuine ghost he faced this was courage of a type bink had never had he was shivering with fear and reaction fanchon had better control now that her initial scream was out we could fall into quite physical pits or set off more boobytraps if we tried to explore this place in the dark were sheltered from the rain herewhy dont we sleep right here in shifts until morning you have marvelous common sense my dear trent said shall we draw straws for first watch ill take it bink said im too scared to sleep anyway so am i fanchon said and bink felt warm gratitude for her admission i have not yet become blase about ghosts there is not enough evil in you trent said chuckling very well i shall be first to sleep he moved and bink felt something cool touch his hand do you take my sword bink and run it through whatever manifests if it has no impact relax for it is a true ghost if it contacts anything material that threat will no doubt be abated by the thrust only take careand bink heard the smile in his voicethat you do not strike the wrong subject bink found himself holding the heavy sword amazed i do not be concerned about your inexperience with the weapon a straight bold thrust will have authority regardless trent continued reassuringly when your watch is done pass the blade on to the lady when she is done i will take my turn being by then well rested bink heard him lie down remember the magicians voice came from the floor my talent is void in the dark since i cannot see my subject so do not wake me unnecessarily we depend on your alertness and judgment he said no more fanchon found binks free arm let me get behind you she said i dont want you running me through by accident bink was glad for her closeness he stood peering about sword in one sweaty hand staff in the other unable to penetrate the dark the sound of the rain outside became loud then he made out trents gentle snoring bink fanchon said at last um what kind of a man would give his enemy his sword and go to sleep that question had been bothering bink he had no satisfactory answer a man with iron nerve he said at last knowing that that could only be part of it a man who extends such trust she said thoughtfully must expect to receive it well if were trustworthy and he isnt he knows he can trust us it doesnt work that way bink it is the untrustworthy man who distrusts others because he judges them by himself i dont see how a documented liar and villain and schemer for the throne like the evil magician can be this way maybe hes not the historical trent but someone else an imposter an imposter would still be a liar but weve seen his power magic is never twice the same he has to be trent the transformer yet something is wrong yes something is right thats whats wrong he trusts us and he shouldnt you could run him through right now while he sleeps even if you didnt kill him with the first thrust he could not transform you in the dark i wouldnt do that bink exclaimed horrified precisely you have honor so do i it is hard to avoid the conclusion that so does he yet we know he is the evil magician he must have spoken the truth before bink decided he cant make it through the wilderness alone and he figures hell need help to get out of this haunted castle in one piece and he knows we cant get out alive either so were all on the same side and wont hurt each other so hes serious about the truce but what about when we get out of all this and the truce ends bink didnt answer with that they were silent but his troubled thoughts continued if they survived the night in this dread castle they could probably survive the day in the morning trent might figure the truce was over bink and fanchon could guard the magician through the night then in the morning trent could slay them both while they slept if trent had taken the first watch he could not have done that because he would have to slay the people who would protect him for the remainder of the evening so it made sense to take the last watch no he was not ready to believe that bink himself had chosen the first watch he had to have faith in the sanctity of the truce if that faith was misplaced then he was lostbut he would rather lose that way than to win through dishonor that decision gave him comfort bink saw no more ghosts that night at last he gave the sword to fanchon to his surprise he managed to sleep he woke at dawn fanchon was asleep beside him looking less ugly than he recalledin fact not really homely at all he certainly was acclimatizing would it ever come to the point where trent seemed noble and fanchon beautiful good trent said he was wearing his sword again now that you can look out for her ill have a look around the premises he walked on down the dim hall they had survived the night bink wasnt sure in retrospect whether he had been more worried about the ghosts or the magician he still lacked comprehension of the motives of either and fanchonas the light brightened he was sure her appearance had improved she could hardly be called lovely but she certainly was not the ugly girl he had perceived when he met her four days ago in fact she now reminded him of someone dee he exclaimed she woke yes her response amazed him as much as the vague resemblance he had called her deebut dee was elsewhere in xanth why then had she answered to that name as if it were her own ii just thought you she sat up youre right of course bink i knew i couldnt conceal it much longer you mean you actually are i am chameleon she said now he was totally confused that was only a code word we used to alert and an omen i am fanchonugly she said and deeaverage and wynnebeautiful i change a little every day completing the circle in the course of a month a lunar month its the female cycle you know now he remembered how dee too had reminded him of someone but wynne was stupid you my intelligence varies inversely she explained that is the other facet of my curse i range from ugly intelligence to lovely idiocy ive been looking for a spell to turn me normal a spell for chameleon he said musingly what an astonishing enchantment yet it had to be true for he had almost caught the similarity when he met dee so close to where he had lost wynne and now he had seen fanchon change day by day chameleonshe had no magic talent she was magic like the centaurs or dragons but why did you follow me into exile magic doesnt work outside xanth humfrey told me i would gradually center on my normal state if i went to mundania i would be dee permanently completely average that seemed my best choice but you said you followed me i did you were kind to wynne my mind may change but my memory doesnt you saved her from the gap dragon at great peril to yourself and you didnt take advantage of her when she you know bink remembered the beautiful girls willingness to disrobe she had been too stupid to think through the likely consequence of her offerbut dee and fanchon later would have understood and now i know you tried to help dee also she i shouldnt have cut you off thenbut we werent as smart then as later and we didnt know you as well you she broke off it doesnt matter but it did matter she was not one but three of the girls he had knownand one of those was excruciatingly beautiful but also stupid how should he react to thisthis chameleon the concept of the chameleon againthe magic lizard that changed its color and shape at will mimicking other creatures if only he could forget that omen or be sure he understood it he was sure this chameleon meant him no harm but she might in fact be the death of him her magic was involuntary but it dominated her life she had a problem certainly and so did he so she had learned that he was to be exiled for lack of magic and made her decision dee without magic bink without magic two ordinary people with a common memory of the land of magicperhaps the only thing to sustain them in drear mundania no doubt her smart phase had figured that out what an apt couple they could make these two demagicked souls so she had actedbut had had no way of knowing about the ambush set by the evil magician it had been a good notion bink liked dee she was not so ugly as to turn him off and not so lovely as to excite his distrust after his experiences with sabrina and the sorceress iriswhat was the matter with beautiful women that they could not be constantbut also not so stupid as to make it pointless just a reasonable compromise an average girl he could have lovedespecially in mundania but now they were back in xanth and her curse was in force she was not simple dee but complex chameleon swinging from extreme to extreme when all he wanted was the average im not so stupid yet that i cant figure out whats going through your mind she said im better off in mundania bink could not deny it now he almost wished it had worked out that way to have settled down with dee raised a familythat could have been its own special brand of magic there was a crash both reacted orienting on the sound it had come from somewhere above trents in trouble bink said he started down the hall carrying his staff must be stairs somewhere behind his immediate consciousness he realized that this reaction indicated a fundamental change in his attitude toward the magician that night with the sword and the sleeping manif evil was as evil did trent could not be very evil trust compelled trust maybe the magician was only trying to manipulate binks attitude regardless that attitude had suffered a fundamental erosion chameleon followed now that it was light they had no fear of pitfalls though bink knew there could be magic ones there was a grandly curving stone staircase beyond a palatial room they charged up this suddenly a ghost loomed up ooooo it moaned its great eye holes staring like holes in a dark coffin get out of my way bink snapped swinging his pole at it the ghost nonplused phased out bink ran through its remnant feeling the momentary chill of its presence trent was right there was no need to fear the insubstantial every step he took was solid apparently there were no illusions in this old castle just its harmless resident spooks that was a relief after the way they had been herded into it last night but now there was silence upstairs bink and chameleon picked their way through surprisingly opulent and wellpreserved chambers searching for their companion at another time bink would have admired the arrangements and tapestries of the rooms and halls at leisure and been glad of the tight roof that had protected them from rain and weathering and rot but right now his attention was preempted by concern what had happened to trent if there were some monster lurking in this castle summoning its victims by magic then they found a kind of upstairs library fat old books and coiled scrolls were filed on shelves along the walls in the center at a polished wood table sat trent poring over an open tome another peephole spells got him bink cried but trent lifted his head no merely the thirst for knowledge bink this is fascinating a bit abashed they halted but the crash bink started trent smiled my fault that old chair gave way under my weight he pointed to a tangle of wood much of the furniture here is fragile i was so interested in this library that i was thoughtless he rubbed his backside reminiscently i paid for it whats so fascinating about the books chameleon asked this one is a history of this castle trent explained it is not it seems just another artifact this is castle roogna roogna bink exclaimed the magician king of the fourth wave the same he ruled from here it seems when he died and the fifth wave conquered xanth eight hundred years ago his castle was deserted and finally forgotten but it was a remarkable structure much of the kings nature imbued the environs the castle had an identity of its own i remember bink said roognas talent was the conversion of magic to his own purposes trent said a subtle but powerful asset he was the ultimate tamer of the forces around him he cultivated the magic trees around here and he built this fine castle during his reign xanth was in harmony with its populace it was a kind of golden age yes bink agreed i never thought id see this famous historical place you may see more of it than you want to trent said remember how we were guided here it seems like only yesterday bink said wryly why were we herded here chameleon demanded trent glanced at her his gaze lingering i believe this locale behooves you fanchon never mind that she said ill be a lot prettier before im through mores the pity she is chameleon bink said she shifts from ugly to pretty and back again and her intelligence varies inversely she left xanth to escape that curse i would not regard that as a curse the magician commented all things to all menin due time youre not a woman she mapped i asked about this castle trent nodded well this castle requires a new resident a magician it is very selective which is one reason it has lain dormant for so many centuries it wants to restore the years of its glory therefore it must support a new king of xanth and youre a magician bink exclaimed so when you came near everything shoved you this way so it would seem there was no malign intent merely an overwhelming need a need for castle roogna and a need for xanthto make this land again what it could be a truly organized and excellent kingdom but youre not king chameleon said not yet there was a very positive quality to the statement bink and chameleon looked at each other in developing comprehension so the evil magician had reverted to formassuming he had ever changed his form they had discussed his human qualifies his seeming nobility and been deceived he had planned to invade xanth and now not ever she flared the people would never tolerate a criminal like you they havent forgotten so you do have prior knowledge of my reputation trent said mildly i had understood you to say you had not heard of me he shrugged however the good citizens of xanth may not have much choice and it would not be the first time a criminal has occupied a throne he continued calmly with the powers of this castlewhich are formidableadded to mine i may not need an army well stop you chameleon said grimly trents gaze touched her again appraisingly are you terminating the truce that gave her pause the end of the truce would put the two of them directly in trents power if what he said about this castle was true no she said but when it does end there was no hint of malignancy in treats smile yes it seems there will have to be a settlement i had thought if i allowed you to go your way you would extend the same courtesy to me but when i said the people of xanth would not necessarily have a choice i did not mean it precisely the way you seem to have taken it this castle may not permit us to do other than its will for centuries it has endured here hanging on against inevitable deterioration waiting for a magician of sufficient strength to qualify perhaps the magicsniffer we encountered in the forest was one of its representatives now it has found not one but two magicians it will not lightly yield them up from here we may be bound to gloryor extinction depending on our decision two magicians she asked remember bink has almost as much magic as i do that was the verdict of the sniffer and i am not certain it was mistaken that would place him comfortably in the magician class but i have no talent bink protested correction trent said to have an unidentified talent is hardly synonymous with having no talent but even if you are talentless there is strong magic associated with you you may be magic as is fanchon chameleon she said thats my real name the others are merely phases i beg your pardon trent said making a little sitting bow to her chameleon you mean ill change somehow bink asked half hopeful halfappalled perhaps you might metamorphose into some superior formlike a pawn becoming a queen he paused sorrythats another mundane reference i dont believe chess is known in xanth i have been too long in exile well i still wont help you try to steal the crown bink said stoutly naturally not our purposes differ we may even be rivals im not trying to take over xanth not consciously but to prevent an evil magician from doing so would you not consider ridiculous bink said disgruntled the notion was preposterous yet insidious if the only way to prevent trent fromno the time may indeed have come for us to part trent said i have appreciated your company but the situation seems to be changing perhaps you should attempt to leave this castle now i shall not oppose you should we manage to separate we can consider the truce abated fair enough how nice chameleon said you can relax over your books while the jungle tears us up i do not think anything here will actually hurt you trent said the theme of castle roogna is harmony with man he smiled again harmony not harm but i rather doubt you will be permitted to depart bink had had enough ill take my chances lets go you want me to come along chameleon asked hesitantly unless you prefer to stay with him you might make a very pretty queen in a couple of weeks trent laughed chameleon moved with alacrity they walked to the stairs leaving the magician poring over his book again another ghost interrupted them this one seemed larger than the others more solid waarrningg it moaned bink stopped you can speak what is your warning dooom beeyonnd staay oh well thats a chance weve already decided to take bink said because we are loyal to xanth xaaanth the spirit repeated with a certain feeling yes xanth so we must leave the ghost seemed nonplused it faded it almost seems theyre on our side chameleon commented maybe theyre just trying to make us stay in the castle though we cant afford to trust ghosts bink agreed they could not exit through the front gate because the portcullis was firm and they did not understand the mechanism for lifting it they poked through the downstairs rooms searching for an alternate exit bink opened one promising doorand slammed it shut as a host of leatherwinged longtoothed creatures stirred they looked like vampire bats he cracked the next open more carefully and a questing rope twined out more than casually reminiscent of the tree vines maybe the cellar chameleon suggested spying stairs leading down they tried it but at the foot huge baleful rats scurried into place and they were facing not fleeing the intruders the beasts looked too hungry too confident they surely had magic to trap any prey that entered their territory bink poked his staff at the nearest experimentally scat he exclaimed but the rat leaped onto the pole climbing up toward binks hands he shook it but the creature clung and another jumped to the staff he thunked it against the stone floor hardbut still they hung on and still they climbed that must be their magic the ability to cling bink above chameleon cried there was a chittering overhead more rats were crowding the beams bracing themselves to leap bink threw the staff away and backed hastily up the stairs holding on to chameleon for support until he could get turned around the rats did not follow this castle is really organized bink said as they emerged on the main floor i dont think it intends to let us go peacefully but weve got to try maybe a window but there were no windows on the ground floor the outer wall had been built to withstand siege no point in jumping from an upper turret someone would surely break a bone they moved on and found themselves in the kitchen area here there was a back exit normally used for supplies garbage and servants they slipped out and faced a small bridge across the moat an ideal escape route but there was motion on the bridge already snakes were emerging from the rotten planking not healthy normal reptiles but tattered discolored things whose bones showed through oozing gaps in the sagging flesh those are zombie snakes chameleon cried with genuine horror waked from the dead it figures bink said grimly this whole castle is waked from the dead rats can thrive anywhere but the other creatures died out when the castle died or maybe they come here to die even now but zombies arent as strong as real living things we can probably handle them with our staffs but he had lost his own staff in the cellar now he smelled the stench of corruption worse than that of the harpy waves of it rose from the festering snakes and the putrescent moat binks stomach made an exploratory heave he had seldom encountered genuine faradvanced decay usually either creatures were living or their bones were fairly neat and clean the stages in between of spoilage and maggot infestation and disintegration were a part of the cycle of life and death he had chosen not to inspect closely hitherto i dont want to try that bridge chameleon said well fall throughand there are zombie crocs in the water so there were big reptiles threshing the slimy surface with leathercovered bones their wormeaten eyes gazing up maybe a boat bink said or a raft uhuh even if it werent rotten and filled with zombie bugs it wouldwell look across the water he looked now came the worst of all walking jerkily along the far bank of the moat human zombies some mummified others hardly more than animate skeletons bink watched the awful things for a long moment fascinated by their very grotesqueness fragments of wrappings and decayed flesh dropped from them some dribbled caked dirt left from their overhasty emergence from their unquiet graves it was a parade of putrefaction he thought of fighting that motley army hacking apart alreadydestroyed bodies feeling their rotting verminriddled flesh on his hands wrestling with those ghastly animations saturated with the cloying stink of it all what loathsome diseases did they bear what gangrenous embraces would they bestow on him as they fell apart what possible attack would make these moldering dead lie down again the spelldriven things were closing in coming across the ragged bridge surely this was even worse for the zombies for they could not voluntarily have roused themselves they could not retire to the pleasant seclusion of the castle interior to be pressed into service in this state instead of remaining in the bliss of oblivionldont think im ready to leave yet bink said no chameleon agreed her face somewhat green not this way and the zombies halted giving bink and chameleon time to reenter castle roogna chapter rationale chameleon was now well through her normal phase which bink had known before as dee and moving into her beauty phase it was not identical to the prior wynne her hair was lighter in color and her features subtly different apparently she varied in her physical details each cycle never exactly repeating herself but always proceeding from extreme to extreme unfortunately she was also becoming less intelligent and was no help on the problem of escaping the castle she was much more interested now in getting friendly with binkand this was a distraction he felt he could not afford at the moment first his priority was to get away from here second he was not at all sure he wanted to associate himself in any permanent way with so changeable an entity if only she were beautiful and brightbut no that would not work either he realized now why she had not been tempted by trents offer to make her beautiful when they were first captured outside the shield that would merely have changed her phase if she were beautiful when she was smart she would be stupid when she was ugly and that was no improvement she needed to be free of the curse entirely and even if she could be fixed permanently at the height of both beauty and brains he would not trust her for he had been betrayed by that type too sabrinahe choked off that memory yet even an ordinary girl could get pretty dull if she had no more than ordinary intelligence or magic castle roogna now that they were not actively opposing it was a fairly pleasant residence it did its best to make itself so the surrounding gardens provided a rich plenitude of fruits grains vegetables and small game trent practiced his archery by bringing down rabbits shooting from the high embrasures using one of the fine bows in the castle armory some of the creatures were false rabbits projecting images of themselves a bit apart from their actual locations causing him to waste arrows but trent seemed to enjoy the challenge one he nabbed was a stinker whose magic aroma was such that there was nothing to do but bury the carcass in a hurry very deep another was a shrinker as it died it diminished in size until it was more like a mouse hardly usable magic always had its little surprises but some were good the kitchen did need some attention otherwise the zombies would come in to do the cooking rather than permit that chameleon took over assisted by advice from the lady ghosts who were very particular about castle roogna cuisine she made creditable meals she had no trouble with the dishes since there was an everlasting magic fountain with aseptic properties one rinse and everything sparkled in fact having a bath in that water was quite an experience it effervesced the inner partitions of the castle were as solid as the roof there seemed to be weatherproofing spells in operation each person had an opulent private bedroom with costly draperies on the walls moving rugs on the floors quivering goosedown pillows and solidsilver chamberpots they all lived like royalty bink discovered that the embroidered tapestry on the wall opposite his bed was actually a magic picture the little figures moved playing out their tiny dramas with intriguing detail miniature knights slew dragons tiny ladies sewed and in the supposed privacy of interior chambers those knights and ladies embraced at first bink closed his eyes to those scenes but soon his natural voyeurism dominated and he watched it all and wished that he couldbut no that would not be proper though he knew that chameleon was willing the ghosts were no problem they even became familiar bink got to know them individually one was the gatekeeper who had looked in on them that first night when the portcullis crashed down another was the chambermaid a third was the cooks assistant there were six in all each of whom had died inappropriately and so lacked proper burial rites they were shades really but without proper volition only the king of xanth could absolve them and they could not leave the castle so they were doomed to serve here forever unable to perform their accustomed chores they were basically nice people who had no control over the castle itself and constituted only an incidental part of its enchantment they helped wherever they could pitifully eager to please telling chameleon where to search for the new foods and telling bink stories of their lives here in the grand old days they had been surprised and chagrined by the intrusion of living people at first for they had been in isolation for centuries but they realized it was part of the imperative of the castle itself and now they had adjusted trent spent most of his time in the library as if seeking to master all of its accumulated knowledge at first chameleon spent some time there too interested in intellectual things but as she lost intelligence she lost interest her researches changed now she looked avidly for some spell to make her normal when the library did not provide that she left it to poke around the castle and grounds so long as she was alone no untoward things manifested no rats no carnivorous vines no zombies she was no prisoner here only the men she searched for sources of magic she ate things freely alarming bink who knew how poisonous magic could be but she seemed to lead a charmed existence charmed by castle roogna one of her discoveries was serendipitous a small red fruit growing plentifully on one of the garden trees chameleon tried to bite into one but the rind was tough so she took it to the kitchen to chop it in half with a cleaver no ghosts wore present they generally appeared now only when they had business thus chameleon did not have warning about the nature of this fruit she was careless and dropped one of the fruits on the floor bink heard the explosion and came running chameleon quite pretty now was huddling in a corner of the kitchen what happened bink demanded looking about for hostile magic oh bink she cried turning to him with woeful relief her homemade dress was in disarray exposing her finely formed breasts above and her firm round thighs below what a difference a few days made she was not at the height of her loveliness but she was quite adequate to the need the need bink found her in his arms aware that she was eager to do any bidding he might make it was difficult indeed to steel himself against the obvious for she also had much of dee in herthe aspect he had liked before he understood her nature he could take her now make love to herand neither her stupid phase nor her smart phase would condemn him but he was not a casual lover and he did not want to make any such commitment at this time in this situation he pushed her away gently the action requiring far more effort than he cared to show what happened he asked again itit banged she said he had to remind himself that her diminishing mentality was the other face of her curse now it was easier to hold off her lush body a body without a mind did not appeal to him what banged the cherry the cherry this was the first he had heard about the new fruit but after patient questioning he elicited the story those are cherry bombs he exclaimed comprehending if you had actually eaten one she was not yet so stupid as to misunderstand that oh my mouth oh your head those things are powerful didnt milly warn you milly was the chambermaid ghost she was busy what would a ghost be busy with well this was no time to explore that after this dont eat anything unless a ghost tells you its okay chameleon nodded dutifully bink picked up a cherry cautiously and considered it it was just a hard little red ball marked only where its stem had broken off old magician roogna probably used these bombs in warfare he didnt like war as i understand it but he never let his defenses grow soft any attackerswhy one man on the ramparts with a slingshot could decimate an army lobbing these cherry bombs down no telling what other trees there are in the arsenal if you dont stop fooling around with strange fruits i could blow up the castle she said watching the dissipating smoke the floor was scorched and a table had lost a leg blow up the castle bink echoed suddenly thinking of something chameleon why dont you bring in some more cherry bombs id like to experiment with them but be careful very careful dont knock or drop any sure she said as eager to please as any ghost very careful and dont eat any that was not quite a joke bink gathered cloth and string and made bags of assorted sizes soon he had bagbombs of varying power he planted these strategically around the castle one bag he kept for himself i think we are ready to depart castle roogna he said but first i have to talk with trent you stand here by the kitchen door and if you see any zombies throw cherries at them he was sure no zombie had the coordination to catch such a bomb and throw it back wormy eyes and rotting flesh necessarily had poor handeye integration so they would be vulnerable and if you see trent come down and not me throw a cherry into that pile fast before he gets within six feet of you and he pointed to a large bomb he had tied to a major support column do you understand she didnt but he drilled her on it until she had it straight she was to throw a cherry at anything she sawexcept bink himself now he was ready he went up to the library to speak with the evil magician his heart beat loudly within him now that the moment of confrontation had come but he knew what he had to do a ghost intercepted him it was milly the chambermaid her white sheet arranged to resemble her working dress her blackhole eyes somehow having the aspect of oncesultry humanity the ghosts had become shapeless from sheer neglect and carelessness in the course of the past few centuries of isolation but now that there was company they were shaping up into their proper forms another week would have them back into people outlines and people colors though of course they would still be ghosts bink suspected milly would turn out to be a rather pretty girl and he wondered just how she had died a liaison with a castle guest then a stabbing by the jealous wife who discovered them what is it milly he asked pausing he had mined the castle but he bore no malice toward its unfortunate denizens he hoped his bluff would be effective so that it would not be necessary to destroy the home of the ghosts who really were not responsible for its grandiose mischief the kingprivate conference she said her speech was still somewhat windy as it was hard for an entity with so little physical substance hardly any ectoplasmto enunciate clearly but he could make it out conference theres nobody here but us he objected or do you mean hes on the pot milly blushed as well as she was able to though as chambermaid she had been accustomed to the chore of collecting and emptying out the chamberpots she felt that any reference to a persons actual performance on them was uncouth it was as if the substance were completely divorced from the function perhaps she liked to believe that the refuse appeared magically overnight untouched by human intestine magic fertilizer no well im sorry but ill have to interrupt him bink said you see i dont recognize him as king and i am about to depart the castle oh she put one foggily formed hand to her vague face in feminine misgiving but seee very well bink followed her to the little chapel room adjacent to the library it was actually an offshoot from the master bedroom with no direct access to the library but it had as it turned out a small window opening onto the library since the gloom of the unlit chapel was deeper than that of the other room it was possible to see without being seen trent was not alone before him stood a woman of early middle age still handsome though the first flush of beauty had faded her hair was tied back and up in a functional fairly severe bun but there were smile lines around her mouth and eyes and beside her was a boy perhaps ten years old who bore a direct resemblance to the woman and had to be her son neither person spoke but their breathing and slight shifts of posture showed that they were alive and solid not ghosts how had they come here and what was their business why hadnt bink or chameleon seen them enter it was almost impossible to approach this castle unobserved it was designed that way to be readily defensible in case of attack and the portcullis remained down blocking off the front entry bink had been down by the kitchen entrance fashioning his bombs but granting that they obviously had come why didnt they speak why didnt trent speak they all just looked at each other in eerie silence this whole scene seemed to make no sense bink studied the odd silent pair they were vaguely reminiscent of the widow and son of donald the shade the ones he had told about the silver oak so that they would not have to live in poverty any more the similarity was not in their physical appearance for these were betterlooking people who had obviously not suffered poverty it was in their atmosphere of quiet loss had they lost their man too and come to trent for some kind of help if so they had chosen the wrong magician bink drew away disliking the feeling of snooping even evil magicians deserved some privacy he walked around to the hall and back to the top of the stairs milly her warning completed vanished apparently it required some effort for the ghosts to manifest and speak intelligibly and they had to recuperate in whatever vacuum they occupied when off duty he resumed his march to the library this time stepping heavily so as to make his approach audible trent would have to introduce him to the visitors but only the magician was there as bink pushed open the door he was seated at the table poring over another tome he looked up as bink entered come for a good book bink he inquired bink lost his composure the people what happened to them trent frowned people bink i saw them a woman and a boy right here bink faltered look i didnt mean to peek but when milly said you were in conference i looked in from the chapel trent nodded then you did see i did not intend to burden you with my private problems who are they how did they get here what did you do to them they were my wife and son trent said gravely they died bink remembered the story the sailor had told of the evil magicians mundane family killed by mundane illness but they were here i saw them and seeing is believing trent sighed bink they were two roaches transformed into the likenesses of my loved ones these were the only two people i ever loved or ever shall love i miss them i need themif only to gaze on their likenesses on occasion when i lost them there was nothing left for me in mundania he brought an embroidered castle roogna handkerchief to his face and bink was amazed to see that the evil magicians eyes were bright with tears but trent retained his control however this is not properly your concern and i prefer not to discuss it what is it that brings you here bink oh yes he was committed and had to follow through somehow the verve had gone out of it but he proceeded chameleon and i are leaving castle roogna the handsome brow wrinkled again this time for real bink said nettled the zombies wont stop us and you find it necessary to inform me we already have our understanding about this and i am sure i would become aware of your absence in due course if you feared i would oppose it it would have been to your advantage to depart without my knowledge bink did not smile no i feel it behooves me under our truce to inform you trent made a little wave of one hand very well i will not claim i am glad to see you go i have come to appreciate your qualities as shown in the precision of your ethic that caused you to notify me of your present action and chameleon is a fine girl of like persuasion and daily more pretty i would much prefer to have you both on my side but since this cannot be i wish you every fortune elsewhere bink found this increasingly awkward this is not exactly a social leavetaking im sorry he wished now that he hadnt observed trents wife and son or learned their identifies those had obviously been good people undeserving of their fate and bink was wholly in sympathy with the magicians grief the castle wont let us go voluntarily we have to force it so we have planted bombs and bombs trent exclaimed those are mundane artifacts there are no bombs in xanthand shall be none never while i am king it seems there were bombs in the old days bink said doggedly theres a cherrybomb tree in the yard each cherry explodes on impact violently cherry bombs trent repeated so what have you done with the cherries we have used them to mine the castle supports if roogna tries to stop us we will destroy it so it is better if it lets us go in peace i needed to tell you so you could disarm the bombs after were gone why tell me this dont you oppose my designs and those of castle roogna if magician and castle were destroyed you would be the clean victor not clean its not the kind of victory i want bink said ilook you could do so much good in xanth if you only but he knew it was useless it simply was not the nature of an evil magician to devote himself to good here is a list of the bomb locations he said setting a piece of paper on the table all you have to do is pick up the packages and bags very carefully and take them outside trent shook his head i dont believe your bomb threat will work to effect your escape bink the castle is not intelligent per se it only reacts to certain stimuli it might let chameleon go but not you in its perception you are a magician therefore you must remain you may have outthought roogna but it will not comprehend the full nature of your ploy thus the zombies will balk you as before then we shall have to bomb it exactly you will have to set off the cherries and all of us will be destroyed together no well get outside first and heave a cherry back if the castle cannot be bluffed it cant be bluffed it is not a thinking thing it merely reacts you will be forced to destroy itand you know i cant permit that i need roogna now it was getting tough bink was ready chameleon will set off the bombs if you transform me he said feeling the chill of challenge he didnt like this sort of power play but had known it would come to this if you interfere in any way oh i would not break the truce but you cant break the truce either i rejoin chameleon alone or she heaves a cherry into a bomb shes too stupid to do anything but follow directions listen to me bink it is my given word that prevents me from breaking the truce not your tactical preparations i could transform you into a flea and then transform a roach into your likeness and send that likeness down to meet chameleon once she set down the cherry binks face reflected his chagrin the evil magician could void the plan chameleonstupid would not catch on until too late that nadir of intelligence worked against him as well as for him i am not doing this trent said i tell you about the possibility merely to demonstrate that i too have ethics the end does not justify the means i feel that you have allowed yourself to forget this temporarily and if you will listen a moment you will see your error and correct it i cannot allow you to destroy this marvelous and historically significant edifice to no point already bink was feeling guilty was he to be talked out of a course he knew was right surely you realize the evil magician continued persuasively that the entire area would erupt in vengeful wrath if you did this thing you might be outside the castle but you would remain in the roogna environs and you would die horribly chameleon too chameleon toothat hurt that beautiful girl devoured by a tangle tree ripped apart by zombies it is a risk i must take bink said grimly though he realized the magician was correct the way they had been herded to this castlethere would be no escaping the savagery of the forest maybe you will be able to persuade the castle to let us go rather than set off that chain of events you are a stubborn one yes at least hear me out first if i cannot persuade you then what must be must be though i abhor it speak briefly bink was surprised at his own temerity but he felt he was doing what he had to if trent tried to approach within six feet bink would take off to avoid transformation he might be able to outrun the magician but even so he could not wait too long he was afraid that chameleon would tire of waiting and do something foolish i really dont want to see you or chameleon die and of course i value my own survival trent said while i love nobody alive today you two have been as close to me as anyone it is almost as if fate has decreed that like types must be banned from the conventional society of xanth we like types bink exclaimed indignantly i apologize for an invidious comparison we have been through a great deal together in a short time and i think it is fair to say we have saved each others lives on occasion perhaps it was to associate with your like that i really returned to xanth maybe so bink said stiffly suppressing the mixed feelings he was experiencing but that does not justify your conquering xanth and probably killing many entire families trent looked pained but controlled himself i do not pretend that it does bink the mundane tragedy of my family was the stimulus not the justification for my return i had nothing remaining in mundania worth living for so naturally my orientation shifted to xanth my homeland i would not try to harm xanth i hope to benefit it by opening it up to the contemporary reality before it is too late even if some deaths occur this is a small price to pay for the eventual salvation of xanth you think xanth wont survive unless you conquer it bink tried to put a sneer in his tone but it didnt register very well if only he had the verbal control and projection of the evil magician yes actually i do xanth is overdue for a new wave of colonization and such a wave would benefit it as the prior ones did the waves were murder and rapine and destruction the curse of xanth trent shook his head some were that yes but others were highly beneficial such as the fourth wave from which this castle dates it was not the fact of the waves but their mismanagement that made trouble on the whole they were essential to the progress of xanth but i dont expect you to believe that right now im merely trying to persuade you to spare this castle and yourself im not trying to convert you to my cause something about this interchange was troubling bink increasingly the evil magician seemed too mature too reasonable too knowledgeable too committed trent was wronghe had to beyet he spoke with such verisimilitude that bink had difficulty pinpointing that wrongness try to convert me he said im glad you said that bink id like you to know my logical rationale perhaps you can offer some positive critique that sounded like a sophisticated intellectual ploy bink tried to perceive it as sarcasm but he was sure it was not he feared the magician was more intelligent than he but he also knew what was right maybe i can he said guardedly he felt as if he were walking into the wilderness picking the most likely paths yet being inevitably guided to the trap at the center castle roogna on the physical and intellectual levels roogna had lacked a voice for eight hundred years but now it had one bink could no more fence with that voice than he could with the magicians keen swordyet he had to try my rationale is dual part of it relates to mundania and part to xanth you see despite certain lapses in ethics and politics mundania has progressed remarkably in the past few centuries thanks to the numbers of people who have made discoveries and spread information in many respects it is a far more civilized region than xanth unfortunately the mundanes powers of combat have also progressed this you will have to take on faith for i have no way to prove it here mundania has weapons that are easily capable of eradicating all life in xanth regardless of the shield thats a lie bink exclaimed nothing can penetrate the shield except perhaps the three of us trent murmured but the main restriction of the shield is against living things you could charge through the shieldyour body would penetrate it quite readilybut you would be dead when you got there same thing not the same thing bink you see there are big guns that throw missiles which are dead to begin with such as powerful bombs like your cherry bombs but much worse preset to explode on contact xanth is a small area compared to mundania if the mundanes were determined they could saturate xanth in such an attack even the shieldstone would be destroyed the people of xanth can no longer afford to ignore the mundanes there are too many mundanians we cant remain undiscovered forever they can and will one day wipe us out unless we establish relations now bink shook his head in disbelief and incomprehension but trent continued without rancor now the xanth internal aspect is quite another matter it poses no threat to mundania since magic is not operative them but it does pose an insidious but compelling threat to life as we know it in xanth itself xanth poses a threat to xanth this is nonsense on the face of it now trents smile was a bit patronizing i can see you would have trouble with the logic of recent mundanian science but he sobered before bink could inquire about that no i am being unfair to you this internal threat of xanth is something i learned just in the past few days from my researches in this library and it is important this aspect alone justifies the necessity of preserving this castle for its accumulated ancient lore is vital to xanth society bink remained dubious weve lived without this library for eight centuries we can live without it now ah but the manner of that life trent shook his head as if perceiving something too vast to be expressed he got up and moved to a shelf behind him he took down a book and riffled carefully through its creaking old pages he set it down before bink open what is that picture a dragon bink said promptly trent flipped a page and this a manticora what was the point the pictures were very nice though they did not coincide precisely with contemporary creatures the proportions and details were subtly wrong and this it was a picture of a humanheaded quadruped with hoofs a horses tail and catlike forelegs a lamia and this a centaur lookwe can admire pictures all day but what do these creatures have in common trent asked they have human heads or forepartsexcept the dragon though the one in this book has an almost human shortness of snout some have human intelligence but exactly consider the sequence trace a dragon back through similar species and it becomes increasingly manlike does that suggest anything to you just that some creatures are more manlike than others but thats no threat to xanth anyway most of these pictures are out of date the actual creatures dont look quite like that any more did the centaurs teach you the theory of evolution oh sure that todays creatures are evolved from more primitive ones selected for survival go back far enough and you find a common ancestor right but in mundania creatures like the lamia manticora and dragon never evolved of course not theyre magic they evolve by magic selection only in xanth can yet obviously xanth creatures started from mundane ancestors they have so many affinities all right bink said impatiently they descended from mundanes what has that got to do with your conquering xanth according to conventional centaur history man has been in xanth only a thousand years trent said in that period there have been ten major waves of immigration from mundania twelve bink said that depends on how you count them at any rate this continued for nine hundred years until the shield cut off those migrations yet there are many partially human forms that predate the supposed arrival of human beings does that seem to be significant bink was increasingly worried that chameleon would foul up or that the castle would figure out a way to neutralize the cherry bombs he was not certain that castle roogna could not think for itself was the evil magician stalling to make time for this ill give you one more minute to make your case then were going regardless how could partially human forms have evolvedunless they had human ancestors convergent evolution doesnt create the unnatural mishmash monsters we have here it creates creatures adapted to their ecological niches and human features fit few niches there had to have been people in xanth many thousands of years ago all right bink agreed thirty seconds these people must have interbred with animals to form the composites we knowthe centaurs manticoras merfolk harpies and all and the creatures crossbred among themselves and the composites interbred with other composites producing things like the chimera bink turned to go i think your minute is up he said then he froze they what the species mated with other species to create hybrids manheaded beasts beastheaded men impossible men can only mate with men i mean with women it would be unnatural to xanth is an unnatural land bink magic makes remarkable things possible bink saw that logic defied emotion but even if they did he said with difficulty that still doesnt justify your conquering xanth whats past is past a change of government wont i think this background does justify my assumption of power bink because the accelerated evolution and mutation produced by magic and interspecies miscegenation is changing xanth if we remain cut off from the mundane world there will in time be no human beings left only crossbreeds only the constant influx of pure stock in the last millennium has enabled man to maintain his typeand there really are not too many human beings here now our population is diminishingnot through famine disease or war but through the attrition of crossbreeding when a man mates with a harpy the result is not a manchild no bink cried horrified no one wouldwould breed with a filthy harpy filthy harpy perhaps not but how about a clean pretty harpy trent inquired with a lift of his eyebrow they arent all alike you know we see only their outcasts not their fresh young no suppose he had drunk from a love spring accidentallyand the next to drink there was a harpy no he but bink knew better a love spell provided an overriding compulsion he remembered his experience with the love spring by the chasm from which he had almost drunk before seeing the griffin and the unicorn in their embrace there had been a harpy there he shuddered reminiscently have you ever been tempted by an attractive mermaid or a lady centaur trent persisted no but an insidious memory picture of the elegant firm mermaid breasts came to him and cherie the centaur who had given him a lift during the first leg of his journey to see the magician humfreywhen he touched her had it really been accidental she had threatened to drop him in a trench but she hadnt been serious she was a very nice filly rather person honesty compelled his reluctant correction maybe and surely there were others less scrupulous than you trent continued inexorably they might indulge in certain circumstances might they not just for variety dont the boys of your village hang around the centaur grounds on the sly as they did in my day boys like zink and jama and potipher bullies and troublemakers who had caused ire in the centaur camp bink remembered that too he had missed the significance before of course they had gone to see the barebreasted centaur fillies and if they caught one alone bink knew his face was red what are you getting at he demanded trying to cover his embarrassment just this xanth must have had intercourse withsorry bad wordmust have had contact with mundania long before the date of our earliest records before the waves because only in mundania is the human species pure from the time a man sets foot in xanth he begins to change he develops magic and his children develop more magic until some of them become fullfledged magicians and if they remain they inevitably become magic themselves or their descendants do either by breaking down the natural barriers between species or by evolving into imps elves goblins giants trollsdid you get a good look at humfrey hes a gnome bink said without thinking then oh no hes a man and a good onebut hes well along the route to something else hes at the height of his magical powers nowbut his children if he ever has any may be true gnomes i dare say he knows this which is why he wont marry and consider chameleonshe has no direct magic because she has become magic this is the way the entire human populace of xanth will go inevitablyunless there is a steady infusion of new blood from mundania the shield must come down the magic creatures of xanth must be permitted to migrate outside freely there to revert slowly and naturally to their original species new animals must come in but bink found himself fumbling with the horrors of these concepts if there was always always an interchange before what happened to the people who came thousands of years ago probably there was some obstruction for a while cutting off migration xanth could have been a true island for a thousand years or so trapping the original prehistoric human settlers so that they merged entirely with the existing forms and gave rise to the centaurs and other sports it is happening again under the shield human beings must enough bink whispered fundamentally shocked i cant listen to any more you will defuse the cherry bombs like a bolt of lightning sanity returned no im taking chameleon and leavingnow but you have to understand no the evil magician was beginning to make sense if bink listened any more he would be subvertedand xanth would be lost what you suggest is an abomination it can not be true i can not accept it trent sighed with seemingly genuine regret well it was worth a try though i did fear you would reject it i still cannot permit you to destroy this castle bink braced himself to move to get out of transformation range six feet trent shook his head no need to flee bink i shall not break the truce i could have done that when i showed you the pictures but i value my given word so i must compromise if you will not join me i shall have to join you what bink whose ears were almost closed to the evil magicians beguiling logic was caught off guard spare castle roogna defuse the bombs i will see you safely clear of these environs this was too easy your word my word trent said solemnly you can make the castle let us go yes this is another facet of what i have learned in these archives i have only to speak the proper words to it and it will even facilitate our departure your word bink repeated suspiciously so far trent had not broken ityet what guarantee was there no tricks no sudden change of mind my word of honor bink what could he do if the magician wanted to break the truce he could transform bink into a tadpole now then sneak up on chameleon and transform her andbink was inclined to trust him all right go and defuse your bombs i will settle with roogna bink went chameleon met him with a glad little cryand this time he was quite satisfied to accept her embrace trent has agreed to get us out of here he told her oh bink im so glad she exclaimed kissing him he had to grab her hand to make sure she didnt drop the cherry bomb she still held she was growing lovelier by the hour her personality was not changing much except as her diminishing intelligence caused her to be less complex less suspicious he liked that personalityand now he had to admit he liked her beauty too she was of xanth she was magic she did not try to manipulate him for her private purposesshe was his type of girl but he knew that her stupidity would turn him off just as her ugliness during the other phase had he could live with neither a lovely moron nor an ugly genius she was attractive only right now while her intelligence was fresh in his memory and her beauty was manifest to his sight and touch to believe otherwise would be folly he drew away from her we have to remove the bombs carefully he said but what about the emotional bombs within him chapter wiggle the three of them walked out of castle roogna without challenge the portcullis was raised trent had found the hoisting winch oiled it and cranked it up with the aid of the magic inherent in its mechanism the ghosts appeared to bid them all fond adieu chameleon cried at this parting and even bink felt sad he knew how lonely it would be for the ghosts after these few days of living company and he even respected the indomitable castle itself it did what it had to do much as bink himself did they carried bags of fruits from the garden and wore functional clothing from the castle closets stored for eight hundred years without deterioration by means of the potent ancient spells they looked like royalty and felt like it too castle roogna had taken good care of them the gardens were magnificent no storm erupted this time no trees made threatening gestures instead they moved their limbs to be touched gently in the gesture of parting friendship no vicious animals appearedand no zombies in a surprisingly short time the castle was out of sight we are now beyond roognas environs trent announced we must resume full alertness for there is no truce with the true wilderness we bink asked arent you going back to the castle not at this time the magician said binks suspicion was renewed just exactly what did you say to that castle i said i shall returnas king roogna shall rule xanth again and it believed that trents gaze was tranquil why should it doubt the truth i could hardly win the crown while remaining confined in the wilderness bink did not respond the evil magician had never said hed given up his plot to conquer xanth after all he had merely agreed to see bink and chameleon safely out of the castle he had done this so now they were back where they had been operating under a truce to get them all safely out of the remainder of the wilderness after thatbinks mind was blank the untamed forest did not take long to make its presence felt the trio cut through a small glade girt with pretty yellow flowers and a swarm of bees rose up angrily they buzzed the three not actually touching or stinging but sheering off abruptly at short range chameleon sneezed and sneezed again violently then bink sneezed too and so did trent sneeze bees the magician exclaimed between paroxysms transform them bink cried i cantachoofocus on them my eyes are watering so achoo anyway they are innocent creatures of the ah aahh achooo run you dopes chameleon cried they ran as they cleared the glade the bees left off and the sneezes stopped good thing they werent choke bees the magician said wiping his flowing eyes bink agreed a sneeze or two was okay but a dozen piled on top of one another was a serious matter there had hardly been time to breathe their noise had alerted others in the jungle that was always the background threat here there was a bellow and the sound of big paws striking the ground all too soon a huge firesnorting dragon hove into view it charged right through the sneeze glade but the bees left it strictly alone they knew better than to provoke any fire sneezes that would burn up their flowers change it change it chameleon cried as the dragon oriented on her dragons seemed to have a special taste for the fairest maidens cant trent muttered by the time it gets within six feet its fire will have scorched us all into roasts its got a twentyfoot blowtorch you arent much help she complained transform me bink cried with sudden inspiration good idea abruptly bink was a sphinx he retained his own head but he had the body of a bull wings of an eagle and legs of a lion and he was hugehe towered over the dragon i had no idea sphinxes grew this big he boomed sorryi forgot again trent said i was thinking of the legendary sphinx in mundania but the mundanes dont have magic this one must have wandered out from xanth a long time ago for thousands of years it has been stone petrified petrified what could scare a sphinx that size chameleon wondered peering up at binks monstrous face but there was business to attend to begone beastie bink thundered the dragon was slow to adapt to the situation it shot a jet of orange flame at bink scorching his feathers the blast didnt hurt but it was annoying bink reached out with one lions paw and swiped at the dragon it was a mere ripple of effort but the creature was thrown sideways into a tree a shower of rock nuts dropped on it from the angry tree the dragon gave a single yelp of pain doused its fire and fled bink circled around carefully hoping he hadnt stepped on anyone why didnt we think of this before he bellowed i can give you a ride right to the edge of the jungle no one will recognize us and no creature will bother us he squatted as low as possible and chameleon and trent climbed up his tail to his back bink moved forward with a slow stride that was nevertheless faster than any man could run they were on their way but not for long chameleon bouncing around on the sphinxs hornyskinned back decided she had to go to the bathroom there was nothing to do but let her go bink hunched down so she could slide safely to the ground trent took advantage of the break to stretch his legs he walked around to binks huge face id transform you back but its really better to stick with the form until finished with it he said i really have no concrete evidence that frequent transformations are harmful to the recipient but it seems best not to gamble at this time since the sphinx is an intelligent life form you arent suffering intellectually no im okay bink agreed better than ever in fact can you guess this riddle what walks on four legs in the morning two legs at noon and three in the evening i shall not answer trent said looking startled in all the legends ive heard some sphinxes committed suicide when the correct answers to their riddles were given those were the smaller type of sphinx a different speciesbut i seem to have muddled the distinctions somewhat and would not care to gamble on the absence of affinity uh no bink said chagrined i guess the riddle was from the mind of the sphinx not me im sure all sphinxes had a common ancestor though i dont know the difference between one kind and another odd not about your ignorance of mundane legends about your riddle memory you are the sphinx i didnt move your mind into an existing body for the original creatures have all been dead or petrified for millennia i transformed you into a similar monster a binksphinx but if you actually have sphinx memories true sphinx memories there must be ramifications of your magic you dont comprehend bink said i wish i understood the real nature of magicany magic yes it is a mystery magic exists in xanth nowhere else why what is its mechanism why does xanth seem to be adjacent to any mundane land in geography language and culture how is this magic in all its multiple levels transmitted from the geographic region to the inhabitants i have pondered that bink said i thought perhaps some radiation from the rock or nutritional value of the soil when i am king i shall initiate a study program to determine the true story of xanths uniqueness when trent was king the project was certainly worthwhile in fact fascinatingbut not at that price for a moment bink was tempted with the merest swipe of his mighty forepaw he could squash the evil magician flat ending the threat forever no even if trent were not really his friend bink could not violate the truce that way besides he didnt want to remain a monster all his life physically or morally the lady is taking her sweet time trent muttered bink moved his ponderous head searching for chameleon shes usually very quick about that sort of thing she doesnt like being alone then he thought of something else unless she went looking for her spellyou know to make her normal she left xanth in an effort to nullify her magic and now that shes stuck back in xanth she wants some kind of countermagic shes not very bright right now and trent stroked his chin this is the jungle i dont want to violate her privacy but maybe wed better check for her umm well i guess you can stand one more transformation trent decided ill make you a bloodhound thats a mundane animal a kind of dog very good at sniffing out a trail if you run into her doing something private well youll only be an animal not a human voyeur abruptly bink was a keennosed floppyeared loosefaced creature smelloriented he could pick up the lingering odor of anythinghe was sure of that he had never before realized how overwhelmingly important the sense of smell was strange that he had ever depended on any lesser sense trent concealed their supplies in a mock tangle tree and faced about very well bink lets sniff her out bink understood him well enough but could not reply as this was not a speaking form of animal chameleons trail was so obvious it was a wonder trent himself couldnt smell it bink put his nose to the groundhow natural that the head be placed so close to the primary source of information instead of raised foolishly high as in trents caseand moved forward competently the route led around behind a bush and on into the wilderness she had been lured away in her present low ebb of intelligence almost anything would fool her yet there was no consistent odor of any animal or plant she might have followed that suggested magic worried bink woofed and sniffed on the magician following a magic lure was almost certainly trouble but her trace did not lead into a tangle tree or gucktooth swamp or the lair of a wyvern it wove intricately between these obvious hazards bearing generally south into the deepest jungle something obviously had led her guiding her safely past all threatsbut what and whereand why bink knew the essence if not the detail some willothewisp spell had beckoned her tempting her ever forward always just a little out of reach perhaps it had seemed to offer some elixir some enchantment to make her normaland so she had followed it would lead her into untracked wilderness where she would be lost and leave her there she would not survive long bink hesitated he had not lost the trail that could never happen there was something else what is it bink trent inquired i know she was following the ignis fatuusbut since we are close on her trail we should be able to he broke off becoming aware of the other thing it was a shuddering in the ground as of some massive object striking it an object weighing many tons trent looked around i cant see it bink can you smell it bink was silent the wind was wrong he could not smell whatever was making that sound from this distance want me to transform you into something more powerful trent asked im not sure i like this situation first the swamp gas now this strange pursuit if bink changed he would no longer be able to sniff out chameleons trail he remained silent very well bink but stay close by me i can transform you into a creature to meet any emergency but you have to be within range i believe were walking into extreme danger or having it walk up on us and he touched his sword they moved onbut the shuddering grew bolder becoming a measured thumping as of some ponderous animal yet they saw nothing now it was directly behind them and gaining i think wed better hide trent said grimly discretion is said to be the better part of valor good idea they circled a harmless beerbarrel tree and watched silently the thumping became loud extremely loud the whole tree shook with the force of the measured vibrations tramp tramp tramp small branches fell off the tree and a leak sprang in the trunk a thin jet of beer formed splashing down under binks sensitive nose he recoiled even in the human state he had never been partial to that particular beverage he peered around the trunkyet there was nothing then at last something became visible a branch crashed off a spikespire tree splintering bushes waved violently aside a section of earth subsided more beer jetted from developing cracks in the trunk of their hiding place filling the air with its malty fragrance still nothing tangible could be seen its invisible trent whispered wiping beer off one hand an invisible giant invisible that meant trent couldnt transform it he had to see what he enchanted together silently steeped in intensifying beer fumes they watched the giant pass monstrous human footprints appeared each ten feet long sinking inches deep into the forest soil trampand the trees jumped and shuddered and shed their fruits and leaves and branches trampand an ice cream bush disappeared becoming a mere patina of flavored discoloration on the flat surface of the depression trampand a tangle tree hugged its tentacles about itself frightened tramp and a fallen trunk splintered across the fivefoot width of the giants print a stench washed outward suffocatingly like that of a stenchpuffer or an overflowing outhouse in the heat of summer binks keen nose hurt i am not a cowardly man trent murmured but i begin to feel fear when neither spell nor sword can touch an enemy his nose twitched his body odor alone is deadly he must have feasted on rotten blivets for breakfast bink didnt recognize that food if that was the kind of fruit mundane trees formed he didnt want any bink became aware that his own hackles were erect he had heard of such a monster but taken it as a joke an invisible but not unsmellable giant if he is in proportion trent remarked that giant is some sixty feet tall that would be impossible in mundania for purely physical reasons squarecube law and such but herewho can say nay to magic hes looking over much of the forest not through it he paused considering he evidently was not following us where is he going wherever chameleon went bink thought he growled right bink wed better track her down quickly before she gets stepped on they moved on following what was now a welltrodden trail where the huge prints crossed chameleons traces the scent of the giant was overlaid so heavy that binks refined nose rebelled he skirted the prints and picked up chameleons much milder scent on the far side now a whistling descended from right angles to the path they were following bink looked up nervously and saw a griffin angling carefully down between the trees trent whipped out his sword and backed toward the black bole of an oilbarrel tree facing the monster bink in no condition to fight it bared his teeth and backed toward the same protection he was glad it wasnt a dragon one really good tongue of fire could set off the tree explosively and wipe them all out as it was the overhanging branches would interfere with the monsters flight forcing it to do combat on the ground still a chancy business but it restricted the battle zone to two dimensions which was a net advantage for bink and trent maybe if bink distracted it trent could get safely within range to transform it the griffin settled to earth folding its extensive glossy wings its coiled lions tail twitched about and its great front eagles talons made streaks in the dirt its eagle head oriented on trent cawp it inquired bink could almost feel that deadly beak slicing through his flesh a really healthy griffin could take on a mediumsized dragon in single combat and this one was healthy he nudged within transformation range follow the giant tracks that way trent said to the monster cant miss it bawp the griffin said it turned about oriented on the giant tracks bunched its lion muscles spread its wings and launched itself into the air it flew lowlevel along the channel the invisible giant had carved through the forest trent and bink exchanged startled glances they had had a narrow escape griffins were very agile in combat and trents magic might not have taken effect in time it only wanted directions trent said must be something very strange up ahead wed better get there in a hurry be unfortunate if some parthuman cult was having a ritual sacrifice ritual sacrifice bink growled his confusion you know trent said grimly bloody altar beautiful virgin maiden rrowr bink took off down the trail soon they heard a commotion ahead it was a medley of thumps crashes bellows squawks and crashes sounds more like a battle than a party trent observed i really cant think what at last they came in sight of the happening they paused amazed it was an astonishing assemblage of creatures ranged in a large loose circle facing in dragons griffins manticoras harpies land serpents trolls goblins fairies and too many others to take in all at once there were even a few human beings it was not a freeforall all were intent on individual exercises stamping their feet biting at air slamming their hooves together and banging on rocks in the interior of the circle a number of creatures were dead or dying ignored by the others bink could see and smell the blood and hear their groans of agony this was a battle certainlybut where was the enemy it was not the invisible giant his prints were confined to one quadrant not overlapping the territory of his neighbors i thought i knew something about magic trent said shaking his head but this is beyond my comprehension these creatures are natural enemies yet they ignore one another and do not feed on prey have they happened on a cache of loco woof bink exclaimed he had spied chameleon she had two large flat stones in her hands and was holding them about a foot apart while she stared intently between them suddenly she clapped them together with such force that they both fell out of her hands she peered at the air above them smiled enigmatically picked them up and repeated the procedure trent followed binks gaze loco he repeated but bink could smell no loco her too it must be an area spell wed better back off before we also fall prey to it they started to retreat though bink did not want to desert chameleon a grizzled old centaur cantered up dont just meander around he snapped get around to the north quadrant he pointed weve suffered heavy losses there and bigfoot cant do it all he cant even see the enemy theyll break through any minute get some rocks dont use your sword fool dont use my sword on what trent demanded with understandable ire the wiggles naturally cut one in half all you have is two wiggles you the wiggles trent breathed and bink growled his own chagrin the centaur sniffed you been drinking bigfoots passage holed the beerbarrel tree we took refuge behind trent explained i thought the wiggles had been eradicated so thought we all the centaur said but theres a healthy colony swarming here you have to crush them or chew them or burn them or drown them we cant afford to let a single one escape now get moving trent looked about where are the stones here ive collected a pile the centaur showed the way i knew i couldnt handle it myself so i sent out willothewisps to summon help suddenly bink recognized the centaur herman the hermit exiled from the centaur community for obscenity almost a decade ago amazing that he had survived here in the deepest wildernessbut centaurs were hardy folk trent did not make the connection the episode had happened after his exile but he well knew the horror the wiggles represented he picked up two good rocks from hermans cache and strode toward the north quadrant bink followed he had to help too if even one wiggle got away there would at some later date be another swarming perhaps not stopped in time he caught up to the magician woof woof he barked urgently trent looked straight ahead bink if i transform you here and now the others will see and know me for what i am they may turn against me and the siege against the wiggles will be broken i think we can contain the swarm with our present creaturepower the centaur has organized the effort well your natural form would not be better equipped to wage this war than your present form wait until this is over bink was not satisfied with all the arguments but he seemed to have no choice so he determined to make himself useful as he was maybe he could smell out the wiggles as they came up to their designated quadrant a griffin gave a loud squawk and keeled over it resembled the one they had directed here it must have lost sight of its guiding willothewisp but all griffins looked and smelled pretty much alike to bink not that it mattered objectively all creatures here had a common purpose still he felt a certain identification he ran to it hoping the injury was not critical the creature was bleeding from a mortal wound a wiggle had holed it through its lions heart wiggles traveled by sudden rushes along wigglesized magic tunnels they created then they paused to recuperate or perhaps merely to contemplate philosophical matters no one really knew the rationale of a wiggle therefore the killer wiggle that had gotten the griffin should be right about here bink sniffed and picked up its faint putrid odor he oriented on it and saw his first live wiggle it was a twoinchlong loosely spiraled worm hovering absolutely still in midair it hardly looked like the menace it was he barked pointing his nose at it trent heard him he strode across with his two rocks good job bink he cried he smashed the rocks together on the wiggle as they came apart the squished dead hulk of the tiny monster dropped one down zzapp theres another trent cried they tunnel through anything even air so we hear the collapse of the vacuum behind them this one should be right aboutthere he smashed his stones together again crunching the wiggle after that it was hectic the wiggles were zapping determinedly outward each in its own pattern there was no way of telling how long they would freeze in placeseconds or minutes or how far they would zapinches or feet but each wiggle went in the precise direction it had started never shifting even a fraction so it was possible to trace that line and locate it fairly quickly if someone stood in front of a wiggle at the wrong time he got zappedand if the hole were through a vital organ he died but it was not feasible to stand behind a wiggle for the closer in toward the source of the swarm one went the more the wiggles were present there were so many wiggles that a creature smashing one could be simultaneously holed by another it was necessary to stand at the outer fringe of expansion and nab the leaders first the wiggles really seemed to be mindless or at least indifferent to external things their preset wiggle courses holed anythinganything at allin the way if a person didnt locate a wiggle fast it was too late for the thing had zapped again yet it could be tricky to find a still wiggle for it looked like a twisted stem from the side and a coiled stem from the end it had to move to attract attention to itselfand then it might be too late to nab it this is like standing in a firing range and catching the bullets as they pass trent muttered that sounded like another mundane allusion evidently mundane wiggles were called bullets the invisible giant operated beside bink on the right as his nose plainly told him trampand a wiggle was crushed out of existence maybe a hundred wiggles at once but so was anything else that got underfoot bink didnt dare point out wiggles for bigfoot it would be his own death warrant for all he knew the giant was stomping randomly it was as good a way as any on the left side a unicorn operated when it located a wiggle it either crushed it between horn and hoof or closed its mouth over it and ground it to shreds with its equine teeth this seemed to bink to be a distasteful and hazardous mode of operation because if it mistimed a wiggle zzapp a hole appeared in the unicorns jaw blood dripped out the creature made a single neigh of anguishthen trotted along the path of the zap it located the wiggle and chomped down again using the other side of its jaw bink admired the unicorns courage but he had to get on with his own job two wiggles had just zapped within range he pointed out the nearest for trent then ran to the other afraid trent would not reach it in time his hounds teeth were made for cutting and tearing not chewing but maybe they would do he bit down on the wiggle it squished unpleasantly its body was firm but not really hard and the juices squirted out the taste was absolutely awful there was some sort of acidyecch but bink chewed carefully several times to be sure of crushing it all he knew that any unsquished fragment would zap away as a tiny wiggle just as dangerous as the original he spat out the remains surely his mouth would never be the same again zzapp zzapp two more wiggles nearby trent heard one and went after it bink sought out the other but even as they both oriented a third zzapp sounded between them the pace was stepping up as the great internal mass of wiggles reached the perimeter there were too many wiggles to keep up with the complete swarm might number a million there was a deafening bellow from above ooaaough herman the centaur galloped by blood trailed from a glancing wigglewound in his flank bigfoots hit he cried get out of the way but the wiggles are breaking out trent said i know were taking heavy losses all around the perimeter its a bigger swarm than i thought more dense in the center we cant hold them anyway well have to form a new containment circle and hope that more help arrives in time save yourselves before the giant falls good advice a huge print appeared in binks territory as bigfoot staggered they got out of there aaoogahh the giant bawled another print appeared this time in toward the center of the circle a wash of air passed as he fell heavyladen with the giantaroma goughoooaaaa the sound arched down from a fiftyfoot elevation toward the center of the wiggle swarm the crash was like that of a petrified pine felled by magic whoomp herman who had taken refuge behind the same jellybarrel tree as trent and bink wiped a squirt of jelly out of his eye and shook his head sadly there goes a big big man little hope now of containing the menace were disorganized and short of personnel and the strength of the enemy is sweeping outward only a hurricane could get them all and the weathers dry then he looked again at trent you seem familiar arent youyes twenty years ago trent raised his hand i regret the necessity he began no wait magician herman said transform me not i will not betray your secret i could have bashed your head in with my foot just now had i intended you ill know you not why i was exiled from my kind trent paused i know not for i do not know you i am herman the hermit punished for the obscenity of practicing magic by summoning willothewisps no centaur is supposed to you mean centaurs can practice magic they couldif they would we centaurs have existed so long in xanth we have become a natural species but magic is considered obscene trent finished voicing binks thought so magic intelligent creatures could do magic their inability was cultural not genetic so you became a hermit in the wilderness correct i share your humiliation of exile but now we have a need more important than privacy use your talent to abolish the wiggle menace i cant transform all the wiggles i must focus on one at a time and there are too many not that we must cauterize them i had hoped my wisps would lead in a salamander a salamander trent exclaimed of course but even so the fire could not spread fast enough to burn out all the wiggles and if it did the fire itself would then be unstoppable a greater menace than the wiggles wed merely exchange one devastation for another not so there are certain restrictions on salamanders and with foresight they can be controlled i was thinking of zzapp a hole appeared in the trunk of the tree jelly oozed out like purple blood bink dashed out to crunch the wiggle who fortunately had passed between them and injured no one yuch that taste theyre inside the trees trent said some are bound to land within things impossible to catch those ones herman trotted over to a nondescript bush he yanked several vines from it salamander weed he explained i have become a fair naturalist in my years of isolation this is the one thing a salamander cant burn it represents a natural barrier to the fire eventually the flames are stopped by proliferating weeds if i make a harness of this i can carry a salamander around in a great circle just beyond the infestation but how to stop the fire before it destroys most of xanth trent asked we cant wait on the chance of the weeds half of the wilderness could be ravaged before it bums itself out we cant possibly clear a firebreak in time he paused you know that must be why your wisps summoned no salamanders this thick forest would naturally have a salamanderrepulsion spell to keep them away because such a fire would quickly prejudice this whole environment still if we start a fire herman held up one strong hand in a halt gesture he was an old centaur but still strong the arm was magnificently muscled you know how salamander fire burns only in the direction it starts if we form a circle of inwardburning magic fire suddenly i comprehend trent exclaimed it will burn itself out at the center he looked around bink what else bink did not relish being a salamander but anything was better than yielding xanth to the wiggles no person or creature would be safe if the swarms got out of control again he came up suddenly he was a small bright amphibian about five inches from nose to tail once more he remembered the omen he had seen back at the outset of this adventure the chameleon lizard had also become a salamander before being swallowed up by the moth hawk had his time finally come the ground he stood on burst into flame the underlying sand would not burn but all the material on top of it was fuel climb in here herman said holding a pouch he had cleverly formed of vines i will carry you in a great left circle be sure you direct your fire inward to the left and to make quite sure bink understood he pointed with his left hand well such a limit wouldnt be much fun but bink climbed into the net the centaur picked it up and dangled it at arms length as well he might for bink was hot only the frustrating salamanderweed vines prevented him from really tearing loose herman galloped clear out clear out he cried with amazing volume to the straggling wounded creatures still trying to stop the wiggles were burning them out salamander and to bink to the left to the left bink had hoped hed forgotten about that restriction ah well half a burn was better than none from him a sheet of flame erupted everything it touched burst up anew burning savagely branches leaves whole green trees even the carcasses of fallen monstersthe flame consumed all that was the nature of salamander fireit burned magically heedless of other conditions no rainstorm could put it out for water itself would burn everything except rock and earthand salamander weed curse the stuff now a hasty exodus developed dragons griffins harpies goblins and men scrambled out of the path of the terrible fire every movable form cleared outexcept the wiggles which proceeded as mindlessly as ever the flames spread hungrily up the great trees consuming them with awesome rapidity a tangle tree writhed in agony as it was incinerated and the smell of burning beer and jelly spread already a swath of scorched earth was developing sand and ashes marking the path they had traveled glorious zzapp bink dropped to the ground a wiggle striking with the luck of the mindless had holed hermans right hand good now bink could get out of the net and really go to work setting the most magnificent blaze in all salamander history but the centaur looped about and grabbed the net with his left hand the flames touched his fingers momentarily and the tips shivered into ash but he hung on with the stubs damn the courage of the hermit on herman cried resuming forward speed to the left bink had to obey angrily he shot forth an especially intense flame hoping the hermit would drop him again but it didnt work the centaur galloped on widening the circle a bit since the wiggle radius had evidently expanded further it was useless to burn where the wiggles had been or where they would be the flame had to be where they were now any that zapped past the sheet of flame and paused in an already burned spot would survive that made it a tricky calculation but it was their only chance the circle was almost complete the centaur could really move they raced up to the broadening swath of their starting point pausing to let a few trapped monsters get out before being doomed the last to go was the great land serpent a hundred feet of slithering torso trent was there organizing the remaining animals into a cleanup detail to intercept any few wiggles already outside the circle of fire now that the great majority of wiggles were being eliminated it was feasible to go after those few individually every last one had to be squished the fire closed in on the original wiggle hive there was a deafening groan aaoogaah something stirred invisibly bigfoot trent exclaimed hes still alive in there i thought he was dead herman said horrified weve already closed the circle we cant let him out he was riddled through the legs so he fellbut he wasnt dead trent said the fall must have knocked him out for a while he stared into the leaping flames now outlining the form of a gargantuan man lying prone stirring at the peripheries the odor was of roasting garbage too late now the doomed giant thrashed about flaming branches flew wide some landed in the jungle beyond the circle catch those flames the centaur cried they can start a forest fire but no one could quench or move or even contain the flames no one except herman himself with his weed net he dumped bink out and galloped toward the nearest which was dangerously close to an oilbarrel tree trent gestured hastily and bink was his human self again he leaped out of the smoldering ground where his salamander self had touched what power the evil magician had he could destroy xanth any time just by making a dozen salamanders bink blinkedand saw chameleon chasing a wiggle between the prongs of magic fire formed by thrown brands she was too intent or too stupid to realize the danger he ran after her chameleon turn back she paid no heed faithful to her chore he caught up and spun her about the fires getting the wiggles we have to get out of here oh she said faintly her oncefancy dress was ragged and dirt smudged her face but she was excruciatingly lovely come on he took her by the hand and drew her along but a determined tongue of fire had crossed behind them they were trapped in a closing island the omen now at last it struckat both chameleon and him herman leaped over the tongue a splendid figure of a centaur up on my back he cried bink wrapped his arms about chameleon and heaved her up onto the hermits back she was wondrously supple slender of waist and expansive of thigh not that he had any business noticing such things at the moment but his position behind her as she slid on her belly onto the centaur made the thoughts inevitable he gave her graceful posterior one last ungraceful shove getting her balanced then scrambled up himself herman started walking then running ready to hurdle the fire with his double burden zzapp a wiggle close by the centaur staggered im hit he cried then he righted himself made a convulsion of effort and leaped he fell short his front legs buckled and the rear ones were in the flame bink and chameleon were thrown forward landing on either side of the human torso herman grabbed each by an arm and with a surge of centaur strength shoved both on beyond the danger zone trent charged up hermit youre burning he cried i will transform you no herman said i am holed through the liver i am done for let the clean fire take me he grimaced only to abate the agony quicklyyour sword sir and he pointed at his neck bink would have temporized pretending misunderstanding trying to delay the inevitable the evil magician was more decisive as you require trent said suddenly his blade was in his hand flashing in an arc and the centaurs noble head flew off the body to land upright on the ground just beyond the flame bink stared aghast he had never before witnessed such a coldblooded killing i thank you the head said you abated the agony most efficiently your secret dies with me the centaurs eyes closed herman the hermit had really wanted it that way trent had judged correctly and acted instantly bink himself would have bungled it there was a creature i would have been proud to have taken for a friend trent said sadly i would have saved him had it been within my power little lights danced in close centering on that dead head at first bink supposed they were sparks but they did not actually burn the willothewisps trent murmured paying their last respects the lights dispersed taking with them their vague impression of wonders barely glimpsed and joys never quite experienced the fire consumed the body then the head and swept on into an alreadyburned area most of the remaining flame was now in the center of the circle where the invisible giant no longer thrashed trent raised his voice all creatures silent in respect for herman the hermit wronged by his own kind who has died in defense of xanth and for bigfoot and all the other noble creatures who perished similarly a hush fell on the throng the silence became utter not even an insect hummed one minute two minutes three no sound it was a fantastic assemblage of monsters pausing with bowed heads in deference to the ones who had labored so valiantly against the common enemy bink was profoundly moved never again would he think of the creatures of the magic wild as mere animals at last trent lifted his eyes again xanth is saved thanks to hermanand to you all he announced the wiggles are exterminated disperse with our gratitude and go with pride there is no more important service you could have performed and i salute you but some wiggles may have escaped bink protested in a whisper no none escaped the job was well done how can you be so sure i heard no zaps during the silence no wiggle sits still longer than three minutes binks mouth dropped open the silence of respect and mourning sincere as it had been had also been the verification that the menace had indeed been abated bink would never have thought of that himself how competently trent had assumed the difficult and demanding chore of leadership when the centaur died and without betraying his secret the assorted monsters dispersed peaceably operating under the tacit truce of this effort many were wounded but they bore their pain with the same dignity and courage herman had and did not snap at one another the great land serpent slithered by and bink counted half a dozen holes along its length but it did not pause the serpent like the others had come to do what had to be donebut it would be as dangerous as ever in future encounters shall we resume our journey trent inquired glancing for the last time across the flat bare disk of ashes wed better bink said i think the fire is dying out now abruptly he was the sphinx again half as tall as the invisible giant and far more massive apparently trent had decided multiple transformations were safe trent and chameleon boarded and he retraced the path to their cache of supplies and no more comfort breaks bink muttered in a boom someone chuckled chapter duel they crested a forest ridgeand abruptly the wilderness ended the blue fields of a bluejean plantation spread out before them civilization trent and chameleon dismounted bink had trudged all night tirelessly sleeping while his great legs worked by themselves nothing had bothered the party even the fiercest things of the wilderness had some caution now it was midmorning a fine clear day he felt good suddenly he was a man againand he still felt good i guess this is where we part company at last he said im sorry we could not agree on more things trent said putting out his hand but i think separation will abate those differences it has been a pleasure to know you both bink took the hand and shook it feeling oddly sad i suppose by definition and talent you are the evil magicianbut you helped save xanth from the wiggles and in person you have been a friend i can not approve your designs but he shrugged farewell magician same here chameleon said flashing trent a breathtaking smile that more than made up for the inelegance of her speech well isnt this cozy a voice said all three whirled defensivelybut there was nothing to see nothing but the ripening jeans on their green vines and the forbidding fringe of the jungle then a swirl of smoke formed thickening rapidly a genie chameleon said but now bink recognized the forming shape no such luck he said thats the sorceress iris mistress of illusion thank you for the elegant introduction bink the nowsolidseeming woman said she stood among the jeans ravishing in a lowcut gownbut bink felt no temptation now chameleon at the full flush of her beauty had a natural if magical allure that the sorceress could not duplicate by her artifice so this is iris trent said i knew of her before i left xanth since she is of my generation but we never actually met she is certainly skilled at her talent it happened i had no hankering for transformation iris said giving him an arch glance you left quite a trail of toads and trees and bugs and things i thought you had been exiled times change iris didnt you observe us in the wilderness as a matter of fact i didnt that jungle is a dreary place with quite a number of counterillusion spells and i had no idea you were back in xanth i dont believe anyone knows not even humfrey it was the huge sphinx that attracted my attention but i could not be sure you were involved until i saw you transform it into bink i knew he had been exiled recently so something was definitely amiss how did you pass the shield times change trent repeated enigmatically yes they do she said nettled at being put off she looked at each of them in turn bink had not realized she could project her illusions so effectively so far afield or perceive things from such distances the ramifications of the powers of magicians and sorceresses were amazing now shall we get down to business business bink asked blankly dont be naive trent muttered the bitch means blackmail so it was strong magic opposing strong magic maybe they would cancel each other out and xanth would be safe after all bink had not anticipated this iris looked at him are you sure you wont reconsider my prior offer bink she inquired i could arrange things so that your exile would be revoked you could still be king the time is ripe and if you really prefer the innocent look in women suddenly another chameleon stood before him as beautiful as the real one anything you desire binkand with a mind too that last little dig at the girls stupid phase annoyed him go jump in the gap bink said the figure changed back to irisbeautiful it faced chameleon i dont know you my dear but it would be a shame to see you fed to a dragon a dragon chameleon cried frightened that is the customary penalty for violating exile when i notify the authorities and they put their magicspotters on you three and verify your status leave her alone bink said sharply iris ignored him now if you could only persuade your friend to cooperate she continued to chameleon you could escape that horrible fatethose dragons really like to chew on pretty limbsand be beautiful all the time iris had claimed not to know chameleon but she had evidently figured things out i can make you seem as lovely in your off phase as you are right now you can chameleon asked excited the deceptions of the sorceress are apt trent murmured to bink obviously with double meaning the truth is not in her bink murmured back only illusion a woman is as a woman seems iris told chameleon if she looks lovely to the eye and feels lovely to the touch she is lovely that is all men care about dont listen to her bink said the sorceress just wants to use you correction iris said i want to use you bink i bear no malice to your girlfriendso long as you cooperate with me i am not a jealous woman all i want is power no bink cried chameleon following his lead uncertainly echoed no now you magician trent iris said i have not been watching you long but you seem to be a man of your word at least when it suits your convenience i could make you a formidable queen or i can have the palace guards on the way to kill you in five minutes i would transform the guards trent said from longbow range perhaps she said raising a fair eyebrow skeptically but i doubt you could be king after such an incident the whole land of xanth would be out to kill you you might transform a great numberbut when would you sleep telling blow the evil magician had been caught before when he slept if he were exposed before he could surround himself with loyal troops he would not be able to survive but why should that bother bink if the sorceress betrayed the evil magician xanth would be secure through no action of binks his own hands would be clean he would have betrayed neither his country nor his companion he should simply stay out of it well i might transform animals or people into my own likeness trent said it would then be very hard for the patriots to know whom to kill wouldnt work iris said no imitation will fool a magicspotter once it fixes on its subject trent considered yes it would be very difficult for me to prevail in such circumstance considering this i believe i should accept your offer sorceress there are some details to work out of course you cant bink cried shocked trent gazed at him affecting mild perplexity it seems reasonable to me bink i desire to be king iris desires to be queen there is power enough to share that way perhaps we could define spheres of influence it would be a marriage of pure convenience but i have no present interest in any other kind of liaison well now iris said smiling victoriously well nothing bink cried conscious that his prior decision to stay clear of this matter was being abrogated youre both traitors to xanth i wont permit it you wont permit it iris laughed indelicately who the hell do you think you are you spellless twerp obviously her true attitude toward him had come out now that she had found another avenue for her ambition do not treat him lightly trent told her bink is a magician in his fashion bink felt a sudden wellnigh overwhelming flood of gratitude for this word of support he fought it off knowing he could not afford to permit flattery or insult to sway him from what he knew was right the evil magician could spin a web of illusion with mere words that rivaled anything the sorceress could do with magic im no magician im just loyal to xanth to the proper king to the senile hasbeen who exiled you iris demanded he cant even raise a dust devil any more hes sick now hell soon be dead anyway thats why the time to act is now the throne must go to a magician to a good magician bink retorted not to an evil transformer or a powerhungry sluttish mistress he paused tempted to end it there but knew that wouldnt be entirely honest of illusion you dare address me thus iris screamed sounding much like a harpy she was so angry that her image wavered into smoke trent change him into a stinkbug and step on him trent shook his head suppressing a smile he obviously had no emotional attachment to the sorceress and shared a masculine appreciation for the insulting pause bink had made iris had just now shown them all how ready she was to sell her illusionenhanced body for power we operate under truce truce nonsense her smoke now became a column of fire signifying her righteous wrath you dont need him any more get rid of him again bink saw how she would have treated him after he had helped her achieve power and she no longer needed him trent was adamant if i were to break my word to him iris how could you trust my word to you that sobered herand impressed bink there was a subtle but highly significant difference between these two magicworkers trent was a man in the finest sense of the word iris was hardly pleased i thought your truce was only until you got out of the wilderness the wilderness is not defined solely by the jungle trent muttered what she demanded that truce would be worthless if i abridged its spirit thus suddenly trent said bink and chameleon and i will part company and with luck we shall not meet again the man was being more than fair and bink knew he should accept the situation and departnow instead his stubbornness drove him toward disaster no he said i cant just go away while you two plot to conquer xanth now bink trent said reasonably i never deceived you about my ultimate objective we always knew our purposes were divergent our truce covered only our interpersonal relation during the period of mutual hazard not our longrange plans i have pledges to fulfill to my mundane army to castle roogna and now to the sorceress iris i am sorry you disapprove for i want your approval very much but the conquest of xanth is and always was my mission now i ask you to part from me with what grace you can muster for i have high respect for your motive even though i feel the larger situation places you in error again bink felt the devastating allure of trents golden tongue he could find no flaw in the reasoning he had no chance to overcome the magician magically and was probably outclassed intellectually but morallyhe had to be right your respect means nothing if you have no respect for the traditions and laws of xanth a most telling response bink i do have respect for these thingsyet the system seems to have gone astray and must be corrected lest disaster overtake us all you talk of disaster from mundania i fear the disaster of the perversion of our culture i must oppose you in whatever way i can trent seemed perplexed i dont believe you can oppose me bink whatever your strong magic is it has never manifested tangibly the moment you acted against me i should have to transform you i dont want to do that you have to get within six feet bink said i could strike you down with a thrown rock see iris said hes within range now trent zap him yet the magician desisted you actually wish to fight me bink directly physically i dont wish to i have to trent sighed then the only honorable thing to do is to terminate our truce with a formal duel i suggest we define the locale of combat and the terms do you wish a second a second a minute an hourwhatever it takes bink said he tried to quell the shaking he felt in his legs he was afraid and knew he was being a fool yet he could not back down i meant another person to back you up to see that the terms are honored chameleon perhaps im with bink chameleon said immediately she could comprehend only a fraction of the situation but there was no question of her loyalty well perhaps the concept of seconds is foreign here trent said suppose we establish an area along the wilderness border a mile deep into the forest and a mile across one square mile approximately or as far as a man might walk in fifteen minutes and it shall be until dark today neither of us shall leave this area until that time and if the issue is undecided by then we shall declare the contest null and separate in peace fair enough the evil magician seemed so reasonableand that made bink unreasonable to the death he saidand immediately wished he hadnt he knew the magician would not kill him unless he were forced to he would transform bink into a tree or other harmless form of life and let him be first there had been justin tree now there would be bink tree perhaps people would come to rest under his shade to have picnic lunches to make love except that now it had to be death he had a vision of a fallen tree to the death trent said sadly or surrender thus he nearly abated binks exaggeration without hurting his pride he made it seem as if the magician arranged the loophole for himself not for bink how was it possible for a man so wrong to seem so right all right bink said you go south ill go north into the forest in five minutes well stop and turn and start fair enough the magician agreed he held out his hand again and bink shook it you should get out of the duel zone bink told chameleon no im with you she insisted she might be stupid but she was loyal bink could no more blame her for that than he could blame trent for pursuing power yet he had to dissuade her it wouldnt be fair he said realizing that it would be futile to try to scare her by thought of the consequences two against one you have to go she was adamant im too dumb to go by myself ouch how true let her go with you trent said it really will make no difference and that seemed logical bink and chameleon set out angling into the jungle to the northwest trent angled southwest in moments the magician was out of sight well have to figure out a plan of attack bink said trent has been a perfect gentleman but the truce is over and he will use his power against us we have to get him before he gets us yes well have to collect stones and sticks and maybe dig a pit for a deadfall yes we have to prevent him from getting close enough to use his power of transformation yes dont just say yes he snapped this is serious business our lives are at stake im sorry i know im awful dumb right now bink was immediately sorry of course she was stupid nowthat was her curse and he might be exaggerating the case trent might simply avoid the issue by departing making no fight at all thus bink would have made his stand and have a moral victoryand have changed nothing if so bink was the dumb one he turned to chameleon to apologize and rediscovered the fact that she was radiantly beautiful she had seemed lovely before in comparison with fanchon and dee but now she was as he had first met her as wynne had it really been only a month ago now she was no stranger though youre great just the way you are chameleon but i cant help you plan i cant do anything you dont like stupid people i like beautiful girls he said and i like smart girls but i dont trust the combination id settle for an ordinary girl except shed get dull after a while sometimes i want to talk with someone intelligent and sometimes i want to he broke off her mind was like that of a child it really wasnt right to impose such concepts on her what she asked turning her eyes upon him they had been black in her last beauty phase now they were dark green they could have been any color and she would still be lovely bink knew his chances of surviving the day were less than even and his chances of saving xanth worse than that he was afraidbut he also had a heightened awareness of life right now and of loyalty and of beauty why hide what was suddenly in his conscious mind however long it had developed subconsciously to make love he concluded that i can do she said her eyes brightening with comprehension how well she understood or on what level bink hesitated to ponder then he was kissing her it was wonderful but bink she said when she had a chance i wont stay beautiful thats the point he said i like variety i would have trouble living with a stupid girl all the timebut you arent stupid all the time ugliness is no good for all the timebut you arent ugly all the time either you arevariety and that is what i crave for the longterm relationship and what no other girl can provide i need a spell she said no you dont need any spell chameleon youre fine just the way you are i love you oh bink she said after that they forgot about the duel reality intruded all too soon there you are iris exclaimed appearing over their makeshift bower tuttut what have you two been doing chameleon hastily adjusted her dress something you wouldnt understand she said with purely female insight no it hardly matters sex is unimportant the sorceress put her hands to her mouth in a megaphone gesture trent theyre over here bink dived for herand passed through her image cleanly he took a tumble on the forest floor silly boy iris said you cant touch me now they heard the evil magician coming through the forest bink looked frantically for some weapon but saw only the great boles of the trees sharp stones might have been used against these treestherefore all stones had been magically eliminated some other area might have potential weapons but not this highly competitive wilderness this fringe near the farms that were always in need of more cleared land i have ruined you chameleon cried i knew i shouldnt have shouldnt have made love true enough in one sense they had wasted vital time loving instead of warring yet there might never be another chance it was worth it bink said well have to run they started to run but the image of the sorceress appeared in front of them here trent she cried again cut them off before they get away bink realized that they could get nowhere so long as iris dogged them there was no place they could hide no surprise they could prepare no strategic placement possible inevitably trent would run them down then his eye fell on an object chameleon still carried it was the hypnotic gourd if he could get trent to look into that unwittingly now the magician came into sight bink gently took the gourd from chameleon see if you can distract him until i get close enough to shove this in his face he said he held the gourd behind his back iris probably did not realize its significance and she would be able to do nothing once trent was out of commission iris the magician called loudly this is supposed to be a fair duel if you interfere again i shall consider our understanding terminated the sorceress started to react with anger then thought better of it she vanished trent stopped a dozen paces from bink i regret this complication shall we start over he inquired gravely wed better bink agreed the man was so damned sure of himself he could give away any advantage maybe he wanted to wrap it up with a completely clear conscience such as it was but by so doing trent had unknowingly saved himself from possible disaster bink doubted he would have another opportunity to use the gourd they separated again bink and chameleon fled deeper into the forestand almost into the quivering arms of a tangle tree if only we could trick him into running into that bink saidbut found he didnt mean it he had somehow gotten himself into a duel he really did not want to winand could not afford to lose he was as dumb as chameleon only somewhat more complicated about it they spotted a nooseloop bush the loops were up to eighteen inches in diameter but would contract suddenly to a quarter of that when any careless animal put its head or limb through their fibers were so tight that only a knife or specific counterspell could alleviate the bind even when separated from the bush the loops retained their potency for several days gradually hardening in place careless or unlucky animals could lose feet or lives and no creature ever bothered a nooseloop plant twice chameleon shied away but bink paused it is possible to harvest and carry such loops he said at the north village we use them to seal packages tight the trick is to touch them only on the outside we can take some of these and lay them on the ground where trent has to step or we can throw them at him i doubt he can transform them once theyre detached from the living plant can you throw pretty well yes he walked toward the bushand spied another wilderness threat looka nest of ant lions he exclaimed if we can put them on his scent chameleon looked at the footlong lionheaded ants and shuddered do we have to i wish we didnt bink said they wouldnt actually eat him hed transform them first but they might keep him so busy that we could overpower him if we dont stop him somehow hes very likely to conquer xanth would that be bad it was just one of her stupid questions in her smart phase or even her normal phase she would never have asked it but it bothered him would the evil magician really be worse than the present king he put the question aside it is not for us to decide the council of elders will choose the next king if the crown starts being available by conquest or conspiracy well be back in the days of the waves and no one will be secure the law of xanth must determine the possession of the crown yes she agreed bink had surprised himself with an excellent statement of the situation but of course it was beyond her present understanding still the notion of throwing trent to the ant lions bothered him so he went on searching in the depths of his mind a parallel search was manifesting concerning the morality of the present government of xanth suppose trent were right about the necessity of reopening xanth to migration from outside according to the centaurs the human population had slowly declined during the past century where had those people gone were new parthuman monsters being formed even now by magically enabled interbreeding the very thought was like being entangled in a nooseloop bush its ramifications were appalling yet it seemed to be so trent as king would change that situation was the evil of the waves worse than the alternative bink was unable to form a conclusion they came to a large river bink had forded this in his sphinx stage hardly noticing it but now it was a deadly barrier little ripples betrayed the presence of lurking predators and eerie mists played about the surface bink flipped a clod of mud into the water and it was intercepted just before it struck by a giant crablike claw the rest of the monster never showed bink was unable to determine whether it was a mercrab or a super crayfish or merely a disembodied claw but he was sure he did not want to swim here there were a few round stones at the edge the river did not have the same reason to be wary of stones that the trees did but it was best to be careful bink poked at them gingerly with his staff to be sure they werent magic lures fortunately they werent he poked experimentally at a pleasant nearby water lily and the flower snapped three inches off the tip of his pole his caution was justified all right he said when they had a fair reserve of stones well try to ambush him well arrange nooseloops across his likely path of retreat and cover them over with leaves and you can throw your loops at him and ill throw stones hell duck the stones and loops but hell have to watch us both to do it while retreating so he may step into a hidden loop itll bind on his foot and hell be vulnerable while he tries to get it off and maybe we can score well get some material from a blanket tree to throw over his head so he cant see us and cant transform us or we can hold the hypnogourd in front of his face hell have to yield then yes she said they set it up their covered loops extended from a hungry tangle tree to the antlion nest and their ambush was in an invisible bush they discovered by sheer accident that was about the only way such a bush could be discovered such plants were harmless but could be a nuisance when stumbled into when they hid behind it they became invisible too so long as they kept the bush between them and the viewer they settled down to wait but trent surprised them while they had been setting up the trap he had been circling around orienting on their sounds now he came at them from the north chameleon like most girls had to answer calls of nature frequently particularly when she was excited she went behind a harmless mocktentacle banyan tree gave one little gasp of alarm and disappeared as bink turned he saw a lovely young winged deer bound out the battle was upon him bink charged the tree stone in one hand pole in the other he hoped to knock out the magician before trent could throw his spell but trent wasnt there had he jumped to a conclusion chameleon could have scared out a hiding doe now the evil magician cried from above he was up in the tree as bink looked up trent gestured not making a magical gesture but bringing his hand down within six feet so as to cast the spell effectively bink jumped backtoo late he felt the tingle of transformation he rolled on the ground in a moment he got his hands and feet under himand discovered he was still a man the spell had failed he must have made it out of range in time after all so that only one arm was in range not his head he looked back at the tree and gasped the evil magician was tangled in the prickles of a candystripe rose bush what happened bink asked forgetting his own peril for the moment a branch of the tree got in the way trent said shaking his head as if dazed he must have had a hard fall the spell transformed it instead of you bink would have laughed at this freak accident but now he remembered his own position so the magician had tried to turn him into a rose bush he hefted his rock sorry he apologizedand hurled it at the handsome head but it bounced off the tough shell of a purple tortoise trent had converted the rose to the armored animal and was hidden behind it bink acted without thinking he aimed the pole like a lance ran halfway around the tortoise and thrust it at the magician but the man dodged and again bink felt the tingle of enchantment his momentum carried him beyond his enemy he was still a man he retreated to the invisible bush marveling at his escape the spell had bounced convening the tortoise to a werehornet the insect buzzed up angrily but decided on escape rather than attack now trent was hot on binks trail the bush became a womanheaded serpent that slithered away with an exclamation of annoyance and bink was exposed again he tried to runbut was caught a third time by the magic beside him a yellow toad appeared what is this trent demanded incredulously i struck a passing gnat instead of you three times my spell has missed you my aim cant be that bad bink scrambled for his staff trent oriented on him again and bink knew he could neither get out of range nor bring his weapon to bear in time he was finished despite all his strategy but the winged deer charged from the side threatening to bowl over the magician trent heard her coming and spun to focus on her as she reached him she became a lovely iridescent butterfly then a very pretty wyvern no problem there trent remarked shes goodlooking in whatever form i put her but my spells are registering perfectly the small winged dragon turned on him hissing and suddenly she was the winged doe again scat trent told her clapping his hands startled the deer bounded away she was not overly bright meanwhile bink had taken advantage of the distraction to retreat but he had gone toward his own carefully fashioned trap and now he did not know precisely where the noose loops lay hidden if he tried to cross that line he would either trap himself or give away its presence to trent assuming the magician was not already aware of it trent strode toward him bink was cornered victim of his own machinations he stood unmoving knowing the magician would turn on him the moment he tried to act he cursed himself for not being more decisive but he simply did not know what to he obviously was no duelist he had been outmaneuvered and outmagicked from the outset of this contest he should have left the evil magician alone yet he still could not see how he could have stood by and yielded xanth up without even token protest this was that token this time no error trent said stepping boldly toward bink i know i can transform you for i have done it many times before without difficulty i must have been overhasty today he stopped within range while bink stood still not deigning to run again trent concentratedand the magic smote bink once more powerfully a flock of funnelbirds manifested around bink hooting derisively they jetted away on their fixed wings the very microbes surrounding you trent exclaimed my spell bounced right off youagain now i know there is something strange maybe you just dont want to kill me bink said i was not trying to kill youonly to transform you into something harmless so that never again could you oppose me i never kill without reason the magician pondered something very strange here i dont believe my talent is misfiring something is opposing it there has to be some counterspell operating you have led a rather charmed life you know i had thought it was mere coincidence but now trent considered then snapped his fingers ringingly your talent your magic talent thats it you cannot be harmed by magic but ive been hurt many times bink protested not by magic ill warrent your talent repels all magical threats but many spells have affected me you transformed me only to help you or to warn you you may not have trusted my motives but your magic knew the truth i never intended to harm you before and so my spells were permitted now that we are dueling and i am trying to change your status for the worse my spells bounce in this respect your magic is more powerful than mineas certain prior signals have indicated indirectly bink was amazed thenthen i have won you cannot hurt me not necessarily so bink my magic has brought yours to bay and forced its unveiling and thereby rendered it vulnerable the evil magician drew his gleaming sword i have other talents than magic defend yourselfphysically bink brought up his staff as trent lunged he barely parried the blade in time he was vulnerablephysically suddenly past confusions unraveled he had never directly been harmed by magic embarrassed humiliated yes especially in childhood but it was evidently physical harm he was protected against when he had ran a race with another boy and the boy had charged through trees and barriers to win bink had not suffered any physical damage merely chagrin and when he had chopped off his own finger nonmagically nothing had aided him there magic had healed that but magic could not have made the injury similarly he had been threatened by magic many times and been terrifiedbut somehow had never had those threats materialize even when he had taken a lungful of potiphers poison gas he had been saved just in time he had indeed led a charmed lifeliterally fascinating aspects to your magic trent said conversationally as he maneuvered for another opening obviously it would be scant protection if its nature were widely known so it arranges to conceal itself from discovery by acting in subtle ways your escapes so often seemed fortuitous or coincidental yes as when he escaped the gap dragon he had also been benefited by countermagic coincidentallyas when he had been taken over by donald the shade enabling him to fly up out of the gap safely your pride was never salvaged merely your body trent continued obviously taking his time about the fight while he worked out all the details just in case he was a meticulous man maybe you suffered some discomfort as in our entry into xanth whose purpose was to conceal the fact that nothing serious had happened to you rather than reveal itself your talent allowed you to be exiledbecause that was a legal or social matter not really magical yet you were not hurt by the shield he had felt the tingle of the shield as he dived through on his way out and thought he had gotten safely through the opening now he knew he had taken the full force of the shieldand survived he could have walked through it at any time but had he known that he might have done itand given away his talent so it had been concealedfrom himself yet now it had been revealed and there was a flaw you were not hurt by the shield either bink cried striking hard with his staff i was in direct contact with you when we entered trent said so was chameleon you were unconscious but your talent still operated to allow the two of us to die while you survived unscathedthat would have given it away or possibly a small field surrounds you enabling you to protect those you touch or your talent looked ahead and knew that if the magic of the shield eliminated us at that time you would be cast into the den of the kraken weed alone and be unable to escape and die there you needed me and my power of transformation to survive the magical threatsso i was spared and chameleon because you would not have worked with me if she had not done so so we all survived in order to promote your survival and we never suspected the true cause similarly your magic protected us all during our trek through the wilderness i thought i needed you to protect me but it was the other way around my talent became a mere aspect of yours when you were threatened by the wiggles and the invisible giant you drew on my transformation of you to abate that threat still without revealing trent shook his head still parrying binks clumsy attacks easily suddenly it becomes less amazingand your talent more impressive you are a magician with not merely the overt complex of talents but the ramifying aspects too magicians are not merely more powerfully talented people our enchantments differ in quality as well as quantity in ways seldom appreciated by normal citizens you are on a par with humfrey and iris and myself id really like to know your powers full nature and extent so would i bink gasped his efforts were winding him without effect on the magician this was true frustration but alas it seems i cannot become king while a talent like that opposes me i sincerely regret the necessity of sacrificing your life and want you to know this was not my intent at the outset of this encounter i would have much preferred to transform you harmlessly but the sword is less versatile than magic it can only injure or kill bink remembered herman the centaur his head flying from his body when trent decided that killing was necessary trent made a deft maneuver bink flung himself aside the point of the sword touched his hand blood flowed with a cry of pain bink dropped his staff he could be hurt by mundane means obviously trent had aimed for that hand testing making absolutely sure this realization broke the partial paralysis that had limited the imagination of his defense he was vulnerablebut on a straight mantoman basis he did have a chance the awesome power of the evil magician had daunted him but now in effect trent was merely a man he could be surprised as trent set up for the finishing thrust bink moved with inspired competency he ducked under the mans arm caught it with his bloody hand turned bent his knees and heaved it was the throw that the soldier crombie had taught him useful for handling an attacker with a weapon but the magician was alert as bink heaved trent stepped around keeping on his feet he wrenched his sword arm free threw bink back and oriented for the killing thrust very nice maneuver bink unfortunately they also know such tactics in mundania trent thrust with instant decision and with killing force bink off balance unable to move out of the way saw the terrible point driving straight at his face he was done for this time the winged doe shot between them the sword plunged into her torso the point emerging from the other side just shy of binks quivering nose bitch trent yelled though that was not the proper term for a female deer winged or landbound he yanked free the bloody blade that strike was not meant for you the doe fell red blood spurting from her wound she had been punctured through the belly ill transform you into a jellyfish the evil magician continued in fury youll smother to death on land shes dying anyway bink said feeling a sympathetic agony in his own gut such wounds were not immediately fatal but they were terribly painful and the result was the same in the long run it was death by torture for chameleon the omen it had finally been completed the chameleon had died suddenly or would die bink launched himself at his enemy again experiencing a vengeful rage he had never felt before with his bare hands he would trent stepped nimbly aside cuffing bink on the side of the neck with his left hand as he passed bink stumbled and fell half conscious blind rage was no substitute for cool skill and experience he saw trent step up to him raising the sword high in both hands for the final bodysevering blow bink shut his eyes no longer able to resist he had done everything he could and lost only kill her too cleanly he begged do not let her suffer he waited with resignation but the blow did not fall bink opened his eyes and saw trent putting his terrible sword away i cant do it the magician said soberly the sorceress iris appeared what is this she demanded have your guts turned to water dispatch them both and be done with it your kingdom awaits i dont want my kingdom this way trent told her once i would have done it but i have changed in twenty years and in the past two weeks i have learned the true history of xanth and i know too well the sorrow of untimely death my honor came late to my life but it grows stronger it will not let me kill a man who has saved my life and who is so loyal to his unworthy monarch that he sacrifices his life in defense of the one who has exiled him he looked at the dying doe and i would never voluntarily kill the girl who lacking the intelligence to be cunning yields up her own welfare for the life of that man this is true love of the kind i once knew i could not save mine but i would not destroy that of another the throne simply is not worth this moral price idiot iris screamed it is your own life you are throwing away yes i suppose i am trent said but this was the risk i took at the outset when i determined to return to xanth and this is the way it must be better to die with honor than to live in dishonor though a throne be served up as temptation perhaps it was not power i sought but perfection of self he kneeled beside the doe and touched her and she was the human chameleon again blood leaked from the terrible wound in her abdomen i cannot save her he said sadly any more than i could cure my wife and child i am no doctor any creature into which i might transform her would suffer similarly she must have helpmagic help the magician looked up iris you can help project your image to the castle of the good magician humfrey tell him what has happened here and ask him for healing water i believe the authorities of xanth will help this innocent girl and spare this young man whom they wrongly exiled ill do nothing of the sort the sorceress screamed come to your senses man you have the kingdom in your grasp trent turned to bink the sorceress has not suffered the conversion that experience has brought me she will not help the lure of power has blinded her to all elseas it almost blinded me you will have to go for help yes bink agreed he could not look at the blood coming from chameleon i will staunch her wound as well as i can trent said i believe she will live for an hour do not take longer than that no bink agreed if she died suddenly bink was a birda fancyfeathered firewinged phoenix sure to be noticed since it appeared in public only every five hundred years he spread his pinions and took off into the sky he rose high and circled and in the distance to the east he saw the spire of the good magicians castle glinting magically he was on his way chapter king a flying dragon appeared pretty bird im going to eat you up it said bink sheered off but the monster was before him again you cant escape it said it opened its toothy mouth was his mission of mercy to end here so near success bink pumped his wings valiantly climbing higher hoping the heavier dragon could not achieve the same elevation but his wounded wingformerly the hand trents sword had cutrobbed him of full lifting power and balance forcing him to rise with less velocity the predator paralleled him without effort staying between him and the far castle give up dumbo it said youll never make it suddenly bink caught on dragons did not speak like that not flying firebreathers anyway they lacked both the cranial capacity and the coolness of brain to talk at all they were simply too light and hot to be smart this was no dragonit was an illusion spawned by the sorceress she was still trying to stop him hoping that if he disappeared and chameleon died trent would resume his march on the throne trent would have done his best and failed realistically he would continue toward his goal thus iris could still achieve her dream of power through him naturally she would never confess her own part in this mischief bink would rather have dealt with a real dragon the sorceresss evil plot might work because he was a phoenix instead of a talking bird he could not tell anyone other than the good magician what was happening others would not have the capacity to understand if he returned to trent now too much time would be lostand in any event iris could stop him there too this was his own private battle his duel with the sorceress he had to win it himself he changed course abruptly and angled directly into the dragon if he had guessed wrong he would light a fire in the belly of the firebreather and lose all but he passed right through it without resistance victory iris shouted something most unladylike at him what a fishwife she was when balked but bink ignored her and winged on a cloud formed before him uhoha storm he had to hurry but the cloud loomed rapidly larger blisters of black vapor boiled out of it swirling funnels forming below in moments the sheer mass of it blotted out the castle ugly dark satellite clouds scudded about it menacing as the heads of goblins a larger rotary pattern developed the whole thing looked disconcertingly formidable there was no hope of rising above it his injured wing was hurting and the storm towered into the sky like a giant genie bolts of jagged lightning danced about crackling loudly there was the odor of metal burning deep in the roiling bowels of it were tangled colors and vague shapes of demonic visages a magic tempest obviously girt with colored hail the most devastating kind bink dropped lowerand the cloud circulation tightened into a single descending gray tube a supertornado that would destroy him then bink almost fell out of the air with the shock of his realization he could not be harmed by magic this was a magic stormtherefore it could not touch him he was being balked by a false threat furthermore there was no actual wind this was another illusion ail he had to do was fly directly toward the castle unswayed by optical effects he shot straight into the cloud he was right again the optical effects had been spectacular but there was no actual storm merely opacity and the suggestion of wetness on his feathers soon he would be through it having called its bluff then nothing could stop him from reaching the castle of the good magician but the grayness continued how could he go to the castle when he couldnt see it iris couldnt fool him but she could effectively blind him maybe he personally could not be harmed by magic either real or illusory magic but his talent did not seem to be concerned with the welfare of other people no matter how bink himself might feel about them he would survive if chameleon died he might not enjoy that survival but the technicality would have been honored damn it talent he thought fiercely youd better stop being concerned with technicalities and start being concerned with my larger welfare ill kill myself physically by mundane means if i find my life not worth living i need chameleon so you cant save me at all if you let this hostile magic stop me from saving chameleon then where will you be the opacity continued apparently his talent was an unreasoning thing and so in the end it was useless like a colored spot on a wall it was magic without purpose he peered about determined to fight it through himself he had made it this far through life without any talent he had known about he would have to make it similarly in the future somehow had he been headed directly toward the castle he thought sobut he could not be sure he had been distracted by the developing cloud trying to avoid it and could have lost his bearings trent might better have transformed him into an unerring carrier pigeon but that bird would not have been distinct enough to attract the attention of the good magician anyway speculations on what he might have been were useless he was what he was and would have to prevail as he was if he were now aimed wrong he might never reach the castle but he would keep trying he dropped down seeking some landmark but the cloud remained about him he could not see a thing if he went too low he might crash into a tree had iris won after all then he emerged from the cloud floor there was the castle he zoomed toward itand paused dismayed again this wasnt the residence of the good magicianthis was castle roogna he had become completely reversed and flown across the wilderness to the west instead of eastward to the good magician the sorceress had surely known this and kept up the blinding fog so that he would not discover his error until too late how much precious time had he wasted if he reversed course and flew straight to the proper castle nowassuming he could find it in the fogcould he possibly get help for chameleon within the hour or would she be dead by the time help arrived thanks to this delay he heard a faint snort immediately it was echoed by snorts all around him coming from every direction the base of the cloud dropped down to obscure his view again something was funny here he might not have paid any attention to the sound if there had not been such an obvious effort to mask its direction why should the sorceress try to prevent him from landing at castle roogna was there healing water there used to patch up zombies doubtful so the snort was important in some way but what had caused it there was no moat dragon at roogna zombies didnt snort very well anyway yet obviously something had made that soundprobably something all the way alive like a winged horse or he caught on this was not castle roogna but the castle of the good magician after all the sorceress had only made it look like roogna to turn him back she was mistress of illusionand he kept being deceived by the ramifications of her power but the hippocampus of the moat had snorted giving it away he had been headed in the right direction after all perhaps guided by his talent his talent had always operated subtly there was no reason for it to change now bink headed for the remembered sound of the first snort tuning out all others abruptly the fog dissipated apparently the sorceress could not maintain her illusions too near the premises of the rival magician whose specialty was truth ill get you yet her voice cried from the air behind then she and all her effects were gone and the sky was clear bink circled the castle which now had its proper aspect he was shivering with reaction how close he had come to losing his duel with the sorceress if he had turned back he found an open portal in an upper turret and angled through it the phoenix was a powerful flier with good control he probably could have outdistanced a real dragon even with his hurt wing it took a moment for his beady eyes to adjust to the gloom of the interior he flapped from one room to another and finally located the magician poring over a massive tome for an instant the little man reminded bink of trent in the roogna library both had serious interest in books had the two really been friends twenty years ago or merely associates humfrey looked up what are you doing here bink he inquired surprised he didnt seem to notice the form bink was in bink tried to talk but could not the phoenix was silent its magic related to survival from fire not to human discourse come over here by the mirror humfrey said rising bink came as he approached the magic mirror showed a scene evidently this mirror was a twin to the one he had broken for he saw no cracks to indicate repair the picture was of the wilderness chameleon lying nude and lovely and bleeding despite a crude compact of leaves and moss on her abdomen before her stood trent sword drawn as a wolfheaded man approached oh i see humfrey said the evil magician has returned foolish of him this time he wont be exiled hell be executed good thing you managed to warn me hes a dangerous one i see he stabbed the girl and transformed you but you managed to get away good thing you had the sense to come here bink tried to speak again and failed again he danced about anxiously more to say this way the gnomelike magician took down a book and opened it setting it on top of his prior volume on the table the pages were blank speak he said bink tried yet again no sound emerged but he saw the words forming in neat script on the pages of the book chameleon is dying we must save her oh of course humfrey agreed a few drops of healing water will take care of that therell be my fee naturally but first well have to deal with the evil magician which means well have to detour to the north village to pick up a stunner no magic of mine can handle trent no trent is trying to save her hes not humfreys brow wrinkled you are saying that the evil magician helped you he asked surprised that is hard to believe bink as quickly as possible bink explained about trents conversion very well humfrey said with resignation ill take your word that he is acting in your interest in this case but i suspect youre a bit naive and now i dont know whos going to pay my fee the evil magician is very likely to get away anyway while we detour but we have to try to catch him for a fair trial he has broken the law of xanth and must be dealt with immediately it would profit us nothing if we saved chameleon while leaving xanth in peril from the conquering lust of the transformer there was so much more bink wanted to explain but humfrey gave him no chance and of course he probably was being naive once the evil magician had time to reconsider he would probably revert to form he was a serious threat to xanth yet bink knew that trent had won the duel and so bink as loser should no longer interfere in the magicians affairs this was a devious but increasingly strong conviction he hoped trent managed to escape humfrey led him down to the castle cellar where he tapped some fluid from a barrel he sprinkled a drop on binks wing and it was instantly sound again the rest he put in a small bottle which he tucked into his vest pocket now the good magician went to a closet and hauled out a plush carpet he unrolled it then sat crosslegged on it well get on birdbrain he snapped youll get lost out there by yourself especially with iris fooling around with the weather reports bink perplexed stepped onto the carpet and faced the magician then the rug lifted startled bink spread his wings and dug his feet deeply into the material hanging on it was a flying carpet the thing angled neatly out through a portal then looped high up into the sky it leveled then accelerated bink facing backward had to furl his wings tightly and almost puncture the fabric with his claws to keep from being dislodged by the wind he saw the castle shrink in the distance just an artifact i accepted in lieu of service some years back humfrey explained conversationally he sneezed never had much use for it just collects dust but i suppose this is an emergency he peered at bink shaking his head dubiously you claim the evil magician transformed you to help you get to me quickly just nod your beak once for yes twice for no bink nodded once but he did stab chameleon another nod but that was not the whole story he didnt really mean to stab her because he was really trying to kill you and she got in the way bink had to nod yes again what a damning statement humfrey shook his head its easy to be sorry after a mistake has been made yet when i knew him before his exile he was not a man without compassion still i doubt he can ever rest until he achieves his ambitionand while he remains alive and in xanth we can never be certain he wont it is a difficult case there will have to be a meticulous investigation of the facts such an investigation would be the death of trent the old king would be determined to abolish this major threat to his declining power and trent knows what is likely to happen to him when the authorities get there if they catch him trent surely did bink nodded yes again and you do you want him dead bink shook his head vehemently no or exiled again bink had to think a moment then he shook his head again of course you need him to transform you back into human form that perhaps gives him some bargaining leverage they might spare his life in exchange for such services but after that it seems likely to be exile for him or blindness blindness but then bink comprehended the horrible logic of it blind trent could not transform anyone he had to see his subjects but what a terrible fate i see you dont like that notion either yet there are harsh realities to weigh humfrey pondered it will be difficult enough to save your life since you also are an illegal immigrant but perhaps i have a wrinkle he frowned im really sorry to see trent get into this scrape hes a truly great magician and weve always gotten along not interfering in each others business but the welfare of xanth comes first he smiled briefly after my fee of course bink didnt see much humor in it well it will soon be out of our hands fortunately what will be will be after that he was silent bink watched the clouds real ones this time they loomed up larger and darker as the rug flew northward now the carpet was over the gap making bink feel less secure despite his wings it was a long way down when the rug passed through a cloud it dipped alarmingly it seemed there were internal downdrafts but humfrey rode with seeming equanimity eyes closed deep in thought it got worse the carpet possessing no intelligence zoomed straight for its preprogrammed destination not trying to avoid the cloud banks the clouds formed into towering mountains and awesomely deep valleys and the drafts got worse no illusion this building storm though it lacked the colors and menacing swirls of iriss illusioncloud in its somber way it was just as threatening then the rug dropped through the fog and came out below there was the north village the windows of the kings palace were draped in black i think it has happened humfrey remarked as they landed before the palace gate a village elder came out to meet them magician he cried we were about to send for you the king is dead well youd better choose his successor then humfrey said acidly there is no oneexcept you the elder replied lamebrain thats no recommendation humfrey snapped what would i want with the throne its a big boring job that would seriously interfere with my studies the elder stood his ground unless you can show us another qualified magician the law requires that you accept well the law can go humfrey paused we have more pressing business who is caretaker during the interim roland he is seeing to the funeral bink jumped his father but he knew immediately that his father would be scrupulous in avoiding any possible conflict of interest better not even to tell him bink was back in xanth humfrey glanced at bink seeming to have the same notion well i think i know just the sucker for the job the good magician said but he has a certain technical problem to surmount first bink suffered an exceedingly uncomfortable shiver of premonition not me he tried to say but still could not speak im no magician really i know nothing of kingship all i want to do is save chameleon and let trent get away too but first we have to settle a couple of other matters humfrey continued the evil magician trent the transformer is back in xanth and a girl is dying if we move fast we may catch them both before it is too late trent the elder was shocked what a time for him to show up he ran into the palace very soon they had assembled a war party the village travelconjurer was given the precise location and he started popping people through first to go was roland himself with luck he would catch the evil magician by surprise and stun him in place nullifying his magic then the others could proceed safely next the good magician went with his vial of healing water to save chameleonif she still lived bink realized that if this plan was successful trent would never have another chance to transform anyone if they unknowingly executed the evil magician before bink was transformed he would remain forever a phoenix chameleon would be alone although well and his father would be responsible was there no way out of this predicament well the plan might fail trent could transform roland and humfrey then bink himself might recover his human form but chameleon would die that was no good either maybe trent would have escaped before roland arrived then chameleon would be cured and trent would survive but bink would remain a bird no matter which way it worked out someone dear to bink would be sacrificed unless humfrey somehow managed things to make everything come out all right yet how could he one by one the elders disappeared then it was binks turn the conjurer gestured the first thing bink saw was the body of the wolfheaded man the creature had evidently charged and been dispatched by trents singing sword elsewhere were a number of caterpillars that had not been here before trent himself stood frozen concentrating as though in the process of casting a spell and chameleon bink flew to her gladly she was well the terrible wound was gone and she was standing looking bewildered this is bink humfrey told her he flew to fetch help for you just in time too oh bink she cried picking him up and trying to hug him to her bare torso bink as a bird with delicate plumage did not find this as delightful as he might have in his natural form change back i am afraid that only the transformer can change him back humfrey said and the transformer must first stand trial and what would be the result of that trial why hadnt trent escaped when he had the chance the proceedings were swift and efficient the elders put questions to the frozen magician who of course could not answer or argue his own case humfrey had the travelconjurer fetch the magic mirrorno it was munly the master of ceremonies at binks hearing who was himself an elder binks birdbrain was letting him get confused munly used his talent to conjure this small object directly to his hand from the good magicians castle he held it up so that all could see the images forming within it in the mirror were reflected scenes from the trios travels in xanth gradually the story came out though it did not reveal binks talent it showed how the three had helped one another to survive in the wilderness how they had stayed at castle roognathere was a general exclamation about that for no one had known this old famous semimythical artifact remained intact how they had fought the wiggle swarmand that produced another reaction how they had finally dueled how the sorceress iris had mixed in and howbink felt a fury of embarrassmenthe had made love to chameleon the mirror was merciless the whole sequence was clearly damning to trent for there were no words but its not really like that bink tried to cry hes a fine man in many ways his rationale makes sense if he had not spared me and chameleon he could have conquered xanth the picture froze on the final sequence of the duel trent wounding bink making ready to strike the final blowand halting seehe spared me he is not evil not any more he is not evil but no one heard him the assembled elders looked at one another nodding gravely binks father roland was among them and the family friend munly saying nothing then the mirror continued showing what had happened after bink flew away the monsters of the wilderness smelling fresh blood had converged trent barely had time to bandage chameleon before these threats became pressing he had stood before her sword in hand bluffing the creatures backand transforming those who attacked anyway to caterpillars two wolfheads had charged together jaws gaping wide slavering one became a caterpillar while the other was cut down by the sword trent had killed only as necessary he could have run even then bink cried silently he could have let chameleon be taken by the monsters he could have escaped into the magic jungle you would never have caught himuntil he caught you he is a good man now but he knew there was no way he could plead this good mans case chameleon of course was too stupid to do it and humfrey didnt know the whole story at last the mirror showed the arrival of roland as strong and handsome in his fashion as the evil magician and a few years older he had landed facing away from trentand directly in front of an advancing twoheaded serpent each head a yard long roland searching the wilderness before him nervous about a nearby tangle tree had seen neither magician nor serpent behind him in the mirror trent charged running at the tail of the monster grabbing it with his bare hands causing it to whirl on him furiously both heads had struckand the thing had abruptly become another caterpillar a twoheaded caterpillar roland whirled for an instant the two men looked into each others eyes their deadly talents equivalent at this range they seemed very similar to each other then roland squinted and trent froze in place the stun had scored before the transformation or had it trent never even tried to resist bink thought futilely he could have transformed my father instead of the serpent or simply let the serpent strike elders have you seen enough humfrey inquired gently if i could have the throne of xanth at the expense of trents life i would not take it bink thought savagely the trial had been a farce they had never let trent speak for himself to present his eloquent thesis of the damage magic was doing to the human population of xanth or of the threat of a future attack from mundania were they going to dispose of him the same way they had exiled bink thoughtlessly by rote law regardless of the meaning behind the facts the elders exchanged glances gravely each nodded slowly affirmatively at least let him talk bink cried mutely then it would be best to release the spell humfrey said he must be free of magic for the denouement as is our custom thank god roland snapped his fingers trent moved thank you honorable elders of xanth he said politely you have granted me a fair presentation and i stand ready to accept your judgment trent wasnt even defending himself this horrendously partial silent investigation obviously a mere ritual to justify a decision privately arrived athow could the evil magician lend credibility to that we find you guilty of violating exile roland said for this the set penalty is death but we are in a unique situation and you have changed substantially since we knew you you always had courage intelligence and strong magic now you are also possessed of loyalty honor and mercy i am not unmindful that you spared the life of my son who had foolishly challenged you and that you protected his chosen one from the ravages of wild beasts you have some guilt in these matters but you expiated it we therefore waive the set penalty and grant you leave to remain in xanth under two conditions they were not going to kill trent bink almost danced for joy but immediately he realized that there would still be stringent restrictions to prevent trent from ever again aspiring to the throne humfrey had mentioned blinding him so that he would be unable to perform his magic bink had some idea of what a life without magic would be like trent would be forced to assume some menial occupation working out his days in ignobility the elders were generally old but not necessarily gentle no smart citizen ever crossed them twice trent bowed his head i thank you sincerely elders i accept your conditions what are they but there was so much more to be said to treat this fine man as a common criminal to force his agreement to this terrible retribution and trent was not even protesting first roland said that you marry trent looked up startled i can understand a requirement that i reverse all prior transformations and desist from any future exercise of my talentbut what has marriage to do with it you are presuming roland said grimly and bink thought trent hasnt caught on they have no need to make restrictionsif they blind him he will be helpless i apologize elder i will marry what is the other condition now it comes bink wished he could blot out the sounds as if by failing to hear the words of the sentence he could alleviate it but that was not his type of magic talent that you accept the throne of xanth binks beak fell open so did chameleons mouth trent stood as if stunfrozen again then roland bent one knee and slowly dropped to the ground the other elders followed silently the king you see is dead humfrey explained it is essential to have a good man and strong magician in the office one who has the demeanor of command coupled with restraint and perspective yet who will muster savagery when necessary in the defense of xanth as in the event of a wiggle invasion or similar threat one who may also provide a potential heir so that xanth is not again caught in the difficult situation just past it is not necessary to like such a monarch but we must have him i obviously do not qualify for i could hardly bring myself to devote the required attention to the details of governance the sorceress iris would be unsuitable even if she were not female because of her lack of restraint and the only other person of magician caliber has neither personality nor talent appropriate to the needs of the crown therefore xanth needs you magician you can not refuse and humfrey too bent his knee the evil magician evil no longer bowed his head in mute acceptance he had conquered xanth after all the ceremony of coronation was splendid the centaur contingent marched with dazzling precision and from all over xanth people and intelligent beasts came to attend magician trent henceforth the transformer king took both crown and bride together and both were radiant there were of course some sly remarks at the fringe of the spectator crowd but most citizens agreed that the king had chosen wisely if shes too old to bear an heir they can adopt a magiciancaliber boy after all hes the only one who can control her and hell never suffer from lack of variety and it eliminates the last real threat to the kingdom they were not yet aware of the other formidable external and internal threats bink restored to his natural form stood alone contemplating the place where justin tree once stood he was glad for trent and certain the man would make a fine king yet he suffered also from a certain anticlimactic disappointment what would he bink do now three youths passed one middleaged zink jama and potipher they were chastened their eyes downcast they knew that the days of wild nuisance were over with the new king in power they would have to behaveor else be transformed then two centaurs trotted up so glad to see you bink cherie exclaimed isnt it wonderful you werent exiled after all she nudged her companion isnt it chester chester forced his face into a tortured smile yeah sure he mumbled you must come and visit us cherie continued brightly chester speaks so often of you chester made a little throttling motion with his two powerful hands yeah sure he repeated more brightly bink changed the subject did you know i met herman the hermit in the wilderness he said he died a hero he used his magic bink paused remembering that the centaurs regarded magic in a centaur as obscene that would probably change once trent publicized the knowledge gained from the castle roogna archives he organized the campaign that wiped out the wiggle swarm before it infested all of xanth i hope hermans name will be honored among your kind in future surprisingly chester smiled herman was my uncle he said he was a great character the colts used to kid me about his exile now hes a hero you say cheries mouth tightened we dont discuss obscenity in the presence of a filly she warned him come on chester had to accompany her but he looked back briefly yeah sure he said to bink you come see us real soon tell us all about what uncle herman did to save xanth they were gone suddenly bink felt very good chester was the last creature he would have expected to have something in common with but he was glad it had happened bink knew all about the frustration of getting teased about some supposed failing and he did want to tell an appreciative audience about herman the magic hermit centaur now sabrina approached him she was as lovely as he had ever seen her bink im sorry about what happened before she said but now that everything is cleared up she was like chameleon in her beauty stage and she was intelligent too a fit bride for almost any man but bink knew her now too well his talent had stopped him from marrying herby keeping itself secret smart talent he glanced aboutand spied the new bodyguard trent had taken on binks recommendation the man who could spot anything including danger before it developed the soldier was now resplendent in his imperial uniform and impressive of demeanor crombie bink called crombie strode over hello bink im on duty now so i cant stay to chat is something the matter i just wanted to introduce you to this lovely lady sabrina bink said she does a very nice holograph in air he turned to sabrina crombie is a good man and able soldier favored by the king but he doesnt quite trust women i think hes just never met the right one i believe you two should get to know each other better but i thought she began crombie was looking at her with a certain cynical interest and she returned the glance he was observing her physical charms which were excellent she was pondering his position at the palace which was also excellent bink wasnt sure whether he had just done a beautiful thing or dropped a bagful of cherry bombs into the hole of a privy time would tell goodbye sabrina bink said and turned away king trent summoned bink to a royal audience sorry about the delay in getting back to you he said when they were alone there were some necessary preliminaries the coronation the marriage bink agreed those too but mainly a certain emotional readjustment the crown landed on my head rather suddenly as you know bink knew if i may ask your majesty why i did not desert chameleon and flee into the wilderness for you alone bink i will make an answer setting aside the moral considerationswhich i did noti performed a calculation that in mundania is called figuring the odds when you took flight for the castle of the good magician i judged your chances of success to be about three to one in your favor had you failed i would have been safe anyway there was no point in deserting chameleon i knew xanth stood in need of a new king for the storm king by all accounts was failing rapidly the chances against the elders finding any magician more competent for the position than i were also about three to one and so on altogether my chances of obtaining the throne by sitting tight were nine in sixteen with only a threeinsixteen chance of execution these were better odds than survival alone in the wilderness which i would rate at one chance in two understand bink shook his head those figures i dont see just take my word that it was a practical decision a calculated risk humfrey was my friend i was sure he would not betray me he knew i had figured the odds but it didnt make any difference because that is the kind of schemer xanth needs in a king and he knew it so he went along not that i didnt have some serious worries at the time of the trial roland certainly made me sweat me too bink agreed but had the odds been otherwise i would still have acted as i did trent frowned and i charge you not to embarrass me by revealing that weakness to the public they dont want a king who is unduly swayed by personal considerations i wont tell bink said though privately he thought it was not much of a failing after all it was chameleon he had saved and now to business the king said briskly i shall of course grant you and chameleon royal dispensation to remain in xanth without penalty for your violations of exile no this has nothing to do with your father i never even realized you were the son of roland until i saw him again and recognized the family resemblance he never said a word about you fine avoidance of conflict of interest there roland will be an important man in the new administration i assure you but thats beside the point there will not be any more exiles for anyone or restrictions on immigration from mundania unless there is violence connected of course this means you are released from having to demonstrate your magic talent in all xanth only you and i comprehend its specific nature chameleon was present at the discovery but was not in condition to assimilate it humfrey knows only that you have magicianclass magic so it will remain our secret oh i dont mind you dont quite understand bink it is important that the precise nature of your talent remain secret that is its nature it must be a private thing to reveal it is to violate it that is why it protects itself so carefully from discovery probably i was permitted to learn of it only to help protect it from others and that i intend to do no one else will know yes but i see you still dont follow your talent is remarkable and subtle it is in its totality a thing of magician rank equivalent to any magic in xanth all other citizens whether of the spotonwall variety or of magician class are vulnerable to those types of magic they dont themselves practice iris can be transformed i can be stunned humfrey can be harassed by illusionyou get the point only you are fundamentally secure from all other forms of magic you can be fooled or shamed or grossly inconvenienced but never actually physically hurt that is exceedingly broad protection yes but in fact we may never know the ultimate limits of it consider the manner in which you reentered xanthwithout revealing your talent to anyone who would tell our entire adventure may be no more than the manifestation of one facet of your talent chameleon and i may merely have been tools to convey you back into xanth safely by yourself you might have been trapped in castle roogna or run afoul of the wiggles so i was there to smooth your way it may even have protected you from my mundane sword by bringing chameleon in to take the killing thrust because you see i had discovered your talent in large part through my own magic through its effect on my magic because i am a full magician it could not balk me completely as it might a lesser power but still it operated to protect you it could not completely thwart me i was able to wound youso it joined me acting to alleviate my quarrel with you by making me king in a way you could accept maybe it was your talent that changed my mind and prevented me from killing you hence my reasoning that it was your talents decision that i be allowed to ascertain its nature for this knowledge has as you see profoundly affected my attitude toward you and your personal safety he paused but bink did not comment this was quite a concept to digest in one lump he had thought his talent was limited not affecting those he cared for but it seemed he had underestimated it so you see trent continued my throne may merely be the most convenient agency for the promotion of your welfare perhaps your entire exile and the death of the storm king at this time are all part of that magical scheme your exile brought me into xanthwithout my army in your company i certainly am not going to gamble that mere coincidence brought me to this pass your talent makes most sophisticated use of coincidence i dont want to go against you and perhaps sicken and die the way my predecessor did after he acted against your interest no binki wouldnt want to be your enemy even if i werent already your friend so i am becoming a conscious agent for the preservation of your secret and the promotion of your welfare in the best way i am able knowing how you feel about xanth i shall try to be the best possible king ushering in a new golden age so that you never suffer any direct or indirect threats through my mismanagement now do you understand bink nodded i guess i do your majesty trent stood up clapping him heartily on the back good all had better be well he paused thinking of something else have you decided on an occupation yet bink i can offer you anything short of the crown itselfthough even that may be in your future if no bink exclaimed then he had to backtrack seeing trents broad grin i mean yes i thought of a job iyou said once bink hesitated suddenly awkward you dont seem to have listened very well what you want you will getif it is within my present power but my talent is transformation not divination you must speak out with it well in the wilderness when we were waiting for chameleon toyou know just before the wiggles we talked about the mystery of trent raised one royal hand say no more i hereby appoint you bink of the north village official researcher of xanth any mysteries of magic shall be your responsibility you shall probe wherever required until they are fathomed to your satisfaction and turn in your reports directly to me for inclusion in the royal archives your secret talent makes you uniquely qualified to explore the most forbidding recesses of xanth for the anonymous magician needs no bodyguard those recesses are long overdue for discovery your first assignment shall be to discover the true source of the magic of xanth iuh thank you your majesty bink said gratefully i think i like that job much better than being king perhaps you appreciate how much that gratifies me trent said with a smile now lets go see the girls the travel conjurer moved them both abruptly they stood at the front portal of castle roogna the drawbridge had been repaired and now gleamed in brass and polished timbers the moat was clean and full of water now stocked with monsters of the finest breeds the teeth of the portcullis glittered bright pennants fluttered from the highest turrets this was a castle restored to full splendor bink peered at something he thought he saw around to the side was it a small graveyard something moved there white as a bone with a trailing bandage oh no then the ground opened up with a final cheery wave the zombie sank into its resting place sleep in peace trent murmured i have kept my promise and if he had not would the zombies have marched out of the wilderness to compel performance that was one mystery bink did not intend to explore they entered roogna all six ghosts greeted them in the front hall every one in full human shape milly quickly popped off to notify the queen of the kings arrival iris and chameleon swept up together wearing castle tunics and slippers the sorceress was in her natural form but so neatly garbed and coiffed that she was not unattractive and chameleon was almost back to her center stage average in both appearance and intellect the queen made no pretense of affection for trent it had been a marriage of convenience as anticipated but her pleasure in the position and her excitement about the castle were obviously genuine this place is marvelous iris exclaimed chameleon has been showing me around and the ghosts instructed our toilettes all the room and grandeur i ever wantedand its all real and it wants so much to pleasei know im going to love it here thats good trent said gravely now put on your pretty face we are entertaining company the middleaged woman was instantly replaced by a stunningly smooth and buxom young woman with a low dйcolletage i just didnt want to embarrass chameleonyou know in her average phase you cannot embarrass her in any phase now apologize to bink iris made a breathtaking curtsy to bink she was ready to do anything to remain queenand human trent could make her into a warty toad or he could make her into the very figure she now resembled he could probably make her young enough to bear a child the heir to the throne trent was the master and iris seemed to lack even the inclination to question this im sorry bink i really am i just got carried away there during the duel and after i didnt know you were going to fetch the elders to make trent king bink hadnt known that either forget it your majesty he said uncomfortably he looked at chameleon so close now to dee the girl he had liked from the outset despite crombies dire warnings a fit of shyness overcame him go ahead get it over with trent muttered in his ear shes smart enough now bink thought about how much of his adventure had centered around chameleons quest for a spell to make her normalwhen she really was quite satisfactory and even somewhat challenging as she was how many people similarly spent their lives searching for their own spells some gratuitous benefit such as a silver tree or political power or undeserved acclaim when all they really needed was to be satisfied with what they already had sometimes what they had was better than what they thought they wanted chameleon had thought she wanted to be normal trent had thought he wanted armed conquest and bink himself had thought he wanted a demonstrable magic talent everyone thought he wanted something but binks real quest at the end had been to preserve chameleon and trent and himself as they were and to make xanth accept them that way he had not wanted to take advantage of chameleon in her stupid phase he wanted to be sure she understood the full implications before he before he something tickled his nose embarrassingly he sneezed iris nudged chameleon with her elbow yes of course ill marry you bink chameleon said trent guffawed then bink was kissing herhis ordinary extraordinary girl she had found her spell all right she had cast it over him it was the same as crombies curselove and at last bink understood the meaning of his omen he was the hawk who had carried away chameleon she would never get free
