the plutonian drug clark ashton smith it is remarkable said dr manners how the scope of our pharmacopoeia has been widened by interplanetary exploration in the past thirty years hundreds of hitherto unknown substances employable as drugs or medical agents have been found in the other worlds of our own system it will be interesting to see what the allan farquar expedition will bring back from the planets of alpha centaurt when or if it succeeds in reaching then and returning to earth i doubt though if anything more valuable than selenine will be discovered selenine derived from a fossil lichen found by the first rocketexpedition to the moon in has as you know practically wiped out the oldtime curse of cancer in solution it forms the base of an infallible serum equally useful for cure or prevention i fear i havent kept up on a lot of the new discoveries said rupert balcoth the sculptor manners guest a little apologetically of course everyone has heard of selenine and ive seen frequent mention recently of a mineral water from ganymede whose effects are like those of the mythical fountain of youth you mean clithni as the stuff is called by the gany medians it is a clear emerald liquid rising in lofty geysers from the craters of quiescent volcanoes scientists believe that the drinking of clithni is the secret of the almost fabulous longevity of the ganymedians and they think that it may prove to be a similar elixir for humanity some of the extraplaaetary drugs havent been so beneficial to mankind have they queried balcoth i seem to have heard of a martian poison that has greatly facilitated the gentle art of murder and i am told that mnophka the venerian narcotic is far worse in its effects on the human system than is any terrestrial alkaloid naturally observed the doctor with philosophic calm many of these new chemical agents are capable of due abuse they share that liability with any number of our native drugs man as ever has the choice of good and evil i suppose that the martian poison you speak of is akpaloli the juice of a common russetyellow weed that grows in the oases of mars it is colorless and without taste or odor it kills almost instantly leaving no trace and imitating closely the symptoms of heartdisease undoubtedly many people have been made away with by means of a surreptitious drop of akpaloli in their food or medicine but even akpaloli if used in infinitesimal doses is a very powerful stimulant useful in cases of syncope and serving not infrequently to reanimate victims of paralysis in a quite miraculous manner of course he went on there is an infinite lot still to be learned about many of these ultraterrene substances their virtues have often been discovered quite by accident and in some cases the virtue is still to be discovered for example take mnophka which you mentioned a little while ago though allied in a way to the earth narcotics such as opium and hashish it is of little use for anaesthetic or anodyne purposes its chief effects are an extraordinary acceleration of the timesense and a heightening and telescoping of all sensations whether pleasurable or painful the user seems to be living and moving at a furious whirlwind rate even though he may in reality be lying quiescent on a couch he exists in a headlong torrent of senseimpressions and seems in a few minutes to undergo the experiences of years the physical result is lamentable a profound exhaustion and an actual aging of the tissues such as would ordinarily require the period of real time which the addict has lived through merely in his own illusion there are some other drugs comparatively little known whose effects if possible are even more curious than those of mnophka i dont suppose you have ever heard of plutonium no i havent admitted balcoth tell me about it i can do even better than that i can show you some of the stuff though it isnt much to look at merely a fine white powder dr manners rose from the pneumaticcushioned chair in which he sat facing his guest and went to a large cabinet of synthetic ebony whose shelves were crowded with flasks bottles tubes and cartons of various sizes and forms re turning he handed to balcoth a squat and tiny vial twothirds filled with a starchy substance plutonium explained manners as its name would indicate comes from forlorn frozen pluto which only one terrestrial expedition has so far visited the expedition led by the cornell brothers john and augustine which started in and did not return to earth till when nearly everyone had given it up as lost john as you may have heard died during the returning voyage together with half the personnel of the expedition and the others reached earth with only one reserve oxygentank remaining this vial contains about a tenth of the existing supply of plutonium augustine cornell who is an old schoolfriend of mine gave it to me three years ago just before he embarked with the allan farquar crowd i count myself pretty lucky to own anything so rare the geologists of the party found the stuff when they began prying beneath the solidified gases that cover the surface of that dim starlit planet in an effort to learn a little about its composition and history they couldnt do much under the circumstances with limited time and equipment but they made some curious discoveries of which plutonium was far from being the least like selenine the stuff is a biproduct of vegetable fossilization doubtless it is many billion years old and dates back to the time when pluto possessed enough internal heat to make possible the development of certain rudimentary plantforms on its blind surface it must have had an atmosphere then though no evidence of former animallife was found by the cornells plutonium in addition to carbon hydrogen nitrogen and oxygen contains minute quantities of several unclassi fied elements it was discovered in a crystalloid condition but turned immediately to the fine powder that you see as soon as it was exposed to air in the rocketship it is readily soluble in water forming a permanent colloid without the least sign of deposit no matter how long it remains in suspension you say it is a drug queried balcoth what does it do to you ill come to that in a minute though the effect is pretty hard to describe the properties of the stuff were discovered by chance on the return journey from pluto a member of the expedition half delirious with spacefever got hold of the unmarked jar containing it and took a small dose imagining that it was bromide of potassium it served to complicate his delirium for a while since it gave him some brandnew ideas about space and time other people have experimented with it since then the effects are quite brief and they vary considerably with the individual there is no bad aftermath either neural mental or physical as far as anyone has been able to determine ive taken it myself once or twice and can testify to that just what it does to one i am not sure perhaps it merely produces a derangement or metamorphosis of sensations like hashish or perhaps it serves to stimulate some rudimentary organ some dormant sense of the human brain at any rate there is as clearly as i can put it an altering of the perception of time of actual duration into a sort of spaceperception one sees the past and also the future in relation to ones own physical self like a landscape stretching away on either hand you dont see very far it is true merely the events of a few hours in each direction but its a very curious experience and it helps to give you a new slant on the mystery of time and space it is altogether different from the delusions of mnophka it sounds very interesting admitted balcoth however ive never tampered much vith narcotics myself though i did experiment once or twice in my young romantic days with cannabis indica i had been reading gautiet and baudelaire i suppose anyway the result was rather disappointing you didnt take it long enough for your system to absorb a residuum of the drug i imagine said manners thus the effects were negligible from a visionary standpoint but plutonium is altogether different you get the maximum result from the very first dose i think it would interest you greatly balcoth since you are a sculptor by profession you would see some unusual plastic images not easy to render in terms of euclidean planes and angles id gladly give you a pinch of it now if youd care to experiment youre pretty generous arent you since the stuff is so rare im not being generous at all for years ive planned to write a monograph on ultraterrestrial narcotics and you might give me some valuable data with your type of brain and your highly developed artistic sense the visions of plu tonium should be uncommonly clear and significant all i ask is that you describe them to me as fully as you can afterwards very well agreed balcoth ill try anything once his curiosity was inveigled his imagination seduced by manners account of the remarkable drug manners brought out an antique whiskyglass which he filled nearly to the rim with some goldenred liquid uncorking the vial of plutonium he added to this fluid a small pinch of the fine white powder which dissolved immediately and without effervescence the liquid is a wine made from a sweet martian tuber known as ovvra he explained it is light and harmless and will counteract the bitter taste of the plutonium drink it quickly and then lean back in your chair balcoth hesitated eyeing the goldenred fluid are you quite sure the effects will wear off as promptly as you say he questioned its a quarter past nine now and ill have to leave about ten to keep an appointment with one of my patrons at the belvedere club its the billionaire claud wishhaven who wants me to do a basrelief in pseudojade and neojasper for the hall of his country mansion he wants something really advanced and futuristic were to talk it over tonight decide on the motifs etc that gives you fortyfive minutes assured the doctor and in thirty at the most your brain and senses will be perfectly normal again ive never known it to fail youll have fifteen minutes to spare in which to tell me all about your sensations balcoth emptied the little antique glass at a gulp and leaned back as manners had directed on the deep pneumatic cushions of the chair he seemed to be falling easily but endlessly into a mist that had gathered in the room with unexplainable rapidity and through this mist he was dimly aware that manners had taken the empty glass from his relaxing fingers he saw the face of manners far above him small and blurred as if in some tremendous perspective of alpine distance and the doctors simple action seemed to be occurring in another world he continued to fall and float through eternal mist in which all things were dissolved as in the primordial nebulae of chaos after a timeless interval the mist which had been uniformly gray and hueless at first took on a flowing iridescence never the same for two successive moments and the sense of gentle falling turned to a giddy revolution as if he were caught in an everaccelerating vortex coincidentally with his movement in this whirlpool of prismatic splendor he seemed to undergo an indescribable mutation of the senses the whirling colors by subtle ceaseless gradations became recognizable as solid forms emerging as if by an act of creation from the infinite chaos they appeared to take their place in an equally infinite vista the feeling of movement through decrescent spirals was resolved into absolute immobility balcoth was no longer conscious of himself as a living organic body he was an abstract eye a discorporate center of visual awareness stationed alone in space and yet having an intimate relationship with the frozen prospect on which he peered from his ineffable vantage without surprise he found that he was gazing simultaneously in two directions on either hand for a vast distance that was wholly void of normal perspective a weird and peculiar landscape stretched away traversed by an unbroken frieze or basrelief of human figures that ran like a straight undeviating wall for awhile the frieze was incomprehensible to balcoth he could make nothing of its glacial flowing outlines with their background of repeated masses and complicated angles and sections of other human friezes that approached or departed often in a very abrupt manner from an unseen world beyond then the vision seemed to resolve and clarify itself and he began to understand the basrelief he saw was composed entirely of a repetition of his own figure plainly distinct as the separate waves of a stream and possessing a streamlike unity immediately before him and for some distance on either hand the figure was seated in a chair the chair itself being subject to the same billowy repetition the background was composed of the reduplicated figure of dr manners in another chair and behind this the manifold images of a medicine cabinet and a section of wallpaneling following the vista on what for lack of any better name might be termed the left hand balcoth saw himself in the act of draining the antique glass with manners standing before him then still further he saw himself previous to this with a background in which manners was presenting him the glass was preparing the dose of plutonium was going to the cabinet for the vial was rising from his pneumatic chair every movement every attitude of the doctor and himself during their past conversation was visioned in a sort of reverse order reaching away unalterable as a wall of stone sculpture into the weird eternal landscape there was no break in the continuity of his own figure but manners seemed to disappear at times as if into a fourth dimension these times he remembered later were the occasions when the doctor had not been in his line of vision the perception was wholly visual and though balcoth saw his own lips and those of manners parted in movements of speech he could hear no word or other sound perhaps the most singular feature of the vision was the utter absence of foreshortening though balcoth seemed to behold it all from a fixed immovable point the landscape and the intersecting frieze presented themselves to him without diminution maintaiaing a frontal fullness and distinctness to a distance that might have been many miles continuing along the lefthand vista he saw himself entering manners apartments and then encountered his image standing in the elevator that had borne him to the ninth floor of the hundred story hotel in which manners lived then the frieze appeared to have an open street for background with a confused everchanging multitude of other faces and forms of vehicles and sections of buildings all jumbled together as in some oldtime futuristic painting some of these details were full and clear and others were cryptically brokenand blurred so as to be scarcely recognizable everything whatever its spatial position and relation was rearranged in the flowing frozen stream of this temporal pattern balcoth retraced the three blocks from manners hotel to his own studio seeing all his past movements whatever their direction in tridimensional space as a straight line in the timedimemion at last he was in his studio and there the frieze of his own figure receded into the eerie prospect of spacetransmuted time among other friezes formed of actual sculptures he beheld himself giving the final touches with his chisel to a symbolic statue at the afternoons end with a glare of ruddy sunset falling through an unseen window and flushing the pallid marble beyond this there was a reverse fading of the glow a thickening and blurring of the halfchiselled features of the image a female form to which he had given the tentative name of oblivion at length among halfseen statuary the lefthand vista became indistinct and melted slowly in amorphous mist he had seen his own life as a continuous glaciated stream stretching for about five hours into the past reaching away on the right hand he saw the vista of the fature here there was a continuation of his seated figure under the influence of the drug opposite the continued basrelief of dr manners and the repeated cabinet and wallpanels after a considerable interval he beheld himself in the act of rising from the chair standing erect he seemed to be talking awhile as in some silent antique film to the listening doctor after that he was shaking hands with manners was leaving the apartment was descending in the lift and following the open brightlylighted street toward the belvedere club where he was to keep his appointment with claud wishhaven the club was only three blocks away on another street and the shortest route after the first block was along a narrow alley between an office building and a warehouse balcoth had meant to take this alley and in his vision he saw the basrelief of his future figure passing along the straight pavement with a background of deserted doorways and dim walls that towered from sight against the extinguished stars he seemed to be alone there were no passers only the silent glimmering endlessly repeated angles of arclit walls and windows that accompanied his repeated figure he saw himself following the alley like a stream in some profound canyon and there midway the strange vision came to an abrupt inexplicable end without the gradual blurring into formless mist that had marked his retrospective view of the past the sculpturelike frieze with its architectural ground appeared to terminate broken off clean and sharp in a gulf of immeasurable blackness and nullity the last wavelike duplication of his own person the vague doorway beyond it the glimmering alleypavement all were seen as if shorn asunder by a falling sword of darkness leaving a vertical line of cleavage beyond which there was nothing balcoth had a feeling of utter detachment from himself an eloignment from the stream of time from the shores of space in some abstract dimension the experience in its full realization might have lasted for an instant only or for eternity without wonder without curiosity or reflection like a fourthdimensional eye he viewed simultaneously the unequal crosssections of his own past and future after that timeless interval of complete perception there began a reverse process of change he the allseeing eye aloof in superspace was aware of movement as if he were drawn back by some subtle thread of magnetism into the dungeon of time and space from which he had momentarily departed he seemed to be following the frieze of his own seated body toward the right with a dimly felt rhythm or pulsation in his movement that corresponded to the merging duplications of the figure with curious clearness he realized that the timeunit by which these duplications were determined was the beating of his own heart now with accelerative swiftness the vision of petrific form and space was redissolving into a spiral swirl of multitudinous colors through which he was drawn upward presently he came to himself seated in the pneumatic chair with dr manners opposite the room seemed to waver a little as if with some lingering touch of the weird transmutation and webs of spinning iris hung in the corners of his eyes apart from this the effect of the drug had wholly vanished leaving however a singularly clear and vivid memory of the almost ineffable experience dr manners began to question him at once and balcoth described his visionary sensations as fully and graphically as he could there is one thing i dont understand said manners at the end with a puzzled frown according to your account you must have seen five or six hours of the past running in a straight spatial line as a sort of continuous landscape but the vista of the future ended sharply after you had followed it for threequarters of an hour or less ive never known the drug to act so unequally the past and future perspectives have always been about the same in their extent for others who have used plutoninum well observed balcoth the reai marvel is that i could see into the future at all in a way i can understand the vision of the past it was clearly composed of physical memories of all my recent movements and the background was formed of all the impressions my optic nerves had received during that time but how could i behold something that hasnt yet happened theres the mystery of course assented manners i can think of only one explanation at all intelligible to our finite minds this is that all the events which compose the stream of time have already happened are happening and will continue to happen forever in our ordinary state of consciousness we perceive with the physical senses merely that moment which we call the present under the influence of plutonium you were able to extend the moment of present cognition in both directions and to behold simultaneously a portion of that which is normally beyond perception thus appeared the vision of yourself as a continuous immobile body extending through the timevista balcoth who had been standing now took his leave i must be going he said or ill be late for my appointment i wont detain you any longer said manners he appeared to hesitate and then added im still at a loss to comprehend the abrupt cleavage and termination of your prospect of the future the alley in which it seemed to end was falman alley i suppose your shortest route to the belvedere club if i were you balcoth id take another route even if it requires a few minutes extra that sounds rather sinister laughed balcoth do you think that something may happen to me in falman alley i hope not but i cant guarantee that it wont manners tone was oddly dry and severe youd better do as i suggest balcoth felt the touch of a momentary shadow as he left the hotel a premonition brief and light as the passing of some nightbird on noiseless wings what could it mean that gulf of infinite blackness into which the weird frieze of his future had appeared to plunge like a frozen cataract was there a menace of some sort that awaited him in a particular place at a particular moment he had a curious feeling of repetition of doing something that he had done before as he followed the street reaching the entrance of falman alley he took out his watch by walking briskly and following the alley he would reach the belvedere club punctually but if he went on around the next block he would be a little late balcoth knew that his prospective patron claud wishhaven was almost a martinet in denanding punctuality from himself and from others so he took the alley the place appeared to be entirely deserted as in his vision midway balcoth approached the halfseen door a rear entrance of the huge warehouse which had formed the termination of the time prospect the door was his last visual impression for something descended on his head at that moment and his consciousness was blotted out by the supervening night he had previsioned he had been sandbagged very quietly and efficiently by a twentyfirst century thug the blow was fatal and time as far as balcoth was concerned had come to an end
