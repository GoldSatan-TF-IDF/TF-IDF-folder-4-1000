chapter one at the opera high society in new york in the early s was a very small world everyone knew everyone elses business they all went out in the evenings dressed in their finest clothes to attend the theater the ballet or the opera to visit people and to be seen they gossiped about upcoming marriages and recent scandals the ladies approved or disapproved of one anothers dresses and hairstyles hundreds of pairs of eyes watched out for something irregular something scandalous or ridiculous and hundreds of tongues were ready to talk about it one january evening newland archer went to the opera the famous soprano christine nilsson was singing in faust at the new york academy of music everyone was there as madame nilsson was singing a passionate love song newland looked over at mrs manson mingotts box mrs mingott herself was far too old and fat to go to the opera but her family used the box tonight her daughter augusta welland was there beside her sisterinlaw mrs lovell mingott behind them sat a young woman in a white dress this was mrs wellands daughter may she was staring at the love scene on the stage her eyes were bright and she was blushing as the blonde soprano sang out mama triumphantly the darling thought newland with pride and satisfaction she doesnt even know what its all about when were married well read faust together by the italian lakes that afternoon he and may had told each other their feelings they were now engaged to be married although they hadnt yet made a formal announcement he was glad that may was innocent but once they were married hed educate her when she was his wife hed teach her to be charming and sophisticated like the married woman who had fascinated him for two years he wanted may to have all that womans charm but none of her weaknesses newland looked back at the stage where madame nilsson was reaching the climax of her love song larry lefferts and sillerton jackson were standing next to newland mr jackson was an old society gossip he knew the secrets and scandals of all of new york society for the past fifty years lefferts was an elegant young gentleman an expert on what was appropriate and inappropriate behavior in new york high society hows the law archer lefferts asked a little ironically newland was a lawyer in a distinguished new york law firm but everyone knew that he didnt care much about his work its all right said newland a little dull but a gentleman must do something so i go to mr letterblairs office every morning suddenly lefferts who had been looking at the people in the boxes opposite said my god newland saw that he was staring at mrs mingotts box another lady had just entered it a slim young woman wearing a band of diamonds in her dark hair and a very elegant empirestyle dress everyone in the opera house was looking at that dress augusta welland shouldnt have brought her here said lefferts newland said nothing but in his heart he agreed he was a generous young man and he was glad that may and her family were kind to her unfortunate cousin countess olenska but being kind to her at home was one thing bringing her to the opera was another thing entirely mrs welland shouldnt have done it what happened to the countess asked a young man close by everyone says that shes unfortunate but ive never heard her story she left her husband replied lefferts i heard her husband was horrible said the young man who obviously wanted to defend the lady yes he was lefferts agreed the young man looked satisfied but then lefferts added she ran away with his secretary oh dear said the young man it didnt last long though said mr jackson last month she was living alone in venice lovell mingott went there and brought her home thats fine a family should take care of its unfortunate members but bringing her to the opera is a mistake especially with miss welland said lefferts newland suddenly wanted to go to mrs mingotts box to show the world that he was engaged to may and to protect her from any difficulties she might have as a result of her cousins scandalous reputation he hurried through the red corridors to the other side of the opera house when he entered the box his eyes met mays and he saw that she instantly understood his motive do you know my niece countess olenska asked augusta welland newland had not seen the countess since she was little ellen mingott a lively pretty child of nine ellens parents had liked traveling when ellen was little they took her all over europe they died when she was nine and her aunt mrs medora manson took care of her after that mrs manson was also a traveler occasionally she came back to new york with a new husband shortly after the death of ellens parents mrs manson brought her niece to new york new york society was shocked to see that the little girl wasnt wearing black even though her parents had died recently instead she wore bright red silk and amber beads for a few months newland had seen her often in the houses of her aunts or his but then mrs medora manson had taken her back to europe nothing was heard of them for ten years then there was news ellen had married a very rich polish nobleman she had met at a ball in paris apparently the count had beautiful houses in paris nice and florence newland sat next to the countess he did this so that everybody at the opera could see him we used to play together when we were children said countess olenska you were a horrible boy you kissed me once behind a door but i was in love with your cousin vandie newland who never looked at me she looked around the opera house and said yes being here brings back all the old memories i can imagine everybody here in childrens clothing just like long ago newland was shocked by the flippant way she referred to new york high society which at that very moment was judging her youve been away a very long time he said oh yes replied the lady centuries and centuries so long that i feel as if im dead and buried and this dear old place is heaven to newland her way of speaking seemed very strange he didnt like her tone it was too european too subtle he thanked god that he was an honest new yorker and that he was about to marry one of his own kind chapter two invitations that evening mr julius beaufort and his wife regina gave a ball they had a splendid house and their annual ball was always a great event in new york society regina beaufort was from the dallas family of south carolina and mrs mingott was her aunt but her husband julius though rich and charming was a mystery he was a very successful banker and he claimed to be english but nobody knew his family and his behavior wasnt at all what new york generally approved of he had a mistress called fanny ring everybody including his wife knew about this mistress but nobody discussed her openly beaufort kept another house and a carriage for fanny ring when they whispered to each other the members of new york high society said that it was a terrible scandal nevertheless they continued to accept beauforts invitations when newland and may became engaged that afternoon they had decided not to make a public announcement for some time but now newland told may that he wanted to announce it at once at the beauforts ball they did so and they were both very happy newland was sure that it was the right thing to do in announcing his engagement he was announcing the connection of two important new york families the archers and the wellands if people wanted to gossip about countess olenska now they would be going against two powerful families not just one a few days later sillerton jackson came to dinner at newlands house where he lived with his mother mrs archer and his sister janey when dinner was over the ladies went to the drawing room newland and mr jackson stayed in the dining room to enjoy their brandy and cigars have you ever met count olenski asked newland yes once mr jackson replied hes a very handsome fellow he collects china and women i hear hell pay any price for them its a good thing she left him he sounds horrible there are rumors about the countess said mr jackson i know said newland impatiently olenskis secretary helped her to run away from him i hear the count was almost keeping her a prisoner in that house while he went out and spent his time with prostitutes i admire the secretary for helping her any gentleman in his position would have done the same mr jackson smiled and looked at his cigar i hear he was still helping her a year later he said they were seen together in lausanne switzerland they were living together newland hesitated for a moment and then said and why not just because she made a mistake in marriage why should her whole life be over they say she wants to get a divorce said mr jackson good idea newland replied women ought to be free as free as we are mr jackson poured himself more brandy and said apparently count olenski agrees with you he never made any effort to get her back when newland had spoken so warmly about freedom for women he had been entirely sincere but in fact he wasnt quite so radical as his words suggested privately he thought that a nice woman would never take advantage of such freedom even if it were given to her a few days later a terrible thing happened mrs lovell mingott sent invitations out asking people to a dinner party at her house to meet countess olenska of those invited only three accepted everyone else said that they couldnt come they gave no reason they simply refused the invitation this was an insult clearly new york high society refused to meet countess olenska this is awful cried mrs archer when newland told her about it we cant tolerate this our family is now linked to theirs through your engagement to dear may we must do something i know lets go and visit cousin henry and see what he has to say about it newland agreed it was an excellent idea mr and mrs van der luyden were at the very top of new york society their family was old not just by new york standards but also by european standards and they had several aristocratic relatives in europe if mr and mrs van der luyden accepted countess olenska the rest of new york society would have to accept her too newland and his mother went to see the van der luydens that evening when mrs archer had explained all about countess olenska and the refusals of mrs mingotts dinner invitations the van der luydens looked very worried indeed well said cousin henry after a while the wellands and the mingotts are connected to our family now so we must do something about this it is the principle of the thing that worries me if an established new york family supports one of its members in her misfortune the rest of society ought to accept that and support her too he looked at his wife my wifes cousin the duke of st austrey is coming to stay with us next week said mr van der luyden well give a little dinner party for him and invite the countess thank you so much said newland that is sure to solve the problem after the archers had left mrs van der luyden took her elegant carriage and went to visit mrs mingott two hours later everybody knew that mrs van der luydens carriage had been seen outside mrs mingotts door by the next morning they also knew that the purpose of mrs van der luydens visit had been to invite countess olenska to a dinner party for the duke of st austrey a week later as he sat in the van der luydens drawing room waiting for ellen to arrive newland thought about her history and her strange unconventional education she walked into the drawing room half an hour late wearing one glove and fastening a bracelet around her wrist but she didnt look hurried or anxious on the contrary she was quite serene as henry van der luyden introduced her to his wifes cousin the duke of st austrey it was clear that he thought he was doing her a great honor but she didnt seem to think so apparently she had already met the duke in nice after dinner the duke sat beside her on the sofa in the drawing room but after twenty minutes of conversation ellen left him and crossed the room to sit beside newland it wasnt traditional in new york for a lady to leave the company of one gentleman and seek that of another but ellen seemed unaware of this you know the duke already asked newland as she sat down beside him yes he likes to gamble he was often at our house in nice i think hes the dullest man i ever met but people here seem to admire him newland was a little shocked but he laughed tell me all about may said ellen are you very much in love as much as a man can be newland replied do you think theres a limit if there is i havent found it she smiled with real pleasure then it really is a romance it wasnt arranged by your families we dont allow our families to arrange our marriages here said newland she blushed ah yes she said i had forgotten that everything here is good that was bad where ive come from she looked down at her hands and her lips trembled im so sorry he said you are among friends here you know yes i know look may has arrived youll want to hurry away and be with her the drawing room was filling up with afterdinner guests may was with her mother she was wearing a beautiful white and silver dress she looked like the goddess diana shes already surrounded by other men said newland look the duke is being introduced to her then stay with me a little longer said ellen quietly yes replied newland mr van der luyden came up and introduced ellen to another gentleman newland stood up ellen turned to him and said ill see you tomorrow after five then yes after five newland replied though he was confused it was the first time she had mentioned an appointment chapter three samarkand and new york countess olenska lived in a bohemian part of the city the kind of place where artists and writers live at fivethirty the next day newland arrived at the house an italian maid showed him into the drawing room she said that the countess was out but that shed probably be home soon newland had spent the afternoon with may and her mother going to visit friends and relatives he had hardly had a moment to speak to may alone so he hadnt told her about countess olenskas request her command that he should visit her after five but he knew that may would approve she was always asking him to be kind to her cousin after all it had been in part to protect the countess that he and may had announced their engagement sooner than they had planned if countess olenska hadnt come to new york he would still have been a free man the drawing room was beautiful and unconventional it smelled of spices several modern paintings in old frames hung on the red walls french novels lay on the table and beside them stood a vase with two roses in it in new york no one ever left books in the drawing room and no one ever bought less than a dozen roses he tried to imagine the drawing room in his future home with may may and her mother would decide exactly how it should look and it would be completely conventional nothing like this room hearing a carriage arrive at the door he went to the window and looked out there he saw countess olenska getting out of beauforts carriage followed by beaufort himself beaufort kissed her hand and got back into the carriage ah cried countess olenska coming into the drawing room how do you like my house its lovely said newland i like it im glad its here in new york in my own country and my own town and im glad i live alone in it do you like being alone asked newland yes as long as my friends visit me so that i dont feel lonely she sat down near the fire and said this is the time of day i like best i was afraid youd forgotten the time beaufort can be very charming mr beaufort took me to see some houses my family dont like this one i dont know why this street is respectable but it isnt fashionable newland replied is that so important she asked with a laugh then she added but i want to do what you all do i want to feel cared for and safe new york is terribly safe he said ironically yes i feel that she replied she hadnt noticed his irony she offered him a cigarette and lit one herself you must help me you must tell me what i should and shouldnt do he wanted to say dont drive around with beaufort but that was new york advice and he didnt feel as if he were in new york here this seemed more like a drawing room in samarkand there are plenty of people to tell you what to do he said yes my aunts and my grandmother theyve all been so kind but they dont want to hear anything unpleasant i tried to talk to them but my aunt augusta told me its better not to discuss these things doesnt anyone here want to know the truth mr archer i feel so lonely living among all these kind people who want me to pretend she began to cry countess olenska ellen dont cry he said touching one of her hands does no one cry here either she asked moving her hand to wipe her tears away just then the italian maid came in and announced the duke of st austrey newland rose to his feet id better go he said out in the street he felt that he was in new york once more he stopped at a florists shop to send lilies of the valley to may he did this every morning but today he had forgotten looking round the shop he saw a vase full of yellow roses he asked the florist to send them to countess olenskas address he didnt sign the card the next day newland went to see may thank you for my lilies of the valley they smell so lovely its so good of you to remember to send them every day they were late yesterday said newland i didnt have time to send them in the morning i sent your cousin some yellow roses at the same time i hope that was the right thing to do how kind of you she had lunch with us today but she didnt mention the roses she said shed received flowers from mr beaufort and from mr van der luyden she seemed so pleased newland was annoyed that his own flowers had not been mentioned even though he had failed to sign the card impulsively he said may lets get married sooner than we planned why wait well its usual to wait a little while most new york couples are engaged for a year or two why cant we be different oh newland i love you so much youre so original original he cried on the contrary were all like paper dolls exactly the same we do the same things we say the same things he had an irritating sense that may was playing the part of a young woman in love saying all the things such young women were supposed to say mother wouldnt like it if we were different said may she looked a little bored and irritated but then she smiled and said oh did i tell you i showed my engagement ring to ellen she thinks its the most beautiful ring shes ever seen she says there is nothing like it in paris i do love you newland for being so artistic chapter four marriage is marriage two weeks later at the office newland was summoned by the head of the firm mr letterblair who said to him mrs manson mingott sent for me yesterday she says her granddaughter countess olenska wants to divorce her husband mrs mingott gave me all the relevant papers and asked me to act for the family she made it quite clear that the family dont want a divorce itd be a terrible scandal i want you to go to the countess and persuade her not to ask for a divorce cant someone else do it asked newland the fact that im engaged to her cousin makes it rather difficult for me it is precisely because youre engaged to her cousin that were asking you to do it mrs mingott asked for you it is a very private matter and nobody else in the firm knows about it please take these papers and read them perhaps divorce is the best thing in this case i cant promise to persuade the countess not to divorce her husband unless im convinced that its the right thing to do i dont understand you archer said mr letterblair youre going to marry into her family do you want that family to be the subject of scandal no of course not but what i want is irrelevant the countess is here the count is in europe the atlantic is between them the count has already given her some of her money back he wont give any more why should he the marriage agreement doesnt require him to do so even in the case of divorce besides they say she doesnt care about the money if that is the case she should just let things remain as they are reluctantly newland took the papers to his office and read them the last was a letter from the count in which he threatened to create a scandal over the countesss relationship with his secretary if she insisted upon a divorce it was a very nasty letter newland felt a sudden compassion for the countess the older ladies in new york society were very severe in their judgment of any woman who had a relationship outside marriage they spoke of that kind of woman and showed no pity to her they always pitied the man they considered him a foolish creature who couldnt resist that kind of woman the man was always the poor victim who had to be saved newland had never really questioned these beliefs but now he suspected that in europe things were less simple there he thought it was possible for a good woman an honest sensitive woman to fall into a relationship like that just because she was lonely and desperate the next day he went to see the countess as he entered the drawing room newland was unpleasantly surprised to see julius beaufort standing by the fire why are you going to the van der luydens again beaufort was asking the countess as newland came in the countess turned to newland and offered him her hand beaufort nodded at him and continued talking to the countess youll be bored to death there come to dinner with me instead ive planned a dinner for you at delmonicos i want to invite all the artists to meet you ah said the countess that does tempt me i havent met any artists since ive been here i know some painters said newland ill introduce them to you if you like painters are there any painters in new york asked beaufort with an ironic smile thank you said the countess to newland but i meant dramatic artists singers actors and musicians my husbands house was always full of them then she turned to beaufort offered him her hand and said goodnight i have to discuss business with mr archer beaufort kissed her hand but he didnt look pleased as he was leaving he said archer if you can persuade the countess to come to delmonicos on sunday you can come too so you care about art mr archer asked the countess when they were alone oh yes i always go to the exhibitions when im in london and paris i used to care about art too but now i want a new life i want to leave my old life behind and become an american just like everyone else youll never be like everyone else said newland dont say that i hate to be different i want a new start i know mr letterblair told me in fact he asked me to come to see you thats why im here ah said the countess with a smile you mean i can talk to you youll help me yes have you read the papers do you know about my life with my husband yes said newland blushing then you agree with me that i should get a divorce well im not sure your family dont want a divorce and theyve sent me or rather my partner mr letterblair has sent me to explain to you their point of view have you read my husbands letter yes and isnt it horrible newland looked down yes im a protestant said the countess our church doesnt forbid divorce in such cases but said newlandin his letter the count threatens to cause a scandal if you insist upon divorce what harm could that do me here asked the countess im afraid it could do you more harm here than anywhere you see new york society is a very small world ruled by people with rather conventional ideas yes she replied and her lips trembled a little as she spoke thats what my family tell me and do you agree with them he stood up and walked to the fireplace staring into the fire he said its my business to explain how your family see these things the mingotts the wellands the van der luydens all your friends and relations tell me what you think sincerely she said well what would you gain from a divorce he said looking into the fire my freedom is that nothing he thought perhaps she wanted a divorce so that she could marry the secretary and this thought made him angry but youre free now arent you he replied impatiently is it worthwhile to make a scandal that will upset all your family and friends no she said and her voice sounded sad she stood up quickly as if to indicate that their talk was over all right she said ill do as you say i wont ask for a divorce newland blushed and took both her hands in his i do want to help you he said i know you do help me goodnight she replied he bent his head kissed her hands and left her the count has written to her said mrs mingott he has asked her to go back he has offered to give her back a lot of the money he received when they were married lovell and augusta think she should go back and i agree with them newland was sitting with her in her drawing room drinking tea id rather see her dead he said would you the old lady replied but here you see my granddaughter is at risk a woman alone is always at risk in europe she has everything she could desire jewels fur coats splendid houses the company of artists and intellectuals marriage is still marriage mr archer and my granddaughter is still a wife chapter five the wedding in march may went to st augustine in florida with her parents for a month newland went down to see her he returned two days later and went straight to countess olenska i went to st augustine to ask may to marry me after easter instead of waiting for another year but she wouldnt agree why not asked the countess lighting a cigarette she wants to give me time for what she thinks my impatience is a bad sign she thinks i want to marry her soon to get away from someone else i love more she wants to give you time to give her up for another woman thats very noble of her yes but its ridiculous why because you dont love anyone else because i dont plan to marry anyone else said newland ah there was a long silence and is there another woman yes mays right there is someone else he put his hand on hers she stood up quickly and walked to the other side of the room dont do that she cried newland stood up ill never do anything to offend you he said but youre the woman i wouldve married if it had been possible for either of us possible for either of us she cried in amazement but youre the one who made it impossible you made me give up the idea of getting a divorce you told me to save my family from scandal and because my family was soon to be your family for mays sake and for yours i did what you told me to do i thought began newland i thought you were afraid of the scandal if the accusations in your husbands letter were made public i had nothing to fear from that letter all i feared was bringing scandal on the family on you and may good god he cried putting his face in his hands then he heard her crying by the fire he went over to her and said ellen im still free and you can get a divorce we can be happy he took her in his arms and kissed her wet face no we cant she said youre engaged to may and im married how can i marry may after this he cried you must you dont understand how youve changed things for me i didnt realize that people disapproved of me i didnt know that they all refused grannys invitation to a dinner to meet me later one day when she was angry with me granny told me everything she said that you went to the van der luydens and asked them to invite me to dinner she told me that you and may announced your engagement early so that i would have the protection of two families not just one i hadnt understood anything everyone seemed so kind but no one was as kind as you you explained to me why it was bad to ask for a divorce and you were right you showed me that it is wrong to find happiness by making other people suffer as she spoke he sat beside her looking at the tip of her satin shoe sticking out from under her dress suddenly he fell to his knees on the floor and kissed the shoe i dont want to go back to my old way of thinking she said dont you see i cant love you unless i give you up newland replied bitterly and beaufort is he going to replace me he expected her to be angry but she just went a little paler no she said why not cried newland you say that youre lonely i wont be lonely anymore she said now that i know you love me just then the maid came in and handed a telegram to ellen she opened it read it and handed it to newland it was from st augustine papa and mama have agreed that newland and i can marry after easter im sending a telegram to newland now im so happy love may newland and may were married the first saturday after easter as he went through the ceremony and received everyones congratulations newland felt cold and empty they went on their honeymoon to all the usual destinations london paris florence rome every hour of every day he was with may listening to her innocent chatter often she irritated him her ideas were so conventional that away from new york she seemed narrowminded and dull they went home in july there newland felt more at ease with may she was one of the prettiest and most popular young wives in new york and he was proud of her a year passed newland now thought of his passion for ellen as a moment of madness how could he ever have thought of marrying her it was ridiculous now she lived on in his memory only as a strange eccentric fascination in august new yorks best families went to newport newland and may were no exception they were there with their families newlands mother and sister mays parents aunt and uncle one day they went to visit mays grandmother mrs manson mingott shed just arrived from the city and was staying in her house by the sea they found her sitting in a garden chair beneath a big tree newland and may sat beside her and mrs mingott rang the bell for tea how nice to see you newland cried the old lady will you be here for the whole month of august may will newland replied i must return to the city for business reasons from time to time ah business many husbands find it impossible to join their wives here except at the weekends marriage is one long sacrifice as often say to ellen newlands heart seemed to stop at the mention of her name julius beaufort is here now but poor regina has had to spend most of the month here alone juliuss business keeps him in the city most of the time here mrs mingott raised an ironic eyebrow because everyone knew that the business that kept beaufort in the city was a lady named fanny ring from what i hear continued mrs mingott his business isnt going very well apparently he invested in railways and lost a lot of money that doesnt stop him spending money here though he came this morning to see ellen and he was telling me all about his new racehorses is ellen here asked may newland didnt breathe as he waited for the reply well actually shes staying with the blenkers in portsmouth but she has come to see me for the day said mrs mingott then she cried out ellen ellen the maid came out of the house and said the countess has gone for a walk by the sea madam newland will you go and find her asked mrs mingott certainly as newland walked through the woods towards the sea his heart beat fast hed heard her name mentioned often enough in the eighteen months since hed last seen her he even knew the main events of her life shed spent the previous summer in newport but in the autumn shed moved to washington hearing about her had never disturbed him before but now that he was going to see her again she became once more a warm living presence for him and he remembered the lovely drawing room with the red walls newland came out of the woods and looked down at the sea there was a lighthouse and a pier the sun was sinking and the whole scene was bathed in golden light ellen stood on the pier looking out to sea beyond her a sailboat was crossing the bay newland thought if she turns round before the sailboat passes behind the lighthouse ill go to her he watched her intently but she didnt move she stood perfectly still looking out to sea he waited until the boat was well past the lighthouse then he turned and walked back to the house as he and may drove away from mrs mingotts may said im sorry that ellen wasnt there she doesnt seem to care about her old friends anymore i suppose she moved to washington because new york bores her and now instead of staying with granny in newport shes staying with the blenkers in portsmouth perhaps after all ellen would be happier with her husband ive never heard you say anything cruel before replied newland why cruel asked may in surprise life with her husband was hell do you think shed be happier in hell well she shouldnt have married a foreigner then said may chapter six boston mrs archer said theyd all been invited by professor and mrs emerson sillerton to a party for the blenkers its a terrible bore of course but the sillertons are related to sillerton jackson so i suppose at least some of us will have to go ill go with mother said may im afraid i cant go said newland ive arranged to go to a farm in the north to look at some horses having said that hed be gone all afternoon it actually took him just an hour to drive up see the horses decide that he didnt want to buy them and leave the rest of the afternoon was free he drove to the blenkers house near portsmouth he told himself that he didnt want to see ellen but he had a strong desire to see the house she was living in hed go there and look at the place then later hed be able to imagine her eating breakfast there or walking in the garden if he could do that perhaps the world around him would feel less empty the blenkers house was a big old place all the windows were open but it was completely silent everyone had gone to the party as newland walked through the garden he saw something pink someone had left a pink parasol on the wall newland felt absolutely certain that it was ellens he picked up the parasol and put its handle to his lips just then he heard the sound of someone approaching a woman in a rustling silk dress he didnt look up he had always known that this might happen oh mr archer cried a loud young voice looking up he saw the youngest and largest of the blenker girls standing before him where did you come from no ones home except for me they all went to the party mother said i couldnt go because i have a cold i was very disappointed but its not so bad now that youre here she smiled at him has countess olenska gone to the party too he asked no she received a telegram yesterday and had to go to boston then she saw the parasol in his hands and cried oh youve found it thank goodness ive been looking for it everywhere she took the parasol from him opened it and put it over her large blonde head do you know where countess olenska is staying in boston said newland im going there tomorrow on business and id like to how kind of you shes staying at the parker house when he got home newland saw a letter from the office waiting for him on the table by the door he opened it as he went into the drawing room where he could hear voices may and mrs welland were back from the party the letter contained nothing important when hed read it newland put it in his pocket and said to may ive had a letter from the office they want me to go to boston tomorrow on business the next morning he took the train to boston and a taxi straight to the parker house but the receptionist told him that the countess was out out repeated newland as if it were a word in a foreign language he left the hotel and went for a walk in the park as he was walking there feeling anxious and frustrated he suddenly saw her sitting on a bench under a tree she looked rather tired and sad she was holding a grey silk parasol how could he ever have thought shed have a pink one he walked up to her she looked up startled and said oh but then a lovely smile spread over her face oh she said again in a different tone newland sat beside her on the bench im here on business he said what a surprise to see you here he didnt know what he was saying he felt as though he were shouting at her across a large distance and that she might vanish before he could get to her im here on business too she said what business he asked very unconventional business she said with a smileive just refused to take back a sum of money that belonged to me your husband has come here to meet you no at this time of year he is always at badenbaden he sent a messenger his secretary she said the word as casually as if it were any other word in her vocabulary but ive refused and ill go back to portsmouth by the afternoon train she looked at newland for a while then said you havent changed he felt like saying i had till i saw you again instead he stood up and said lets go out to lunch together why not havent we done all we could you mustnt say things like that to me ill say anything you like or nothing i wont open my mouth unless you tell me to i just want to listen to your voice its a hundred years since we met it may be another hundred before we meet again why didnt you come down to meet me by the sea that day at grannys she asked suddenly because you didnt look round you didnt know i was there i told myself that i wouldnt go to you unless you looked round he laughed at his own childishness but i didnt look round deliberately i knew you were there when you drove in i recognized the carriage so i went down to the beach to get as far away from me as you could yes he laughed again well you see its no use my business in boston was simply to find you come on lets go to lunch at the restaurant they talked and were silent the silences werent embarrassing they were just as natural as the conversation she told him what shed been doing in the eighteen months since theyd last met i was so glad to come home to my friends and relatives in new york she said but after a while i realized that was too different to feel at home there so i moved to washington ill probably stay in washington you meet a greater variety of people and opinions there people in new york blindly follow tradition and the tradition they follow is somebody elses do you think christopher columbus would have taken all that trouble to cross the atlantic if he had known that people in america would make a bad copy of european society she smiled but newland felt irritated by her criticism of new york do you say that kind of thing to beaufort he asked i havent seen him for a long time but i used to and he understood me you dont like us cried newland and you like beaufort because hes european you think were boring why dont you go back to europe he thought shed be angry with him for saying that but instead she sat in thoughtful silence for a while and then said i stay here because of you he blushed and waited in silence hoping that she would say more at least she added after a while it was you who taught me that under the conventionality there are fine values that people here care about their families and look after each other in a way that would seem strange where i come from all the exquisite pleasures of europe seemed empty and cheap then he wanted to say at least youve experienced exquisite pleasures i never have but he looked at her in silence ive wanted to have this conversation for a long time she said i wanted to tell you how much youve changed me youve changed me too cried newland dont forget im the man who married one woman because another one told him to she blushed and said you promised not to say things like that to me ah how like a woman said newland none of you has the courage to talk about the bad things is it a bad thing for may she asked he heard the tenderness with which she spoke her cousins name well she continued didnt you tell me that we always have to think of the feelings of others we always have to think of the family to try to make them happy if you think that my marriage is a success youre mistaken if you think that by giving me up youve made may happy youre wrong you gave me my first glimpse of real life and then you told me to continue the false life no one could endure that im enduring it she cried her eyes full of tears suddenly her entire soul everything she was feeling was expressed in her face you too oh all this time youve been going through this misery too for answer the tears flowed down her face dont go back to europe please dont go he said i wont she replied as long as we can stand it he sat in silence trying to fix her words in his memory he knew that he would never again feel entirely alone chapter seven beauforts disgrace four months passed and newland didnt see ellen again she went back to washington and he went back to his false empty life one evening he and may went to dinner at his mothers house with sillerton jackson when the ladies had left them to their brandy and cigars mr jackson said it looks as though beaufort will go bankrupt if that happens it will be a big scandal he didnt spend all that money on regina well everyone knows that replied newland impatiently its a pity that countess olenska didnt accept her husbands offer why do you think its a pity well whats she going to live on now if beaufort newland leapt to his feet and banged his fist on the table what the devil do you mean sir he cried indignantly mr jackson smoked his cigar and looked serenely at the young mans angry face at length he said with a smile well she hasnt got much money and what she did have was invested with beaufort so i could ask you my dear boy what do you mean by asking me what i mean you know perfectly well that what you said seemed to suggest yes but im not the only one whos suggesting it larry lefferts told me and he isnt the only one talking about them either newland was afraid of having shown too much to this observant old man i think its time we joined the ladies he said newland decided to go to washington to visit ellen he could wait no longer he had to see her he told may that he had business in washington and would be gone for several days he made arrangements to leave on tuesday early on sunday morning however mrs manson mingott had a stroke on saturday evening regina beaufort had come to visit her shed begged mrs mingott to lend beaufort the money he needed to avoid bankruptcy shed insisted that the whole familys honor depended on this im a dallas regina had cried to her aunt no regina the old lady had replied your husband has ruined himself and hundreds of innocent people who trusted him with their money he has brought shame on anyone associated with him you were a beaufort when he covered you in diamonds and youre still a beaufort now that he has covered you in shame at three in the morning mrs mingott had called her maid the maid found her sitting up in bed unable to speak properly or to move her left arm she sent a messenger to the doctors house and to the houses of mrs welland and mr lovell mingott the old ladys children the rest of the family arrived at six and went in to see her one by one they were relieved to see that she was a little better she could speak clearly now when mr lovell mingott came out of his mothers room he said she said shell never speak to regina beaufort again she also says we must send a telegram to ellen telling her to come here immediately the whole family was rather shocked by this last bit of news they felt offended that their own presence wasnt comfort enough obviously the old lady cared for no one but ellen they were also alarmed clearly if the old lady asked for ellen she must be very ill indeed she must be afraid of dying why else would she command ellen to come to new york may thought perhaps her grandmother wanted to try one last time to persuade ellen to return to her husband newland listened to these discussions in silence will you go to the post office newland and send the telegram asked may of course newland replied as he walked to the post office newland saw beauforts disgrace announced on every newsstand the whole of new york was shocked at his dishonor and fashionable young gentlemen were gossiping about it on every corner the next day a telegram arrived in reply to the one newland had sent it said that countess olenska would arrive at jersey city station on tuesday evening somebody must meet her its two hours drive from jersey city we cant let her come back to new york on her own said mrs welland lovell and i must be here with mother and mr welland isnt well enough to go ill go said newland but newland cried may youll be in washington then you told me you were leaving on tuesday morning for a business meeting its been cancelled said newland so i can go and meet countess olenska its no trouble at all really said may in amazement what a coincidence she looked at him and her eyes at that moment seemed so blue that newland wondered if there were tears in them oh thank you so much newland said mrs welland and may looked down chapter eight snow it was a dark snowy afternoon when ellen got off the train newland was startled by her pale face she looked at him in surprise come he said i have a carriage waiting he hurried her into the carriage and sat down beside her he told her all about her grandmothers illness and beauforts ruin poor regina she said softly were you surprised to see me at the station he asked then yes she replied with a smile so was i said newland when i saw you i was surprised i hardly remembered you hardly remembered me she repeated in amazement i mean how can i say it each time i see you you happen to me all over again oh yes i know she said is it the same for you he asked yes she said looking out of the window ellen ellen ellen she didnt reply so he sat in silence watching her profile against the snowy window the precious moments were slipping away and hed forgotten everything hed planned to say to her what a pretty carriage she said after a while is it mays yes did may send you to meet me how kind of her with a jolt the carriage went over a bump in the road and she was thrown against him he put his arm around her and said we cant go on like this ellen we cant be together and not be together you shouldnt have come today she cried suddenly she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him then she turned away and looked out of the window trying to keep as far away from him as possible dont be afraid of me he said i know you dont want a squalid affair and neither do i i want us to be together really together not just for an hour in secret with days of longing in between you chose a good place to tell me that she said laughing why because this is my wifes carriage all right lets get out and walk im sure youre not afraid of a little snow no i wont get out and walk because i must go to grannys thats what im here for and youll sit beside me and talk to me not about visions but about realities this is the only reality he said she sat silent as the carriage turned into fifth avenue do you want me to live with you as your mistress since i cant be your wife she asked the crudeness of the question startled him women in new york high society never used that word even when they were talking about fanny ring ellen spoke it clearly and simply as if it were a normal word in her vocabulary i want to go away with you to a world where words like that ideas like that dont exist a world where well just be two human beings who love each other she laughed again oh my dear where is that country she said have you ever been there the carriage had crossed fortysecond street mays excellent horses were pulling them quickly to the end of their journey soon the precious two hours would be over so what is your plan for us asked newland for us there is no us in that sense were near each other only if we stay far from each other then we can be ourselves otherwise were only newland archer the husband of ellen olenskas cousin and ellen olenska the cousin of newland archers wife trying to be happy behind the backs of the people who trusted them im beyond that said newland no youre not cried ellen youve never been beyond but i have and it isnt a place you and i want to be he sat in silence full of pain then he called to the driver and asked him to stop the carriage why are we stopping this isnt grannys said ellen in surprise no but ill get out here he replied opening the door and stepping out into the snow youre right i shouldnt have come to meet you he whispered to her then he called to the driver drive on that evening may returned from mrs mingotts house just before dinner newland and may dined alone why didnt you come back to grannys asked may as the servant filled her wine glass i had some letters to write besides i didnt know you were staying there i thought youd be at home she didnt reply and he noticed that she looked tired and sad for the first time newland thought that perhaps the monotony of their life together caused her pain too then he remembered that as he was leaving mrs mingotts house to go to jersey city shed said to him ill see you back here then hed replied yes but hed immediately forgotten about it he had had other things to think of now he felt slightly irritated that she should be offended by so trivial an omission after two years of marriage after dinner they went to the library for coffee he sat down to read a history book when they were engaged he used to read poetry aloud to her but after their marriage hed stopped doing that her comments on the poems were too depressing now he preferred to read history in peace may took out her embroidery and started working on it she wasnt very good at embroidering but all the other wives embroidered cushioncovers for their husbands so may did it too every time he looked up from his book there she was her sapphire engagement ring and gold wedding ring gleamed in the lamp light shell always be the same thought newland in all the years to come shell never surprise me with a new idea or emotion she was maturing into a copy of her mother he put down his book went to the window opened it and leaned out into the icy air the snow was still falling big soft flakes of it were blowing in the wind newland said may what are you doing i want some fresh air its stifling in here please shut the window youll catch your death he shut the window and turned to her catch my death he repeated in a sarcastic voice he wanted to say ive caught my death already ive been dead for months and months but then he had another thought what if may dies young healthy people like may sometimes get ill and die what if that happened to may then i would be free she looked up at him in surprise newland are you all right are you feeling ill no he said returning to his chair and as he passed by her he put his hand on her hair poor may poor why poor she said with a nervous laugh because ill never be able to open a window without worrying you he replied for a moment she was silent and then she said ill never worry if youre happy ah my dear ill never be happy unless i can open windows in this weather she cried newland sighed and returned to his book chapter nine decisions six or seven days passed newland didnt see ellen and no one in the family mentioned her name in his presence he didnt mind he could wait that night when hed leaned out of the window in the icy cold hed made a decision when ellen left new york he would leave with her he would go with her to washington or somewhere else if she agreed japan for instance they could go to japan for days hed been thinking about this plan then one day may told him that mrs mingott wanted to see him there was nothing strange about the request she was getting better and newland was her favorite grandsoniniaw it was natural that she would ask to see him standing outside mrs mingotts door newland felt his heart beating fast in another minute he would see ellen he would speak to her he would ask her when she was going back to washington the maid answered the door and took him into mrs mingotts room he looked around for ellen but she was nowhere to be seen the old woman sat in an enormous armchair by her bed she was pale and there were dark shadows under her eyes but she was much better than shed been that first morning after the stroke she cried out in delight when she saw him hello my dear am i terribly ugly youre prettier than ever replied newland laughing and taking her hand she laughed too and said but not as pretty as ellen that day when she came from jersey city she looked very pretty i thought perhaps youd told her so and thats why she made you walk home in the snow she was still laughing so he laughed too waiting for the joke to be over its a pity she didnt marry you said mrs mingott suddenly then i wouldnt have had all this worry about olenski newland wondered if her illness had affected her brain anyway its all over now she has agreed to stay here with me you know they all tried to persuade me to cut off her allowance so that she would have to go back to her husband yes they did lovell and augusta and letterblair and the rest they all tried to persuade me and they nearly did persuade me especially after that secretary came with the counts new offer it was a very generous offer and i thought money is money and marriage is marriage but when i saw her i thought you sweet bird we cant put you back in that cage again i decided then that i wouldnt force her to go back now she has agreed to stay and take care of her granny and of course ive told letterblair that she must have her proper allowance as newland listened his heart beat fast at first he felt confused and perplexed hed made a decision and now everything was changed then slowly he realized that this change made things easier if ellen had agreed to come and live with her grandmother surely it meant that she now understood that they couldnt live apart anymore this was her answer to what hed said to her in the carriage she wouldnt take the extreme step of running away to live with him but she would come back to new york so that they could see each other more frequently hed been ready to risk everything to be with her but that was no longer necessary the family are still opposed to it mrs mingott continued they still want her to go back to her husband and they say that im too old and too ill to make a proper decision about it youll have to help me newland why me asked newland why not the old lady looked at him with her quick intelligent eyes im too insignificant they wont listen to me youre letterblairs partner you must persuade letterblair to persuade them ill try my best good i knew you would because they never quoted you when they were saying that everyone thought it was her duty to go home he wondered if they had quoted may but he didnt ask is countess olenska in he asked instead no she went to see regina beaufort i told her that ill never speak to regina beaufort again but she said come on granny shes your niece and shes a very unhappy woman then i said and shes the wife of a very bad man and ellen replied so am i and my family want me to go back to him well i didnt know what to say to that so i lent her my carriage and let her go i have to go now said newland he kissed the old ladys hand which was still in his ah whose hand do you imagine youre kissing cried mrs mingott laughing at him your wifes i hope he left mrs mingotts house and walked quickly to the beauforts on fifth avenue he remembered the house blazing with lights on the night of the beauforts ball when he and may had announced their engagement now it looked dead there was only one lighted window some people were saying that beaufort had left new york with fanny ring but that seemed improbable mrs mingotts carriage was waiting outside the door newland felt full of admiration for ellen she alone had rushed to reginas side to show her solidarity and affection for her cousin in troubled times suddenly the front door opened and she came out she turned and said something to someone inside the house then she descended the steps ellen he said in a low voice she stopped in surprise he noticed two men walking along the other side of the street they passed under a street lamp and he saw they were larry lefferts and sillerton jackson they looked over at newland and ellen with interest tomorrow i must see you somewhere where we can be alone he whispered she laughed in new york theres the art museum in the park he said ill wait for you at the door at half past two she turned away without answering and got into the carriage the next day they met at the museum why have you come back to new york he asked because i thought at grannys house i would be safer she said safer from me she looked down at her hands and didnt reply safer from loving me he asked he saw that her eyes were full of tears safer from doing irreparable harm she cried lets not be like the others she meant all the people in new york society who had affairs and lived a life of lies with their husbands and wives she didnt want to be like those people and neither did he but something made him say what others im no different from anyone else i have the same desires she blushed and looked at him shall i come to you once then go home she asked in a clear low voice oh my dearest he said but then he hesitated what do you mean by go home home to my husband no of course you cant go home well i cant stay here and lie to people who have been good to me newland looked at her in despair it would be easy to say yes come once he was sure that he would be able to persuade her later not to go back to her husband but he couldnt deceive her he wanted to be as honest as she was thats why i want you to come away with me he said what were trying to do is impossible she stood up and said i must go he held her wrist the thought of losing her was unbearable well then come to me once he said for a moment they looked at each other like enemies send me a note saying where and when she said will you come to me tomorrow she hesitated the day after she said finally her face was very pale but full of love chapter ten a farewell dinner the next evening faust was playing at the new york academy of music again everything was as it had been two years before on the evening that he and may had announced their engagement newland stood in the box rented by his gentlemens club with mr jackson and lefferts may was in her grandmothers box with her mother and aunt the large blonde soprano on the stage sang out mama triumphantly newland looked at may he had a strong desire to tell her the truth and ask for the freedom he had once refused when she offered it to him in st augustine he ran through the red corridor to mrs mingotts box entering quietly he leaned close to may and said i have a terrible headache will you come home with me may whispered to her mother who nodded sympathetically and in fifteen minutes they were at home in the library newland lit a cigarette i want to tell you something may yes dear said may sitting down its time i told you something about myself he began countess olenska oh why should we talk about ellen tonight said may impatiently i know ive been unfair to her youve understood her better than most people youve always been kind to her but it doesnt matter now does it now that its all over what do you mean asked newland well shes going back to europe soon and granny approves of the idea and has given her enough money to be independent of her husband i thought you knew i thought they would have told you at the office she blushed and looked down how do you know newland asked at last ellen and i had a long talk yesterday evening when i was at grannys house she was so kind to me i think she understands everything then this afternoon she sent me a note she has gone back to washington to pack her things she says she is going to sail from new york for europe in ten days shes going to live in paris you know newland we havent given a big dinner party yet lets give one for ellen before she leaves the dinner was very formal and elegant lamplight shone on the ladies bare shoulders and on their red and blue and gold silk dresses the gentlemen wore elegant black jackets with white flowers there were five vases full of orchids on the long dining table nine days had passed since ellen had returned to washington and newland had heard nothing from her now she was back in new york and the next day she would sail for europe but she wasnt going back to her husband therefore he could follow her and if he did that he was sure she wouldnt send him away this thought gave him the strength to get through the dinner party as the guest of honor ellen sat on newlands right at dinner her face looked pale and tired almost ugly and he had never loved it so much he looked down at her hands all the beauty that seemed to have deserted her face was there in her hands her long pale fingers and slender wrists he thought to himself i would follow her just for the chance of seeing her hands again now that she was leaving everyone was affectionate people kept mentioning her name referring to her as ellen and the dear countess as though they had never gossiped about her never thought her life was scandalous never said she should go back to her husband newland looked at them his eyes went from one wellfed face to another and suddenly he realized that for months all these people had believed that he and ellen were lovers and now they were glad because they had succeeded in separating the lovers it was new yorks way of doing things without scenes without scandal they had all come this evening to support may and may understood this she too believed that newland and ellen were lovers she too approved of this way of avoiding unpleasant scenes ellen would go back to europe and everything would return to normal mrs van der luyden sat on newlands left she mrs welland and sillerton jackson were discussing beaufort and regina they were merciless theyre doing this thought newland to show me what would happen to me if i offended them he laughed out loud do you think its funny asked mrs van der luyden indignantly well i suppose reginas idea of staying in new york has its ridiculous side and she continued talking to the others newland suddenly realized that he had said nothing to ellen since the dinner began he had to speak to her to have a polite conversation how was your journey from washington he asked she looked at him and her eyes said clearly oh yes lets play our parts well it was fine she replied but the train was very hot you wont have that problem in france he said i remember one train ride from calais to paris ive never been so cold in my life she laughed but no matter how uncomfortable it is travel has its advantages said newland raising his voice to address larry lefferts on the other side of ellen you get away you see something new im planning to do some traveling myself soon hey larry lets take a trip around the world starting next month i cant go next month replied lefferts theres the charity ball for the blind i cant miss that at this point the ladies went to the drawing room the gentlemen lit their cigars and returned to their conversation about beaufort all the old values are changing now said lefferts in a few years well all be marrying our children to beauforts bastards oh dear cried sillerton jackson what a terrible thing to say henry van der luyden sat at the end of the table with an expression of sadness and disgust upon his face two hours later everyone left suddenly newland was by the front door and ellen was in front of him offering him her hand goodbye he said ill see you in paris he spoke in a loud voice he wanted everyone to hear oh she replied i would be so happy if you and may could visit me there then she was gone he walked up the stairs slowly and went into the library he lit a cigarette and stood gazing into the fire may came in and sat down in the big armchair beside him well i think that was a great success dont you she said brightly do you mind if i stay here with you and talk about the party all right he sat down in the armchair opposite her theres something id like to discuss with you first you see im tired may very very tired oh my dear i thought so youve been working too hard perhaps anyway i need a break you mean from the law you want to give up the law i want to go away to travel for a while to get away from everything where to asked may oh i dont know india or japan but im afraid you cant do that my dear said may gently not unless you take me with you and i dont think the doctor would let me go she came over and put her arms around him she was blushing and there were tears in her eyes i found out this morning that im expecting a baby oh my dear said newland he stood up and embraced her she was warm and trembling in his arms have you told anyone else only mamma and your mother she replied he couldnt see her face it was buried in his shoulder oh and ellen i told ellen you remember i told you that we had a long talk and she was very kind to me yes i remember but wasnt that two weeks ago i thought you said you just found out this morning yes said may its true i wasnt sure about it then but i told her i was and you see i was right she raised her head and looked at him her blue eyes wet with victory chapter eleven paris almost twentysix years later newland archer stood in his library looking at the fire his hair was now gray this room had seen the most important moments of his family life here his wife had told him that she was expecting their first child their eldest son dallas here dallas had been christened by their old friend the bishop of new york because he was too delicate to be taken to church here their second child mary who looked very like her mother but was not as pretty had announced her engagement to a boring and reliable young man from an old new york family here he and may had always discussed their childrens futures mary had a passion for sports dallas was artistic and had finally found work in the office of an important new york architect for the past six months dallas had been engaged to fanny beaufort lefferts had been right fanny was the illegitimate daughter of julius beaufort and fanny ring but no one seemed to mind about that now she was a delightful young woman and newland was glad to welcome her into the family perhaps may might not have approved but she had died two years before so her approval wasnt necessary but above all it was in that library that his friend theodore roosevelt who was then governor of new york had said to newland youre the kind of man this country needs if were ever going to solve its problems newland had tried to be elected to public office but without success however he continued his useful work for the city of new york and its people for many years for every public artistic or philanthropic project people always wanted opinion this was a big change for a man of his generation newland had escaped from the narrow world of old new york when men thought about nothing except sport moneymaking and society even so newland knew he had missed something the flower of life when he thought of ellen olenska it was abstractly serenely as one might think of an imaginary beloved in a book or a picture she had become the image of all he had missed in life and that image had kept him from other women he had been a faithful husband and when may had died he had honestly mourned her their long years together had taught him that it doesnt really matter if marriage is a dull duty as long as it kept the dignity of a duty the phone rang hello dad said a lively young voice from chicago its dallas listen im leaving for paris on wednesday and i want you to come with me i have to go for business but if you come too we can make it a holiday our last fatherandson holiday before i get married newland felt a little nervous may hadnt liked traveling now he was used to that quiet life and the idea of going abroad was a little frightening but dallas was right it was their last chance to take a holiday alone together yes all right he said laughing it was strange to be in paris for the first few years after ellen had left new york newland had often thought of paris as the setting of her life he had imagined the horsechestnut trees on the boulevards flowering in the spring the great river rolling under its splendid bridges the life of art and study and pleasure and now here it was he was walking down those boulevards with his son and his heart was beating fast looking at dallas he wondered if his sons heart beat like that in the presence of fanny beaufort he thought probably not can your heart beat fast for something that is permitted he remembered the calm way dallas had announced his engagement absolutely sure that no one would object the difference between his generation and mine newland thought is that they assume they will get everything they want whereas we almost always assumed that we would not isnt this lovely dad said dallas putting his hand on his fathers shoulder as they walked along weve had the whole day to ourselves but now we must hurry were going to visit countess olenska at half past five fanny made me promise to visit her she said the countess was so kind to her when she was in paris newland stared at him in amazement you told her i was here of course why not tell me what was she like newland blushed and was silent under his sons curious gaze come on dad you and she were great friends werent you they say she was really lovely lovely said newland i dont know she was different ah yes thats how i feel about fanny what do you mean asked newland oh dad youre so oldfashioned dont be so prehistoric why cant we talk about it didnt you once feel about her just like i feel about fanny she was the woman you really loved i know mother told me the day before she died she said she knew we would be safe with you because once when shed asked you to youd given up the thing you most wanted newland walked on in silence then he said she never asked me no i forgot you never did ask each other anything did you or tell each other anything you just sat and watch each other and tried to guess what the other was thinking youre not angry with me are you dad no no of course not and it was true he wasnt angry with dallas for saying those things it was a relief to know that someone had guess and pitied him and it was terribly moving to know that it had been his wife and he wasnt angry that dallas had arranged for them to go and visit countess olenska she had never returned to her husband and when he had died some years earlier she hadnt changed her way of life there was nothing now to keep them apart after all im only fiftyseven he thought they walked to the quiet square where countess olenska lived the early evening light was golden for thirty years her life of which he knew so little had been lived in this golden light her life must have been full of interests art conversation people which he could hardly understand here it is said dallas stopping in front of a modern building she lives on the top floor come on its almost time i think ill sit here for a while said newland he sat down on a bench under a flowering horsechestnut tree why are you ill no im fine but please go up without me you mean youll come up later i dont know replied newland slowly if you dont she wont understand go on ill follow you dallas stared at him but what shall i say to her my dear boy you always know what to say all right shall i say that youre oldfashioned and prefer to walk up five flights of stairs because you dont like lifts just say im oldfashioned thatll be enough looking perplexed dallas turned and walked into the building newland sat on the bench and gazed up at the balcony and the windows on the top floor he calculated the time it would take dallas to go up in the lift ring the door bell be admitted and walk into the drawing room he wondered if it was true as people said that dallas took after him he tried to imagine the people in the drawing room six was the hour for visiting he was sure there would be more than one person there among them would be a pale lady with dark hair she would hold out her hand to dallas he thought she would be sitting near the fire there would be flowers on the table beside her its more real to me here than if i went up he thought he sat on the bench for a long time as the golden light faded and the evening came he watched the lights come on in the room behind the windows on the top floor then a maid came out and closed the shutters newland archer got up from the bench and walked back alone to the hotel the end
