as we entered the gates to horrorland we had no idea that in less than an hour we would all be lying in our coffins im the calm one in the morris family everyone says lizzy youre the calm one and im trying to tell this story calmly but believe me theres no way we had never planned to go to horrorland in fact wed never heard of it the five of us were squeezed into dads little toyota on our way to spend the day at zoo gardens theme park dad had messed up and left the map at home but mom said the park would be real easy to find when we got close to the park mom said there would be lots of signs to direct us but so far we hadnt seen a single sign dad was driving and mom was beside him in the front i was squeezed in back with my little brother luke who is ten and lukes friend clay it wasnt the best place to be my brother cannot sit still for a second especially in the car he just has too much energy and hes totally goofy the longer we drove the more restless luke became he tried wrestling with clay but there really wasnt room then he tried arm wrestling with him and the two of them kept bumping me until i lost my temper and started shouting at them to stop why dont you three play alphabets mom suggested from the front look out the window for letters there arent any luke replied there arent any signs there isnt anything to look at clay grumbled he was right we were driving past flat sandy fields there were a few scraggly trees here and there the rest was all desert im going to take this turnoff dad announced he took off his chicago cubs cap and scratched his thinning blond hair havent i already taken this turnoff dad is the only blond in the family mom luke and i all have straight black hair and blue eyes in fact dad doesnt look as if he belongs in the same family the three of us are tall and thin with very fair skin and dad is short and kind of chubby with a round face thats almost always pink i tease him all the time because i think he looks a lot more like a wrestler than a bank manager which he is im pretty sure weve already been here dad said unhappily its hard to tell its all desert mom replied gazing out her window very helpful dad muttered how can i be helpful mom shot back youre the one who left the map on the kitchen table i thought you packed it dad grumbled why should it be my job to pack the map mom cried break it up you two i interrupted once they start fighting they never stop its always best to interrupt them quickly before they really get into it im the mad pincher luke cried he let out a gruesome horrormovie laugh and started pinching clays ribs and arms i hate lukes mad pincher routine more than anything i was so glad that clay was sitting in the middle next to luke and not me usually the only way to stop lukes pinching is to slug him clay started squirming and laughing he thinks everything luke does is a riot he laughs at all of my brothers stupid jokes and stunts i think thats why luke likes clay so much the two of them began pinching each other then luke shoved clay onto me give me a break i cried i shoved clay back i know i shouldnt have but it was getting hot in the car and wed been driving for hours and what was i supposed to do lizzy boys chill out back there dad cried dad nobody says chill out anymore i told him calmly and quietly for some reason that made him go berserk he started yelling and his face got bright red i knew he wasnt mad at me he was mad because he couldnt find zoo gardens theme park everybody just take a deep breath and be silent mom suggested ow stop pinching me clay screamed he gave luke a hard shove you stop pinching me my brother shrieked shoving him back boys can really be animals hey look a sign up ahead mom pointed as a large green sign came into view luke and clay stopped fighting dad leaned forward over the steering wheel squinting through the windshield does it say where the park is luke demanded does it say where we are clay asked the words on the sign came into view as we drove past it it said sign for rent we all let out disappointed groans the mad pincher returns luke cried he gave clay a hard pinch on the arm luke never knows when to quit this road isnt going anywhere dad said scowling ill have to turn around and get back on the highway if i can find it i think you should ask someone for directions mom suggested ask someone ask someone dad exploded do you see anyone i can ask his face was bright red again he drove with one hand so he could use the other to shake a fist i meant if you see a gas station mom murmured a gas station dad screamed i dont even see a tree dad was right i stared out the window and saw nothing but white sand on both sides of the road the sun beamed down on it making it gleam the sand was so bright it nearly looked like snow i meant to go north dad muttered the desert is south we must have gone south youd better turn around mom urged are we lost clay asked i could hear some fear in his voice clay isnt the bravest kid in the world in fact he is pretty easy to scare once i crept up behind him in our back yard at night and whispered his name and he almost jumped right out of his shoes dad are we lost luke repeated the question yeah were lost dad replied quietly hopelessly lost clay let out a soft cry and slumped in the seat he looked a little like a balloon deflating dont tell him that mom cried sharply what should i tell him dad snapped back were nowhere near zoo gardens were nowhere near civilization were in the desert going nowhere just turn around im sure well find someone we can ask mom said softly and stop being so dramatic were all going to die in the desert luke said with a gruesome grin on his face and buzzards will peck out our eyeballs and eat our flesh my brother has a great sense of humor doesnt he you cant imagine what its like having to live with a total ghoul luke stop scaring clay mom said turning in her seat to glare at luke im not scared clay insisted but he looked scared his round face was kind of pale and his eyes were blinking a lot behind his glasses with his short feathery blond hair and round eyeglasses clay looked a lot like a frightened owl muttering to himself dad slowed the car to a stop then he turned it around and we headed back in the direction we had come great vacation he said through clenched teeth its still early mom told him checking her watch the late morning sun was nearly straight overhead i could feel its warmth on my face through the open sunroof we drove for nearly half an hour luke wanted to play twenty questions or geography with clay but clay moodily said no he just stared out the window watching the desert roll by every few minutes hed ask are we still lost pretty lost my dad would reply unhappily were okay mom kept reassuring us as we drove the scraggly trees reappeared then after a while the sand gave way to darker fields dotted with trees and low shrubs i sat silently my hands clasped in my lap staring out the window i wasnt really scared or worried but i wished we would at least see a gas station or a store or one other human being im getting hungry luke griped is it lunchtime with a long sigh that sounded like air escaping from a tire dad pulled the car to the side of the road he reached across mom to the glove compartment theres got to be some kind of map in there he said no i already looked mom told him as they started to argue i raised my eyes to the open sunroof above my head oh i let out a cry as i saw a hideous monster staring down at me lowering its enormous head about to crush the car i opened my mouth to scream but no sound came out the monster glared down at me through the sunroof it was as tall as a building i realized its red eyes glowed with evil and its mouth was twisted in a hungry grin ddad i finally managed to stammer dad was bent over fumbling through the papers in the glove compartment wow i heard luke cry i turned and saw that luke was staring up at it too his blue eyes wide with fright dad mom my heart was pounding so hard i thought my chest might explode lizzy what is it mom asked impatiently the monster lowered its head over us its mouth opened wide ready to swallow the whole car and then luke started to laugh wow cool he cried and i realized at the same time that the monster wasnt alive it was a mechanical figure part of a giant billboard display ducking my head to get a better view through the side window i saw that dad had pulled the car up right beside the billboard my parents were so busy arguing about maps they hadnt even noticed it i stared up at the redeyed monster it lowered its head and opened its jaws then the jaws snapped shut and the enormous head slid back up it looks so real clay exclaimed staring up at it didnt fool me i lied i wasnt going to admit that i nearly leaped out through the sunroof im supposed to be the calm one after all i rolled down the window and stuck my head out to read the billboard in front of the mechanical monster in huge red letters it said welcome to horrorland where nightmares come to life there was a dark red arrow in the upper lefthand corner with the words one mile can we go there luke demanded eagerly he leaned forward and grabbed the back of dads seat with both hands can we dad how about it it looks kind of scary clay said softly dad slammed the glove compartment shut with a sigh he was giving up on the map idea luke stop pulling my seat he snapped sit back can we go to horrorland luke demanded horrorland whats horrorland mom demanded never heard of it dad muttered its only a mile from here luke pleaded it looks great the monster lowered its head over the car staring in through the sunroof then it raised its head again i dont think so mom said staring out at the huge billboard zoo gardens is such a wonderful park horrorland doesnt look very nice it looks great luke insisted pulling at dads seat back again it looks really excellent luke sit back dad pleaded lets go i urged were never going to find zoo gardens mom hesitated chewing her lower lip i dont know she said fretfully some of these places arent safe itll be safe luke declared itll be very safe luke sit back dad growled can we go luke demanded ignoring dads request can we it could be fun clay said quietly lets give it a try i urged them if we hate it we can always leave dad rubbed his chin he sighed well i guess it would be better than sitting here in the middle of nowhere arguing all day yaaaaay luke screamed luke and i reached over clay to slap each other a high five horrorland sounded like a pretty cool place to me too i love scary rides if the rides are as scary as that monster i said pointing at the billboard this park will be awesome you dont think its too scary do you clay asked i saw that he had his hands clasped tightly in his lap and he had that frightened owl look on his face again no it wont be too scary i told him oh wow was i wrong i cant believe someone would build a big theme park out in the wilderness dad declared we were driving through what seemed like an endless forest tall old trees leaned over the twolane road nearly blocking out the late morning sun maybe they havent built the park yet mom suggested maybe theyre going to clear out these trees and build the park here all three of us in the back seat were hoping mom was wrong and she was the road curved sharply and as we came out of the curve we saw the tall gates to the park straight up ahead behind a tall purple fence horrorland seemed to stretch for miles leaning forward in my seat i could see the tops of rides and strange colorful buildings as we drove across the enormous parking lot eerie chords of organ music invaded the car yaaaaay this looks great luke exclaimed clay and i enthusiastically agreed i couldnt wait to get out of the car and see everything the parking lot is nearly empty dad said glancing uneasily at mom that means we wont have to wait in long lines i quickly exclaimed i think lizzy is excited about this place mom commented smiling me too luke cried he punched clay enthusiastically on the shoulder luke always has to be punching or pinching somebody we crossed the wide parking lot i saw a few cars parked near the front gate at the far side of the lot stood a row of purpleandgreen buses with the word horrorland across the side as we rode closer i got a good look at the front gate the same monster we had seen behind the billboard rose up behind a big purpleandgreen sign over the gate the sign read the horrorland horrors welcome you to horrorland i dont get that sign mom said what are the horrorland horrors well find out i exclaimed happily the solemn eerie organ music floated heavily over the parking lot dad pulled into a space in an empty aisle to the right of the front gate luke and i pushed open the back doors before the car had even stopped lets go i cried luke clay and i started trotting toward the gate as i ran i stared up at the green monster over the sign this one didnt move its head like the billboard monster but it looked very real i glanced back and saw that mom and dad were hurrying to catch up with us this is going to be way cool i exclaimed and then i gasped as a deafening explosion made the ground shake and i stared back in horror as our car burst apart exploding into a million pieces it took me a long while to stop screaming finally i swallowed hard choking back my cries we all stared in shock small chunks of twisted metal and a few burning cinders were all that was left of our car how was all dad managed to say i i ddont believe it i stammered thank goodness we were all out of the car mom cried she gathered us up in a big hug thank goodness were all okay luke and clay still hadnt uttered a sound they stood wideeyed staring at the spot where the car had stood my car dad choked out in a horrified whisper my car how how were safe mom murmured were all safe what a terrifying explosion i cant get the sound of it out of my ears i ive got to call the police dad sputtered he began trotting to the gate shaking his head muttering to himself how could the car just blow up like that dear mom asked hurrying after him what would make it do that how should i know dad snapped angrily i i dont get it i really dont and now what are we going to do he sounded really panicked i didnt blame him the explosion was really scary and when i realized that we could have all been inside the car when it went off i had cold chills down my back maybe theres a rental car place we can call mom suggested mom is like me calm in any emergency we followed dad as he went running up to the ticket booth at the entrance a green monster stood in the booth he had bulging yellow eyes and dark horns curled over his head it was a really great costume welcome to horrorland he said in a gruff low voice a loud stab of organ music rose up from inside the ticket booth i am a horrorland horror all of the horrors and i hope you have a scary day my car dad cried frantically there was an explosion i need a phone im sorry sir no phones the guy in the monster costume replied huh dads face was bright red again his forehead was drenched with sweat but i need a phone right away dad insisted glaring angrily at the green monster my car exploded were stuck here well take care of you the horror replied lowering his gruff voice nearly to a whisper youll what dad cried we need a car i need to get to a phone dont you understand no phones the monster repeated but please sir allow us to take care of you i promise we will take care of everything dont let this spoil your visit to horrorland spoil my visit dad shrieked his face growing even redder but my car another loud stab of organ music made me jump the creepy music made me feel as if i were actually in a horror movie we will take care of you i promise the horror said a strange smile crossed his face his yellow eyes lit up please enjoy your stay and do not worry about transportation the other horrors and i will see that you are properly taken care of but but dad sputtered the horror gestured toward the park please enter as our guests free admission i apologize for your car but please do not worry i promise you will have no need to worry about your car dad turned back to us sweat dripping down his forehead i could see that he was really upset i i cant enjoy an amusement park now he said i cant believe this happened i really cant weve got to get a car somehow and oh please dad luke cried please cant we go inside he said hell take care of it for us just for a little while i joined my brother in pleading weve had such a long drive mom told dad lets go in for a short while let them blow off some steam dad thought about it frowning hard okay just for a little while he agreed finally the organ music grew louder as we stepped through the gate wow look at this place i cried it really is like being in a horror movie we were standing on a brown cobbled street strange dark cottages tilted up on both sides of the street tall trees along the street nearly blocked out all the sunlight the air carried a chill low howls like wolf howls floated out from the cottages cool luke declared a sign proclaimed welcome to werewolf village do not feed the werewolves if you can help it the frightening howls grew louder luke and i laughed at the sign i saw a green monster one of the horrors staring out at us through a dark window in the cottage across the narrow street another horror walked past carrying a very reallooking human head he grasped it by its long blond hair and bounced it up and down sort of like a yoyo as he walked cool luke proclaimed again it seemed to be his word of the day we walked along the cobbled street the sound of our thudding sneakers echoed off the cottage walls ohh we all let out cries of surprise as a long low gray wolf ran in front of us it disappeared around the side of a cottage before we really got a good look at it was that a real wolf clay asked his voice shaking of course not i told him it was probably a dog or else it was mechanical well they certainly keep this park clean mom said trying to sound cheerful there isnt a piece of trash or dirt anywhere of course it isnt very crowded dad lingered behind i ive got to find a phone he said fretfully i cant enjoy this until i know we have a way to get home but dear mom started theres got to be a phone somewhere dad interrupted go on without me no ill come with you mom said youre in such a frantic state youll need me to make the calls for you the kids will have a better time without us hanging around anyway leave them dad cried you mean let them go on their own of course mom said hurrying back to him theyll be perfectly fine this looks like a very nice place what could happen what could happen with those words mom and dad rushed off to find a phone meet back here mom called to us luke clay and i were suddenly on our own i turned to watch mom and dad hurry away i turned back in time to see a gray wolf edging out from behind the cottage it lowered its head and let out a rumbling warning growl all three of us froze as we realized its hungry red eyes were locked on us i cried out and pulled luke and clay back the wolf slithered out holding its head low glaring up at us with wide red eyes its mouth open hungrily it its real clay declared swallowing hard i had my hand on his shoulder i could feel him trembling the wolf let out a low growl then it slid back behind the cottage wall i think its some kind of robot or something i told clay lets go somewhere else clay replied suddenly very pale what does that sign up there say luke asked he went running over the dark cobblestones to the sign and clay and i followed the sign read no pinching luke laughed thats stupid what a dumb sign clay agreed that sign was meant just for you luke i exclaimed i gave him a hard pinch on the arm hey cant you read he shouted angrily pointing to the sign i saw a green horror watching us from down the street then i saw a family making its way behind the row of cottages there was a mother a father and a little girl the little girl was crying for some reason the parents had their hands on her shoulders and looked very upset a wolf howl cut through the air lets find some rides clay suggested some scary rides luke added walking side by side keeping close together we made our way out of the werewolf village the street widened into a round plaza bright sunlight returned as soon as we stepped out of the village several purpleandgreen buildings surrounded the plaza i saw a few more families and several greencostumed horrors keeping an eye on everything a pudgy horror behind a purpleandgreen cart was selling ice cream cones black ice cream yuck luke declared making a face we hurried past the cart past another no pinching sign and stopped in front of what appeared to be a tall purple mountain its a ride i told them a doorway was cut into the side of the mountain and above the doorway was a sign doom slide will you be the one to slide forever cool luke cried slapping clay a high five ill bet you climb to the top then slide all the way down i said pointing to the top of the mountainshaped building lets go luke cried excitedly we ran to the building then through the open doorway in its side it was dark and cold inside a wide ramp curved up toward the top i could hear kids squealing and laughing but i couldnt see them the three of us halfwalked halfran up the ramp eager to get to the top about halfway up we stopped to read another sign warning you may be the one to slide to your doom now i could hear kids screaming as they slid down but it was too dark to see anything are you scared clay i asked noticing his tight expression no way he insisted embarrassed by my question ive seen these things before theyre like really huge sliding boards you just sit on them and slide down hurry luke shouted running ahead of us hey wait up i called i followed them to the top of the ramp we found ourselves on a wide platform a row of long curving sliding boards stretched to the end of the platform the sliding boards were numbered from one to ten in the dim light i saw two horrors watching us approach they stood in front of the sliding boards their bulging yellow eyes lit up as we hurried over to them do you slide all the way down luke asked one of them the horror nodded do you go really fast clay asked lingering a few feet behind us the horror nodded again its a long way down he rumbled be careful which slide you pick the other horror warned dont pick the doom slide he gestured to the number painted in black in front of each slide yes dont pick the doom slide his partner repeated youll slide down forever and ever i laughed he was just trying to scare us wasnt he i chose slide number three because three is my lucky number luke sat down on top of the slide next to mine slide number two and clay scrambled over to the far end and dropped down onto slide number ten i glanced back to see what the horrors were doing but before i could focus on them i felt the bottom tilt underneath me i let out a long highpitched shriek as i began to slide i raised my arms over my head leaned back and screamed all the way down my cries echoed in the enormous dark canyon of the doom slide building it felt great the slide curved and curved and i swirled down in the darkness faster and faster in the shadowy light i could see luke in the slide next to mine he was lying on his back staring straight up with his mouth wide open i tried to call out to him but the slide curved away and i curved with it down down i was sliding so fast the darkness became a solid blur the slide curved up then around then down again im a human roller coaster i thought happily down down darker and darker im sliding faster than the speed of light i thought i glanced from one side to the other trying to see luke and clay but it was too dark and i was moving too fast too fast and then bump a chute opened up i hit the ground hard landing on the seat of my jeans outside i was back outside bump luke bounced out beside me he hit the ground still lying on his back and made no attempt to get up he grinned up at me where am i back on the ground i told him climbing to my feet i brushed off the back of my jeans then reached behind my head to straighten my braid great ride huh lets go again luke said still lying there we cant go again if you dont get up i said help me he reached up a hand i groaned as i tugged him to a sitting position get up yourself i said impatiently you were screaming in there he told me i did it on purpose i said i wanted to scream yeah sure he rolled his eyes then he pulled himself to his feet wow im a little dizzy how fast do you think we were going i shrugged pretty fast i think its so dark in there its hard to know how fast youre going and then i realized we were missing a member of our sliding party i stared at the closed chutes on the wall of the building hey wheres clay huh luke had forgotten about him too we both stared at the side of the building waiting for clay to pop out where is he luke demanded shrilly he couldnt be that much slower than us could he i shook my head i was starting to feel really nervous i had a heavy feeling in the pit of my stomach and my hands were suddenly cold and clammy come on clay i pleaded staring at the wall come on out luke scratched his black hair whered he go he asked why didnt clay come out maybe he came out the front i said maybe slide number ten dumps you out in front lets check it out as we ran around the building toward the front i scolded myself for getting scared so easily of course clay came out in a different chute he was probably waiting for us in front of the building he was probably worried about us as we rounded the purple building the wide circular plaza came into view i searched for mom and dad but they werent there i saw a couple of other families on the other side of the circle and the pudgy green horror leaning on his icecream cart no sign of clay luke and i kept running up to the front entrance of the doom slide we stopped a few feet from the dark opening he isnt here luke cried struggling to catch his breath i was breathing hard too and the heavy feeling of dread in my stomach grew even heavier no no clay i muttered what are we going to do luke asked his blue eyes were wide with fear i saw a green horror woman standing just inside the entrance hey i called as i ran over to her did you see a kid come out of there i asked breathlessly the yellow eyes on the horrors mask bulged and appeared to light up no this is the entrance no one comes out here she replied hes blond and sort of chubby he wears glasses i told her hes wearing a blue tshirt and denim shorts the horror shook her head no no one comes out this way did you check the back everyone comes out the back he didnt luke said shrilly we were there he didnt come out my brothers voice came out high and squeaky he was breathing so hard his chest was heaving up and down he was in a panic i was frightened too but i knew i had to stay calm for lukes sake he didnt come out the back i told the horror and he didnt come out the front so what happened to him the horror was silent for a long moment then she said in a low voice just above a whisper maybe your friend chose the doom slide i stared at the woman in the horror costume you youre joking right i stammered i mean the doom slide thats just a joke she stared back with her bulging yellow eyes and didnt reply the signs give a warning she said theres always a warning she turned and disappeared into the dark entrance luke and i goggled at each other i swallowed hard my throat suddenly felt very dry my hands were cold as ice now this is stupid luke muttered he jammed his hands into his jeans pockets its just a dumb slide why is she trying to scare us i guess thats her job i told him weve got to find mom and dad luke muttered weve got to find clay first i told him if mom and dad find out we lost clay theyll get angry and make us go home as soon as we find him if we find him luke said glumly i glanced back across the plaza no mom and dad two teenagers were buying black icecream cones from the horror at the cart two horrors were sweeping the plaza with push brooms working side by side far in the distance i could hear the howl of a wolf from the werewolf village the sun was high in the sky now i could feel it beaming down on top of my head and on my shoulders but i still felt cold all over clay where are you i asked thinking out loud hes sliding forever luke said shaking his head sliding forever and ever on the doom slide thats dumb i replied but luke had given me an idea come on i said tugging the sleeve of his tshirt i started pulling him to the dark entrance huh where luke pulled back well go on the slides again i told him his mouth dropped open in protest without clay we cant go on it again without clay were going to find clay i said grabbing his arm this time and pulling him to the dark open doorway you mean my brother was starting to catch on i nodded yes well follow him well take the same slide he took slide number ten luke murmured and then he added in a solemn whisper the doom slide well take it and it will lead us right to him i said we climbed the ramp in silence the rapid thud of our sneakers echoed in the vast hollow mountain we ran past the sign about halfway up to the top i read it again as i passed it by warning you may be the one to slide to your doom clay are you still sliding i wondered i shook my head hard shaking away the thought of course he wasnt still sliding what a stupid idea the two horrors were still standing at the top of the slides be careful which slide you pick one of them warned we know which one we want i said breathlessly slide number ten both of us together the horror nearest the slide motioned for us to sit down i glanced at luke who stood right behind me his features tight with fear he tugged me back a few steps maybe we shouldnt he whispered why not i demanded impatiently what if the warning is true luke demanded dont be dumb i scolded him this is an amusement park remember they dont kill kids or send them sliding to their doom its all for fun luke swallowed hard you sure of course im sure i replied now do you want to find clay or not luke nodded then lets go i ordered i sat down at the top of slide number ten luke plopped down right behind me stretching his legs outside of mine i felt the floor tilt up beneath us we started to slide clay here we come i cried i didnt scream this time i clasped my hands in my lap and gritted my teeth there was no way i was going to enjoy this ride i just wanted to get to the end of it i wanted to solve the mystery and find clay as we slid down together luke grabbed onto me his hands gripping my waist he cried out when we slid over a big bump and it felt as if we were going to go flying off the slide then we both screamed as the slide took a steep dive almost straight down and we started to fall we landed hard and then the slide curved sharply to the right we were both screaming our lungs out now we were sliding faster and faster in total darkness blacker than black i tried to see if we were moving alongside the other slides but it was so dark i couldnt even see my sneakers in front of me luke squeezed my waist so hard i could hardly breathe i tried to tell him to loosen his grip but he was screaming too loud to hear down down darker and darker we hit another bump that sent us bouncing up into the air then the slide dipped and curved sharply to the left we should be at the bottom by now i realized wed been sliding a very long time i gritted my teeth harder and tried to brace myself to go flying out the chute and bumping onto the ground but no chute opened the ride didnt end we began to slide faster i gasped in mouthfuls of the hot damp air struggling to catch my breath the slide dipped and curved sending us down into the thick heavy blackness were going to slide forever the warning sign didnt lie i struggled to force those frightening thoughts from my mind luke suddenly got very quiet are you okay i called back to him i dont know he replied holding on even tighter why are we sliding so long youre hurting me i cried he loosened his hold a little i dont like this he shouted in my ear we hit another bump his hands flew off me another bump even harder i thought i was going to fly off the slide and fall to the bottom if there was a bottom down down luke and i both cried out in disgust as something sticky covered our faces i reached up with both hands and tried to pull it off yuck luke screamed what is it my face its like cobwebs i shouted back at him hot sticky cobwebs my whole face itched the sticky threads covered my face like a net i pulled frantically at them oh i cried out as the slide took another sharp dip tearing at the sticky cobwebs i managed to pull most of them off but my face still itched like crazy it felt as if a thousand ants were crawling around on it its so gross luke yelled behind me my face it hurts down down into the heavy darkness and then a flare of bright light made me shut my eyes was it daylight were we heading outside no i forced my eyes open and squinted at the yellow light and realized i was staring at blazing flames the slide ahead of us was on fire the yellowandorange flames raged up topped by a curtain of billowing black smoke i raised my hands to my face and started to shriek we were sliding right into the blazing flames were going to burn up luke screamed help somebody help us i shut my eyes and felt a powerful burst of heat almost like an explosion im burning up i thought burning up a whoosh of cool air made me open my eyes the fire was behind us now we had sailed right through it curving gently we slid through cool darkness i could still see the orange flicker of flames reflected on the dark walls above us luke and i were both silent i was waiting for my heart to stop thudding in my chest great special effects luke cried he let out a wild laugh a frantic laugh id never heard before the fire was fake i realized some kind of projection or something i sucked in mouthfuls of the cool air i had never been so terrified in my life when does this ride end luke cried his voice had become high and frightened never i thought glumly we really are going to slide forever and as that frightening thought lingered in my mind a chute opened in front of us daylight streamed in bump i landed hard on soft grass a few seconds later luke dropped out behind me i blinked several times waiting for my eyes to adjust to the bright sunlight then i climbed slowly to my feet my heart still pounding a yellowandgreen sign on a wooden pole stood directly in front of us it read welcome to doom population humans standing next to the sign was clay he came rushing over to greet us a happy smile on his round pink face hey guys hey he called whereve you been he slapped luke a high five then luke gave him a playful punch in the stomach whereve we been i asked whereve you been right here clay replied i didnt know where i was i think this is the other side of the park or something so i just waited for you we went back on the doom slide luke explained we took your slide number ten what a ride it was so cool a few seconds ago luke had been shrieking in real terror now here he was pretending he loved it telling clay how cool it was you picked the good slide luke told clay wow it was excellent i was kind of scared clay confessed i mean the fire great special effects my brother exclaimed this park is awesome luke was such a phony there was no way he would ever admit that he had been worried about clay and no way hed admit that the long slide to doom had terrified him but i was glad to see his old enthusiasm return i really didnt like seeing my brother frightened and in a panic it was kind of a long slide clay said frowning his feathery blond hair glowed in the bright sunlight a little too long i think id like to go on it again luke boasted i turned and gazed around we were definitely in another section of horrorland nothing looked familiar across the wide walkway i saw several kids in bathing suits heading down a sandy path a sign over the path read horror rapids to our right a squareshaped building made of glass reflected the bright sunlight the glass walls shimmered brightly as if on fire squinting into the light i could just barely make out the sign in front of it house of mirrors lets try the house of mirrors luke urged pulling clay by the arm whoa wait a minute i cried dont you think we should try to find mom and dad theyre way over on the other side of the park luke replied tugging clay along with him across the pavement lets have some fun and then find them theyre probably looking for us i said fretfully the park isnt very crowded theyll find us luke replied come on lizzy it looks like fun i hesitated thinking about mom and dad i stared into the white glare of the glass building suddenly i felt someone tap my shoulder startled i cried out and spun around it was a greencostumed horror his bulging eyes stared into mine as he leaned close to me get away while you can he whispered he turned his eyes quickly from side to side as if making sure no one was watching him please im serious get away while you can i was so stunned i didnt say anything i watched him run off moving awkwardly in the bulky horror costume his purple tail dragging over the pavement behind him what did he want clay called he and luke were nearly up to the house of mirrors entrance he he said we should get out while we can i stammered running over to them i lost them for a moment in the blinding sunlight reflected off the glass building luke laughed these horror guys are great he declared they really try to scare you in this place behind his glasses clays eyes narrowed thoughtfully he was kidding right he asked quietly i mean it was just a joke wasnt it i dont know i told him i guess so i watched the horror disappear quickly behind a tall blue pyramidshaped building thats his job luke insisted he goes around scaring people all day maybe he was really warning us clay murmured staring at me no way luke declared he gave clay a hard slap on the back stop looking so gloomy all the time this is a great place you like to be scared dont you clays expression remained worried i guess he replied uncertainly i started to tell clay i was sure it was just a joke but luke interrupted hurry up lets check out the house of mirrors lets have some fun before mom and dad show up and make us leave he dragged clay toward the entrance and i followed we passed another no pinching sign as we made our way to the shimmering glass building outside the entrance i stopped to read the yellowandgreen sign it read house of mirrors reflect before you enter no one may ever see you again hey wait up i called to the boys they had already hurried inside i stepped in and found myself in a narrow dark tunnel my eyes were still filled with the bright glare from outside i couldnt see a thing luke clay wait up i shouted my voice echoed through the low tunnel i could hear them laughing up ahead i jogged blindly ducking my head because the ceiling was so low finally my eyes adjusted to the darkness the tunnel ended and i found myself in a narrow corridor with mirrored walls and a mirrored ceiling oh i uttered a low cry i could see my reflections dozens of them i seemed to surround myself i stopped for a moment and adjusted my long black braid it was always coming loose then i called again to the boys where are you wait up i could hear them giggling somewhere up ahead try and find us luke called more giggling i made my way quickly through the mirrored walkway the walls curved to the right then the left my reflections followed me stretching deep into the mirrors dozens and dozens of me getting smaller and smaller stretching to infinity hey dont get too far ahead i cried i heard them giggling then i heard a rumble of footsteps that seemed to come from the other side of the mirrored wall i followed the corridor walking slowly carefully until i saw a narrow opening up ahead wait right there im coming through i called i started through the opening and bonk hit my forehead on solid glass ow i cried out as the pain jolted across my forehead then down the back of my neck all the way down my spine i raised my hands to the glass and waited for my dizziness to fade away lizzy where are you try to find us i heard luke call i hit my head i shouted rubbing my forehead i could hear him and clay laughing their voices seemed to be behind me now i turned back but there were only mirrors behind me no opening my head still ached a little but the dizziness had gone away i started walking again more carefully this time i kept both hands out in front of me so i wouldnt bump into anything again i turned a corner and stepped into a different room to my surprise the floor in this room was a mirror the walls the ceiling the floor were all mirrors i felt as if i were standing inside a mirrored box i took a few careful steps it felt so weird walking on my own reflection i could see the tops and the bottoms of my sneakers as i walked it made it really hard to walk i kept having the feeling that i was going to fall into myself hey guys where are you i called no reply i felt a sharp stab of fear in my stomach luke clay are you there i saw the mouths of my reflections move as i called out dozens of mouths but only one voice came out my voice tiny and shrill luke clay silence dont fool around guys i shouted where are you silence no reply i stared at the dozens of reflections on all sides of me they all looked very frightened luke clay where had they gone i stared at my reflections as horrifying thoughts swept over me had the boys really disappeared had they fallen into some kind of trap were they lost in the maze of glass and mirrors horrorland was too scary i decided it was fun to be scared but it was too hard to tell whether the scares here were for fun or for real were there dangers in this place or was it all a big scary joke luke clay i called to them in a trembling voice turning all around searching for an exit silence then i heard a muffled giggle then i heard whispering voices nearby another giggle louder this time lukes giggle they had been playing a little joke on me hey youre not funny i screamed angrily really not funny i could hear them both burst out laughing come and find us lizzy luke called whats taking you so long clay added more giggling it seemed to come from just up ahead sliding my hands along the mirrors i followed the hallway around to the right i had to duck my head to slip through a narrow opening between the mirrors i found myself in another small room surrounded by mirrors above and below and on all sides the mirrors were tilted at strange angles so that my reflections appeared to bounce off each other as i moved where are you am i getting closer i called the light grew dim as i made my way through this room my reflections darkened the shadows grew longer we cant see you clay called hurry up luke shouted impatiently im going as fast as i can i screamed just dont move okay stay in one place we are luke called back how will we ever get out of here i heard clay ask him in a low voice ow i bumped my head again on a section of clear glass i pounded my fist angrily on the glass this wasnt any fun i decided it was too painful hurry up luke called from somewhere nearby its boring waiting here for you im coming i muttered rubbing my poor aching forehead i turned a corner and stepped into a wider room no mirrors here the walls were all glass i stopped to gaze around and there was luke finally he cried why couldnt you find us i kept hitting my head i told him lets get out of here wheres clay huh lukes mouth dropped open in surprise he spun around searching for his friend he was standing right here he said luke im in no mood for any more dumb jokes i said sharply clay where are you hiding im not hiding im over here clay called i took a few steps closer to my brother and clay came into view he was standing in deep shadows behind a glass wall his hands pressed against the pane howd you get over there luke asked clay clay shrugged i cant find a way out i moved toward my brother then stopped i suddenly realized that he was behind a wall of glass luke and i were in different rooms hey wheres the opening i asked him luke glanced around what do you mean lizzy you and i were not in the same room i replied i walked up to the glass wall and tapped on it with my fist huh lukes face filled with surprise he made his way over to me then he tapped on his side of the glass as if making sure it really did exist howd that get there he murmured clay started moving around his room sliding his hands along the panes of glass searching for the opening stand right there i told luke ill find a way into your room i followed clays example i moved slowly around the room keeping a hand pressed against the glass the light was dim my shadow fell over the glass as i walked i could see my face reflected darkly in the glass my eyes stared back at me dark and desperate before i realized it i had made a complete circle i was back where i had started and there was no opening no doorway no way out hey im trapped in here clay called shrilly so am i i told him theres got to be an opening luke said how did we get in youre right i replied fretfully we should be able to get out the way we came in i began to search along the walls again moving quickly my heart began to pound i had a fluttering feeling in my chest there had to be a way out there had to be luke pounded hard on the glass in the other room i could see clay jogging frantically around his room pushing on the walls as he moved i went all the way around twice then stopped there was no way out i im trapped i stammered its like a box a glass box were all trapped clay cried luke was still pounding frantically on the glass with his fists luke stop i cried shrilly that isnt helping he lowered his fists to his sides this is ridiculous he muttered theres got to be a way out maybe theres a trapdoor or something i suggested i began to search the mirrored floor it was too dark to see well the floor appeared solid to me i returned to the glass wall this isnt much fun i said glumly luke and clay nodded i could see they were both really frightened so was i but i decided i was two years older than them so i had to try to be the brave one i wasnt feeling very brave though uttering a worried sigh i leaned against the wall that separated luke and me and as i leaned the wall started to move i jumped back with a sharp cry the wall was sliding toward me closing in on me i took another step back glancing around frantically i saw that all the walls were sliding in luke i cried i turned to see him backing up too the walls clay called help me theyre sliding in on me too luke screamed each room must have its own glass walls all three of us were trapped with a desperate groan i threw myself against one of the walls and tried to push it back but i couldnt stop it the box was closing in growing smaller smaller were going to be crushed i cried do something please do something clay was screaming luke lowered his shoulder to the glass and struggled to stop it from moving but he wasnt strong enough the walls kept sliding in on him i backed up my hands raised like a shield closer closer the glass walls moved slowly silently i backed up until my back hit the wall behind me there was nowhere to go do something somebody do something clays terrified screams rang in my ears the glass its squeezing me luke shrieked lizzy i i cant move i shouted to him the panes of glass began to press in on me from all sides above and below too i suddenly pictured one of those crushed cars you know the cars that are crunched into a perfect square in those big compactor machines my entire body shuddered as i realized i was going to be crushed into a perfect square too ow i cried out as the glass pressed down on me somebody help i tried to scream but my voice came out a muffled yelp it was getting hard to breathe the glass panes moved in tighter tighter i gasped for air i tried to push with all my might against the glass but it was no use i was being crushed into a human square i couldnt hear luke or clay anymore i could only hear my gasping choked breaths i shut my eyes and felt the floor drop away and before i realized what was happening i was falling falling rapidly down i opened my eyes in time to see the glass walls roll above me as i slid down down down through an open chute and in a few seconds i was back outside i landed sitting up on the grass with a gentle thud luke and clay came sliding out beside me for a long moment we sat on the grass blinking in the bright sunlight staring at each other in disbelief were okay clay said uncertainly finally breaking the silence he slowly climbed to his feet his round face was bright red and his glasses were crooked and nearly falling off his nose were okay luke let out a laugh a gleeful laugh he stood up and began jumping up and down for joy i didnt exactly feel like jumping up and down i was still picturing the crushed car luke reached down grabbed both of my hands and pulled me to my feet what should we do next he demanded grinning huh next i cried are you for real that was really scary clay said his face still red i thought we were going to be scrunched flat it was awesome luke declared once again he was forgetting that a few seconds before hed been screaming in total panic it was way too scary clay murmured shaking his head clays right i agreed it was too scary to be fun one more second and dont you see thats the whole idea luke cried thats how they scare you here its so awesome they make you think that one more second and youre a goner but its all perfectly timed they want you to be terrified and then poof youre okay i guess youre right said clay doubtfully he pushed up his glasses then rubbed his chin were not really going to get hurt or anything luke continued this is an amusement park remember they want you to come back again and again so theyre not going to really hurt anybody maybe clay said but luke what if they mess up i asked him what if the machines get goofed up what if the timing gets off lets say the floor underneath us got stuck then what luke didnt reply he stared back at me thoughtfully what would have happened to us if the floor hadnt dropped away at the right moment i demanded luke shrugged they make sure everything works okay he answered finally i rolled my eyes yeah sure is it possible to really be scared to death clay asked me a solemn expression on his face i mean i know it happens in books and movies but does it happen in real life i dont know maybe i replied ill bet people could get scared to death in that house of mirrors clay continued seriously no way luke insisted listen to me this is just a place for fun scary fun he was watching something over my shoulder i turned to see one of the guys in a green horror costume walking by carrying a huge bouquet of black balloons luke hurried up beside the horror hey has anyone ever died here in this park luke asked the horror kept walking the black balloons bobbed above his head only once he told luke one person died here luke asked the horror shook his big green head no not what i meant what did you mean luke demanded a person can only die once here the horror said no one has ever died twice do you mean people have really died here i shouted but the horror walked quickly on the black balloons bouncing against each other floating darkly against the clear blue sky the horrors answer made me shiver it wasnt just his words it was the cold tone of his voice the way he made it sound like a warning he was joking right clay asked in a trembling voice he scratched his blond hair nervously yeah i guess i replied a family walked past us heading toward the house of mirrors they had two little boys with them both about five or six and both of them were crying ive seen so many crying kids in this park i commented theyre just wimps luke replied scaredycats lets go find another ride or something no i really think we should find mom and dad i told him yeah lets go find them clay said eagerly the poor kid i think he was really scared but he was trying his best not to let my brother see how frightened he was aw whats the hurry luke protested let them find us but theyre probably really worried i insisted i started walking toward the front gate dad will only make us leave luke grumbled but he followed anyway and clay gratefully came along keeping close to my side following the trail we passed by a rickety old wooden roller coaster it rose up as high as a fourstory building casting a wide dark shadow over the walk a sign in front read out of order do you dare to ride it anyway the gate was open there was no attendant hey lizzy want to ride it luke asked staring at the beatup old cars parked at the bottom of the tracks no way clay and i replied in unison we kept on walking the trail curved under thick trees and we were suddenly in the shade a sign read beware of tree snakes clay covered his head with his hands all three of us raised our eyes to the trees were there really snakes up there it was too dark to see anything the leaves were so thick no sunlight filtered through suddenly i heard a gentle hissing sound at first i thought it was just the rustle of the leaves but then the hissing grew louder until all of the trees seemed to be hissing down at us run i cried the three of us started running along the trail ducking low our sneakers thudding hard on the pavement the hissing in the trees above us grew louder angrier i thought i saw a long dark snake slithering in the grass beside the trail but it might have just been a shadow we kept running even after the trees ended and we were in sunlight again the trail curved past a row of evillooking statues they were made of stone they were statues of grinning monsters eyes narrowed menacingly fangs lowered from their twisted mouths their arms were outstretched ready to grab anyone who came close i slowed to a trot my eyes on the ugly statues suddenly i heard low evil laughter it its coming from the statues clay exclaimed keep running did the statues move toward us did they raise their arms higher did they beckon to us to come closer im not sure with their evil laughter in my ears i lowered my head and turned on the speed all three of us were panting hard as we ran along the trail i didnt see any other people i didnt see anyone in a horror costume either we slowed as we came to another sign this one had an arrow pointing in the direction we were running it read front exit dont bother you will never escape i caught the worried expression on clays face as he read the sign its only a joke i told him the signs are supposed to be funny haha he said weakly he was panting hard struggling to catch his breath without warning luke jumped on clays shoulders hey clay how about a ride clay cried out angrily get off luke laughed and hung on clay dropped to his knees trying to throw luke off come on guys i pleaded luke stop being such a goof were trying to find mom and dad but now they were laughing and wrestling on the ground come on guys i shouted rolling my eyes lets go i tugged my brother to his feet clays glasses had flown off he stopped to pick them up from the grass then we continued on our way the path led past a rectangular flower garden filled with black flowers then it suddenly came to a stop in front of a large red barn the boys walked up to the open doorway of the barn i stayed back searching for a path that led around the barn i couldnt see one the path goes right through the barn to the other side luke called to me come on lizzy he motioned for me to join them i spotted a small sign painted to the right of the barns double doors it read bat barn hey are there bats in there i called feeling a cold shudder run down my back i like most animals but bats really give me the creeps luke stepped inside the barn clay hung back standing just outside the door i dont see any luke called out to me its kind of dark a strange odor invaded my nostrils it was strong and sour it came from the barn i didnt want to go in there come on lizzy luke called the path goes right out the other side dont be chicken you can run straight through i stepped up beside clay at the doorway and peered inside the barn it looks okay clay said quietly the sour odor was much stronger yuck i said making a face it really stinks luke stood inside the barn his eyes raised to the rafters i dont see anything up there he reported doors on the opposite wall were wide open it would only take ten seconds to run through the barn and out the other side i realized lets go i told clay he and i stepped into the barn the sour smell was overpowering i held my breath and pinched my fingers over my nose we started running to the doors on the opposite wall and they slammed shut with a gasp of surprise i turned back to the doors we had entered they slammed shut too hey i shouted angrily whats going on clay cried in a whisper we were in total darkness blacker than black the sour odor swept over me i started to feel sick and then i heard the rapid flutter of wings soft at first then louder closer i screamed as i felt something brush against the back of my neck go away i let out a low moan of horror and swung my hands wildly above my head the rapid fluttering retreated then returned bats clay cried in a terrified tiny voice i felt him grab my arm i cant see luke shouted its so dark i i hate bats i stammered i felt a cold whoosh of air as a bat flapped over my head i swung my hands wildly the flapping fluttering sounds were all around us as my eyes slowly adjusted to the darkness i began to see shadowy shapes shooting past back and forth faster and faster i felt one brush my shoulder oh help i cried clay started to shriek help us help us theyre zooming right at me luke wailed something bumped into my shoulder i screamed help us help us clay continued to plead at the top of his lungs his shouts were nearly drowned out by the flapping of wings i felt another bat brush against my shoulder covering my face i tried to make my way blindly to the door the sour odor choked me my terror made my legs shaky i could barely walk and then i felt a hard tug in my hair another tug loud flapping right on my head a shrill whistling hiss so close it could have been coming from me i screamed i screamed again it its caught in my hair i cried falling to my knees another shrill hiss another tug of my hair i swung my hands i hit it i felt a warm body felt the brush of fluttering wings i shoved it hard shoved it from my hair ohhh help i cried the flapping wings and shrill whistles surrounded me i could hear luke and clay shouting but they seemed far far away another one brushed my cheek another one bumped my shoulder the shadows darted back and forth the barn was alive with flying chittering bats ohh help help us please another one brushed my face i felt a rush of air beating wings on the top of my head help us help us but there was no one around to help i covered my eyes with one hand and thrashed out wildly with the other hand trying to beat the bats away choking and sobbing i could barely breathe i heard luke calling far far away he seemed to be behind a curtain of flapping chittering bats and then suddenly sunlight invaded the barn on my knees i lowered my hand from my eyes and saw that the barn door had slid open luke standing at the door his mouth open in shock turned back to clay and me i i touched the door and it opened he explained clays glasses were hanging off one ear his blond hair was totally messed up his eyes darted around the barn where are the bats he cried i raised my eyes to the rafters hey i cried out no bats no sign of any bats anywhere i climbed to my feet pulling my hair back with both hands lets get out of here i cried clay and i followed luke out of the barn the warm sunshine felt so good i was still itchy from the bats i rubbed my shoulders and the back of my neck i hate bats i really do i exclaimed with a shudder but there werent any bats luke said grinning at me it was all a fake huh it was not clay cried angrily those were bats i could hear them and feel them all special effects luke claimed it wasnt special effects when one got tangled in my hair i cried just thinking about it gave me cold shivers special effects luke repeated really excellent special effects i was almost scared too almost i cried i walked over grabbed him and pretended to wring his neck almost i heard you screaming your head off luke he pulled out of my grasp laughing i knew it wasnt real i was just screaming like that to scare you what a liar i really didnt believe my brother he was scared he was plenty scared i knew he was they were bats not special effects i insisted angrily then where did they go when the door opened luke demanded as soon as the door opened the bats all vanished lets stop talking about it clay pleaded lets find your parents okay yeah okay i agreed glaring at luke you really are nuts you know that i told him he stuck his tongue out at me i wanted to punch his lights out but i try to be a nonviolent person so i just gave him one hard punch on the shoulder he howled in protest youre stupid lizzy youre really stupid he muttered and youre afraid of pretend bats i ignored him and led the way down the path toward the front gate two people in horror costumes appeared on the path going the other way chatting enthusiastically is this the way to the front gate i called to them they ignored my question and walked right past us hey i called to them but they both kept jabbering away and didnt even seem to see or hear me the sun beamed down on us the air had become hot and still with no breeze at all i wiped sweat off my forehead with one hand i could still smell the sour aroma of the bat barn the odor was on my hands on my clothes i saw four teenagers in bathing suits two boys and two girls hurrying over the grass toward a large brown pond a sign came into view near the shore it read alligator pond feel free to swim here luke laughed are those guys crazy we stopped to watch them step into the water do you think there are really alligators in there clay asked biting his lower lip i shrugged who knows i dont know what to think about this park we continued along the path a few minutes later i recognized the mountainshaped structure of the doom slide the wide circular plaza came into view it was nearly deserted even the icecreamselling horror had vanished from his cart where do you suppose mom and dad are i asked theyve probably been looking for us for hours and now theyre really mad luke said frowning where are they clay cried he was starting to sound really stressed out weve got to find them is that them luke asked he was pointing to a man and a woman in the shade of a large stone fountain i shielded my eyes from the sun with one hand the woman was tall with dark hair the man was short and blond yes thats them i cried happily i started running to the fountain calling to them mom dad the boys came racing after me mom dad hey i shouted happily they both turned around surprised expressions on their faces oh i cried out when i saw it wasnt them i stopped short and luke bumped right into me sorry i told the confused couple we thought you were someone else the three of us hurried across the plaza i could hear the wail of wolf howls from the werewolf village the icecream cart stood lonely and deserted near the entrance to the doom slide where are they clay asked whining im starting to get hungry yeah its way past lunchtime i agreed they could be anywhere luke said unhappily kicking a pebble across the pavement they could be anywhere in this giant park i sighed lets look for them in the shade the sun is really getting hot we headed toward the shade of the doom slide building suddenly two greencostumed horrors came into view their big yellow eyes bulged in front of their heads without thinking i went running up to them have you seen our parents i asked breathlessly they stared at me in surprise your parents one of them repeated yeah i nodded my mom has black hair my dad is kind of short and he has blond hair hmmmm the two horrors glanced at each other mom was wearing a bright yellow sundress i told them and dad had a chicago cubs cap on his head luke added oh yeah right one of the horrors a woman replied you saw them i asked eagerly she nodded yeah i remember them they left they left about half an hour ago huh i gaped at her in disbelief they asked me to give you a message the horror said message what message i asked goodbye the horror replied youre wrong i cried they wouldnt leave about half an hour ago the horror repeated she shrugged her shoulders under the bulky monster costume i was at the gate when they left but but i sputtered the two horrors turned and began walking toward a small white shed at the edge of the plaza hey wait i called chasing after them you made a mistake our parents wouldnt leave without us they disappeared into the shed the door slammed behind them i turned back to luke and clay they stared at me blankly she was wrong i told them mom and dad are still here i know it then why did she say clay started but his voice broke i could see that he was very worried and upset beads of sweat ran down his pink forehead luke tried to make a joke i guess that means we have the whole park to ourselves he exclaimed forcing a smile very funny i replied sarcastically we also have no money and were about three hundred miles from home we could call somebody luke suggested no phones clay muttered he lowered his head shoved his hands into the pockets of his shorts and turned away from us oh right luke remembered they told dad there are no phones in the park thats crazy i said heatedly theyre liars the horrors are all liars i guess thats their job luke said telling us lies to scare us to death thats why they call it horrorland they should call it dumbland clay muttered bitterly but its so cool luke protested i love being scared out of my wits dont you he gave clay a hard shove no clay replied softly he made no attempt to shove luke back well she was lying about mom and dad i insisted gazing at the white shed she was just trying to scare us mom and dad are still here we just have to find them come on lets go luke urged i hope we find them soon im getting really hungry we wandered through the park for what seemed like hours we searched through dark mysterious woods and strange monster villages we passed through a carnival area with dozens of scarylooking rides on the other side of a vampire village we passed a building marked monster zoo it was closed but we could hear the most terrifying grunts howls and moans coming from inside a long yellow building had a sign outside that proclaimed guillotine museum please hold on to your head luke wanted to go inside but clay and i talked him out of it horrorland was surprisingly empty we passed several horrors scurrying along the paths in their bright green costumes and we saw a few families wandering around always with crying kids the rides in the carnival area were all running empty all of the food stands and restaurants were empty too we walked clear across to the other end of the park i was feeling more and more worried why hadnt we run into mom and dad surely we should have seen them by now clay had become very quiet i could tell he was really scared even luke trudged along with his shoulders slumped and his head down by the time we found ourselves back at the alligator pond i was feeling pretty bad i crossed the grassy shore and walked up to the edge of the brown water what do you think happened to those teenagers who went swimming here luke asked staring across the pond think the alligators ate them maybe i replied i wasnt really listening to him i was thinking about mom and dad hey look clay cried pointing to the water i saw two long greenishbrown logs floating toward us on top of the water it took me a while to realize that the logs were alligators big ones clay declared in a hushed whisper better step back i warned them all three of us were standing on the waters edge the alligators floated silently just below the surface of the still water hardly creating a ripple mom and dad didnt leave without us i repeated for the thousandth time but we searched everywhere luke said quietly they didnt leave without us i said they would never leave without us so i hesitated i was thinking hard and my thoughts were all frightening so clay asked eagerly so if theyre not in the park i continued it means something happened to them something bad happened to them clay gasped luke narrowed his blue eyes at me what do you mean lizzy he asked i mean maybe this place really is evil i said and maybe the horrors or somebody did something bad to mom and dad i stared down at the brown alligator backs gliding so smoothly so effortlessly toward us thats crazy luke muttered i knew it was crazy but i had no other explanation i have such a bad feeling about this park i told them a real bad feeling and as i said that i felt strong hands grab me from behind and push me into the alligator pond i screamed then i realized i wasnt being tossed into the water the hands were holding on to my shoulders i spun around dad i cried lizzy he exclaimed still holding on to me where have you guys been weve searched this entire park twelve times mom declared she was standing behind us on the grass hands pressed tensely on her waist we were looking for you i cried they told us you left luke said we were kind of scared clay added we all started talking at once i was so happy to see them and i could see that luke and clay were really happy too i had imagined all sorts of terrible things happening to mom and dad it wasnt like me to let my imagination run away like that but horrorland was such a scary place it was impossible not to have scary thoughts here i want to go home i said did you find a phone clay asked did you find a car dad shook his head no no phones the guy in the monster costume didnt lie there are no phones in the park but the horrors were very nice to us mom broke in they told us not to worry about a thing they said to just come to the ticket booth when we were ready to leave dad reported mom ran a hand tenderly through lukes hair did you go on any rides or anything we did a lot of scary stuff luke told her very scary clay added im really hungry luke said dad glanced at his watch its way past lunchtime i think were all hungry the restaurants and foodstands are all on the other side of the park mom said can we just eat lunch and then leave i asked eagerly i still had a bad feeling about the place i wanted to get away from horrorland far away your mom and i have spent all our time searching for you dad said wiping sweat off his sunburnt forehead with one hand we havent had any fun at all we should all at least go on one ride together before we leave mom said i just want to go i urged i really do lizzy thats not like you mom scolded shes scared luke told them shes a chicken maybe theres a ride that will take us to the front of the park dad suggested we could all take it then have some lunch and leave that sounds good mom said she stared at me okay with you i guess i told her sighing its just that the rides here are all too scary they arent any fun luke laughed theyre too scary for lizzy but not for clay and me he said right clay i was a little scared in the bat barn clay confessed we headed away from the alligator pond across the grassy shore to the paved walkway a couple of costumed horrors walked past chattering in low voices a girls highpitched shrieks of terror floated in the air from somewhere in the distance the same frightening cry repeated over and over wolf howls rose up in front of us and from a speaker hidden somewhere in the trees i heard evil laughter a hideous cackle that repeated over and over its like being in a horror movie mom commented very clever dad added walking with a hand on my shoulder its strange that we never heard of this park they should put some ads on tv mom said then theyd get more people to come here we passed by a tall narrow green building with a sign in front that read free fall the only bungee jump without a cord want to try that dad asked squeezing my shoulder and grinning at me i dont think so i quickly replied luke was way ahead of us he turned around and walked backwards waiting for us to catch up mom and dad should try the doom slide he said grinning its awesome had he really forgotten how terrified he was i dont think theyd like it i said quietly maybe we could find something thats just a little scary clay suggested dad laughed are you having a good time clay clay hesitated a little he replied finally im having a great time luke declared the path curved along a narrow brown river millions of tiny white insects flitted over the surface of the water catching the bright sunlight they looked like little sparkling diamonds a small brown boathouse came into view behind it i could see slender canoes bobbing beneath a wooden dock a sign beside the boathouse read coffin cruise a relaxing float to the grave this might be fun mom said her eyes on the small boats i think the river flows toward the front of the park dad said lets take it luke cheered and went running to the dock i lingered behind the others when i finally stepped out onto the dock it took me a while to realize that the objects bobbing in the brown water werent canoes they were coffins they were made of black polished wood the lids were pulled back revealing red satin interiors each coffin was big enough for one person i felt a cold chill run down my back were really going to climb into coffins i asked they look comfy mom said smiling at me the water is flat and gentle lizzy it wont be a scary ride me first luke cried running to the end of the wooden dock two costumed horrors appeared to help us into the coffins lie back enjoy the ride one of them said it will be your last the other horror added with a low chuckle when we were all inside coffins the horrors untied them and gave us a hard push away from the dock here i am i thought lying in my coffin here we all are my entire family on our backs in our coffins the coffin floated gently bobbing in the water i stared up at the bright blue sky trees shimmered on both banks as i floated past it was so pretty so relaxing why did i think something terrible was about to happen lying on my back i couldnt see the others over the coffin sides but i could hear the splash of their coffins around mine this is nice mom said very relaxing its boring luke declared from up ahead of me wheres the scary part its just a nice ride in a coffin dad said do you think were really floating or do you think the coffin is on some kind of track i could float like this for hours mom said the rides here are pretty long clay told her is that a hawk up in the sky dad asked can everyone see it shielding my eyes from the sun with one hand i searched the sky directly above a dark shadow hovered high in the sky a little bigger than a dot its not a hawk ill bet its a vulture luke declared it sees the coffins and its waiting to eat our flesh he laughed luke where do you get these hideous ideas mom demanded maybe luke should live in horrorland dad exclaimed we could get him one of those green monster costumes and hed fit right in perfectly he doesnt need a costume i joked i was starting to feel a little better the ride was gentle and relaxing and i figured nothing terrible could happen with my whole family around i settled back on the coffin bottom my hands resting at my sides and stared up dreamily at the bird circling high in the clear sky the coffin bobbed gently making soft splashing sounds so pleasant so quiet and then before i could utter a sound the coffin lid slammed shut over me and i was trapped in total darkness hey i shouted my voice was muffled by the heavy lid over me i could heard the dull thud of the other coffin lids slamming shut hey let me out i pushed against the lid with both hands but it wouldnt budge i took a deep breath and tried again this time i pushed with my hands and my feet the heavy lid still didnt move my heart was pounding so hard i thought my chest would explode the air inside the closed coffin was already getting hot and stuffy open up open up i screamed i tried pushing the lid again i could hear clays muffled cries in the coffin next to mine the poor guy was screaming his head off i let out a loud groan as i pushed up with all my strength the lid wouldnt give an inch calm down lizzy calm down i instructed myself its just a stupid ride the coffin lid will open any second breathing hard i waited i counted to ten i counted to ten again the lid didnt snap open i tried shutting my eyes and counting to fifty when i reach fifty i told myself ill open my eyes and the lid will be open twentytwo twentythree twentyfour i counted out loud my voice sounded tiny and choked it was getting hard to breathe the air began to feel really stale i stopped counting at twentyfive and opened my eyes the lid hadnt popped open its so hot in here i thought the sun is beating down on the lid theres no air and im going to fry i tried to scream but no sound came out i gasped for air outside i could hear muffled shouts and cries was that my mother screaming like that its just a ride i said out loud just a stupid ride the lid is going to pop now but it didnt the air was so hot so hot and stale why didnt the lid open why i tried to force back my panic but i couldnt my entire body was shaking and shivering i felt cold perspiration drip down my forehead something has gone wrong i cried out loud the lid is supposed to open but it doesnt frantically i pushed up with both hands my arms ached from pushing so hard but the lid didnt move the coffin bobbed and rocked in the water i lowered my hands in defeat i sucked in a mouthful of the hot stale air my chest was heaving my body trembled and then i felt my legs start to itch a tingly feeling down near my ankles moving up my legs an itchy crawly feeling something was crawling slowly up my legs something small and prickly ohh i let out a low terrified groan spiders i tried to scratch my legs but my arms werent long enough unable to move or bend in the cramped coffin i couldnt reach down to them the tingling moved higher i wanted to scream but i started to cough and then the coffin lid popped open bright sunlight made me shut my eyes oh i pulled myself up to a sitting position blinking against the light i saw the others already scrambling up out of their coffins i scratched my legs furiously to my surprise there were no spiders no bugs of any kind the coffin had pulled up to a small dock i braced both hands against the sides of the coffin and heaved myself to my feet lets get out of here i heard clay cry that was horrible my mom shrieked luke didnt say anything his face was pale and his black hair was matted to his forehead with sweat they really went too far dad said angrily im going to complain lets just go mom told him we all scrambled onto the dock i helped pull clay up then i took several deep breaths of fresh air dad ran off the dock toward the open plaza and the rest of us hurried after him to the ticket booth he called back to us right up there he pointed the coffin ride had taken us to the front of the park i could see the front gate and the row of green ticket booths to the right that ride was really gross clay said shaking his head my legs got all itchy i thought it was ants luke declared i thought it was spiders i told him i wonder how they did that luke said thoughtfully i dont care i replied i just want to get out of here i hate this place so do i clay agreed they just go too far mom said breathlessly jogging to keep up with us as we followed dad it isnt any fun when a ride is that scary i really had trouble breathing so did i i told her hey how do we get home luke suddenly demanded staring at mom our car blew up i think those people in the monster costumes will lend us a car mom replied they told your father just to come to the ticket booth can we stop and get pizza luke asked lets get out of this place and then worry about lunch mom told him the main plaza was totally empty not another living person we followed dad to the first ticket booth he turned back to us making a disappointed face closed he said a metal grate had been pulled over the window dad was breathing hard from running all the way he pushed his blond hair off his sweaty forehead with both hands over here he said we followed him to the next ticket booth also closed then the next closed it didnt take us long to discover that all of the ticket booths were closed weird luke said shaking his head dont they expect any more visitors today mom asked dad how can they just close up like that dad shrugged well have to ask someone his eyes searched the empty grounds i turned and checked out the plaza along with him still no one in sight no visitors no horrors lets try over there dad said he started walking to a low green building that stood beyond the ticket booths it looked like some kind of office it was closed too dad tried the door it was locked dad scratched his head whats going on here whered everyone disappear to he demanded mom took his arm its very strange she said softly i glanced at luke and clay they were standing tensely side by side on the walk in front of the office neither of them spoke are you sure these are the right ticket booths i asked yes dad replied wearily this is the front entrance so where can everyone be mom asked chewing her lower lip maybe we can find someone in the parking lot i suggested you know a parking attendant or something theyll be able to tell us how to get a car to go home good idea lizzy dad said he patted the top of my head the way he used to when i was a little girl i waited for luke to make fun of me but he didnt say a word i guess he was too worried and upset come on i urged i turned and ran past the empty ticket booths the tall metal front gate to horrorland stood just beyond the booths i stopped for a second to read a sign on the side of one of the ticket booths it said no exit no one leaves horrorland alive haha i said sarcastically these signs are a riot arent they i jogged the rest of the way and reached the gate first i pulled it and it wouldnt open so i tried pushing it it didnt move then i saw the heavy chain and the large steel padlock on the gate swallowing hard i turned back to the others were locked in i told them what dad stared at me his face twisted in confusion i dont think he believed me were locked in i repeated i lifted the heavy metal padlock with both hands and then let it fall back with a loud clang against the bars of the gate but thats impossible mom cried raising her hands to her cheeks they cant lock people inside an amusement park maybe its another joke luke suggested everything in this place turns out to be a joke maybe this is one too i lifted the heavy padlock again it doesnt look like a joke luke i said unhappily then there must be another gate where they want us to exit mom suggested maybe dad said doubtfully maybe theres a side exit but i havent seen one what are we going to do clay asked whining his face was red and he was breathing hard where is everyone luke demanded whining too theyve got to let us leave theyve got to lets try to stay calm dad said putting a hand on lukes shoulder theres no reason to panic this is a strange place but were not in any danger hes right mom broke in theres no reason to be afraid well be out of here and on our way home in no time she forced a smile as soon as we get out ill buy you guys pizzas and big cold drinks dad promised and well all have a good laugh about our terrifying adventures today in horrorland but how do we get out luke demanded shrilly well dad rubbed his chin do you think we could climb the fence i asked we all raised our eyes to the top of the iron fence it was way over our heads it must have been about twenty feet tall i cant climb that clay cried id fall its too high mom said quickly bad idea i murmured a large white cloud drifted over the sun our shadows grew longer over the pavement the air quickly grew cooler i felt a chill run down my back theres got to be a way out of this stupid park i cried angrily i hoisted up the padlock and slammed it against the bars of the gate hold on lizzy dad said soothingly we just have to find one of those costumed park workers theyll tell us how to get out uh dad i turned and saw luke grab dads arm here they come we all uttered astonished cries as we saw the horrors crossing the plaza dozens of them they moved quickly with a steady rhythm silently a few seconds before the plaza had been empty now it was filled with greencostumed horrors marching toward us spreading out preparing to surround us i could feel the panic rise up from my stomach my knees began to shake i stared in horror at them as they drew closer closer i couldnt speak i couldnt move what are they going to do clay cried his features twisted in terror he slipped behind dad what are they going to do to us he cried we huddled together as the horrors marched silently toward us the only sound was the soft thud of their monster feet on the pavement and their long purple tails dragging on the ground there are hundreds of them mom murmured she grabbed dads arm with one hand she slipped her other arm around my shoulders and pulled me closer we had our backs against the iron fence we stared helplessly at the grinning green faces the bulging yellow eyes which appeared to be laughing cruelly at us finally they stopped a few feet in front of us the plaza was still and silent terrifyingly silent the sun was still hidden behind the big cloud two large black birds swooped low in the gray sky we stared at the horrors and they stared back at us i swallowed hard leaning against my mother i could feel her entire body trembling i took a deep breath and then cried out what do you want the sound of my own voice startled me one of the horrors a young woman stepped forward frightened i tried to back up but my back was already pressed against the fence what do you want i repeated in a trembling voice the costumed horror stared at us one by one i want to thank you she said in a cheery voice huh i uttered im the horrorland mc we all want to thank you for being our guests today she flashed us a warm smile you mean we can go luke demanded halfhidden behind my dad of course the horror said grinning warmly but first we all want to thank you for appearing on horrorland hidden camera the dozens of horrors behind her broke into applause and loud cheers huh you mean this is some kind of show dad demanded frowning see the cameras the mc asked she gestured up to two tall poles in the plaza raising my eyes to the top i saw two tv cameras you mean we were on tv luke cried since the moment you arrived the mc replied our hidden cameras followed you everywhere from the hilarious scene where we blew up your car our cameras were with you and i know our home audience loved the terrified expressions on your faces and all of your horrified screams as you took our horrorland rides now wait a minute dad said angrily he took a step forward his hands were balled into tense fists at his sides you say this is a tv show how come ive never seen it were seen every weekend on the monster channel the horror replied oh dad replied quickly lowering his eyes we dont have cable you should get it the horror told him youre missing a lot of great scary shows on the monster channel the horrors all clapped and cheered well youve been very good sports the mc continued her yellow eyes bouncing in front of her head as she talked weve enjoyed having you and to show our appreciation we have a brandnew car waiting for you in the parking lot more cheers and applause from the horrors a new car thats excellent luke exclaimed does that mean we can leave clay asked timidly the horror nodded yes its time for you to leave the real exit is right over there through that doorway she pointed to a tall green building near the end of the fence i saw a yellow door on the side take the yellow door the horror instructed and thanks again for appearing on horrorland hidden camera as all the horrors clapped their big green hands we stepped away from the fence and hurried toward the exit i cant believe we were on tv the whole time mom declared and were getting a new car luke exclaimed happily he started jumping up and down then he leaped onto clays back nearly knocking him over i laughed it was good to see the old luke back with us weve got to get cable luke told dad i want to see the monster channel its got to be awesome well have to order it so we can see ourselves mom said i reached the yellow door first and pulled it open i stepped into an enormous room with white walls that shone under the bright white lights from the ceiling is this the exit i cried as soon as we were all inside the door slammed shut with a bang that made my heart skip then all the lights went out welcome to the horrorland challenge boomed a deep frightening voice over a loudspeaker huh i gazed blindly around trying to see something anything in the total darkness you have one minute to go through the monster obstacle course the voice thundered please keep in mind that the games are now over this is real youre playing for your life weve been tricked i heard dad cry angrily and then he shouted at the top of his lungs lets get out of here run the deep voice boomed over the loudspeaker you have fiftysix seconds dad started to shout again but we stopped when a dim light came up and a disgusting fourarmed creature stepped toward us ohhh i cried out without even realizing it the size of a gorilla the monster had huge green eyes surrounded by thick red fur over its face saliva drooled from its mouth and as it opened its jaws wider two rows of long fangs slid over its thin purple lips dont just stand there run this is an obstacle course the voice boomed impatiently you have fifty seconds to live at least make a good race of it the monster uttered a low growl and lumbered toward us in the dim light its jaws were opened wide as if preparing to bite its four enormous clawed hands swiped at the air in front of it i was too stunned to move too frightened to run but suddenly i felt a hand grab mine and tug me hard it was dad i realized trying to pull me to safety i heard the boys screaming in fear i felt mom brush beside me as we started to stumble forward run run the deep voice urged over the shrieks of the two boys i couldnt see where i was running the light was so dim so shadowy i saw only a blur now a blur of running feet of moving shadows the monster let out a deafening roar i covered my ears and kept running its four clawed hands swiped at dad missed we hurtled past it only to face two giant birds at least ten feet tall they looked like cranes they squawked and flapped their enormous wings it sounded like canvas tents flapping in a strong wind ohh help was that me shrieking like that was i really being wrapped in their hot flapping wings smothered choked no please how did i break away was i being chased now by six growling piglike creatures with sharp pointed teeth curling from their twisted mouths the screams and terrified shrieks of my family rose over the beating birds wings the monstrous growls and grunts i heard dad cry out and in the dim light i saw him struggling to free himself from the fourarmed creature no i screamed as i felt something warm wrap around my ankle a furcovered snake i screamed again and kicked wildly sending it flying into the darkness but before i could move away another furry snake spun around my leg tightening quickly i bent and pulled at it as it hissed in protest i tossed it aside run run the voice on the loudspeaker boomed twenty seconds to live more monsters loomed in front of us disgusting yellow lizardlike creatures with dark flicking tongues like bullwhips a hopping furry ball that roared as it hopped sharp teeth poking out of three mouths hissing snakes enormous buzzing insects with glowing red eyes more grunting pig monsters then a giant bearlike creature came at us on two legs it tossed its dark round head back and laughed like a hyena as its paws punched the air help me i heard luke shriek and then i saw him disappear wrapped inside the beating wings of one of the giant birds the bird cawed in triumph as its wings tightened around my brother ten seconds the voice boomed no i cried i lunged toward the bird grasped the beating wing and pulled it open luke slid out and we both began to run monsters growled and flapped and grunted and roared are we going to make it luke asked in a tiny voice i didnt have a chance to answer two powerful paws grabbed me around the waist hoisted me high in the air then slammed me to the floor i landed hard on my stomach my forehead hit the floor dizzy and hurt i looked up in time to see an enormous elephantlike creature about to flatten me with its huge furry back foot im not going to make it i realized im not going to make it the enormous flat foot lowered over me slowly steadily the monster was taking its time it all seemed to be happening in slow motion i wanted to move i wanted to roll out from under it but the fall had taken my breath away i lay there gasping watching the monster foot coming down to crush me ohhh i couldnt catch my breath i couldnt squirm away i could feel the heat of the monster foot i could smell its putrid sweat the foot pressed down on my stomach i shut my eyes and waited for the pain the jarring blast of a buzzer made my eyes shoot open the buzz echoed through the vast room the monster raised its heavy foot from my body the floor shook under its weight as it began to lumber away am i alive i wondered or am i only dreaming that im still alive is that creature really leaving without crushing me the buzzer echoed in my ear then it abruptly stopped the loudspeaker crackled on times up a womans voice said the voice of the horrorland mc who had led us to this terrifying obstacle course time is up what a thrilling race she gushed i groaned and started to pull myself up in the dim light i saw that all of the monsters had vanished that was a tough battle the mc continued over the loudspeaker do we have any survivors yes we do the deep booming voice replied how many survivors do we have in there the woman asked three the booming voice replied three survivors out of five a cold chill ran down my body i opened my mouth in a silent cry of shock and leaped to my feet three out of five did that mean that two of us were dead my chest still ached my knees were trembling i squinted into the dim light searching desperately for the others halfway across the room i saw luke and clay they were huddled together walking as if in a daze toward the far wall hey i tried to call to them but my voice came out a choked whisper where were mom and dad were they both killed by the monsters three out of five three out of five nooooooooo i finally found my voice and let out a horrified wail that echoed off the walls excuse me a slight mistake the deep voice boomed make that five out of five survivors five out of five the horrorland mc exclaimed a new record weve never had a perfect score before lets give them a round of applause everyone i took a deep breath and held it trying to stop my trembling theyre okay i thought happily mom and dad are okay and then i saw them they had their arms around luke and clay and were making their way toward me were okay i cried rushing to them my arms outstretched were okay all five of us huddled in the center of the dark room hugging each other and sobbing dads arm was bleeding from a deep gash one of the monsters had clawed him aside from that we were shaken but not hurt now what luke asked in a trembling voice are they going to let us go they cant get away with this dad said angrily they cant do this to people and get away with it i dont care if it is tv those monsters were real i exclaimed with a shudder it wasnt a fake they were really trying to kill us how do we get out luke demanded will they let us out we all started chattering at once our voices high and frightened suddenly the ceiling lights flashed on flooding the room with bright light and the mcs voice broke through our frightened conversation lets bring our winners out with a round of applause she announced cheerfully we all cried out as the floor began to tilt beneath us i grabbed on to dad and we started to slide the floor tilted down like a sliding board and we slid out of the room and landed in the plaza outside still feeling dazed i jumped quickly to my feet as the horrorland mc hurried to greet us the big crowd of horrors behind her was clapping and cheering you cant do this to us i screeched i was so angry i didnt know what i was doing i just totally freaked i leaped at the woman grabbed the top of her mask and started to pull it off with both hands you cant do this you cant i shrieked let me see your face let me see who you really are using all of my strength i gave the mask a hard tug then i screamed and let go as i realized the truth she wasnt wearing a mask the monstrous green face was her face she wasnt wearing a monster costume none of the horrors were wearing costumes i realized i stepped back raising my hands in horror as if trying to shield myself you youre really monsters i stammered they nodded back at me pleased grins on their ugly faces their yellow eyes bobbed gleefully you youre all monsters i screamed but but you said this was a tv show i stammered to the horror mc her bulging yellow eyes gazed at me were happy to say it is the toprated show on the monster channel she said cheerily thanks to great contestants like you and your family the monster channel is watched by nearly two million monsters all over the world but but i stammered taking another step back people dont always take us seriously she continued people come to horrorland and think its all a big joke people laugh at the signs around the park they laugh at the rides and attractions but its all very serious to us all of it my father stepped up beside me shaking a fist angrily but you cant do this to innocent people he shouted you cant bring people into this park to torture them and and oh im sorry our time is up for this week the mc interrupted shaking her enormous green head im sad to say its time to say goodbye to our special guests for this week now wait dad shouted raising both hands for quiet the crowd of horrors silently pushed forward we had no choice but to start moving with them let me show you people the way we say goodbye on the horrorland hidden camera show the mc said dad tried to hold back to resist but several horrors bumped against him they were bumping all of us now pushing us toward what appeared to be a round purple pond just beyond the plaza we couldnt fight back there were too many of them we couldnt run they had us surrounded they drove us like sheepdogs herding cattle in a few seconds we were standing on the edge of the purple pond a foul smell rose up from the pond the purple liquid bubbled and gurgled making a sick sucking sound let us go luke cried shrilly we want to go home the horrorland mc ignored his frantic pleas and stepped to the edge of the gurgling pond saying goodbye is always sad she said so we try to have a little fun with our farewells just let us go luke insisted dad put a hand on his shoulder to try to comfort him we all stared at the mc as she raised a large rock in one hand and held it over the disgusting bubbling pond watch she instructed us with a smile she let the rock drop into the pond as soon as it touched the thick surface it was pulled down with a loud sucking sound see how easy it is to say goodbye the horror said turning to us now will you jump in or do you want to be pushed silently the horrors began moving in on us closer closer backing up clay tripped over my foot and nearly fell into the gurgling purple pit i grabbed him and held on to him until he regained his balance all five of us were standing on the edge of the pit the sour odor swept over me i felt sick the thick purple slime lapped up at my ankles as if reaching out to grab me mom dad i cried i didnt know what i expected them to do we were all helpless i knew we werent going to escape this time without realizing it we were all holding hands will you jump in or do you want to be pushed the mc repeated her question im real sorry dad murmured to us ignoring her im real sorry i brought you here i i didnt know his voice broke he lowered his eyes dad its not your fault i told him squeezing his hand and as i squeezed his hand i had an idea a wild idea a stupid idea a really crazy idea i knew i had to try it it was the only idea i had people laugh at everything in the park the horrorland mc had told us but its all very serious to us shed said all very serious very serious she stood right in front of me now waiting for us to jump to our deaths eager for us to get sucked down into the purple slime i knew this was my last chance i knew it was crazy but i knew i had to try it i stepped up to the mc reached out and pinched her arm as hard as i could her mouth opened wide and she let out a startled gasp she tried to pull her arm away but i held on and pinched harder the mad pincher strikes again i shouted remembering lukes annoying cry her yellow eyes rolled around crazily no she pleaded harder harder and then i was the one to cry out as her mouth opened wide and with a loud whoosh a rush of air escaped her lips i leaped back as the air rushed from her mouth she appeared to deflate just like a balloon i gaped in amazement as she folded helplessly to the ground an angry cry rose up from the crowd of horrors inflate her one of them yelled inflate her immediately they began moving in on us growling and grumbling menacingly pinch them i shouted to my family pinch them the no pinching signs that we thought were so stupid they were serious the horrors deflate if theyre pinched a horror stepped up arms outstretched to push me into the pond i pinched his arm hard and a few seconds later he deflated i heard the whoosh of air escaping to my right and saw that luke had deflated one too whoosh another one deflated and folded to the pavement thats all it took the plaza filled with frightened cries and gasps of horror the alarmed horrors turned and ran stampeded is a better word they scattered through the park screaming as they ran taking a long deep breath i happily watched them flee see i always come through in a pinch i said amazing myself by making a joke i dont think anyone else in my family heard me they were shouting for joy hugging each other jumping up and down lets get out of here i shouted i started running toward the front gate the others followed close behind the gate was open now i guess the horrors had opened it figuring the only place we were heading was to the bottom of the purple pond without looking back we ran out onto the empty parking lot and stopped no car i murmured in all the excitement i had forgotten that our car had been blown up i let out a weary sigh i felt as if i were deflating just like the horrors now what i asked staring across the enormous flat parking lot its too far to walk luke wailed how do we get out of here the buses mom cried pointing i turned my eyes to the row of purpleandgreen buses parked on the side of the lot they glowed under the bright afternoon sun yeah dad cried excitedly maybe we can start one up and get away from here we started jogging over the pavement to the buses cross your fingers dad called leading the way maybe they leave the keys in them its our only chance hurry luke shouted suddenly theyre coming my heart leaped in my chest i turned back toward the gate sure enough the horrors were pouring out of the park chasing after us give up you cannot escape one of them screamed no one ever escapes another horror shouted hurry luke cried hurry theyre going to catch us with the horrors close behind shouting and threatening us we ran full speed toward the row of buses my heart was pounding almost as loud as my sneakers against the pavement my throat ached and i had a sharp pain in my side but i kept running you cannot escape stop now give up the angry cries of the horrors sounded even closer but i didnt turn back to see if they were catching up the door to the first bus was open dad got there first and scrambled up the steps and inside mom stepped in followed by the two boys the engine coughed then started up with a roar as i pulled myself inside the bus door slid shut behind me dad the keys i choked out yes theyre here he cried happily hold on were getting away he lowered his foot on the gas pedal and the bus shot forward i stumbled down the aisle and fell into a seat behind luke and clay hurry theyre coming theyre coming luke and clay were screaming in unison i could hear the angry shouts of the horrors through the closed bus windows were okay dad cried leaning over the big steering wheel were okay were outta here yes i shouted happily yes we all started to cheer we kept cheering until we were out of the parking lot and back on the highway we laughed and celebrated all the way home the drive took hours and hours but we didnt care we were safe we had escaped it was night when dad pulled the bus up our driveway home sweet home i cried joyfully we all piled eagerly out of the bus i took a deep breath and stretched the air smelled so sweet and fresh a full moon made the front lawn shine then i saw him it was a horror and he was clinging to the back of our bus oh no i cried out what are you doing there dad demanded did you ride back there the whole way home luke asked in disbelief i shrank back as the horror let go of the bus and slid to the ground his yellow eyes studied us menacingly he moved toward us quickly clay and luke hid behind dad moms mouth dropped open in fright what do you want i cried he reached out his green hand here he said we forgot to give you your free passes for next year
