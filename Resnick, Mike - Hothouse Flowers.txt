i test the temperature it is degrees warm but not hot just right i spend the next hour puttering around checking medications adjusting the humidity cleaning one of the life stations then superintendent bailey stops by on his way out to dinner how are your charges doing he asks any problems today no sir evrythings fine i answer good he says we wouldnt want any problems especially not with the celebration coming up the celebration is the turn of the century although there is some debate about that because we are all preparing to celebrate the instant the clock hits midnight and ad begins but some spoilsport scientists have told the press that the new century really begins a year later when we enter not that my charges know the difference but im glad were celebrating it this year because it means that well decorate the place with bright colors and if we like it why well do it again in i have been married to felicia for years and i hardly ever regret it she was a little bit pudgy when we met and she has gotten pudgier over the years so that now she is honesttogoodness fat and there is simply no other word for it her hair which used to be brown is streaked with gray now and shes lost whatever physical grace she once had but she is a good life partner her taste in holos is similar to mine so we almost never fight about what to watch after dinner and of course we both love our work as we eat dinner the topic turns to our gardens as always im worried about rex she confides rex is begonia rex her hanging basket oh i say whats wrong with him she shakes her head in puzzlement i dont know perhaps ive been letting him get too much sun his leaves are yellowing and his roots could be in better shape have you spoken to one of the botonists no theyre totally absorbed in cloning that new species of aglaonema crispum still she shrugs they say its important the damned plants been around for centuries i say i cant see whats so important about it i told you they engineered an exciting mutation it actually glows in the dark as if its been dusted with phosphorescent silver paint its not going to put the energy company out of business i know but its important to them it seems unfair i say for the hundredth or maybe the thousandth time they get all the fame and money for creating a new species and you get paid the same old salary for keeping it alive i dont mind she replies i love my work i dont know what id do without my greenhouse i know i say soothingly i feel the same way so how is your rex today she asks its my turn to shrug about the same as usual suddenly i laugh whats so funny asks felicia you think your rex is getting too much sun i decided my rex wasnt getting enough so this afternoon i moved him closer to a window will it make a difference do you think she asks i sigh deeply does it ever i walk up to the major and smile at him how are we today i ask the major looks at me through unfocused eyes there is a little drool running out the side of his mouth and i wipe it off its a lovely morning i say its a pity you cant be outside to enjoy it i pause waiting for the reaction that never comes still i continue youve seen more than your share of them so missing a few wont hurt i check the screen at his life station find his birthdate and dope it out well ill be damned youve actually seen mornings of course hes been here for almost half of them to be exact if he ever did count them he stopped a long time ago i clean and sterilize his feeding tubes and his medication tubes and his breathing tubes examine him for bedsores wash him take his temperature and blood pressure and check to make sure his cholesterol hasnt gone above the level i elevate his withered body just long enough to change the bedding then gently lower him back down then its on to rex felicia has problems with her rex and i have problems with mine good morning rex i say he mumbles something incomprehensible at me i look down at him his right eye is bloodshot and tearing heavily rex what am i going to do with you i say you know youre not supposed to stare at the sun he doesnt really know it i doubt that he even knows his name is rex but cleansing his eye and medicating it is going to put me behind schedule and i have to blame someone rex doesnt mind being blamed he doesnt mind burning out his retina he doesnt even mind lying motionless for decades if there is anything he does mind nobodys found it yet i spill some medication on him while fixing his eye so i decide that rather than just change his diaper i might as well go all the way and give him a drychem bath i marvel as always at the sheer number of surgical scars that crisscross his torso the first new heart the second the new kidneys the new spleen the new left lung theres a tiny ancient scar on his lower belly which i think was from the removal of a burst appendix but i cant find any record of it on the computer and hes been past talking about it for almost a century then i move on to mr spinoza hes laying there mouth agape eyes open head at an awkward angle i can tell even before i reach him that hes not breathing my first inclination is to call emergency but i realize that his life station will have reported his condition already and sure enough just seconds later the resurrection team arrives and sets up a curtain around him and within ten minutes theyve got the old gentleman going again this is the fifth time mr spinoza has died this year all this dying has to be hard on his system and i worry that one of these days its going to be permanent so how was your major today asks felicia at dinner same as usual i say hows yours her major is the browallia speciosa majorus ditto she says old but hanging on she frowns we may not get any blossoms this year though the roots are a little ropey im sorry to hear it it happens she pauses how was the rest of your day we had some excitement i reply oh mr spinoza died again thats the fourth time isnt it she asks the fifth i correct her the resurrection team revived him the resuscitation team she corrects me you have your word for them i have mine i say mines better resurrection is what they do so youve only lost one this week says felicia if not changing the subject at least moving on a tangent away from it right mr lazlo he was years old she muses and then shrugs i guess he was entitled you mentioned that you lost one too i note my cymbidium thats an orchid right i say the one they nicknamed peter pan she nods silly name for an orchid i remark it stayed young forever or so it seemed she replies it had the most exquisite blooms im really going to miss it id had it for almost years she smiles sadly and a single tear begins to roll down her cheek i worked so hard over it sometimes i felt like its mother she looks at me that sounds ludicrous doesnt it not at all i say sincerely touched by her grief its all right she says then she stares at my face dont be so concerned it was just a flower its called empathy i answer and she lets it drop but i am troubled and by the oddest thought shouldnt i feel worse about losing a person than she feels about losing an orchid but i dont i dont know when it began probably with the first caveman who made a sling for a broken arm or forced water out of a drowned companions lungs but somewhere back in the dim and distant past man invented medicine it had its good centuries and its bad centuries but by the end of the last millennium it was curing so many diseases and extending so many lives that things got out of hand more than half the people who were alive in were still alive in and almost of the people who were alive in will be alive in medical science had doubled and then trebled mans life span immortality was within our grasp life everlasting beckoned we were so busy increasing the length of life that no one gave much thought to the quality of those extended lives and then we woke up one day to find that there were a lot more of them than there were of us his name is bernard goldmeier they carry him in on an airsled then transfer him to mr lazlos old life station after i clean the majors tubes and change his bedding and medicate rexs eye i call up mr goldmeiers medical history on the holoscreen at his life station this place stinks rasps a dry voice i jump startled then turn to see who spoke there is no one in the room except me and my charges who said that i demand i did replies mr goldmeier i look closely at him the skin hangs loose and brownspotted on his bald head his cheeks are covered by miscolored flesh and his nose has oxygen tubes inserted into it but his eyes sunken deep in his head are clear and he is staring at me you really spoke i exclaim you never heard an inmate speak before not that i remember which is another unhappy truth by age one out of every two people has some form of senile dementia by its four out of five by its out of mr goldmeier is years old the odds against his retaining anything close to normal mental capacities are better than to one i should add i say that the proper term is charge not patient and certainly not inmate a zombie by any other name i decide there is no sense arguing with him how do you feel i ask look at me he says disgustedly how would you feel if youre in any discomfort i begin i told you this place stinks it reeks of shit and urine some of our charges are incontinent i explain we have to show them understanding and compassion why he rasps what do they show us in exchange try to be a little more tolerant i say you try he snaps im busy i cant help but ask busy doing what hanging on to reality i smile is that so difficult why dont you ask some of your other inmates he sniffs the air and makes a face goddamnit another ones crapping all over himself what the hell am i doing here anyway im not a fucking vegetable yet i check all the notations on the screen youre here mr goldmeier i say not without some satisfaction at what im about to tell him because no other ward will have you youve offended every attendant and orderly in the entire complex where do i go when i offend you this is your last stop youre here for better or worse lucky me i turn back to the holoscreen and begin punching in the standard questions what are you doing now he demands he tries to boost himself up on a scrawny miscolored elbow to watch me but hes too weak checking to see if im to medicate you for any diseases i reply i havent been out of bed in years he rasps if i have a disease i got it from one of you goons i ignore his answer and continue staring at the screen you have a history of cancer big deal he says as quick as i get it you bastards cure it he pauses seventeen cancers you cut five out burned three out and drowned the other nine in your chemicals i keep reading the screen i see you still have your original heart i note with some surprise most hearts are replaced by the time the patient is years old the lungs and kidneys even sooner are you offering me yours he says sarcastically okay so hes an arrogant hostile bastard but hes also my only charge whos capable of speech so i force a smile and try again youre a lucky man i begin he glares at me you want to explain that youve retained your mental acuity very few manage that at your advanced age and you think thats lucky do you certainly then youre a fool said mr goldmeier i sigh im trying very hard to be your friend youre not making it easy his emaciated face contracts in a look of disgust why in hell should you want to be my friend i want to be friends with all my charges them he says contemptuously scanning the room youd probably get more action from a bunch of potted plants its not dissimilar from what felicia says on occasion look i say youre going to be here for a very long time so am i why dont we at least try to cultivate the illusion of civility thats a disgusting thought being civil i ask wondering what kind of creature they have delivered to my ward that too he says but i meant being here for a very long time he exhales deeply and i hear a rattling in his chest and make a mental note to tell the doctors about his congestion then he adds being anywhere for a very long time what makes you so bitter i ask ive seen terrible things things no man should ever have to see weve had our share i agree the war with brazil the meteor that hit mozambique the revolution in canada fool he snaps those were diversions diversions i repeat incredulously just what hellholes have you been to the worst he answers ive been to places where men begged for death and slowly went mad when it didnt come i dont remember reading or hearing about anything like that i say where was this he stares unblinking at me for a long moment before he answers right here in the wards felicia looks up from her plate his names bernard goldmeier she says thats right i dont have any bernards she says its not the kind of name they give to flowers it doesnt matter suddenly her face brightens i do have a gold flower though a mesembryanthemum criniflorum i can call it goldie or even goldmeier its not important but it is she insists for years its been how we compare our days she smiles it makes me feel closer to you caring for flowers with the same names fine i say call it whatever you want you seem she searches for the word upset he troubles me oh why i love my work i begin i know you do and its meaningful work i continue trying to keep the resentment from my voice maybe im not a doctor but i stand guard over them and hold death at bay thats important isnt it of course it is she says soothingly he belittles it that doesnt mean a thing says felicia reaching across the table and taking my hand you know how they get when theyre that old yes i know how they get but hes not like them he sounds i dont know normal like me thats the upsetting part he doesnt seem irrational i say aloud just bitter enough bitterness will make anyone irrational i know i say but but what well its going to sound juvenile and selfish youre the least selfish man i know says felicia tell me whats bothering you its just that well i always thought that if my charges could speak to me theyd tell me how grateful they were how much my efforts meant to them i pause and think about it does that make me selfish certainly not she replies i think they ought to be grateful she pats my hand a lot of people in that place are just earning salaries youre there because you care anyway here ive finally got someone who could thank me could tell me that im appreciated and instead hes furious because im going to do everything within my power to keep him alive she coos and purrs and making soothing noises but she doesnt actually say anything and finally i change the subject and ask her about her garden a moment later she is rapturously describing the new buds on the aphelandra squarrosa and telling me that she thinks she will have to divide the scilla sibirica and i listen gratefully and do not think about mr goldmeier lying motionless in his bed and cursing the darkness until i arrive at work in the morning are you feeling any better today i ask as i approach mr goldmeiers life station no im not feeling better today he says nastily gods fresh out of miracles are you at least adjusting to your new surroundings hell no you will i damned well better not i stare at him youre not leaving here i know then you might as well get used to the place never i dont understand you at all i say thats because youre a fool he snaps look at me i have no money and no family i cant feed myself or even sit up thats no reason to be so hostile i say placatingly i am about to tell him that his condition is no different from most of my charges but he speaks first all i have left is my rage i wont let you take it away its all that separates me from the vegetables here i look at him and shake my head sadly i dont know what made you like this years made me like this he says i continue staring at him at the atrophied legs that will never walk again at the shriveled arms and skeletal fingers at the deathmask skull with its burning sunken eyes and i think maybe just maybe senility is natures way of making life in such a body tolerable maybe youre not as lucky as i thought the majors chin is wet with drool and i walk over to him and wipe it off there i say clean as a whistle okay i think staring down at him youre not grateful but at least you dont hate me for doing what you can no longer do for yourself why cant they all be like you why dont you ask for a transfer to another ward if hes bothering you that much asks felicia what would i say i reply that this old man who cant even roll over without help is driving me away just tell them you want a change i shake my head my work is important to me my charges are inportant to me i cant turn my back on them just because he makes my life miserable maybe you should sit down and figure out why he upsets you he makes me think uncomfortable thoughts what kind of uncomfortable thoughts i dont want to talk about it i reply but what i really mean is i dont want to think about it i just wish i could get my brain to listen to me superintendent bailey enters the ward and approaches me im going to need you to work a little overtime today he informs me oh i reply whats the problem there must be some virus going around he says a third of the staff has called in sick all right ill just have to let felicia know ill be late for dinner where do you want me to go when im through here ward isnt that a womans ward i ask yes id rather have a different assignment sir and id rather have a full staff he snaps were both doomed to be disappointed today he turns and leaves the ward what have you got against women croaks mr goldmeier i had thought he was asleep but hes been lying there motionless with his eyes wide open nothing i answer i just dont think i should bathe them why the hell not its a matter of respecting their dignity their dignity he snorts derisively their modesty if you prefer dignity modesty what the fuck are you talking about theyre human beings i answer with dignity of my own not any more he replies contemptuously theyre a bunch of vegetables that dont give a damn who bathes them he closes his eyes youre a blind sentimental fool i hate it when he says things like that because i want to explain that i am not a blind sentimental fool but that requires me to prove he is wrong and i cant ive tried all human beings have modesty and dignity if they havent any then theyre not human beings any more and if theyre not human beings why are we keeping them alive therefore they must have modesty and dignity then i think of those shriveled bodies and atrophied limbs and uncomprehending eyes and i start getting another migraine two days have passed and i am not eating or sleeping any better than mr goldmeier what did he say this time says felicia wearily staring across the dining room table at me im not sure i answer he kept talking about youth in asia so finally i looked them up in the encyclopedia all it says is that there are a lot of them and theyre starving i pause frowning but as far as i can tell hes never been to asia i dont know why he kept talking about them who knows says felicia with a shrug hes an old man they dont always make sense he makes too goddamned much sense i mutter bitterly could you have misunderstood the words she asks old men mumble a lot i doubt it i understand everything else he says so why not this lets find out for sure she says activating the dining room computer it glows with life computer find synonyms for the term youth in asia the computer begins rattling them off young people in asia adolescents in asia children in asia teenagers in stop commands felicia synonym was the wrong term computer are there any homonyms for the term youth in asia a homonym is an exact match answers the computer and there is no exact match are there any close approximations one the word euthanasia ah says felicia triumphantly and what does it mean it is an archaic word no longer in use i can find no definition of it in my memory bank euthanasia says mr goldmeier articulating each syllable how the hell can the dictionaries and encyclopedias not list it any longer they list it i explain they just dont define it figures he says disgustedly as i wait patiently for him to tell me what the word means he changes the subject how long have you worked here almost fourteen years seen a lot of patients come and go of course i have where do they go when they leave here they dont except when theyre transferred to another ward so they come to this place and then they die you make it sound like it happens overnight i reply weve kept some of them alive for more than a century i add proudly a lot of them in fact he stares at me i recognize that particular stare it means im not going to like what he says next you could save a lot of time and effort by killing them right away that would be contrary to civil and moral law i reply angrily its our job to keep every patient alive have you ever asked them if they want to be kept alive no one wants to die right its against all civil and moral law he coughs and tries to clear his lungs well thats why you wont find it in the dictionary find what i ask confused euthanasia he says i dont understand you thats what we were talking about isnt it he says it means mercy killing mercy killing youve heard both words before figure it out i am still wondering why anyone would think it was merciful to kill another human being when my shift ends and i go home why would someone want to die i ask felicia she rolls her eyes goldmeier again yes somehow im not surprised she says in annoyed tones she shakes her head sadly i dont know where that man gets his ideas no one wants to die she paused look at it logically if someones in pain he can go on medication if hes lost a limb he can get a prosthesis if hes too feeble even to feed himself well thats what trained people like you are there for what if hes just tired of living you know better than that replied felicia with unshakeable certainty every living organism fights to stay alive thats the first law of nature yes i suppose so i agree hes a nasty old man did he say anything else no not really i toy with my food somehow my appetite has vanished how were things at the greenhouse they finally got exactly the shade of phosphorescent silver they want for the aglaonema crispum she says i think theyre going to call it the silver charm cute name yes i rather like it they tell me there was once a famous racehorse centuries ago with that name she pauses of course it means some extra work for me potting them theyre all potted no the problem is making room for them i think well have to get rid of the browallia speciosa majorus but those are your majors i protest i know how you love them i do she admits they have exquisite blossoms but theyve got some kind of exotic root rot disease she sighs deeply i saw some miscoloration some slimy residue but i didnt identify it in time its my fault theyre dying why not bring them home i suggest if you want majors ill bring some young healthy ones that will flower in the spring but im just going to dump the old ones in the garbage the disease won im grasping for something but im not quite sure what didnt you just tell me that every living thing fights to stay alive the majors dont want to die said felicia theyre infected so im taking that decision out of their hands before the disease can spread to other plants but if dont go getting philosophical with me she says theyre only flowers its not as if they feel any pain later that night i find myself wondering when was the last time rex or the major or mr spinoza or any of the others felt any pain years more then i realize that thats what mr goldmeier wants me to think he sees the weak and he wants them dead but theyre not his targets at all they never were i finally know who he is trying to infect i show up early for work and enter my ward everyone is sleeping i look at my charges and a warm glow comes over me we are a team you and i i give you life and you give me satisfaction and a sense of purpose i pledge to you that i will never let anyone destroy the bond between us when i think about it there is really very little difference between felicias job and my own she has to protect her flowers i have to protect mine i fill a syringe and walk silently over to mr goldmeiers life station it is time to start weeding my garden
