the treader of the dust clark ashton smith the olden wizards knew him and named him quachil uttaus seldom is he revealed for he dwelleth beyond the outermost circle in the dark limbo of unsphered time and space dreadful is the word that calleth him though the word be unspoken save in thought for quachil uttaus is the ultimate corruption and the instant of his coming is like the passage of many ages and neither flesh nor stone may abide his treading but all things crumble beneath it atom from atom and for this some have called him the treader of the dust the testaments of carnamagos it was after interminable debate and argument with himself after many attemptsto exorcise the dim bodiless legion of his fears that john sebastian returned to the househe had left so hurriedly he had been absent only for three days but even this was an interruption without precedent in the life of reclusion and study to which he had given himself completely following his inheritance of the old mansion together with a generous income at no time would he have defined fully the reason of his flight nevertheless flight had seemed imperative there was some horrible urgency that had driven him forth but now since had determined to go back the urgency was resolved into a matter of nerves overwrought by too close and prolonged application to his books he had fancied certain things but the fancies were patently absurd and baseless even if the phenomena that had perturbedhim were not all imaginary there must be some natural solution that had not occurred to his overheated mind at the time the sudden yellowing of a newly purchased notebook the crumbling of the sheets at their edges were no doubt due to a latent imperfection of the paper and the queer fading of his entries which almost overnight had become faint as age old writing was clearly the result of cheap faulty chemicals in the ink the aspect of sheer brittle wormhollowed antiquity which had manifested itself in certain articles of furniture certain portions of the mansion was no more than the sudden revealing of a covert disintegration that had gone on unnoticed by him in his sedulous application to dark but absorbing researches and it was this same application with its unbroken years of toil and confinement which had brought about his premature aging so that looking back into the mirror on the morn of his flight he had been startled and shocked as if by the apparition of a withered mummy as to the manservant timmers well timmers had been old ever since he could remember it was only the exaggeration of sick nerves that had lately found in timmers a decrepitude so extreme that it might fall without the intermediacy of death at any moment into the corruption of the grave indeed he could explain all that had troubled him without reference to the wild remote lore the forgotten demonologies and systems into which he had delved those passages in the testaments of carnamagos over which he had pondered with weird dismay were relevant only to the horrors evoked by mad sorcerers in bygone eons sebastian firm in such convictions cameback at sunset to his house he did not tremble or falter as he crossed the pinedarkened grounds and ran quickly up the front steps he fancied but could not be sure that there were fresh signs of dilapidation in the steps and the house itself as he approached it had seemed to lean a little aslant as if from some ruinous settling of the foundations but this he told himself was an illusion wrought by the gathering twilight no lamps had been lit but sebastian was not unduly surprised by this for he knew that timmers left to his own devices was prone to dodder about in the gloom like a senescent owl long after the proper time of lamplighting sebastian on the other hand had always been averse to darkness or even deep shadow and of late the aversion had increased upon him invariably he turned on all the bulbs in the house as soon as the daylight began to fail now muttering his irritation at timmers remissness he pushed open the door and reached hurriedly for the hall switch because perhaps of a nervous agitation which he would not own to himself he fumbled for several moments without finding the knob the hallwas strangely dark and a glimmering from the ashen sunset sifted between tall pines into the doorway behind him was seemingly powerless to penetrate beyond its threshold he could seenothing it was as if the night of dead ageshad laired in that hallway and his nostrils while he stood groping were assailed by a dry pungency as of ancient dust an odor as of corpses and coffins long indistinguishable in powdery decay at last he found the switch but the illumination that responded was somehow dim and insufficient and he seemed to detect a shadowy flickering as if the circuit were at fault however it reassured him to see that the house to all appearance was very much as he had left it perhaps unconsciously he had feared to find the oaken panels crumbling away in riddled rottenness the carpet falling into motheaten tatters had apprehended the breaking through of rotted boards beneath his tread where he wondered now was timmers the aged factotum in spite of his growing senility hadalways been quick to appear and even if he had not heard his master enter the switching on of the lights would have signalized sebastians return to him but though sebastian listened with painful intentness there was no creaking of the familiar tottery footsteps silence hung everywhere like a funereal unstirred arras no doubt sebastian thought there was some common place explanation timmers had gone to the nearby village perhaps to restock the larder or in hope of receiving a letter from his master and sebastian had missed him on the way home from the station or perhaps the old man had fallen ill and was now lying helpless in his room filled with this latter thought he went straight to timmers bedchamber which was on the ground floor at the back of the mansion it was empty and the bed was neatly made and had obviously not been occupied since the night before with a suspiration of relief that seemed to lift a horrid incubus from his bosom he decided that his first conjecture had been correct now pending the return of timmers he nervedhimself to another act of inspection and went forthwith into his study he would not admit to himself precisely what it was that he had feared to see but at first glance the room was unchanged and all things were as they had been at the time of his flurried departure the confused and highpiled litter of manuscripts volumes and notebooks on his writing table had seemingly lain untouched by anything but his own hand and his bookshelves with their bizarre and terrifical array of authorities on diabolism necromancy goety on all the ridiculed or outlawed sciences were undisturbed and intact on the old lecturn or readingstand which he used for his heavier tomes the testaments of carnamagos in its covers of shagreen with hasps of human bone lay open at the very page which had frightened him so unreasonably with its eldritch intimations then as he stepped forward between the readingstand and the table he perceived for the first time the inexplicable dustiness of everything dust lay everywhere a fine gray dust like a powder of dead atoms it had covered his manuscripts with a deep film it had settled thickly upon the chairs the lampshades the volumes and the rich poppylike reds and yellows of the oriental rugs were bedimmed by its accumulation it was as if many desolate years had passed through the chamber since his own departure and had shaken from their shroudlike garments the dust of all ruined things the mystery of it chilled sebastian for he knew that the room had been cleanswept only three days previously and timmers would havedusted the place each morning with meticulous care during his absence now the dust rose up in a light swirling cloud about him it filled his nostrils with the same dry odor as of fantastically ancient dissolution that had met him in the hall at the same moment he grew aware of a cold gusty draft that had somehow entered the room he though that one of the windows must have been left open but a glance assured him that they were shut with tightly drawn blinds and the door was closed behind him the draft was light as the sighing of a phantom but wherever it passed the fine weightless powder soared aloft filling the air and settling again with utmost slowness sebastian felt a weird alarm as if a wind had blown upon him from chartless dimensions or through some hidden rift of ruin and simultaneously he was seized by a paroxysm of prolonged and violent coughing he could not locate the source of the draft but as he moved restlessly about his eye was caught by a low long mound of the gray dust which had heretofore been hidden from view by the table it lay beside the chair in which he usually sat while writing near the heap was the feather duster used by timmers in his daily round of housecleaning it seemed to sebastian that the rigor of a great lethal coldness had invaded all his being he could not stir for several minutes but stood peering down at the inexplicable mound in the center of that mound he saw a vague depression which might have been the mark of a very small footprint half erased by the gusts of air that had evidently taken much of the dust and scattered it about the chamber at last the power of motion returned to sebastian without conscious recognition of the impulse that prompted him he bent forward to pick up the featherduster but even as his fingers touched it the handle and the feathers crumbled into fine powder which settling in a low pile preserved vaguely the outlines of the original object a weakness came upon sebastian as if the burden of utter age and mortality had gathered crushingly on his shoulders between one instant and the next there was a whirling of vertiginous shadows before his eyes in the lamplight and he felt that he should swoon unless he sat down immediately he put out his hand to reach the chair beside him and the chair at his touch fell instantly into light downwardsifting clouds of dust afterward how long afterward he could not tell he found himself sitting in the high chair before the lecture on which the testaments of carnamagos lay open dimly he was surprised that the seat had not crumbled beneath him upon him as once before there was the urgency of swift sudden flight from that accursed house but it seemed that he had grown too old too weary and feeble and that nothing mattered greatly not even the grisly doom which he apprehended now as he sat there in a state half terror half stupor his eyes were drawn to the wizard volume before him the writings of that evil sage and seer carnamagos which had been recovered a thousand years agone from some graecobactrian tomb and transcribed by an apostate monk in the original greek in the blood of an incubusbegottten monster in that volume were the chronicles of great sorcerers of old and the histories of demons earthly and ultracosmic and the veritable spells by which the demons could be called up and controlled and dismissed sebastian a profound student ofsuch lore had long believed that the book was a mere medieval legend and he had been startled as well as gratified when he found this copy on the shelves of a dealer in old manuscripts and incunabula it was said that only two copies had ever existed and that the other had been destroyed by the spanish inquisition early in the thirteenth century the light flickered as if ominous wings had flown across it and sebastians eyes blurred with a gathering rheum as he read again that sinister fatal passage which had served to provoke shadowy fears though quachil uttaus cometh but rarely it had been well attested that his advent is not always in response to the spoken rune and the drawn pentacle few wizards indeed would call upon a spirit so baleful but let it be understood that he who readeth to himself in the silence of his chamber the formula given hereunder must incur a grave risk if in his heart there abide openly or hidden the least desire of death and annihilation for it may be that quachil uttaus will come to him bringing that doom which toucheth the body to eternal dust and maketh the soul as a vapor for evermore dissolved and the advent of quachill uttaus is foreknowable by certain tokens for in the person of the evocator and even perchance in those about him will appear the signs of sudden age and his house and those belongings which he hath touched will assume the marks of untimely decay and antiquity sebastian did not know that he was mumbling the sentences half aloud as he read them that he was also mumbling the terrible incantation that followed his thoughts crawled as if through a chill and freezing medium with a dull ghastly certainty he knew timmers had not gone to the village he should have warned timmers before leaving he should have closed and locked the testaments of carnamagos for timmers in his way was some thing of a scholar and was not without curiosity concerning the occult studies of his master timmers was well able to read the greek of carnamagos even that dire and soul blasting formula to which quachil uttaus demon of ultimate corruption would respond from the outer void too well sebastian divined the origin of the gray dust the reason of those mysterious crumblings again he felt the impulse of flight but his body was a dry dead incubus that refused to obey his volition anyway he reflected it was too late now for the signs of doom had gathered about him and upon him yet surely there had never been in his heart the least longing for death and destruction he had wished only to pursue his delvings into the blacker mysteries that environed the mortal estate and he had always been cautious had never cared to meddle with magic circles and evocations of perilous presences he had known that there were spirits of evil spirits of wrath perdition annihilation but never of his own will should he have summoned any of them from their nightbound abysms his lethargy and weakness seemed to increase it was as if whole lustrums whole decades of senescence had fallen upon him in the drawing of a breath the thread of his thoughts was broken at intervals and he recovered it with difficulty his memories even his fears seemed to totter on the edge of some final forgetfulness with dulled ears he heard a sound as of timbers breaking and falling somewhere in the house with dimmed eyes like those of an ancient he saw the lights waver and go out beneath the swooping of a batblack darkness it was as if the night of some crumbing catacomb had closed upon him he felt at whiles the chill faint breathing of the draft that had troubled him before with its mystery and again the dust rose up in his nostrils then he realized that the room was not wholly dark for he could discern the dim outlines of the lecturn before him surely no ray was admitted by the drawn windowblinds yet somehow there was light his eyes lifting with enormous effort saw for the first time that a rough irregular gap had appeared in the rooms outer wall high up in the north comer through it a single star shone into the chamber cold and remote as the eye of a demon glaring across intercosmic gulfs out of that star or from the spaces beyond it a beam of livid radiance wan and deathly was hurled like a spear upon sebastian broad as a plank unwavering immovable it seemed to tranfix his very body and to form a bridge between himself and the worlds of unimagined darkness he was as one petrified by the gaze of the gorgon then through the aperture of ruin there came something that glided stiffly and rapidly into the room toward him along the beam the wall seemed to crumble the rift widened as it entered it was a figure no larger than a young child but sere and shriveled as some millennial mummy its hairless head its unfeatured face borne on a neck of skeleton thinness were lined with a thousand reticulated wrinkles the body was like that of some monstrous withered abortion that had never drawn breath the pipy arms ending in bony claws were outthrust as if ankylosed in the posture of an eternal dreadful groping the legs with feet like those of a pigmy death were drawn tightly together as though confined by the swathings of the tomb nor was there any movement or striding or pacing upright and rigid the horror floated swiftly down the wan deathly gray beam toward sebastian now it was close upon him its head level with his brow and its feet opposite his bosom for a fleeting moment he knew that the horror had touched him with its outflung hands with its starkly floating feet it seemed to merge with him to become one with his being he felt that his veins were choked with dust that his brain was crumbling cell by cell then he was no longer john sebastian but a universe of dead stars and worlds that fell eddying into darkness before the tremendous blowing of some ultrastellar wind the thing that immemorial wizards had named quachil uttaus was gone and night and starlight had returned to that ruinous chamber but nowhere was there any shadow of john sebastian only a low mound of dust on the floor beside the lecturn bearing a vague depression like the imprint of a small foot or of two feet that were pressed closely together
