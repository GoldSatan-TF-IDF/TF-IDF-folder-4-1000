chapter to see the rainbow the stork glided to a landing before stunks residence and squawked for attention no it cant be the goblin cried in panic im not even married snot that the stork said through his long bill in the offseason i deliver mail he produced an officiallooking letter offseason for what the goblin demanded you wouldnt understand take the missive i have other idiots to bug but i cant read stunk protested his panic shifting to embarrassment few goblins could read but like most illit erates they didnt like this advertised i will read it to you bulbnose the stork opened the envelope and oriented an eye on the document inside greetings same to you birdbrain stunk said politely goblins had excellent manners though for some reason other crea tures seemed unable to appreciate them dont answer back dolt the stork said im reading the letter not talking to you dont you know what greet ings means stunk didnt answer hey stupid i asked you a question the stork said irritated i thought you were reading the letter needlebeak so i didnt answer back im trying to be polite to one not worth the effort of course i know what it means its an ungob linish salutation salutation ha you dope it means you have been drafted night mare what i wasnt aware of any draft its a very quiet day no breeze at all abducted into the army moron caught by the offi cial press gang your happy civilian life is over no stunk cried appalled i dont want to fight not that way with weapons and rules and things tell me it isnt true ill bet you wish youd had the baby instead huh gob lin the stork gloated cradling the letter with his wings why would i be summoned to war were at relative peace with the dragons and the griffins its the mundane invasion oaf the nextwave of con quest the horrible mundanes are coming to make dragon stew and goblins too no no stunk screamed his horror growing by stum bles and lurches and faltering footsteps i dont want to be goblin stew im only a young ignorant lout i have my whole ornery life ahead of me i wont go then you are a draft evader or a deserter the stork said licking his beak with an orange tongue do you know what they do to deserters i dont want to know they feed them to dragons the stork was gloating waves of gloat radiated out from him like ripples on a greasy puddle behind him a dragon loomed snorting up little warmup snorts of purple smoke theyll never get me alive stunk cried working up to a superior degree of cowardice he charged out of his hole in the wall fleeing the draft notice but already the dragon was pursuing him hungrily pumping up extrapurple smoke the kind that not only roasted goblins but smelled pretty bad too salivary smoke stunk fled screaming feeling the monsters fire hot at his back he paid no attention to where his feet were going he was beginning to outdistance the dragon but knew he was not yet out of its range that tongue of flame could reach him any time suddenly he was at the brink of a ledge unable to stop his horror doubled as he fell off he saw the hard rock of the bottom of a canyon rushing up at him as his stubby arms windmilled futilely better the dragon than this and better night mare the draft than the dragonbut now it was too late for ei ther it was too much bawling out his terror be woke imbri leaped through the wall phasing into intangibility she had misjudged the clients reaction to the dream and had almost been caught visible it was very bad form for any night mare to be seen by a waking person even one as insignificant as a goblin she galloped out into the night leaving only a single hoofprint behind as a signature that signature was important imbri was a perfectionist and liked to put her personal stamp on every bad dream she delivered dawn was threatening fortunately this was her last call now she could go home and relax and graze for the day she galloped across the land passing through trees and bushes until she came to a patch of hypnogourds without pause she dived into a ripe gourda feat that would have surprised anyone who was not conversant with magic as horses were much larger than gourdsand was instantly in an alternate world soon she was on the dusky plain with the other mares of the night mare herd converging all returning from duty their hoofprints bore maps of the moon with its green cheese and holes and the names of the individual mares highlighted thereon mare humerum mare nu bium mare frigoris mare nectaris make australeall her old immortal friends all with seas of the moon named after them in honor of their nocturnal performance over the centuries another mare galloped up to intercept imbri it was crisium serving as temporary liaison to the night stallion she projected a dreamlet the moment she came within range it was the scene of an elf waving his arms in ani mated speech imbril the elf exclaimed report to tro jan right away the brief dream faded a summons from the dark horse himself that was not to be ignoredl imbri whirled on a hoof and charged across the plain heading for the stable her relaxation would have to wait the night stallion was awaiting her he stood huge and night mare handsome midnight black of hide and mane and tail and hoof in the same fashion as all the mares but on him it was more impressive any male was impressive in the realm of equus for the real power lay with the few stal lions trojan projected a dream set in a lush human edifice chamber in which imbri took the form of an elegant hu man person lady and he was a grayhaired human creature king you are not doing well mare imbrium the horse king said you have lost that special spark that truly ter rifies i am dissatisfied but i just drove a goblin to distraction imbrilady protested after hauling in the dragon and the unforeshadowed cliff trojan retorted you should have had him terrified into oblivion before he ever left the house dream dragons must not be brought in promiscuously or the dreamers will become acclimated to them and desensitized that ruins it for the other mares you must avoid overexposure of emer gency elements imbri realized it was true the nucleus of the dream had been the horror of the draft that was supposed to chill the spine of the client and make him shiver she had lost her competitive edge and made clumsy what should have been precise i will try to do better her lady form said peni tently that is not enough he replied the edge is not en tirely a matter of trying it is inherent once you lose it its gone im going to have to trade you mare imbrium but this is the only work i know she protested stricken she felt as the goblin had when receiving a dread notice after more than a century of dream duty during which time she bad earned and held her designated moon sea she wasnt ready for anything else you can learn new work there are daydreams daydreams she repeated with contempt i believe you have the inclination inclination she was stunned i never you were recently caught and ridden by a client he said firmly no night mare can be caught unless she tac night mare itiy acquiesces but why would you accede to being caught by a client the king held up a hand to forestall her protest i will tell you why you saw in the memory of another client long ago the image of a rainbow you were fascinated by this vision you wanted to see the reality for yourself but you knew you could never do that as a night mare for the rainbow shuns the night it is a phenomenon of day yes she agreed realizing it was true the vision of the multicolored rainbow had haunted her for years but no night mare could go abroad by day the radiation of the sun caused her kind to fade rapidly so it had always been a futile notion and she had been quite foolish to let it distract her as it happens you possess half a soul the stallion continued you carried an ogre out of the fringe of the void and accepted in payment half the soul of a centaur when all you really wanted was the chance to see a rain bow logic has never been the strong point of females she remembered it well the ogre had wanted to do her a return favor but she had not felt free to converse with him in dreamlet fashion and had been unable to convey her interest in the rainbow to him otherwise he had been a decent sort for an ogre and for a male the two concepts overlapped significantly as it happens the dream king continued that soul has further dulled your edge interfering with your dream performance it is difficult to be truly brutal when you have a soul that is contrary to the nature of souls but its only a half soul imbri protested a mere fil let of soul i thought it wouldnt hurt any portion of a soul hurts in this business he said are you ready to give it up now give up my soul she asked appalled for a reason she could not define as you know most mares who earn half souls soon turn them in to me for storage so that their edge will not be dulled and they receive bonuscredit for extraordinary service to the cause souls are extremely valuable commod ities and we grasp and hold any we can you alone re night mare tained your share of soul passing up the advantage you could have had by cashing it in why i dont know imbri admitted ashamed i do know trojan said you are a nice personality and you have grown nicer over the decades you dont really enjoy causing people misery the soul enhances that liability yes she agreed sadly knowing that she was con fessing a guilty secret that could indeed wash her out as a bearer of bad dreams i have drifted along an errant path this is not necessarily wrong her ears perked forwardan incongruous thing since she remained in lady image in the dream not wrong it relates to your destiny it will one day enable you to see the rainbow the rainbow you are a marked mare imbrium and you will set your mark on xanth that time is near imbri stared at him the night stallion knew more than any other creature in the world of night but seldom told it if he perceived a pattern in imbris incapacities he was surely correct but she dared not inquire about it directly imbrium i am transferring you to day mare duty a more horrendous mare will assume your night duties but i cant go into dayl she protested with fearful hope she knew how brutal and awful some mares were with wild eyes and wilder manes they had absolutely no mercy on sleepers it bothered her to think of her clients being placed in the power of such a creature one of the distinctions between night mares and day mares is the possession of souls the creatures of night have no souls those of day have no bodies you will ac tually be a halfway creature with half a soul and a half material body i shall enchant you to be able to withstand the light of the sun i can go abroad in the real world by day the hope became less fearful for when the stallion neighed all mares believed you will serve as liaison between the powers of the night and the powers of day during the crisis night mare crisis imbri thought she was confusing the term with her friend mare crisium it is essential that the enemy not know your nature or enormous peril may arise they must perceive you as a simple horse enemy it was in the dream you delivered you have become careless about such details imbri tried to review the details of the last dream but before she could make progress the dark horse continued therefore you will report to chameleon to be her steed to whom to be what she is the mother of prince dor xanths next king she is part of the key to xanths salvation she will need transportation and the kind of guidance and assistance only a night mare can provide guard her imbrium she is more important than anyone suspects you will also bear her this message for king trent beware the horseman but i dont understand imbri exclaimed the dream background shaking you arent meant to i dont even know chameleon or king trent ive never had to take a dream to either of them how can i deliver a message your present image is that of chameleon the stallion said producing a mirror from air so she could look at her self in the dream imbri was not a phenomenal judge of human appearance but the image appeared quite ugly chameleon was an awful crone use your dreamerlocator sense it will operate by day as well as by night and if you need to meet king trent directlyhe is my present im age the stallions dream form was handsome in an aged sort of waythe very model of a longreigning king but i understand so littlel imbri protested this is like a bad dream granted the stallion said war is very like a bad dream but it does not pass with the night and its evil remains long after the combat has abated war is no warn ing of ill it is the ill itself war night mare but the stallions kingly eyes flashed and the dream faded imbri found herself standing at the edge of the broad grazing plain alone the interview was over imbri traveled the realm of the night making her farewells to its denizens she went to the city of brass threading her way between the moving buildings meeting the brass folk brassies were just like human folk only made of metal the males wore brassards and the females wore brassieres the brass folk were activated when particular dreams had to be massproduced they were very good at mechanized manufacturing imbri had been here often before to pick up specialized dreams and they were always well crafted one brassie girl approached imbri you do not know me mare she said i understand you are going dayside i was dayside once imbri remembered that a brassie had briefly joined the party of the ogre you must be biyght she sent i am biythe i changed my name i envy you mare i wish i could visit dayside again the light doesnt hurt me and some of the people are very nice yes they are if i ever have occasion to bring a brassie there it will be you biythe imbri promised feeling a kind of camaraderie with the girl perhaps biythe too wanted to see the rainbow imbri went on to bid farewell to the paper folk and the ifrits in their bottles and the walking skeletons of the grave yard shift and the ghosts of the haunted house all of them contributed their special talents to the manufacture of frightening dreams it was a community effort say hello to my friend jordan one of the ghosts told her he haunts castle roogna now imbri promised to relay the message she went finally to mix with her friends the other mares with whom she had worked so closely for so many years this was the saddest of her partings now it was time to go imbri had used up the day and grazed the night preparing for the awful transition she did like her work as a bearer of bad dreams even if she was no longer good at it it was exciting to contemplate going into day but awful to think of leaving the night all her friends were here not therel she trotted out toward the rind no creature could es cape the gourd unaided except a night mare otherwise all the bad stuff of dreams would escape and ravage xanth uncontrolleda natural disaster so the gourd had to be limited a separate world of its own except for those whose business it was to deliver its product some few people fool ish enough to attempt to glimpse its secrets by peeking into the peephole of a gourd found themselves trapped there for an indefinite period if one of their friends interfered with their gaze at the peephole then they were freedand sel dom peeked again it was always wisest not to peek at what concerned one not lest one see what pleased one not the stallion was right imbri had lost her touch with the dreams she carried them she delivered thembut the goblins draft notice had not been her first clumsy effort she no longer had the necessary will to terrify and it showed it was indeed best that she go into another line of work difficult as the transition might be she focused on the positive side of it she would at last get to see xanth by day she would see the rainbow at lasti that would be the fulfillment of her fondest suppressed ambition and after that what could the sight of the rainbow be worth the loss of her job and her friends that seemed a little thin now she came to the rind and plunged through it she didnt need to will herself immaterial that came automatically in a moment she was out in the night of xanth the moon was there exactly like one of her hoofprints its sea and craters etched on the surface of its cheese she paused to stare at it spotting her namesake mare im brium the sea of rains some called it the sea of tears she had always taken the name as a punnish play on con cepts the land of xanth was largely fashioned of puns they seemed to be its fundamental building blocks now with her half soul and her new life ahead the sea of tears seemed to have more significance she backed off and looked at one of her hoofprints it night mare night mare matched the visible moon as it always did even to the phase the prints of night mares became obscure as the moon waned unless a mare made a special effort as for a signature imbri had never liked dream duty when the moon was dark her feet tended to skid leaving no prints at all but there was no such problem tonight the moon was full almost to the bursting point she trotted on through the xanthian night just as if bearing a fresh load of dreams to sleeping clients but this time her only burden was her message beware the horse man she didnt know what that meant but surely the king would meanwhile her equine heart beat more strongly with anticipation as the dread dawn gathered itself always before she had fled the rising sun the scourge of day this time she would face the carnage it did to the darkness the stars began to fade they wanted no part of thisi day was coming soon it would be light enough for the sun to climb safely aloft the sun hated the night just as the moon despised the day but imbri understood the moon had the courage to encroach on the edges of the day especially when fully inflated and strong perhaps the lady moon was interested in the male sun though he gave her scant en couragement as long as the moon was present a night mare could travel safely though perhaps uncomfortably even if the edge of day caught her but why take chances still imbri had to brace herself as the light swelled omi nously she knew the spell of the night stallion and the presence of her half soul would enable her to survive the daybut somehow it was hard to believe absolutely what would happen if the spell were faulty she could be de stroyed by the strike of a deadly sunbeam and her sea on the moon would fade out unremembered she trusted the stallion of course he was her sire and he ruled the powers of the night yet surely tfae sun was an aspect of the pow ers of the day and perhaps did not know she was supposed to be exempt from its mischief or if it knew maybe it refused to recognize the fact oops sorry horse you mean that was the mare i was supposed to spare fortu nately you have others the brightening continued inexorably now was the time she would have to standor break and run home to the gourd her legs trembled her nostrils dilated white showed around the edges of her eyes her body was poised for flight then she remembered the rainbow she would never see itunless she faced the sun or faced away from it it was always a creatures shadow that pointed to the rainbow she understood that was one of the special aspects of the magic of xanth that secret signal but the sunlight had to fall on that person to make the shadow appearshadows were reputed to be very strict about thatso the shadow could perform the mare imbri stood letting the dread sun ascend watching its terrible beams lance their way cruelly through the mists of morning one launched itself right toward im bri amazingly swift and scored before she could react she survived the only effect was a shine on her coat where the beam touched the protective spell had held she had withstood the awful light of the sun she was now a day mare after the tension of the moment imbri felt an enormous relief never had she suspected the night stallion of seek ing to eliminate her by tricking her into braving the sun beam yet she realized now that some such suspicion had made an attempt to harbor itself deep in her being how glad she was that her trust had been justified she took a step feeling the soundness of her legs the solidity of the ground and the springiness of the air she breathed not only did she seem whole she seemed twice as real as before she was now conscious of the weight of her body of the touch of weeds against her skin and of the riffle in her mane as a teasing breeze sought it out ouch she made a squeal of protest and swished her tail slap ping her own flank smartly a fly buzzed up the brute had bitten her she had become a creature of tfae day all right no fly could bite a true night mare few flies abounded at night and the mares were solid only when they willed themselves so now it seemed she was solid and bitablewithout ef night more night mare fort she would have to watch that getting chomped by a bug wasnt fun fortunately she had a good tail she could keep the little monsters clear there was a certain joy in solidity now the sunbeams were bathing the whole side of her body warming it the heat felt strangely good she was more alive than ever there was something about being alltheway solid that was exhilarating who would have believed it she walked then trotted then pranced she leaped high in the air and felt the spring of her legs as they absorbed her shock of landing she leaped again even higher something cracked her down in midprance she dropped to the ground bright white stars and planets orbit ing her dazed head those stellar objects had certainly found her quicklyl what had happened as her equilibrium returned accompanied by a bruise on her head imbri saw that nothing had struck her instead she had struck something she had launched into a pome granate tree cracking headfirst into its pometrunk jarring loose several granate fruits she was lucky none of those rocks had hit her on the way downl now she understood on a more basic level the liabilities of being substantial all the time she had not watched where she was going because she usually phased through objects automatically as a day mare she could not do that when solid met solid there was a brutal thump she walked more sedately after that careful not to bang into any more trees there was nothing like a good clout on the noggin to instill cautioni though muted her joy re mained it merely found less physical ways to express itself deepening and spreading suffusing her body but it was time to go about her business imbri ori ented and discovered she had forgotten what her business was that knock on the head must have done it she knew she was a night mare turned day mare and that she had to go see someone and deliver a messagebut who that per son might be and what the message was she could not recollect she was lostnot in terms of the geography of xanth which she knew well but in terms of herself she did not know where to go or what to dothough she knew it was important that she go there and do it promptly and that the enemy not discover whatever it was she had to do imbri concentrated there was somethingah yes that was it the rainbow she had come to see the rainbow that must be her missionthough where the rainbow was at the moment and what she was supposed to say to it and why this was important to the welfare of the land of xanththese things remained opaque well she would just have to look for it eventually she would find the rainbow and perhaps then the meaning in this mission would become apparent chapter the day horse fflare imbri was hungry there had always been plenty of grazing in the gourd but she had been too busy and too immaterial to graze while on dream duty and evidently had not consumed enough during the past night to sustain the elevated material pace of the real world now she had to grazeand didnt know where to find a decent pasture here in dayside xanth she looked about she was in the deep jungle forest dry leaves coated the forest floor there were few blades of grass and those that she found were wiregrass metallic and inedible no doubt this was where the brassies bar vested some of the wire for their constructions she was roughly familiar with this region of course since she had been all over xanth on dream dutybut by day it looked night mare night mare different and now that she was fixed solid it felt differ ent she had never paid much attention to the potential grazing here where would there be a decent pasture well this was not far west of castle roogna the human folk capital she recalled that there was a large clearing north of here and that should have plenty of excellent grazing the problem was there was a minor mountain range between herself and that pasture and in her present solid state it would be at best tedious and at worst danger ous to climb over that range there was good pasturage at the castle however but she had seldom gone there as the bad dreams for the royal human personages were generally carried by night mares with seniority those who had been in the business for three centuries or more imbri would be likely to blunder in that vicinity especially by day and she didnt want to do that but she remembered that there was a pass through the mountains little known but adequate it had a mildly inter esting history she paused in her thought there was a nice patch of grass superverdant she could graze right here after all she trotted to it and put her nose down the grass reached up and hooked in her tender nostrils and lip imbri vaulted backward her nose getting scratched as the awful greenery ripped free that was carnivorous grass she couldnt go near that instead of being eaten by her it would eat her no help for it she would have to cross the mountains she set off at a trot bearing north she skirted tangle trees and danglevines and the lairs of dragons griffins basilisks nickelpedes and other ilk knowing they were now danger ous to her she had after all illustrated such hazards in the dreams she delivered to deserving creatures often enough soon she came to the mountains now where was that pass a little westward she re called she trotted in that direction she knew the general lay of the land but exact details of placement were vague since material things not relating to clients had not had much importance to her before something was coming toward her imbri paused not frightened but careful she realized that she was now vul nerable to monsters though she had confidence she could outrun most of them few things moved faster than a night mare in a hurry but there were so many things to remem ber when ones body was stuck solid the reality was a pleasant surprise it was a magnificent white horse trotting eastward along the range he had a fine white mane a lovely tail and his appearance was marred only by a thin brass band about his left foreleg at ankle height imbri had never heard of a horse wearing a braceletbut of course the only horses she knew were those of the gourd he halted when he spied imbri she became conscious of the distinction between them she was a black mare he a white stallion she had understood there were no true horses in xanth only part equines like the sea horses horse flies and centaurs her kind the night mares existed separately in the gourd and did not roam freely when not on business there were also the daydream mares but they were completely invisible and immaterial except to others of their kind what was this creature doing here she decided to ask him she could have neighed but wasnt sure she could define her question well enough that way so she stepped forward somewhat diffidently and projected a small dream it was technically a daydream since this was daya conscious kind of imagining much milder in content and intensity than the night visions she normally carried it was also less perfectly structured since she had no original text to work from anything could hap pen in an extemporaneous dream in this dream she assumed a talking form that of a young human woman garbed in black with lustrous long black hair in lieu of a mane and a skirt instead of a tail skirts werent as useful as tails since they were no good for swatting flies but did serve to render mysterious that por tion of the anatomy that profited by such treatment hu man people almost always wore clothing over their func tional parts as if they were ashamed of such parts it was one of a number of oddities about them who are you the dream girl inquired with a fetching smile the white horses ears flattened in dismay and suspicion he wheeled and bolted galloping away back west night mare imbri sighed through her nose he had been such a handsome creature but apparently he was afraid of hu man people had she known she would have projected something else such as a talking bird if she should en counter him again she would be much more careful she proceeded west and in due course located the pass and there standing within it was a man he was of good stature for his kind with pale hair and skin with muscle on his limbs and handsomeness on his face in the humanoid manner naturally no human person was as handsome as a horse that was another of the discomforts the human species seemed to have learned to live with i say pretty mare the man called when he saw her have you seen a runaway white stallion he is my steed but he bolted he wears my circlet on hissforeleg and the man held aloft his left wrist where there was a similar short circlet there could be little doubt he was associated with the horse imbri projected a dreamlet herself in woman form again garbed in black her female parts carefully covered she did not want to scare off another creature i saw him shortly ago man but he bolted from me too he ran in this direction the man looked startled is that you in my mind mare or did i imagine it it is me man she said continuing the daydream for him i am a dream equine i project dream visions to your kind but by day they lack the conviction they have at night she had not realized it before but obviously there was no qualitative difference between the dreams of night and those of day it was just that the conscious minds of waking people were much less credulous so the impact was less they could readily distinguish fancy from reality but the dreams remained excellent for communication ah and did you project such a dream to my steed the day horse no wonder he spooked i fear my visions can frighten creatures who are not prepared she projected her woman image spreading her hands in the human signal of gentle bewilderment if only she had been able to inspire such fright in her bad dream night mare duty i am the night mare imbrium called imbri for brief a night mare he exclaimed i have often met your kind in my sleep but i thought you could not go abroad by day i am under special disposition to the day she said but i do not remember my mission except perhaps to see the rainbow ah the rainbow he exclaimed and a worthwhile goal that is marel i have seen it many times and have always marveled anew where is it she asked eagerly so excited she almost forgot to project it in dream form when she did her dream girl was in partial dishabille like a nymph quickly she patched up the image for the dream man was beginning to stare i know my shadow points to it but there must be sun and rain to summon the rainbow the man said but dont clouds blot out the sun during rainfall there cant be both at once there can be but it is rare the rainbow formation is exceedingly choosy about when and where it appears lest familiarity make it change from magic to mundane you will not see it today there is not rain nearby then i shall go and graze she said disappointed that is surely what my steed is doing though i feed him well he said his appetite is openended sometimes i think he processes hay into clods without bothering to digest them in passing left to his own devices he eats without respite but hes a good horse where could he have gone he did not pass by me and i have been walk ing east until i heard your hooffalls imbri studied the ground horseprints curved into the gap between mountains he seems to have gone through the pass she projected the man looked i see his tracks now that must be it had i been a little swifter i should have intercepted him he paused looking at imbri mare this may be an impo sition but i am not much afoot would you give me a lift through the mountains i assure you i only want to catch night mare up to my errant steed once i see him and call to him he will come to me hes really an obedient mount and not used to being on his own he may even be looking for me but have lost his way he is not as intelligent as you are imbri hesitated she had been ridden before but pre ferred freedom yet she would like to meet the day horse again and if she was going this mans way anyway or if you would like to come home with me the man continued persuasively i have plentiful grain and hay which i keep for my own horse he is of mundane stock you know what he lacks in wit he makes up for in speed and power but he is very shy and gentle not a mean bone in his body i fear he will come to harm alone in this magic land mundane stock that would explain the presence of the horse some mundane animals did wander into xanth ran domly of course it was not safe for such creatures here even imbri herself a creature of an aspect of xanth could have trouble here by day there were perils all about that was probably why the true daydream mares were intangi ble it was a survival trait not to be able to materialize by day i will take you through the pass she projected excellent the man said and in return i will show you a rainbow the very first chance i get he ap proached his voice continuing softly soothingly she stood still with a certain nervousness for ordinarily no waking person could touch a night mare but she reminded herself firmly that she was now a creature of the day and touch able the man sprang on her back his boots hung down on either side around her barrel and his hands gripped her mane he had ridden a horse before if she had not known the day horse was his steed she could have told by his balance and confidence she started through the pass the man riding easily so that she was hardly aware of his weight the ground was firm and almost level and she was able to trot this is a strange configuration the man said as they passed almost beneath the looming rocky cliffs of the sides of the pass so steep above so level below this is the faux pass imbri sent in a dreamlet cen turies ago the giant faux was teamping north and there were clouds about his knees so he did not see the mountain range he caught his left foot on it and tripped and almost took a fall he was a big giant and such a fall would have wreaked enormous destruction in xanth but he caught himself and his misstep merely kicked out a footsized piece of the range creating a gap that ordinary creatures could use to get through thus it came to be named after him though now people tend to pronounce it rather slop pily and just call it fo pa a most delightful story the man said patting imbri on the shoulder she felt good and felt foolish for the feel ing what did she care for the opinion of a human man perhaps her new solidity made her more susceptible to the opinions of solid creatures this is a fascinating deriva tion faux passthe giant misstep i suspect that term will in due course enter the language for many people make missteps of one nature or another they emerged to the north the plain spread out filled with lush tall grass imbri was delighted here she could graze her fill i think i see a print the man said over there he made a gesture imbri hesitated uncertain which way he meant as his gesture had been confusing she did want to find the day horse he was such a handsome animaland he was also male she veered to the left no wrong way the man said there he gestured confusingly again she veered right no still wrong he said imbri stopped i cant tell where you mean she pro jected irritated her dream girl frowning prettily through strands of mussedup hair not your fault the man said i love your little imagi nary pictures you have no trouble communicating my ver bal directions are too nonspecific and you evidently are not familiar with my human gestures but i think i can clarify them he jumped down removing something from his clothing it was a little brass stick with cords attached to each end put this in your mouth behind your front set of teeth he held the stick up to her face sidewise nudg night mare ing it at her mouth so that she had either to take it or to back off she opened her mouth doubtfully and set it in between her front and back teeth where there was the nat ural equine gap human beings did not have such a gap which was another one of their problems they could not chew nearly as well as horses could since everything tended to mush up together in their mouths unappetiz ingly now i will tug on these reins he explained that will show you exactly where to go here ill demonstrate he jumped on her back again and got the two cords reaching from the metal bit to his hands turn that way he said tugging in the right rein the bit pulled back against her hind teeth uncomfort ably to ease the pressure imbri turned her head to the right youve got it the man cried you are a very smart horse it had not been intelligence it had been discomfort i dont like this device imbri projected you dont im so sorry lets turn to the left now he tugged at the other rein sending a twinge tothat side of her jaw but imbri had had enough she balked planting all four feet firmly on the ground and trying to spit out the brass bit it tasted awful anyway but the reins held it in place annoyingly she sent a fierce dream at him of her dream girl self gesturing in righteous ire tresses flouncing get off my back man you must address me by my proper tide the man said i am known as the horseman the horseman suddenly imbris misplaced memory re turned her message was beware the horsemanand now she had an inkling of its meaning beware the horseman eh the man repeated and im bri realized she had spoken her thought in the dream an grily she exploded her dream girl image into a roil of smoke but this did not daunt the man so you carry a message of warning about me what a fortunate coinci dence this is mare i certainly can not afford to let you go now i must take you home with me and keep you con fined so that you can not betray me imbri did not know what to do so she continued to do nothing she had unwittingly put herself in the power of the one person she should have avoided time to go home the horseman said ill come back and catch the day horse later you are too valuable a cap tive to let escape i understand you night mares can pass through solid rock at night and even turn invisible that means i must get you safely corralled before darkness comes move move mare imbri refused to move it was true he could not hold her at night even if he remained awake and alert if he slept she would send him a dream so bad he would be paralyzed time was on her side but she had no intention of obliging him one moment longer than necessary her feet would remain planted here until she figured out how to dump him i have another little device that may amuse you the horseman said it makes horses go and he banged his heels into her flanks pain lanced through her there were knives on his boots imbri was leaping forward before she realized it jolted by the shock a horses natural response to fright or pain was to bolt as running was normally the most effective de fense you appreciate my spurs the horseman inquired he drew on the left rein forcing her to curve around that way imbri tried to slow but the spurs stung her again mak ing her run faster she tried to veer right but the bit in her mouth cut cruelly and she had to go left the horseman had subjected her to his awful will no wonder the day horse had fled this terrible man if only she had realized the horsemans nature if only she had not foolishly forgotten her warning message but these things had come to pass and she was paying the price of her neglect if she ever got out of this fix she would be a wiser mare the horseman rode her back through the faux pass and west along the south side of the mountain range imbri stopped fighting her captor and found it amazingly easy to yield to his directives the horseman did not hurt her un less she resisted night mare night mare imbri cursed herself for her inability to resist but she was rapidly becoming conditioned to the will of the horse man when she tried to resist he punished her when she obeyed he praised her he seemed so sure of himself so reasonable so consistent while she seemed even to herself like a poorly mannered animal for now until she figured out an effective course of independence she had to go along but capitulation was not enough he wanted informa tion too who gave you that warning to beware of me he asked imbri hesitated the horseman touched her sore flanks with his awful spursthey werent actually knives they just felt like itand she decided that there was no harm in answering she sent a dreamlet representing herself in woman form in shackles her side bleeding from abrasions and with a brass bar in her mouth ve commands va pow ers of va night the woman said around the bit do not tease me mare the horseman said touching her again with the spurs your dreams can speak clearly she had to give up that ploy he commands the powers of the night she repeated clearly the night stallion he assigns the dreams to be delivered he sent the mes sage the night stallion the horseman repeated natu rally you equines revert to the herd in the wild state but he is confined to the night to the gourd she clarified it keeps us secure by day now she wished she had never left it explain he said the only gourd i know is the hyp nogourd that has a little peephole anyone who sets eye to that is instantly hypnotized and can not move or speak un til someone else breaks the connection that is the same imbris tattered dream girl said looking woeful she hated giving so much information to the enemy but didnt see how this particular news would help this man he already knew better than to peek into a gourd unfortunately we night mares are the only crea tures who can pass freely in and out of the gourd all gourds are the same all open onto the same world of night when a person looks into any gourd his body freezes but his spirit takes form inside and must thread its way through our labyrinth of entertainments those who remain too long risk losing their souls then their bodies will never be functional again so its a kind of trap a prison he said thoughtfully i suspected some such im glad you are choosing to tell me the truth mare how many spirits can it contain any number the gourd is as large as xanth in its fashion it has to be to contain dreams for every person in xanth every night no two dreams the same to us in the gourd the rest of xanth seems small enough to carry under one of your arms yes i see that now very interesting we can carry your world around and you can carry ours around its all relative after a moment he had a new question to whom were you to deliver your message now imbri resisted being sure this would affect the conduct of the war but the horseman dug in his spurs again and the pain became so terrible she had to tell she had never had to endure pain before for it didnt exist in immaterial form she couldnt handle it i was to go to chameleon with the message for the king who is chameleon the mother of prince dor the next king she is an ugly woman why not take the message directly to the king the spurs were poised i dont know the dream girl flinched putting her hands to her sides the spurs touched desperately imbri amplified my mission was to be secret maybe it was a ruse to report to the woman who would relay the message to the king no one would suspect i was liaison to the gourd the king is important then nothing can be done without his directive the king rules the human concerns of xanth imbri agreed he is like the night stallion his word is law without his word there would be no law yes that makes sense the horseman decided and the spurs did not strike again if you reported directly to the king the enemy might catch on and know the warning night mare night mare had been given that could nullify much of its effect still i think it better yet to nullify all its effect by preventing the message from being delivered at all because of course it is an apt warning your night stallion evidently has good intelligence he is the smartest of horses imbri agreed in a frag mentary dreamlet he knows more than he ever says as does good magician humfrey intelligence as in gathering data about the enemy the horseman clarified this is the activity i am currently engaged in but of course your stallion has the night mare network you mares were peeking into our brains as we slept werent you no secrets from your kind no we only deliver the dreams imbri protested her pride in her former profession overriding her wish to deceive the horseman we cant tell whats in peoples minds if we could i would never have let you put this bit in my mouth that brass tasted awful and not just physically how then did you know about me i know you knew because of your message of warning about me dont know the night stallion knows he has a re search department so he can tell where to target the bad dreams but he cant usually tell waking people theres very little connection between the night world and the day world so i now understand many secrets are buried in the depths of night but what of this good magician who you say also knows a great deal why hasnt he warned xanth about me magician humfrey only gives information in return for one years service by the one who asks imbri said no body asks him anything if he can help it ah zealously guarded parameters the horseman said seeming to like this information or the mercenary mo tive so for the truth about xanths situation a person must either pay a prohibitive fee or peer into the peephole of a gourdwhereupon he is confined and can not extricate himself by his own effort it is a most interesting situation the people are almost entirely dependent on the king for information and leadership if anything were to happen to king trent he paused a moment his successor prince doris he competent all i know is what i have picked up from peoples dreams imbri temporized certainly and their dreams reflect their deepest con cerns what about prince dor he has hardly had any experience she sent unwill ingly when he was a teenager about eight years ago king trent went on vacation and left dor in charge he had to get his friends to help and finally the zombie mas ter had to come and take over until king trent returned there were a lot of bad dreams then we mares were over loaded with cases and almost ran our tails off it was not a very good time for xanth so prince dor is not noted for competence the horse man said and next in the line of succession is the zombie master whom the people dont feel comfortable with so there really is no proper successor to king trent he lapsed into thoughtful silence guiding imbri by nudges of his knees when he pushed on one side he wanted her to turn away from that side he was not wantonly cruel she understood all he required was the subordination of her will to his in every little detail that was of course one thing she couldnt stand at the moment she could not escape him but she would find a way sometime he couldnt keep the bit and spurs on her forever and the moment he slipped she would be gone with a whole lot more news about him than she had had originally beware the horseman indeed they came to the horsemans camp there were two men there mundane by their look found me a horsel the horseman called jovially wheres the other horse one asked he bolted but ill get him tomorrow this ones better shes a converted night mare sure enough the mundane agreed uncertainly eyeing imbri it seemed he thought the reference to night mare was a joke mundanes could be very stupid about magic better off without the white horse the other mundane said for all the riding you get on him and all the feeding you give him hes never around when you need him night mare night mare hes got spirit thats all the horseman said with a tol erant gesture i like a spirited animal now put a hobble on this one shes a literal spirit and shes not tame yet one of the henchmen came with a rope imbri shied away nervously but the horseman threatened her again with his awful spurs and she had to stand still the hench man tied the rope to her two forefeet with only a short length between them so that she could stand or walk care fully but could not run what a humiliating situation they put her in a barren pen where there was a grimy bucket of water they dumped halfcured bay in for her to chew the stuff was foul but she was so hungry now that she had to eat it though she feared it would give her colic no wonder the day horse had boltedl all day she remained confined while the mundanes went about their brutish business elsewhere imbri drank the bad water finished off the bad hay and slept on her feet in the normal manner of her kind her tail constantly swishing the bothersome flies away she had plenty of time to consider her folly but she knew the night would free her and that buoyed her spirit her half soul now she meditated on that few of her kind possessed any part of any soul and those who obtained one generally didnt keep it as the night stallion had reminded her yet she clung to her soul as if it were most important was she being foolish imbri had carried the halfhuman smash the ogre out of the gourd and out of the void but it was not any part of his soul she had it was half the soul of a centaur filly that soul had changed her outlook making her smarter and more sensitive to the needs of others that had been bad for her business and had finally cost her her profession but as she gradually mastered the qualities of the soul she became more satisfied with it now she knew there was more to life than feeding and sleeping and doing her job she was not certain what more there was but it was well worth searching for perhaps the rainbow would have the answer one look at the celestial phenomenon might make her soul comprehensible yet that search had led her into the privation of the moment as evening approached the horseman and the two henchmen appeared and started hauling firewood logs from the forest the wood fairly glowed with eagerness to bum they threw a flamevine on the pile and burn it did the fire blazed high turning the incipient shadows to the brightness of day suddenly imbri realized what they were doing the mundanes were keeping the pen too light for her to assume her nocturnal powers as long as that fire burned she could not escape with despair she watched as they hauled more logs they had enough wood to carry them through the night she would not be able to dematerialize the sun tired and dropped at last to the horizon making the distant trees blaze momentarily from its own fire imbri wondered whether it descended in the same place each night or whether it came down in different locations doing more damage to the forest she had never thought about this before since the sun had been no part of her world or she would have trotted over there and checked the burned region directly the fire blazed brighter than ever in the pen malevo lently consuming her precious darkness it sent sparks up into the sky to rival the stars perhaps they were stars after all the little specks of light had to originate some where and new ones would be needed periodically to re place the old ones that wore out the mundanes took turns watching imbri and dumping more wood on the fire as it waned waned she thought that jogged a nagging notion she wished it had waned this night putting out the fire waned rained that was it if only a good storm would come and douse everything but the sky remained distress ingly clear slowly the henchman on guard nodded he was sleeping on the job and she was not about to wake himbut it didnt matter because the fire was more than bright enough to keep her hobbled whether he woke or slept she might hurl a bad dream at him but that would only bestir him with fright making him alert again she would have to deal with that fire first but how when she was hobbled then she realized how to start she approached the fire and put her front feet forward trying to ignite the rope that night mare hobbled her but the blaze was too fierce she could not get close enough to burn the rope without burning herself she turned about and tried to scrape dirt onto the blaze with a hind hoof but the ground was too solid she could not get a good gouge she seemed helpless then a shape appeared some large animal was stomp ing beyond the wall of the pen out of the firelight a dragon come to take advantage of a horse who could only hobble along she sent an exploratory dreamlet who are you is it safe an equine thought came in the dream it was the day horse imbri quelled her surprise and pleasure at his presence and projected another dreamlet stay clear stallion the horseman is looking for you iknow the horse replied slowly she wasnt certain whether it was dullness or caution that made him seem less than smart she understood that mundane animals were not terrifically intelligent and the horseman had said as much he wants to catch you and ride you again she sent making her dream image resemble a centaur so as to seem more equine while retaining the ability to speak clearly of course horses had their own language but overt neighing and other sounds might wake up the henchman ihide the day horse replied beginning to catch on to this mode of dialogue he stepped up to the fence and looked over his head bright in the firelight well go hide now because if that henchman wakes yougreet me he said in the dream awkwardly i run youcaught by man my fault i camefree you imbri was moved she had pictured him in the dream as a white centaur and he seemed to like the form she had made sure it was a very muscular and handsome centaur knowing that males tended to be vain about their appear ance males of any species were foolish in a number of respects but what would xanth be like without them i cant get away as long as that fire bums her dream filly image said i had hoped there would be a rainstorm but rainstorm water to douse the fire she explained sure enough night more he was the strong handsome amiable stupid type fortu nately stallions didnt need brains they were attractive as they were douse fire he said understanding make water he jumped over the pen wall landing with such a thump that imbri had to jam a dream of an earthquake at the sleeping henchman to prevent him from being alarmed of course he was alarmed but then she modified the dream to show that the earthquake had been weak and brief and had cracked open the ground in front of him to reveal a trea sure chest filled with whatever it was he most desired the henchman quickly opened the chest and out sprang a lovely nude nymph he would remain asleep for a long time the day horse walked over to the burning logs angled his body and urinated on the flames clouds of steamy smoke flared up as the fire hissed angrily it certainly did not appreciate this treatment the new noise disturbed the henchman despite his dream he started to awaken this time imbri sent a mean dream at him showing the merest suggestion of a basilisk the size of a horse swinging around to glare at the man the mundane immediately squinched his eyes tightly closed he knew what happened when one traded gazes with a bask he did not want to wake and see the monster imbri let him drift off again returning to his treasure chest nymph imbri was as relieved as he to see him sleep in a moment the fire had sizzled down enough to let the shadows reach out to imbri she phased through her hob bles and the wall of the pen the day horse leaped to fol low her they ran through the forest come with me to castle roognal imbri projected her filly image smiling gladly and swishing her black tail in friendly fashion but the day horse faltered the handsome centaur image frowned nighttire quicklycreature of daymust give it up he stumbled by night i sleep she saw that it was so then well hide so you can rest she sent you go i came only to free you he said speaking night mare more clearly now he might be slow but he did catch on with practice pretty mare black like deepest night imbri was flattered and appreciative though he was only telling the truth she was as black as deep night be cause she was a night mare but any notice by a stallion was a thing to be treasured nonetheless she did have a mission and had to complete it without delay when will i see you again come to the baobab at noon he said nice tree if i am near i will be there do not betray me to the human kind i do not wish to be caught and ridden again ill never betray you day horse she exclaimed in the dream shocked you freed me ill always be grateful farewell his dream image said he turned and walked north as the dreamlet faded out imbri saw the brass circlet on his foreleg glint faintly in the moonlight the baobab tree imbri sent after him she knew of that growth from her dream duties sometimes human peo ple camped out there and it was conducive to bad dreams at night a little like a haunted house it was at the edge of the castle roogna estate out of sight of the castle but im possible to overlook she would certainly be there when she had the chance chapter centycore et cetera by midnight imbri reached castle roogna she skirted it and went to chameleons home which was a large cottage cheese imbri had once delivered a dream here to chameleons husband bink it had been a minor one for the man did not have much ill on his conscience but at least she knew her way around these premises de spite lacking the seniority required to bring dreams to kings she phased through the hard rind and made her wayshould that be whey in this house she wondered to chameleons bed but a stranger occupied that bed chameleon according to the image the night stallion had formed was a crone this person was a lovely older woman of about fifty had she come to the wrong address where is chameleon imbri inquired in a pictureless dreamlet maybe this woman was visiting and would know i am chameleon the woman replied in the dream imbri stood back and considered the reply had been direct and honest the night stallion must have made an error forming the image of some other woman imbri had never known him to make an error before but obviously it was possible something else bothered her chameleon was sleeping alone yet she was a family person where were her hus band and son imbri projected a dream it was of herself as another centaur filly standing beside the bed chameleon i must give you a message the woman looked up oh am i to have a bad dream why do they always come when my familys away no bad dream imbri reassured her i am the night mare imbri come to be your steed and bear a message for the king when you wake i will remain i will talk to you in your sleep as now or in daydreamlets no bad dreams the woman seemed slow to under stand no bad dreams imbri repeated but a message for the king the kings not here you must seek him at castle roogna i know but i can not go to him i will give you the message to relay to him me repeat a dream night mare night mare repeat the message imbri was getting impatient the woman seemed to have very little wit what message beware the horseman who the horseman is that a centaur no hes a man who rides horses but there are no horses in xanth there is one now the day horse and there are the night mares like me but then people dont need to fear him just horses should fear him that might be true certainly imbri would never again be careless about the horseman but it was irrelevant she had to get the message through that is for the king to decide you must give him the message what message beware the horsemani imbris image shouted frus trated chameleons image looked around nervously where is he what was this was the woman a complete idiot why had the night stallion sent imbri to such a creature the horseman is west of here he may be hazardous to the health of xanth the king must be warned oh when my husband bink comes home ill tell him when will bink be back imbri inquired patiently next week hes up north in mundania working out a new trade agreement with onesti or something i certainly hope he works on it with honesty imbri said but next weeks too long we must warn the king tomorrow oh i couldnt bother the king hes seventy years old but this affects the welfare of xanth imbri protested getting frustrated again yes xanth is very important then youu warn the king warn the king about the horseman the centaur filly said keeping her tail still and her face straight with an effort but me king is seventy years oldl imbri stamped a forefoot angrily in both her dream form and her real form i dont care if he is a hundred and seventy years oldl am hes still got to be warned chameleon stared at the filly image you certainly dont look that old i am a night mare we are immortal at least until we die i have a soul now so i can age and breed and die when im material but i never aged before once i ma tured now about the king maybe my son dor can tell him where is your son now imbri asked warily hes south at centaur isle getting the centaurs to or ganize for possible war because good magician humfrey says there may be a wave we dont like it when waves are made but i dont think the centaurs believe it a wave it was imbris turn to be confused she knew the woman wasnt talking about the ocean the nextwave chameleon clarified unhelpfully imbri let that go she had seen the lastwave but that had been a long time ago when will dor be back here tomorrow night just in time for the elopement somehow the womans ingenuous remarks kept making imbri react stupidly too elopement chameleon might not be smart but she had a good memory dor and ireneshes king trents daughter a lovely child with the green thumb only its really her hair thats greenhave been engaged for eight years now a third of their lives they could never decide on a date we think dors a little afraid of the responsibility of marriage hes really a very nice boy obviously nice meant in nocent in this connection imbri was surprised to leam that any innocent males remained in xanth perhaps this was merely the fond fancy of a naive mother irene is twentythree now and shes getting impatient she never was a very patient girl this seemed to mean that the other woman in chameleons sons life was not viewed with entire favor but was tolerated as a necessary evil in this attitude chameleon was absolutely typical of the mothers of sons so shes going to come here at night and take dor night mare away and marry him in an uncivil ceremony and then it will be done everyone will be there so the pleasure of a wedding ceremony overwhelmed the displeasure of turning her son over to an aggressive girl this too was normal except for an elopement imbri felt more stupid than ever was this a human folk custom she had missed she had understood that elopements were sneak marriages cer tainly she had delivered a number of bad dreams relating to that oh theyll all be in costume of course so dor wont know poor thing maybe irene wont know either its all very secret nobody knows except everybody else imbri realized that she bad again been distracted by an irrelevancy and was getting ever more deeply enmeshed in the confusions of chameleons outlook two days is too long for my message to wait the horseman is within range of castle roogna now spying on the xanth defenses anyway it seems that prince dor will be too busy to pay attention to it you must go to the king first thing tomor row morning oh i couldnt bother the king hes seventy years old he still needs to know the horse man is dangerousl the dream chameleon looked at the dream imbri with childlike seriousness why dont you tell him then i cant my mission here must be confidential then imbri paused startled confidential from whom was the secret of her nature to be kept the horseman already knew he had ridden her and intercepted her mes sage and forced her to tell him everything ill go tell him right nowl imbri said cursing her own foolishness but its nightl the kings asleep all the better im a night mare oh thats all right then but dont give him any bad dreams hes a good man i wont imbri trotted through the rindwall of the cot tage letting chameleon lapse into more peaceful slumber she hurried to castle roogna hurdled the moat with one prodigious leap and phased through the massive outer night more wall this would be no easy castle to take by storm she passed through the somber darkened halls and passages until she came to the royal bedchamber the king and queen had separate apartments both were safely asleep imbri entered the kings chamber and stood over him exactly as if she were on dream duty even at seventy which was old for a mortal man he was a noble figure of his kind the lines of his face pro vided the appearance of wisdom as much as of age yet it was clear he was mortal she detected infirmities of system that would in due course bring him to a natural demise he had reigned for twentyfive years perhaps that was enough except that if he lacked a competent replacement in prince dor she entered his mind in dream form this time assuming the likeness of a nymph bare of breast and innocent of countenance symbolic of her intention to conceal nothing from him king trent she called he had been dreaming he was sleeping now he dreamed he woke what are you doing in my bedroom nymph he demanded are you one of my daughters playmates speak or i will transform you into a flower startled imbri did not speakand suddenly in me dream she was a tiger lily she growled baring her petals in a grimace all rightill give you another chance king trent did not make any gesture but imbri was back in nymph form even in dreams the kings magic was formidable i bring you a message she said quickly through the mouth of the nymph beware the horseman and who is the horsemana kind of centaur no sir he is a man who rides horses he rode me she paused realizing this statement did not make much sense while she was in nymph image i am a night mare ah then this is after all a dream i mistook it for reality my apology imbri was embarrassed that a king should apologize to a dream image but it is real the dream is only to commu nicate really then i had better wake the king made an effort and woke imbri was amazed night mare in all her one hundred and fifty years experience in dream duty after her youth and apprenticeship she had not seen anyone do this so readily so you really are a mare king trent said studying her in reality not a nymph sent to tempt me into foolish thoughts yes not a nymph she agreed projecting a spot dreamlet and you do not fade in my waking presence interest ing i am spelled to perform day duty she explained to bring my message which is to beware the horseman the king stroked his beard i dont believe i know of him is he by chance a new magician no sir i think he is a mundane but he is clever and ruthless he hurt me she nodded at the scrapes on her flanks you could not phase away from him mare not by day i am now mortal by day would this relate to the invasion the mundanes are sup posed to be mounting i think so sir the horseman has two mundane hench men and a mundane horse where did you encounter this cruel man two hours trot west of here south of the gap chasm yes your majesty at faux pass thats odd my scouts should have spotted any crossing of the chasm or any sea approach you are sure of the location quite sure i made a bad misstep there that happens at faux pass yes imbri was embarrassed again then they must have found a way to sneak in the king pondered a moment ahi have it a quarter cen tury ago bink and chameleon and i entered xanth below the gap when we departed from the region of the isthmus far northwest of here we somenow traversed in perhaps an hour a distance that should have required a days gallop by your kind obviously there is a magic channel under night mare water the horseman must have found it and somehow gotten by the kraken weed that guards it we shall have to close that off devious though it may be there are merfolk in that vicinity i shall notify them to investigate he smiled meanwhile a lone man and two henchmen and a mundane horse should not present too much of a threat to xanth the horse is not with them any more your majesty he is the day horse who fled his master and helped me es cape then we must reward that horse where is he now he does not want to meet with human folk she ex plained he is wary of being caught and ridden again again the king smiled then we shall ignore him true horses are very rare in xanth for there is no resident pop ulation he might be regarded as a protected species that will help him survive in what might otherwise be a hostile land king trent had a marvelous way of solving problems imbri was grateful i am also to serve as liaison to the gourdthe realm of the powers of the night and to the folk of xanth imbri said in another dreamlet maintain ing her nymph image for the purpose and i am to be the steed of chameleon but i dont know why she seems not very smart an excellent assignment king trent said evidently you do not properly comprehend chameleons nature she changes day by day becoming beautiful but stupid as she is at the moment then reversing and turning ugly but intel ligent she is alone because of the exigencies of this pres ently developing crisis and that is unfortunate because someone really should be with her at her nadir of intellect you can be with her and nudge her from danger in a few days she will become smarter and in two weeks she will be so smart and ugly you cant stand her but she is a good woman overall and needs a companion in both phases oh now the night stallions assignment made more sense it also explained his seeming error he had shown an image of ugly chameleon but meanwhile her aspect had changed return to her now king trent said i will have a new assignment for you both by morning how thoroughly the king took over once he tackled something imbri trotted through the wall and jumped down to the ground outside actually she landed in the moat but it didnt matter because she was immaterial she didnt even disturb the moat monsters soon she was back with chameleon now understanding this woman better appearance and intelligence that varied in a monthly cyclehow like a woman imbri checked in with a reassuring dreamlet then moved back outside to graze on the excellent local grass she slept while grazing comfortably suspecting she would need all her energy the next day a tiny golem appeared at the cottage in the morning oh hello grundy chameleon said do you want a cookie yes the miniature figure said accepting the prof fered delicacy it was an armful for him but he chewed bravely into the rim but thats not why im here king trent says you must ride the night mare to good magician humfreys castle and ask his advice for this campaign but i couldnt bother the good magician chameleon protested hes so old nobody knows the king says this is important we have a crisis com ing up in the nextwave and we dont want to misplay it he says humfrey should see this mare get going within the hour imbri snorted who was this little nuisance to order them about the golem snorted backspeaking perfect equine im grundy the golem and im on the kings errand horse face so you can communicate in nonhuman languages im bri neighed that was quite a talent she didnt even have to project a dreamlet at him still she didnt like the insult ing inflection he had applied to the uninsulting horse face so she sent a brief dream of the fires of hell at him the golem blanched thats some talent you have your self mare he concluded he departed with dispatch night mare chameleon looked at imbri but i dont know how to ride a horse she said she seemed very unsure of herself in her stupid phase but she was certainly an excellent fig ure of a woman of her age use a pillow for a cushion and i will teach you how imbri projected her dreamlet showing chameleon seated confidently and somewhat regally on the dream horses back her lovely hair flowing down about her chameleon got a pillow and followed instructions soon she was precariously perched her legs dangling awk wardly her arms rigid this was an immense contrast to the evil expertise of the horseman but imbri moved care fully and the woman gradually relaxed it really was not hard to ride a horse if the horse was willing they moved east through field and forest toward the good magicians castle because imbri had been almost everywhere in xanth in the course of her century and a half of dream duty she needed no directions to locate it she stayed clear of dragons tangle trees and similar haz ards and reached the castle without untoward event late in the day imbri could have covered the distance much faster alone but chameleon would have taken much longer by herself so it was a fair compromise they had paused to eat along the way and had taken turns napping imbri car ried the woman carefully while she slept then had shown her how to guide the snoozing mare away from holes in the ground and other nuisances by the pressure of knees on sides chameleon was quite surprised that a creature could walk while sleeping she was stupid but she had a sweet personality and followed directions well she was learning to be a helpful rider as the castle came into view both mare and woman were startled it was a monstrous circle of stones set within a moat each stone was too huge to be moved physically and stood upright on top were set enormous slabs of rock so that the whole formed a kind of pavilion there was no sign of the good magician i am not very smart of course chameleon said but i dont understand this at all that megalith looks many cen turies old imbri was reasonably smart but she was similarly baf night mare fled she had been by this castle several times in the past and though it bad always looked different it had never been this different we shall have to go in and look she projected maybe there is some sign of what happened to the good magician maybe he moved chameleon suggested they approached the moat by night imbri could have hurdled it or trotted across the surface of the water but now she had to wade and swim since she did not want to delay unnecessarily the moment her hoof touched the water a fish swam up it changed into a naked man before them halt you cant pass here oh dear chameleon said imbri recognized the type youre a nix she projected the man shifted form again partway adopting the tail of a fish well mare he said what else would you expect to find guarding a moat at castle roogna there are nice moat monsters cha meleon said i am a moat monster the hix declared and you cant pass unless you know the password password chameleon was plainly perplexed so was imbri why should they be allowed to pass it they knew a word if their merit was not otherwise apparent this did not seem to make sense imbri tried to evoke the word from a dream but the nix was too canny for that dreams were aids to communica tion and often evoked deep feeling but were not for mind reading well just have to cross despite him imbri projected privately to chameleon with a dream picture of woman and horse forging across the moat while the nix protested helplessly after all the creature carried no weapon and was not physically imposing in either its fish or man form also they had the right and the need to cross they were on the kings business yes we must cross chameleon agreed she hiked up her skirt so that it would not get wet though of course imbri was likely to sink low enough in the water to wet the womans legs to the thighs anyway they were excellent night mare limbs considering her age perhaps even not considering her age water would hardly hurt them this was not lost on the nix he whistled lewdly look at those gams he exclaimed ignore him imbri said in the dream image for she saw that the dream girl chameleon was blushing it seemed that despite a quarter century of marriage chameleon re mained fundamentally innocent that probably accounted for her sons innocence imbri found herself liking the woman even more and felt protective toward her chame leon was as esthetic emotionally as she was physically al most too nice to be true they plunged into the water nix nix the nix cried you shall not pass without the word i will freeze your tracks he pointedand the water abruptly congealed about imbris legs imbri stopped perforce she stood kneedeep in ice the nix did have power to stop her progress what do you think of that nag the nix demanded with insolent satisfaction he was now back in fish form able to speak that way too no password no passing i told you did you think the rule was passe chameleon fidgeted helplessly but imbri struggled to draw one foot and then another from its mooring ice splin tered as her hooves came free soon she stood on the frozen surface and began to walk forward nix nix the sprite cried back in man form pointing again with a finlike arm the ice melted instantly and im bri dropped into deeper water with a splash the nix chor tled well then she would wade again one way or another she would cross this moat the nix froze the water againand again imbri strug gled to the top he melted it plunging her down this was awkward but she continued to make progress the nix could not actually stop her then she reached the deep where she had to swim the water came almost to the top of her back chameleon hiked her skirt up over her waist oh it tickles she pro tested the nix gloated now faintly resembling a satyr where night mare does it ticlde wench fll give you a good tickle if thats what you like this caused the dream girl to blush fu riously again but she wouldnt let her dress get wet ac tually it was a fairly simple outfit in shades of gray the parts neither matching nor clashing it was she herself who made it attractive hey i never knew a doll could blush that far down the nix said evilly imbri nosed a splash of water at him but continued swimming if the nix remained distracted by the womans exposure and embarrassment long enough they would be across that should embarrass him he certainly deserved it alas the nix was not that foolish nix nixl he cried pointing again this time the freezing was incomplete the water thick ened into cold sludge but imbri was able to forge through it it seemed there was too much volume here to freeze enough to immobilize her submerged body so the effect was diluted well then nox the nix cried angrily nix nox pad dywox live the frog alone this nonsense thawed the water then thinned it far ther suddenly it was too dilute to support the mares swim ming weight she sank down over her head this was like phasing through solidswith one differ ence she could not breathe the water was now too thin to swim but too thick to breathe and its composition was wrong imbris feet found the bottom this was solid she turned hastily about and walked the few paces needed to bring her high enough for her head to break the surface now she could breathe she projected a dreamlet to chameleon centaur filly shaking a spray of water out of her hide are you all right woman my dress is soakedi think chameleon lamented the water isnt very wet that was good enough for imbri take a deep breath and i will run all the way across the moat on the bottom with thin water we can do it night mare thats what you think night nag the nix cried evi dently catching part of the dream he was swimming along his forepart that of a fish his hind part that of a man the water was abruptly fully liquid again try to run through that imbri realized that it could be dangerous to try if she swam and the nix vaporized the water she would sink without a breath and have to turn back chameleon could panic and possibly drown imbri wasnt certain whether chameleon could swim and now was not the time to in quire she paused to consider alone she could probably forge through despite the mischievous nix but with chameleon it was harder too bad the woman was so stupid imbri had to do all the thinking how could she get them both across with minimum risk then she had a notion she projected a new dream to chameleon a scene of herself in mare form and the woman in woman form exactly as they were in life but the nix was there too eavesdropping whatever they tried he would foil the dream mare projected a dream within the dream to chameleon this one bypassed the snooping nix who did not realize the complex levels available in dream symbol ism in that redistilled dream imbri was a woman in black and chameleon a woman in white trust me she said to the dreamindream girl who looked slightly startled we shall crossbut not the way we seem to follow what i say not what i do can you do that the dreamindream girl blinked uncertainly til try imbri she agreed that is you ohit was the human guise that confused her yes i can take any form in dreams but i usually am black or wear black because thats night mare color the chameleons on the three levels of reality dream and dreamdream smiled getting it straight now they returned to focus on the outer dream hang on chameleon the mare cried in real life imbri could not physically talk human language but dreams had differ ent rules im swimming across now swimming across the woman agreed hiking her skirt night mare high again her limbs were just as shapely in the dream as in reality youll get your nono wet the nix cried evilly teasing her chameleon blushed yet againshe seemed to have an excellent supply of blush as pretty women didbut held her pose the dream mare moved into deep water swim ming across the real mare did likewise nix nix the sprite cried caught halfway between fish and man forms he vaporized the water the real mare and woman sankbut the dream pair continued swimming ifs not too deep here the dream mare called we can run along the bottom and still breathe in just a moment well be across hey the nix exclaimed angrily nix nix ill nix you and he froze the water now the real mare was able to slog upward through the cold slush and get her head and the womans above water so they could breathe again she plowed clumsily forward but the dream mare was stuck i cant move that mare cried were frozen in tight serves you right nocturnal nag the nix shouted jubi lantly you cant cross without the password we must turn back the dream mare said despairingly yes turn back dream chameleon agreed though she did not seem fully convinced youre doing well the dreamindream imbri woman figure reassured her on that level meanwhile the real mare pulled free of the slush and swam on toward the megaliths progress was faster as the water cleared well never get across the dream mare wailed never the dream girl agreed enthusiastically but the nix was not completely gullible heythose are your dream images real mares cant talk he blinked orienting on the reallife situationand discovered how they had tricked him he had been so busy snooping on the supposedly private dream that he had neglected reality as imbri had intended nix nix nix he screamed from a fish mouth set in a human face hurling a vapor spell the water thinned about them dropping them downbut now night mare they were close to the far side and the moat was becoming shallow imbri galloped up the slope and her head dipped under water only momentarily the nix froze the water the mare scrambled up on top of it as here in the shallower region the freezing was solid can i breathe now the dream chameleon pleaded breathe imbri responded clambering to shore they had made it behind them the nix sank wrathfully into a region of vaporizing ice his human head set on a fishs body you females tricked me he muttered then looking at the forming cloud of ice vapor i never did believe in subli mation it is the nature of males to be gullible imbri agreed in a dreamlet making a picture of the nix formed as a human being with the head of a fish wearing a huge dunce cap while an ice storm swirled about him they climbed out of the moat and stood wetly before the stone structure it was immense each vertical stone was the height of an ogre crudely hewn dauntingly massive they had little time to gawk a monster came charging along the inner edge of the moat the creature was horren dous it had horsehooves a lions legs elephantine ears a bears muzzle a monstrous mouth and a branching antler projecting from the middle of its face ho intruders the beast bellowed in the voice of a man flee as well as you can so i may have the pleasure of the hunt imbri recognized the monster it was a centycore this was a creature without mercy no use to reason with it they would need either to stop it or to escape it imbri ran she was a night mare she could outrun any thing she left the centycore behind immediately chameleon screamed and almost fell off she was still an inexpert rider not at all like the cruel horseman and could readily be dislodged by a sudden move imbri had to slow letting the poor woman get a better hold on her mane then she accelerated again in time to avoid the monster soon she had circled the region enclosed by the moat being confinedand there was the monster again facing her from in front imbri braked and reversed angling her body to prevent chameleon from being thrown off and took off the other way but she realized that this was no real escape she would not be able to concentrate on any thing else such as exploring the megalithic structure and searching for clues to the whereabouts of the good magi cians castle until she dealt with the centycore she slowed letting the thing gain though this terrified chameleon who was clinging to imbri for dear life imbri hurled back a dreamlet picture of herself as a harpy hover ing low calling what are you doing here monster chasing you you delectable equine the centycore bel lowed back snapping his teeth as punctuation ask a foolish question we only came to seek the good magician imbri sent i dont care what you seek you will still taste exactly like horsemeat and the centycore lunged his antler stab bing forward with ten points oh i dont like this chameleon wailed i wish my husband bink were here nothing too terrible ever happens to him that was surely an exaggeration but imbri understood her feeling she accelerated putting a little more distance between herself and the predator how could she nullify the centycore she knew she couldnt fight it as it was a magic beast well able to vanquish anything short of a dragon even if she were able to fight it she could not safely do so while chameleon rode her the woman would surely be thrown off and fall prey to the monster run through a walll chameleon cried sensing the problem i cant phase through solid things by day imbri pro tested her dreamlet showing herself as a mare bonking headfirst into a megalithic column and coming to a bone jarring stop she felt chameleons sympathetic hand pres sure though the accident had been only a dream the woman tended to take the dreams too literally only at nightand we have at least an hour of day left it seemed like an eternity with the centycore pursuing but the description of the problem suggested the answer suppose they somehow made it prematurely dark then imbri would be able to phase for it wasnt night itself but darkness that made her recover her full night mare properties otherwise the horsemans fire would not have been able to hold her the powers of the night came to whatever night there was natural or artificial whatever and whenever it was for night was nothing but an exten sive shadow just as day was nothing more than a very large patch of light how could they make it dark sometimes imbri under stood the moon eclipsed the sun rudely shoving in front of it and blocking it out but the sun always gave the moon such a scorching on the backside when the cheese did that that the moon hardly ever did it again soon there was very little chance of it happening right at this moment the moon wasnt even near the sun sometimes a big storm blotted out most of the light turning day to night but there was no sign of such a storm at the moment count that out too there was also smoke a bad smoldering blaze could stifle the day for a time if they could gather the makings of a fire then start it going chameleon imbri sent in a dreamlet if i let you off behind a stone so the monster doesnt see you could you make a fire a fire the woman had trouble seeing the relevance naturally enough to stop the centycore oh chameleon considered i do have a few magic matches that i use for cooking all i have to do is rub them against something rough and they burst into flame excellent make a big fire imbri projected a se quence in pictures chameleon hiding behind a stone col umn dashing out when the monster wasnt near gathering pieces of wood and dry moss and anything else that might blaze a big smoky fire keep it between you and the centycore actually the monster could go around the fire to get at the woman but that wasnt the point the fire was merely the mechanism to generate smoke i can do that chameleon agreed imbri accelerated leaving the centycore puffing behind veered near a megal ithic column and braked as rapidly as she could without night mare throwing her rider why hadnt she tried a fast decelera tion or bucking when the horseman had ridden her be cause she like a dumb filly hadnt thought of it but she suspected it wouldnt have worked anyway the man under stood horses too well to be deceived or outmaneuvered by one hence his namethe man who had mastered the horse chameleon dismounted and scurried behind the megalith while imbri galloped ostentatiously off attracting the monsters baleful attention it worked the centycore snorted after her never glancing at the woman it probably preferred the taste of horsemeat anyway imbri was re lieved if the monster had turned immediately on the woman there could have been real trouble imbri led the monster a merry chase keeping tantaliz ingly close so as to monopolize its attention meanwhile chameleon dashed about diligently gathering scraps of wood and armfuls of dry leaves and grass in due course the blaze started a column of smoke puffed up ho the centycore exclaimed pausing whats this imbri paused with him not wanting him to spy the woman behind the column thats a fire homface she projected to bum you up it wont bum me up the centycore snorted the dues of his antler quivering angrily i will put it out you couldnt touch it imbri sent her dreamlet show ing the monster yelping as he got toasted on the rump by a burning brand so you claim the centycore muttered glancing at his posterior to make sure there was no burning brand being shoved at it he approached the flame imbri skirted it to the other side and reached chameleon who climbed ea gerly on her back the woman evidently had been afraid with excellent reason but had performed well anyway that was worth noting she might not be smart but she had reasonable courage the centycore kicked at the fire a piece of wood flew out starting a secondary blaze a short distance away you wont put it out that way bearsnoot imbri projected with a picture of a burning branch falling on the monsters ant night mare ler and getting caught in it the dream centycore shook his head violently but the brand only blazed more brightly toasting his snoot in a moment the antler began to burn stop that the monster snapped shaking his antler as if it felt hot youll bum to pieces imbri dreamed causing the im ages antler to blaze more fiercely jets of flame shot out from each point forming bright patterns in the air as the monster waved its antler about the patterns shaped into a big word fire enough the centycore screamed he leaped for the moat and dunked his horn that doused the dream flame reality was too strong for it but imbri did manage to dream up a subdued fizzle where the points entered the water hey the nix protested picking up the dream image he froze the water around the antler trapping the centy core headdown the monster roared with a terrible rage and ripped his head free sending shards of ice flying out the nix changed to a fish and scooted away daunted now the centycore scooped icy water toward the fire with his antler but the fire was too big and too far away only a few droplets struck it with furious hissing hell had no anger like that of a wetted fire as imbri knew from experience the centycore considered then he scooped up a homful of muck from the edge of the moat and hurled that toward the fire there was a tremendous hiss as the blob scored and a balloon of steam and smoke went up ha ha mare hes putting it out the nix called from a safe distance across the moat apparently he felt that it was best to join sides with the monster i guess that knots your tail you shut up imbri projected in a dream that encom passed both nix and centycore he wont get it all thats what you think horsehead the nix cried encouraged by this the monster indulged in a fever of mudslinging his aim was good more gouts of smog bal looned out the fire was furious but was taking a beating curses hes doing it imbri projected with wonderfully poor grace night mare indeed he was soon the fire was largely out and smoke suffused the entire region making them all cough the light of the sun diminished for sunrays didnt like smelly smog any better than anyone else did was it dark enough imbri wasnt sure if this doesnt work were finished she projected privately to chame leon maybe you should dismount ill stay with you the woman said loyally imbri chalked up one more point for her character though she realized it might be fear of the monster that motivated chameleon as much as support for imbri now the centycore reoriented on them youre next marefacel he cried and charged imbri bolted for the megalith nearest the fire where the smoke hovered most thickly the centycore bounded after her he was sure he had her now the mare leaped right into the stone columnand phased through it chameleon in contact with her did the same the darkness was deep enough the monster following too closely smacked headfirst into the column the collision jammed several points of his antler into the stone trapping him there he roared and yanked but the stone was tougher than the ice had been and he could not get free that particular menace had been nullified actually imbri now recognized an additional concern she hadnt quite thought of before she had not been cer tain she could phase a rider with her she had brought the ogre out of the gourd but he had already been in it his body separate she had carried the girl tandy once but that had been in genuine night when she phased out of the horsemans pen she had left the hobble behind and it had certainly been in contact with her body so the precedents were mixed apparently she could take someone or some thing with her if she wanted to and leave it behind if she chose it was good to get such details straight an error could be a lot of trouble now they could explore the center of the stone structure they moved in cautiously there was a rumble as of a column wobbling in its socket and beginning to crumble some sand sifted down night mare from one of the elevated slabs both mare and woman looked up nervously what was happening the noises subsided as they stood apparently it was a random event possibly the result of the heat or smoke of the recent fire imbri took another step forward there was a long moaning groan to the right causing their heads to snap about it was just another massive stone column settling doing nothing again imbri stepped forward the huge rock slab above slipped its support and crunched down toward them imbri leaped backward whipping her head around and back to catch chameleon as the woman tried to fall off the massive stone swung down where the two of them had been the moment before thudding into the ground with an awesome impact this place is collapsingi chameleon cried lets get out of here but imbris memory was jogged by something isnt it strange that it should collapse the very moment we enter it after standing for what seems by the cobwebs and moss to have been centuries actually cobwebs could form faster than that but imbri wasnt concerned about minor details this resembles the handiwork of the spriggan she con cluded in the dream spriggan giant ghosts who haunt old castles and megalithic structures they are destructive in nature thats why old structures eventually collapse the spriggan keep shoving at columns and pulling at cross pieces until there is a col lapse but why right now chameleon asked since imbri hadnt directly answered her own question a creature had to make things quite clear for this woman to stop us from proceeding farther dont you remem ber the nature of magician humfreys castle oh yes i had to ask him a question once before i married bink and it was just awful getting in but not like this his castle is different each time a person comes to it ive seen it on my way to deliver dreams never the same night mare night more yes i remember she agreed he must spend a lot of time getting it changed so this is humfreys castle now a megalithic structure we have passed two hazards and are encountering the thirdthe spriggan they are preventing us from advanc ing by shoving the stones down in our path oh chameleon was not entirely reassured but we dont have a question were on the kings business yes i understand the good magician is not supposed to charge for official business he must not have realized we were coming but hes supposed to know everything but hes old and absentminded and set in his ways imbris dream image reminded her still she was not pleased at having to run this gauntlet so we must find out how to get past the ghosts imbri concluded then we will be able to consult the magician despite his forgetful ness the ghosts at castle roogna are friendly chameleon said evidently not liking the spriggan no doubt i am supposed to convey greetings from the ghosts of the haunted house in the gourd to one of the ghosts of castle roogna i havent yet had the opportu nity who one named jordan do you know him not well he keeps mostly to himself but i do know millie who is not really a ghost any more theyre all pretty nice i think except for the sixyearold ghost who she hesitated not wishing to speak evil of the dead who is a brat imbri supplied helpfully i suppose but the others are nice spriggan are not they are to nice ghosts as ogres are to elves thats awful evidently chameleon was not going to be much help on this one imbri skirted the fauen stone and started forward once more there was another groan this one to the left imbri shied rightand the column there began to crumble threateningly oh i dont like this chameleon cried imbri paused she didnt like this either but there had to be a way through there always was this was the na ture of the good magicians defenses he did not like to be bothered by frivolous intrusions so he set up challenges only smart determined and lucky petitioners could get through imbri knew king trent would not have sent them here if the matter had not been important so they had to conquer the challenges too bad the smoke had dissipated so she could no longer phase them through solid obstacles that would have made it easy but already the shadows were lengthening soon it would be dusk and that would solve her problem all she had to do was keep from getting squished under a rock before then she really would have been smarter to wait for night before trying to enter the castle but now she was in it and would carry through with marish stubbornness she thought about the spriggan they were distantly re lated to night mares being both material and immaterial in their natural forms they were invisible but they could solidify their mouths to issue groans and their hands to shove stones they never touched living creatures directly however contact with warm flesh discombobulated them and it took them a long time to get recombobulated there might be the answer all imbri had to do was make the giants show themselves then advance on them maybe im going to try something risky imbri projected to chameleon her dreamlet showed herself charging directly at a horrendous ghost would you like me to set you down outside the megaliths where it is safe chameleon was frightened but firm its not safe the centycore is there maybe hes gotten unstuck from the col umn i will stay with you good enough now we must provoke the ghostgiants into showing themselves when they do you must act terri fied a touch of humor penetrated the womans naivete i will imbri nerved herself and took a step forward there was an immediate warning groan she projected a dream to the vicinity of the sound youre pretty bold hiding behind night mare big stones her dream image said with an expression of contempt you wouldnt scare anyone if you were visible oh yeah the sprig she had addressed responded look at this mare the ghost took form before her he was the size of a man but his arms were huge and hairy and his face was dominated by two upcurving tusks groooaan he groaned chameleon shrieked in presumably simulated terror but imbri moved directly toward the ghost the sprig startled shrank to the size of a midget then catching itself it expanded to the size of a giant booooot it boooooed shoving at a ceiling stone the stone budged sending down a warning shower of sand chameleon screamed again it seemed she didnt like sand in her hair but as the mare neared the ghost the sprig jumped out of the way avoiding contact they passed right through and imbri knew she and chameleon had penetrated well in toward the castle there was another invisible groan from another sprig imbri charged it though another column was crumbling her ploy worked the column crashed the other way not striking her the ghosts never pulled columns down upon themselves thus where the spriggan stood was the safest place to be despite the scary noises they made all she had to do was keep charging them and she would be safe it worked columns and ceiling stones tumbled all around her but imbri navigated from the groan to groan and threaded the dangerous maze successfully abruptly they were inside the castle proper chapter forging the chain well hello chameleon the gorgon said she was a mature almost overmature woman whose impres sive proportions were verging on obesity life had evidently been too kind to her her face was invisible so that there was no danger from her glance and the mare imbrium too do come in and relax we are here to see good magician humfrey chame leon said king trent sent us of course he did dear the gorgon agreed we have been expecting you chameleon blinked but you tried to stop us its just humfreys way hes such a dear but he does have his little foibles those creatures wouldnt really have hurt you imbri snorted she was not at all sure ofthatt you both must be hungry the gorgon continued blithely we have milk and honey and alfalfa and oats in any combination you two may desire milk and oats chameleon said promptly honey and alfalfa imbri projected in a dreamlet ah so it is true the gorgon said pleased you really are a night mare what a cute way of talking she led them to the dining room where she brought out the prom ised staples chameleons oats were cooked over a little magic flame then served with the milk and a snitch of honey from imbris soaked alfalfa it was an excellent din ner then they were ushered into the surly presence of good magician humfrey he had a tiny cluttered study upstairs stuffed with old tomes multicolored bottles magic mirrors and assorted unclassifiable artifacts humfrey himself hunched over an especially big and ancient volume he was gnomelike with enormous mundanetype spectacles and wrinkles all over his face he looked exactly as old as he probably just might be well he snapped irritably chameleon and the mare imbrium are here for advice the gorgon said deferentially you have them on your cal endar i never pay attention to that bit of paper the good magician grumped im too busy but he looked at a chart on the wall there in large letters was the note pair mare oh yes certainly he grumbled well lets get on with it there was a pause the advice the gorgon reminded the magician gently have they paid the fee theyre on the kings business no fee what is xanth coming to he mumbled ungraciously too many creatures expecting a free lunch that was dinner chameleon said brightly again there was a pause the gorgon touched hum freys elbow he looked up startled almost as if he had been dozing of course beware the horseman his old eyes returned to his book but weve already had that message imbri protested in a dreamlet humfreys brow corrugated yet farther such a thing would have been impossible without magic oh well it remains good advice he cogitated briefly break the chain he looked at his tome again i dont understand chameleon said it isnt necessary to understand humfreys answers the gorgon explained they are always correct regard less imbri wasnt satisfied dont you folk realize theres a war on she projected in an emphatic dream her picture showed brutish mundanes tromping like ogres through the brush frightening small birds and despoiling the land with sword and fire the image was taken from her memory of night mare the lastwave we have to find out how to defend xanth humfrey looked up again of course i realize look at my book they crowded closer to peer at his open tome there was a map of xanth with portions marked in color here is where the mundanes are invading humfrey said pointing to the northwestern isthmus they have not yet penetrated far but they are well organized and tough and determined and the auspices are murky divination doesnt work very well on mundanes because they are nonmagical creatures but it seems the nextwave of con quest is upon us it will be the end of xanth as we know it unless we take immediate and effective measures to pro tect our land ttie nextwave chameleon repeated horrified we knew there would be another wave sometime the gorgon said all through the history of xanth there have been periodic waves of conquest from mundania all hu man inhabitants derive from one wave or another or did until very recently but each wave sets xanth back im measurably for the mundanes are barbaric they slay whatever they do not understand and they understand very little if this wave succeeds in conquering xanth it will be a century before things return to normal but how do we stop it chameleon asked i told you humfrey snapped break the chain imbri exploded with full night marish ferocity storm clouds roiled in her dream image booming hollowly as they fired out fierce jags of lightning this is no time for cute obscurities we need a straight answer to a serious prob lem do you have an answer or dont you a jag struck near humfrey humfrey gazed soberly at her one hand idly swatting away the jag of lightning though it was only a dreamlet image there are no simplistic answers to a complex problem we must labor diligently to piece together the best of all possible courses or at least the second best depend ing on what is available the mare backed off she did realize that some an swers could not be simple or clear magic often had pecu night mare night mare liar applications and predictive magic was especially tricky even when mundanes werent involved night nears the gorgon said gently indeed the clut tered scrap of a window showed nearblackness outside you will be able to travel more freely then we must let magician humfrey labor in peace she led them to an other room where there was a couch you will want to rest first i will wake you at midnight that was good enough there were sanitary facilities and a pleasant bed of straw imbri lay down and slept she could rest perfectly well on her feet but suspected the gor gon would worry about hoofprints and droppings and such so lying down was best actually there was hardly any place in xanth that could not be improved by a nice fertilizerrich dropping but human beings tended not to understand that a night mare visited her of course imbri recognized her instantly mare crisium she exclaimed in her dream how is everything back home the dark horse is worried crises said she like im bri could speak in the human language in the dream state he says the menace advances and you are the only one who can abate it and you have fallen into the power of the enemy i did but i escaped imbri replied i delivered the message to king trent now im on a mission for him it is not enough the king is about to be betrayed you must tell him to beware the horseman i told you i told him that imbri flared you must tell him again imbri changed the subject wheres vapors she had a special affinity for both crises and vapors for those two mares had picked up half souls at the time imbri got hers but the others had not retained them their halves had been replaced by the halves from a demon cynical and cruel which gave them a certain competitive edge their bad dreams were real terrors and they got the most chal lenging assignments even so they had not been satisfied and had finally turned the half souls into the central of fice so imbri was now the only night mare with any part of a soul but still she felt closer to those other two they understood the impact a soul could have vapors is with chameleon in a moment the woman will wake screaming then you both must go and warn the king imbri started to protest but then chameleons scream sounded and both woman and mare were jolted rudely awake instantly vapors and crises bolted leaving only their signature hoofprints imbri was saddened she was now considered a mortal creature who was not permitted to see a night mare in the waking state that wrenched at her for she had spent most of her long life in the profes sion how quickly the prerogatives and perquisites of em ployment were lost once a creature retired but that was the price she paid for the chance to see the rainbow she went to chameleon who clutched at her hysteri cally oh it was awful imbril such a bad dream is that really what you used to do not that well imbri sent with a tinge of regret ob viously mare vaporum retained the terrifying touch that imbri had lost what did you dream i dreamed king trent was close to death or something almost as awfull we must go right back and warn him she was still breathing raggedly her lovely hair in disarray a simple premonition of danger to another personand the client was in shambles imbri realized that she had re tired none too soon she would have had to bring in a fire breathing sea monster to achieve a similar effect she was just too softhearted get on my back woman imbri projected well ride immediately the gorgon appeared carrying a lighted candle that il luminated her empty head oddly showing the snakelets that were her hair from the inside surface midnight she said time tooh i see youre ready do come again soon we will chameleon called her mood lightening he cause of the contact with the familiar facelessness of a friend then imbri plunged through the wall and they were off night mare night mare this time there was no trouble from the spriggan centy core or nix imbri was in her night mare form phasing through everything and chameleon phased with her be cause that was the nature of night mare magic they gal loped in a straight line toward castle roogna passing blithely through trees and rocks and even a sleeping dragon without resistance chameleon was pleasantly amazed she was a good audience for this sort of thing and that made imbris mood improve oh no chameleon exclaimed suddenly i forgot the elopement that was rightthis was the scheduled night for the marriage of prince dor chameleon was the mother of the victim of course she wanted to attend we can make it imbri sent no we cant chameleon said tearfully it was to happen at midnight and were hours away and its past midnight now imbri hated to have this lovely and innocent woman un happy we can travel fasterbut its a route you may not like anything chameleon exclaimed if we can even catch the end of itmy poor baby boyi know hell be so happy imbri had a certain difficulty following the womans thought processes this time but decided chameleon had mixed feelings about her son and his marriage mothers were notorious for that sort of thing then hold on tight and dont be afraid of anything you see imbri galloped into a patch of hypnogourds and plunged into a gourd it was dark as they phased through the rind and became part of the gourd world of course they were not part they were alien visitors who normally would have found access only by looking through a peephole instead of passing physically through this was a gray area of magic possible only because of imbris special status as an agent of liaison then they were in a graveyard oh are we there al ready chameleon asked the zombie cemetery not yet imbri projected stay on me for if the woman ever set foot inside the world of the gourd alone she would not readily get free that was the nature of the region of night a walking skeleton appeared it reached for chameleon its hollow eye sockets glinting whitely go away the woman cried knocking the bony arm away youre no zombie youre too clean startled the skeleton retreated they are a lot more cautious about visitors since an ogre passed through and intimidated them imbri sent it had taken weeks after the ogres departure for the skeletons to get themselves properly organized since their bones had been hopelessly jumbled together probably some of them were still wearing the wrong parts imbri charged into the haunted house a resident ghost loomed flaring with awesome whiteness at chameleon are we back at castle roogna already she asked i dont recognize this ghost disgusted the ghost faded out thinking it had lost its touch imbri knew the feeling there were few things as humiliating as having ones efforts un appreciated when ones business was fear now imbri shot out the front wall of the house she gal loped along a short walkway then out through the decora tive hedge she emerged into a bleak moor the ground became soggy opening dark mouths to swallow intruders but the night mare hurdled them handily the terrors of the world of night were for others not herself she might be retired but she was not yet that far out of it she passed on to a mountain shaped like a burning ice berg galloping up its slope amorphous shapes loomed reaching for chameleon with multiple hands and hungry snouts misshapen eyes glared now the woman was frightened for she had had no prior experience with this type of monster zombies and ghosts were familiar but not amorphous monsters she hunched down and hid her face in imbris mane that was another trait of human folk they tended to fear the unfa miliar or the unknown though often it was not as threaten ing to them as the known then they were out through the rind of another gourd their shortcut through the world of night completed they emerged from a gourd patch much nearer castle roogna night mare night mares could travel almost instantly anywhere in xanth simply by using the proper gourds this route was not available to imbri by day since she was solid then fortunately it was now night chameleons fright eased as she saw that she was back in the real world of xanth is that really where you live she asked among the horrors daytime xanth seems far more hazardous to me im bri projected tangle trees and solid boulders and the mundanesthose are monsters enough i suppose so chameleon agreed doubtfully are we near the cemetery very near imbri veered to head directly toward it wait chameleon cried we must go in costume costume what was this creature thinking of now we must look like zombies so no one will know evidently so imbri humored her since it was difficult to argue with a person of such low intelligence and sweet personality they stopped and the woman found stink vines and ink pots which she used to make each of them look and smell rotten her artistry was reasonably good chameleon did indeed resemble a buxom fleshloose zom bie more than the lovely older woman she really was imbri looked like a halfdead nag now they continued to the cemetery where it lurked in the lee of castle roogna the zombies were up and about in strength not many things stirred them but marriage was in certain ways akin to death in its finality and disillu sion we conspired with the zombie master chameleon whispered to one of imbris perked furry ears he roused his minions for the occasion though he could not attend himself one of the zombies is a justice of the peace i dont know what that is but it seems he can marry them she was all excited with anticipation zombies were loosely formed creatures so naturally would have a justice of the piece imbri realized it was not too great a stretch of the rationale to extend the authority to restore lost pieces of zombie to the union of full crea tures of flesh marriage in xanth was whatever one made of it anyway the real test of it would be the acceptance by night mare the partners in it and by the wider community rather than any single ceremony as they stepped onto the graveyard grounds things changed suddenly the zombies were twice as ghastly as before dressed in tuxedos and gowns that concealed much of their decay but made the parts that showed or fell off more horrible in contrast all were standing quietly be tween the gravestones facing the largest and dankest crypt at the north end where an especially revolting zombie stood with a tattered book in his spoiled hands a femal zombie came up her eyeballs were sunken and parts of her teeth showed through her wormdecimated cheek her low decplletage exposed breasts like rotten mel ons are you a centaur she inquired in a surprisingly normal voice im chameleon your majesty chameleon said dis mounting evidently recognizing the voice and this is the mare imbri who brought me back in time for the wedding have we missed anything wonderful chameleon queen iris cried embracing her with a sound like funguses squishing take your place in the front row by the chancel youre the mother of the groom after all you havent missed a thing these events always run late and youre the mother of the bride chameleon said happy at the way this was working out the queen zombie turned to imbri her rotten body ro tating at differing velocities her illusion was a morbid work of art you really are a mare she asked yes i see you are since youre not related to the principals you should stand in back but imbris my friend chameleon protested loyally ill stand in back imbri projected quickly she knew little about human folk ceremonies and much preferred to be out of the way oh my thats interesting magic the queen said al most like my illusion only yours is all inside the head or do i mean all in the mind i didnt know animals could do magic i am a night mare imbri clarified night mare night mare oh that explains it of course the queen turned away going to greet other arrivals chameleon went dutifully to the front while imbri made her way back she came to stand between two zombies it seemed the lucky couple for whom this ceremony was wait ing had not yet arrived so there was time to talk hello she projected to the one on the left the answer was an awful morass of foulness resembling a blood pudding riddled with maggots this was a true zombie who might have been dead for centuries she had just glimpsed its actual brain imbri was not unduly fin icky for every monster was allowed its own style in xanth but she was accustomed to the clean bones of the walking skeletons in the gourd she tried not to shy away from this person for that would be impolite but she did not attempt to communicate with it again imbri tried the figure on the right are you a zombie too she sent tentatively this person was alive but startled did you address me or was i dreaming yes imbri agreed he turned to peer more closely at her are you a per son or a horse yes im afraid im not used to this concentration of magic he said i may have made a faux pas no thats west of here imbri corrected him its true you are a horse and you did address me yes i am the night mare imbrium a literal nightmare how original one never knows what to expect next in xanth i am ichabod the archivist from what you term mundania my friend the centaur amoldehe is currently in mundania as thats his office liaison to that regionbrought me here so i could do re search into the fantastic and ahem pursue a nymph or two that is what nymphs are for imbri agreed politely she knew it was a very popular human entertainment but his reference to mundania alarmed her was he one of the enemy oh no im no enemy ichabod protested and imbri realized she had forgotten to separate her private thought from the formal dreamlet she would have to be more care ful about that now that she was among waking people mundania is many thingsyou might say all things to all people it seems mundania has extremely limited access to xanth while xanth has virtually unlimited access to mun dania this includes all the historical ages of our world therefore xanth is but an elusive dream to the mundanes most of whom do not believe in it at all while mundania is a prodigious reality to xanthians who are very little inter ested in it am i boring you he was doing that of course but imbri had the equine wit not to say so i deal in dreams and i am elusive so i am certainly a creature of xanth really you mean you are a dream yourself youre not really there he reached out a hand tentatively to touch her shoulder not exactly she phased out and his hand passed through her fabulous he exclaimed i must put you in my note book you say your name is imbrium as in the sea of rains on the visible face of the moon how very intrigu ing he might be mundane but she saw that he was not en tirely ignorant yes they named the sea of rains after my grandam who lived a long time ago i inherit my signa ture from her and the title to that portion of the moon she phased back to solid and stamped a forehoof making a moonmap imprint with her own name highlighted oh marvelous ichabod cried i say would you do that on a sheet of my notebook i would love to have a direct record imbri obligingly stamped his page the map showed up very clearly on the white paper since of course there was a coating of good rich cemetery dirt on her hoof oh thank you thank you the mundane exclaimed admiring the print i have never before encountered a genuine nightmarenot in the flesh so to speak it is not every mundane who receives such an opportunity if there is any return favor i might possibly do you night mare night mare just tell me who is here and how the ceremony is to proceed i have never attended an elopement i shall be delighted to though my own understanding is far from perfect it seems that prince dor and princess irenetheir titles are similar but have different deriva tions as he is the designated heir to the throne while she is merely the daughter of the kingboth of whom i met eight years ago in mundania are at last to achieve nuptial bliss or such reasonable facsimile thereof as is practica ble imbri realized that mundanes had a more complex man ner of speaking than did real people she cocked one ear politely and tried to make sense of the convolutions but he seems not yet to be aware of this and she is supposedly not aware that virtually everyone in castle roogna or associated with it is attending it is supposed to be an uncivil ceremony performed in the dead of night by a dead manie a zombie a most interesting type of creature incidentally queen iris has cloaked all visitors with illusionshe does have the most marvelous facility for thatso they seem to be zombies too and she has mixed them in with the real zombies so that no one not conversant with the ruse is likely to penetrate it oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceivel that is a mundane quotation from he broke off for there was a stir to the south just in time for he had been about to bore imbri again he did seem to have a formidable propensity for dullness all the zombies real and fake hushed waiting the pale moonlight showed a young woman of voluptu ous proportion stepping through the fringe of the castle roogna orchard hauling along a handsome young man well just cut through the zombie graveyard she was say ing were almost there almost where he demanded irritably youre being awfully secretive irene im tired i have just come back from centaur isle where i couldnt make much of an im pression ive consulted with king trent about the next wave incursion and how to contain it and now i just want to go home and sleep youll have a good sleep very soon i promise you irene said a sleep like none before a rock chuckled itll be long before you sleep you poor sucker it said shut up irene hissed at the rock then to dor come on were almost there almost where dont trust her the ground said its a trap irene stamped her foot hard oooo the ground moaned hurting i wish youd just tell me what youre so worked up about dor said dragging me out here for no reason no reason hah a chunk of deadwood chortled irene kicked it into the moat where there was a brief wild splashing as a moat monster snapped it up i suppose you do have the right to know she said as they entered the graveyard all the guests had abruptly faded into invisibility thanks to queen iriss illusion its an elopement a what elopement idiot a tombstone cracked better run before youre lost irene rapped the stone on the top and it went quiet she seemed to have had experience dealing with talking objects were eloping she said clearly im taking you secretly away to get married then youll have something nice in bed with you something nice dor asked bemused you mean youre giving me a pillow this time it was dor she kicked as the whole cemetery guffawed evilly me you oaf stop teasing me i know you arent that stupid i can be very soft and warm when i try oooool the crypt said in a naughtynaughty voice not many of that kind herev but we havent set the date dor protested thats why were eloping well be married tonight be fore anyone knows so there wont be any foolishness the job will be done but night mare she turned and idssed him emphatically you have an objection dor obviously daunted by the kiss was silent marvelous just marvelous the way she manages him ichabod murmured beside imbri the couple arrived at the crypt zombie justice where are you irene called the officiating zombie appeared holding his book also slowly the rest of them phased into dim view under the continued glow of the moon were going to be married by a zombie dor de manded weakly wont the union fall apart ha ha i have laughed she shook her head so that her green hair flounced darkly in the limited light its the only person i could get without alerting mother irene ex plained there was a choked snort of mirth from the depths of the audience irene looked around and spied the crowd well all you zombies didnt have to rip yourselves from your graves she said in a spookswillbespooks manner but i suppose some witnesses are in order i didnt know there were this many zombies buried here dor said there arent you poor stiff the crypt said these are quiet the queen zombie snapped now irene was suspicious that voice is familiar of course it is you luscious dummyi the crypt said then a black cloud roiled out of nowhere and emitted a roll of thunder that drowned out whatever other informa tion the crypt disgorged theres something very funny about this dor said squinting at the loud cloud irene reverted to first principles whats funny about zombies they love grim occasions lets get on with it the zombie magistrate opened his book a page fell out the volume was as decrepit as the zombie oh how i hate to see a book mistreated ichabod breathed beside imbri wait a moment dor protested you tricked me out here irene i didnt agree to get married tonight night mare oh well i intend to marry someone should it be one of these zombies now thats a bluff i can call dor said irene stood in silent but almost tangible grief her shoul ders shook tears plopped into the sod at her feet dor aided by a touch of the queens illusion assumed a form somewhat like the hinder part of a giants boot a first class heel ah well he mumbled inadequately irene flung her arms about him and planted another kiss that made the audience murmur with envy even the zom bies seemed moved when she was through dor stood as if numbed as well he might classic ichabod whispered that girl has absolutely mastered the art the zombie magistrate mumbled something unintelligi ble he had no tongue and he was reading from the page less book with empty eyeball sockets i do irene said firmly the zombie mumbled something else as his nose fell onto the book he does irene said nudging dor the zombie made a final effort causing several loose teeth to dribble out of his mouth ive got it irene said she produced a ring with an enormous stone that glowed in the moonlight so strongly it seemed to illuminate the graveyard put it on me dor no not that finger idiot this one dor fumbled the moonstone onto the designated finger were married now irene said now you can kiss me dor did so somewhat uncertainly the audience broke into applause the remaining illusion faded revealing the zombies and people standing throughout the graveyard irenes gaze swept across the crowd mother she exclaimed indig nantly this is your mischief i refreshments are served in the castle roogna ball room queen iris said controlling a catlike smirk come dearsmustnt keep the king waiting dor came out of his trance you made king trent fetch refreshments night mare night mare of course not dor queen iris said i supervised that chore myself yesterday my husband refused to participate in this little charade the spoilsport but i know hell want to congratulate you he should congratulate me irene said landed dor after all these years in the whole castle one honest person dor muttered but he did not seem unhappy i knew the king would not betray me well youre married now queen iris said at last now come on in before the food spoils the zombies stirred they liked the notion of spoiled food soon all the living people were across the moat where sleepy moat monsters made only token growls of protest and inside castle roogna where food and drink had been set out imbri found herself near the beverage table since she did not drink humanstyle drinks and did not much care for humanstyle treats she was satisfied to watch ichabod still beside her felt otherwise i love to eat he confided it is my inane ambition eventually to become obese he took a buttercup filled with a sparkling brown liquid this looks suitably calorific he tilted it to his mouth as the liquid passed his ups ichabod made a funny little jump brown fluid splashed over his face i say he sput tered why did you do that mare do what imbri projected kick me i did not kick you she protested i distinctly felt a boot in my posterior then he cocked his head looking at her feet but you dont wear boots if i kicked you you would have a map of the moon on your rump imbri sent ichabod nibbed the affected portion true it must have been an hallucination he tipped the remaining liq uid to his mouth again he jumped someone did kick me he ex claimed but there was no one to do it imbri got a notion let me sniff your drink she sent ichabod held down the cup for her imbri sniffedand felt a slight shove at her tail i thought so this is the rare beverage boot rear distilled from the sap of the shoefly tree its the drink that gives you a real kick boot rear ichabod repeated thoughtfully i see he picked up another cup perhaps this differs it seems ef fervescent but colorless he put it cautiously to his lips paused and when no suggestion of a kick manifested gulped it quickly down shining bars formed about him enclosing him so tightly that he yelped with discomfort let me out he cried imbri quickly put a hoof on a nether bar and used her nose to shove the higher bars apart in a moment ichabod was able to squeeze out his suit torn abrasions on his body i suppose that was the result of the drink too he asked irritably imbri sniffed the empty cup yes thats injure jail a concoction of incarcerated water she reported i should have guessed but the man hadnt given up he took a third drink sipped it with extreme caution paused took a deeper sip waited and finally swallowed the rest this is excellent then he fidgeted he reached inside his jacket and drew out a card where did this come from he found another up his sleeve and a third dropped out of his pant leg imbri sniffed the cup no wonder this is card hider she reported this begins to grow tiresome ichabod said imbri would you do me the immense favor of locating me a safely sedate beverage imbri obliged sniffing her way along the table seam croda she sent foot frunch june pruice ill take that last ichabod said that sounds like my style i think it is presently june in my section of mun dania chameleon came to join them wasnt that a wonderful wedding she asked delicately mopping her eyes i cried real tears she picked up a drink wait imbri projected and ichabod cried together it was an unclassified beverage but chameleon was already sipping it it seemed she had to replace the fluid lost through her tears then her night mare night mare feet sank into the floor oh myim afraid i took a droft sink she exclaimed im sinking imbri and ichabod managed to haul her back to floor level i wouldnt want to seem to criticize the queen who i am sure put a great deal of attention into this spread of refreshments ichabod said but in some quarters it might be considered that certain types of practical jokes become shall we say tiresome now the queen herself approached have you taken any of these drinks she inquired brightly she had clothed herself in a fantastically bejeweled royal robe that was perhaps illusory i trust you find them truly novel and not to be taken lightly or soon forgotten i want this occasion to make a real impression on the guests mutely the three nodded the drinks were all that the queen described queen iris picked one up herself and sipped delicately then she spit it out again indelicately her pattern of illusion faltered revealing a plain housedress in lieu of her robe whats this she demanded a truly novel beverage that makes a real impression and is not soon forgotten ichabod murmured dont get flip with me mundane the queen snapped a miniature thundercloud forming over her head whats in this cup imbri sniffed drapple ink she projected drapple ink the queen exclaimed her gems re forming and glinting furiously thats meant for signing official documents indelibly whats it doing on the re freshment stand ichabod picked up another cup of boot rear perhaps this one is better your majesty he suggested offering it to her it certainly made an impression on me the queen sniffed it she took a step forward as if shoved from behind thats not what i ordered she cried and now her gems shot little lances of fire some miscreant has switched the drinks oh wait till i get my claws on that chef so queen iris had not been responsible for the joke chameleon looked relieved the queen paused turning back ohchameleon she called i really came to ask if you had seen my hus band the king he doesnt seem to be here would you look for him for me please of course your majesty chameleon agreed she turned to imbri will you help me look please he might be in a dark room meditating and we have another message to give him imbri re minded her remembering beware the horseman or break the chain if only we knew what chain chameleon sighed i havent seen any chains ill help too ichabod said i do love a mystery they looked all through the downstairs castle but could not find the king could he be upstairs in the library ichabod asked thats a very nice room and he is a liter ate man yes he is often there chameleon agreed they went upstairs going to the library a ghost flitted across the hall but was gone before imbri could send a dreamlet to it if she ever had a moment when she wasnt busy she would catch up to a ghost and inquire where jor dan was so she could give him the greeting from the ghosts of the haunted house in the gourd world the library door was closed ichabod knocked then called but received no answer i fear he is not in he opined i do not like to enter a private chamber unbidden but we should check the others agreed cautiously they opened the door and peeked in the room was dark and quiet there is a magic lantern that turns on from a button near the door chameleon said fumbling for it in a mo ment the lantern glowed illuminating the room there was king trent sitting at the table an open book in front of him your majesty chameleon cried we have to tell you something is wrong ichabod said he is not moving they went to the king he sat staring ahead taking no notice of them this was odd indeed for king trent was normally the most alert and courteous person as men of genuine power tended to be night mare imbri projected a dream to the kings mind but his mind was blank hes gone she sent to the others alarmed he has no mind the three stared at one another with growing dismay xanth had lost its king chapter sphinx and triton by morning the new order had been established king trent had been retired to his bedroom for the dur ation of his illness and prince dor had assumed the crown and mantle of kingship and sat momentarily on the throne making it official for dor was the designated heir and xanth had to have a king he had vaulted in one strange night from single prince to married king if there was to be a visible transformation in the young man it had not yet materialized he called a meeting of selected creatures after breakfast the golden crown perched somewhat askew on his head and the royal robes hung on him awkwardly these things had been fitted for king trent who was a larger man and it seemed king dor preferred to wear them unaltered so that they could be returned when king trent recovered the shadows of dors eyes showed that he had not slept few of them had the joy of the elopement had shifted without pause to the horror of involuntary abdication in deed king trent had lost his mind while the others were celebrating in the zombie graveyard it was hard not to sus pect that the two events were linked in some devious way the new queen irene evidently thought they were she had lost a father while in the process of gaining a husband we have a crisis here at castle roogna king dor said speaking with greater authority than his appearance night mare suggested queen irene stood at his side poised as if ready to catch him if he fell her eyes were dark and red and not from any artifice of makeup or magic how well she knew that it was the misfortune of her father that had cat apulted her to replace her mother as queen this was hardly the way she had wanted it former queen iris was upstairs with kingemeritus trent watching for any trifling signal of intelligence no one knew what had happened to him but with the mundane invasion they could not wait for his recovery the king turned to a blackboard that his ogre friend had harvested from the jungle on it was a crudely sketched map of xanth with the several human folk villages marked as were centaur isle and the great gap chasm that severed the peninsula of xanth but that few people remembered the mundanes have crossed me isthmus dor said pointing to the northwest they are bearing south and east wreaking havoc as they progress but we dont know what type of mundanes they are or how they are armed or how many there are king trent was devel oping that information but i dont know all of what he knew i will consult with the good magician humfrey but that will take time as we dont have a magic mirror con necting to his castle at the moment the one we have is on the blink we shall try to get it fixed meanwhile were on our own that reminded imbri your majesty she sent in a dreamlet we have magician humfreys message for the king in the excitement we forgot lets have it dor said tiredly it was beware the horsemanwhich we had already told king trent and break the chain that was his other message dors brow wrinkled he had a full head of intermediate shade hair that was handsome enough when disciplined but it was now a careless mop were it not for the crown he would have been easy to mistake for some weary travel er i dont understand maybe my father would have understood irene mur mured he could have had dialogue with the good magi night mare dan maybe theres a chain in the armory whose magic will be released when it is broken sometimes humfreys obscure answers are more trou ble than they are worth dor grumbled why cant he just come out and say what he means i can perhaps explain that the mundane ichabod said first he may believe he is speaking plainly since he knows so much more than others do second prophecy tends to negate itself when made too obvious therefore it has to be couched in terms that become comprehensible only when conditions for fulfillment are proper maybe so dor said or maybe humfrey is getting too old to giverelevant answers any more if we dont find a chain in the armory well just have to wage this war our selves the first thing we have to do is get good recent information ill have to send a party i can trust to scout the mundanes ill go chameleon said king dor smiled even a king does not order his own mother into danger especially when she is as pretty as mine imbri exchanged a glance with ichabod aware that what dor really meant was that chameleon was well into her stupid phase a probable disaster on a reconnaissance mission at any rate i doubt you could travel fast enough to i mean with imbri chameleon said anyone is safe with her ah the night mare dor considered is it true mare that you can move as fast as thought itself yes king imbri replied when i use the gourd but thats only at night and can you keep my mother safe even by day i think so king dor paced the floor the oversized robe dragging i dont like this but ive got to have better information and my mother is one person i trust absolutely i think id better send grundy the golem along too to question the plants and animals id go myself to question the stones if you must stay here and rule irene said holding his arm possessively night mare yes i really wish we could include an expert in the party who would know exactly what to look for its so important that we know precisely what were up against mundanes are not all alike ichabod coughed your majesty i fancy myself some thing of an expert in mundane matters since i am of mun dane persuasion myself i should be glad to go and identify the invading force for you dor considered ichabod i have known you for eight years intermittently you have done excellent research on the magic of xanth and your information has been invalu able when we have needed to research mundania you en abled us to locate and rescue king trent when he was cap tive in mundania i do trust you and value your information and know king trent felt the same thats why he gave you free acess to all the things of xanth and allowed you to research in the castle library but you are mundane i can not ask you to spy on your own people my people do not ravage and pillage and slaughter wantonly ichabod protested do not judge all mundanes by the transgressions of a few those few may be enough to destroy xanth king dor said yet you make a good case but you would need a steed to keep up with the night mare and i do not think any of our available creatures are suitable a centaur might help but most of them are down at centaur isle organiz ing for the defense of their isle i should know i just re turned from there so the day horse might help imbri projected the day horse king dor asked i met him in the forest he was mundane steed for the horseman but he escaped and helped me escape he doesnt like the mundanes he might be willing to carry ichabod though if no bit or spurs were used if he knew ichabod was not one of the enemy mundanes imbri twitched her skin where her own sore flanks were healing i am to meet him at the baobab tree at noon king dor considered briefly very well i dont like or ganizing such an important mission so hastily but we cant defend xanth at all unless we get that information if you night mare meet this day horse and if he agrees to help ichabod can ride him but you mother will be in charge of the mission only please listen to grundy chameleon smiled i have been stupid since before you were born dor i know how to get along i will listen to grundy now the golem appeared he was as tall as the length of a normal hand and resembled the wood and rag he had originally been fashioned from though now he was alive most people of xanth had magic talents he was a talent that had become a person well get along fine he said i care about chameleon i know you do king dor said i was dors guide when he wasnt even a prince grundy said asserting himself i know chameleon from twentyfive years back cant say the same for this nag though imbris ears flattened back in ire she sent a dreamlet of a thousandtoothed monster chomping the golem then again grundy said shaken as he had been the last time they clashed maybe ive met her in my dreams chameleon smiled in an inoffensive way night mares are very scary in dreams but nice in person take care of yourselves king dor said gravely he seemed quite different from his petulance and indecision of the prior evening as if the responsibility of leadership had indeed brought out a new and superior facet of his character there is not one of you i would care to lose he smiled to show there was a modicum of humor there though it wasnt really necessary we must say goodbye to queen iris chameleon said she led the way upstairs and imbri and grundy followed not knowing what else to do the kings bedroom had become an enormous dark cave with stony stalactites depending from the domed ceil ing and deep shadows shrouding the walls muted wailing sounded in the background fallen king trent had the as pect of phenomenal grandeur while queen iris was garbed in the foulest rags the setting was illusion courtesy of the queens talent but the sentiment was real i just wanted to say your majesty that we miss the king and will try our best to help chameleon said stand ing on a rocky escarpment queen iris looked up she saw how lovely chameleon was and knew what it meant thank you chameleon im sure your son will make a good king she said speak ing slowly and clearly so the woman would understand of course there was no assurance that dor would be able to handle the job let alone the mundanes but this was not the occasion for the expression of such doubts im going north now with mare imbri and grundy and ichabod maybe to spy on the mundanes im sure you will spy well queen iriss gaze dropped her politeness was almost exhausted goodbye your majesty chameleon said the queen nodded then the visitors left the gloomy cave and found the stairs leading down they grabbed some supplies reviewed the map selected a promising daytime route and moved out imbri galloped ahead to the baobab tree for it was coming on to noon and she didnt want to miss the day horse she carried grundy who could talk to any living thing and would not seem like a human person ichabod and chameleon followed more slowly on foot the baobab was a monstrous tree it towered above the jungle its apex visible from far away the oddest thing about it was the fact that it grew upside down its foliage was on the ground and its tangled roots were in the air a space around it was clear for the baobab didnt like to be crowded and used hostile spells to drive away competitive plants imbri poked her nose in the foliage was the day horse here he hadnt specified which day he might be else where this noon the golem made a windy whispering sound the tree replied similarly bao says the horses waiting inside grundy reported imbri nosed her way to the tremendous bulbous trunk there was a split in it wide enough to admit a horse she entered cautiously night more inside it was like a cathedral with the dome of the tree rising high above wooden walls convoluted down to a tes selated wooden floor from inside the tree looked right side up perhaps that was illusion there in the center stood the handsome day horse shin ing white his mane and tail were silken silver and his hooves gleamed his small ears perked forward alertly on either side of his forelock he was almost the prettiest sight she had seen now theres a horse you can call a horse grundy murmured appreciatively no fishtail no unicomhom no shady colors no bad dreams the mundanes may not be good for much but they certainly know how to grow horses imbri could only agree despite the golems obliquely de rogatory reference to herselfthe implication that xanth could not grow good horses the only male of her species she had known before was the night stallion who was her sire the dark horses had been closely interbred for millen nia but now they seldom bred at all because the relation ship was too close new blood was neededbut what was she thinking of this was a mundane horse not really her kind her new solidity was giving her new sorts of reaction the day horse made a nicker he says come forward so he can see you in the light black mare grundy translated unnecessarily of course imbri understood equine talk she stepped forward she hadnt seen the day horse more than fleetingly by day before and was now as skitterish as a colt the sheer masculinity of him had a terrific impact on her you are lovely as the night the day horse nickered you are handsome as the day imbri nickered back oh what a thrill to interact with such a stallion i just hate to interrupt this touching dialogue grundy cut in with a certain zest but you do have business you know imbri sighed the confounded golem was right quickly she projected a dream of explanation describing what she wanted from the day horse he considered i dont like going near mundane human night mare folk he said in the dream they might capture me again he stomped his left foot nervously making the brass circlet on it glint then i would never get away imbri well understood once he was tethered he would not be able to phase away by night as imbri could for he was not magic like the mundane human beings he was limited to mundane devices this was the terrible curse of all mundanes they could not do magic most of them did not even believe in magic which might be a large part of their problem fortunately their offspring in xanth soon became magical that was why the mundane conquests never lasted more than a generation or so the intruders stopped being mundane you dont have to go near them grundy said in equine language all you have to do is carry ichabod close enough so he can look at them hes mundane himself so he knows mundane the day horse neighed his nostrils dilating and white showing around his eyes but hes a tame mundane the golem continued loyal to xanth he doesnt want to see it despoiled he likes the wild nymphs too well what does he do with nymphs imbri asked curious mostly he just looks at their legs the golem explained hes too old to chase them very fast im not sure he would know what to do with one if he caught her but he likes to dream no offense to you night mare grundy was get ting more civil as he became better acquainted with her no offense she sent thats not the kind of dream i carry anyway the day horse was shaking his head and scuffling the floor with his hooves i dont like mundane men i know about them they cant be trusted say thats right grundy said you came with them you can tell us all about them what time and region of mundania are they from time region the day horse seemed confused mundania is all times and all places grundy said with assumed patience thousands of years and more territory than in all xanth we need to know when and where you night mare come from so ichabod can look it up in his moldy tomes and find out bow to fight the men i dont know anything about that the day horse neighed all i know is how the horseman put the bit in my mouth and the spurs to my sides and made me go imbri nickered with sympathy she understood exactly youve got to know the golem cried how can you spend your whole life among the mundanes and not know all about them the day horse just looked at him ears angling back imbri caught on mundane animals are stupid like chameleon she projected to the golem in a private dreamlet he never noticed the details of the mundane society he was probably kept in a stable and pasture that must be it grundy agreed irked he probably couldnt even talk until he came to xanth then he brightened speaking inside the private dreamlet so that the day horse would not overhear at least he cant betray us to the mundanes he wont understand our mission either yes imbri acknowledged sadly hes such a fine looking animal but not a creature of xanth not like the night stallion who was every bit as intelligent as a human being it was really too bad they returned their attention directly to the mission somehow weve got to convince you to help grundy told the day horse otherwise the mundane wave may wash right across xanth then you wont have anywhere to es cape to mundanes will control everything that daunted the creature i dont want that of course you might hide from them easier if you took off that brass circlet you wear the golem said the day horse glanced down at his foreleg where the band clasped it oh no i couldnt do thati why not as long as you wear it the horseman knows youre his horse if you took it off he might think you were some other horse especially if you got your coat dyed black the day horse communicated slowly and with difficulty but with certainty if i take off the circuit and they catch me they will know i am a deserter and will butcher me for night mare horsemeat if i leave it on they may think i only got lost and will not treat me so bad grundy nodded not a bad effort of logic for you he admitted so the band represents ironicallyfor all that its brass not irona kind of insurance because they be lieve youre too dumb really to try to escapeand the fact that you dont remove it confirms that belief the day horse nodded back he was not indeed quite as stupid as he seemed but if you give ichabod a ride and then are later caught by the mundanes they will believe that you were captured by the other side and had no choice you did not return to the mundanes because the enemy wouldnt let you thats insurance too the day horse considered slowly the sense of it pene trated does this renegade mundane of yours use spurs no ichabod is an old man who has probably never rid den a horse before in his life a centaur maybe because the centaur archivist amolde is his closest friend but thats not the same youd have to step carefully to prevent icha bod from falling off the day horse digested that certainly ichabod did not sound like much of a threat no bit we dont use that sort of thing in xanth creatures carry people only when they choose to imbri here is giv ing me a ride because she knows i cant get about the way she can you dont see any bit in her mouth do you in the end the day horse was swayed by the golems persuasion and agreed to carry ichabod on condition that there be no direct contact between him and the mundanes i dont even want to see a mundane he insisted if i saw them they might see me and if they see me they will chase me and they might catch me you could outrun them the golem protested then they would shoot me with arrows so i dont want to go near them at all fair enough the golem agreed they departed the tree picked up the archivist and headed north sure enough ichabod was unsteady on horseback and had to hang on to the day horses mane to stop from sliding off one side or the other but gradually night mare he got used to it and relaxed and the horse relaxed also the lack of a bit and reins made all the difference soon they were able to pick up speed imbri became aware of another aspect of group interac tion she picked up chameleon without thinking but real ized by the reaction of the day horse that the woman had not been mentioned before at first the day horse had hesi tated then when he saw how pretty chameleon was he watched her with interest if it had been chameleon who had needed the ride it would have been easier to persuade this animal the day horse was a fine runner making up in brute strength what he lacked in intellect and imbri found her self reacting on two levels to him she liked his body very well but was turned off by his slow mind yet she re minded herself she liked chameleon well enough despite her slowness maybe it was that chameleon was not a po tential breeding object yes there it was the presence of a fine stallion meant inevitable breeding when imbri came into season as a night mare she had been immortal and ageless and never came into season or at least not seriously but as a mate rial animal she was subject to the material cycle she would age and eventually die and so there would be no one to carry on her work and maintain title to her sea of the moon unless she had a foal material creatures had to breed just to maintain their position and she would breed if she had the opportunity this was no imposition she wanted to do it but she also wanted to produce a handsome and smart foal the day horse was handsome but not smart that boded only half a loaf for the foal yet the day horse was probably the only other possible stallion extant in xanth in or out of the gourd without him there would be no breed ing at all unless she searched out one of the winged horses of the mountains she understood those types hardly ever deigned to associate with earthbound equines however that kept the options severely limited and made the deci sion difficult would there be a decision when a mare came into sea sonand this was a cyclical thing not subject to her volun night mare tary control when she was materialany stallion present would breed her nature took it out of the province of indi vidual free will perhaps wisely human folk were other wise they could breed at any time and the complexities of their individual natures meant that often they bred at the wrong time or to the wrong person or did not breed at all that probably explained why horses were so much stronger and prettier than human beings but humans were gener ally more intelligent probably because it required a smart man to outsmart and catch a difficult woman or a smart woman to pick out the best man and get him committed to the burden of a family the midnight scene in the graveyard had illustrated that prince dor had no doubt played inno cent to avoid getting married but had this time been outma neuvered and unless imbri found a way to control her own breeding she would have a stupid foal so if she didnt want that she would have to place distance between herself and the day horse when her season came on fortunately that would not occur for a couple of weeks she would have time soon they arrived at the great gap chasm which sepa rated the northern and southern portions of xanth few people knew about the gap because of the forgetspell on it it didnt even appear on many maps of xanth since they were on the kings business they had access to the invisible bridge that spanned it most people forgot about the bridge along with the chasm but it was there for those who knew how to find it imbri as a night mare felt very little effect from the forgetspell so had no trouble the day horse however was hesitant i dont see any bridge he neighed no one can see the bridge imbri projected in her daydreamlet she made the bridge become visible as a gossa mer network of spidersilk cables in her night dream duty she had not needed to use the bridge but had known of it and the two others as well as the devious paths down and through the gap she had perfect confidence in all the bridges and in the charms that kept monsters off the paths though she would be wary of descending into the gap when the gap dragon was near no spell ever stopped that monster it ruled the chasm deeps that was night mare another thing normally forgotten which meant the dragon caught a lot of prey that didnt know it existeduntil too late its all right day horse ichabod said reassuringly i have been across it before i know magic seems incredible to mundane folk such as are you and i but here in xanth it is every bit as reliable as engineering in our world i have no fear in crossing encouraged by that and by now well aware that icha bod was mundane yet harmless but not stupid the day horse followed imbri out into midair over the chasm dont worry gnmdy called back you cant fall it has rails on both sides except for the center where a stupid harpy crashed through them and left a blank stretch the day horse stumbled horrified for he was now ap proaching the center the golem laughed its not true imbri projected immediately dont lis ten to the golem he has an obnoxious sense of humor the day horse recovered his balance he glared at grundy his ears flattening back he dropped a clod on the bridge a symbol of his opinion grundy bad made an en emy foolishly it was one of his talents they got across without further event and trotted on north they still had a long way to go and would not reach the region of the mundane line this day now the terrain became rougher for they were traveling crosscountry northern xanth was less populated by hu man folk than wascentral xanth so there were fewer peo ple paths one good trail led directly to the north village where chameleons husband bink had been raised but they intended to avoid human settlements to keep their mission secret the mundanes surely had spies snooping near the various villages ichabod warned so they went east of the north village threading the jungle between it and the vast central zone of air in the center of northern xanth the jungle thinned to forest with clusters of everblues everyellows and evergreens and then diminished to wash and scrub as if to compensate the ground became rougher their trot slowed to a walk and the walk became labored both horses shone with sweat and blew hot blasts night mare from dilated nostrils chameleon and ichabod unused to such extended travel were tired and sore and even the obnoxious golem was quiet riding in front of chameleon where he could hang on to imbris mane the trouble with travel was that it was wearing in addition it was hungry business horses had to eat a lot and it was hard to graze while trotting they would have to stop at the next suitable field and spring they found but there was no suitable spot here the land was pretty much barren certainly there was no spring on the hillside and no river maybe we should cut west toward the north village grundy said much better terrain there but it would delay us and perhaps expose our mission ichabod protested there must be a better alter native imbri reflected she had not been to this region recently because there were very few people in it and therefore few calls for bad dreams there are some lakes scattered through this region with lush vegetation around them but i cant place them precisely she projected to the group the local plants and animals should know where they are however she gave her mane a little shake waking grundy who it seemed had had the indecency to nod off during her reflection huh the golem said oh sure i can check that he began questioning the bushes they passed soon he found a fruitfly who had been seeded at a lake to the north but the fly says to beware the sphinx the golem reported the sphinx got a sunburn and is very irritable this week beware the sphinx chameleon asked i thought we were to beware the horseman thats good advicel the day horse neighed how often have i felt that monsters spurs you mean like imbris flanks the golem asked i find it hard to believe anyone would want to poke holes in the hide of a living horse what kind of a monster is this horseman the day horse did not like grundy but this question mellowed him somewhat a human monster spurs are an indefensible cruelty ichabod commented night mare night mare the typical horse will perform to the best of his ability for his rider spurs substitute the goad of pain for honest incentive to the disadvantage of the animal the day horse nodded evidently getting to like the ar chivist better there was always something attractive about a wellexpressed amplification of ones own opinion imbri agreed emphatically and the bit is almost as bad she sent i dont see any scars on your flanks grundy said to the day horse i learned long ago to obey without question the day horse replied he hasnt used the spurs on me in some time the scars are now so faint as to be invisible but if he caught me now after i escaped him it would be terrible there would be blood all over my hide imbri visualized bright red blood on the bright white hide and flinched what horror surely so ichabod nodded man has a very poor rec ord in his treatment of animals in xanth it is not as bad for animals are much better able to defend themselves dragons are grundy agreed laughing and ant lions and basilisks and harpies they were mounting a steep bald hill that barred their way north aggressive carnivorous vines and nettles to east and west made this the best route laborious as it was but soon they would be over it and might be able to relax a little going down the other side where the sweet lake was supposed to be imbri and the day horse dug their hooves into the reddish turf scuffling the sparse dry grass aside the slope was spongy and warm from the sun suddenly the bank exploded into a bunch of sticks cha meleon screamed both horses reared and plunged to the sides startled flying snakes grundy cried fend them off i rec ognize this species theyre mean and unreasonable and some of them are poisonous no use to try to talk to them they only respect a clout on the snoot chameleon and ichabod had staffs they had harvested from a forest of general staffs they had been using these to brush away clinging vines and such now they used them in earnest as the snakes darted through the air jaws gaping they were not big serpents but they might be poi sonous as grundy had warned imbri dodged away from them as well as she could avoiding a green one and a red one but a yellow one got through and bit her on her left front knee she reached down with her own teeth and caught it behind the head and tore it loose but the punc tures hurt she had never had to worry about this sort of thing as a full night mare a few moments of vigorous action got them away from the snakes who could not fly very fast air simply was not as good to push against as ground they resumed plodding up the hill it is strange that both the night stallion and the good magician provided the same warning ichabod reflected aloud it was one of his annoying habits he talked a great deal about obscure aspects of situations boring people since the horseman is an obvious enemy and perhaps a leader of the invading mundanes naturally loyal xanth cit izens should avoid him why waste a prophecy belaboring the obvious i fell into his power anyway imbri confessed i car ried the warning but i did not recognize the horseman when i met him if the day horse hadnt helped me es cape i couldnt stand to see a mare as pretty as you in the power of a man as cruel as that the day horse said in the community dream imbri was providing i was terribly afraid to come so close to his camp you didnt seem at all afraid imbri returned compli menting him thank you the day horse said i look bolder than i am i suppose that seemed to be true the day horses fear of the in vading mundanes amounted almost to a fetish imbri felt he was overreacting but outside of that he did look bold with his brilliant white coat and flaring mane and tail and muscular body all factors considered it remained a plea sure being with him with a final effort they crested the red knoll now the land of xanth spread out around them in a sufficient if not marvelous panoply like the clothing of an illkempt night mare giant in the distance to the south was the barely visible crevice of the gap chasm to the west was a faint tail of smoke rising from the cookfires of the north village to the north a lake ichabod exclaimed happily with rich green color around it surely suitable grazing for the equines and fruits for the unequines theres our evening campsitel so it seemed but theres an awful mess of corrugations between us and it grundy said i can travel a straight line to it imbri sent i am used to holding a straight course regardless of the view once i know where im going good enough grundy said imbri started down the slope leading the wayand stumbled she went down headfirst and grundy and cha meleon were thrown ofe they all went rolling down the rough slope helplessly until they fetched up in a gully on the side of the knoll grundy picked himself up shedding red dust and bits of grass what happened horseface he demanded grump ily put your foot in it my knee gave way imbri projected abashed that never happened before chameleon righted herself even dirty and disheveled she looked lovely it was not necessarily true that women grew ugly as they aged she was the impressive exception is it hurt she asked imbri rolled over got her forefeet placed and heaved herself up frontfirst in the manner of her kind but she immediately collapsed again the knee would not support her weight under stress chameleon looked at it as she might inspect the scrape on the leg of a child she was not bright but that sort of thing did not require intelligence only motherly concern you were bitten she exclaimed its all swollen the day horse arrived picking his way carefully down the slope bitten he neighed so those snakes were poisonousl grundy said why didnt you tell us one got you we could have held it for interrogation and maybe found the antidote horses dont complain imbri sent she had never been night more bitten before and had not properly appreciated the possible consequence her leg had hurt but she had assumed the pain would ease it had done sobut the extra strain of the downhill trek had aggravated what she now realized was not a healing but a numbness her knee had no staying power i will carry all the people the day horse offered i can handle it after a brief consultation they acceded the stallion was tired and sweaty but still whole and strong he could bear the burden chameleon and grundy joined ichabod on the day horses broad back it was a good thing he was along the whole party would have been in trouble had it been imbri alone for transportation now it was up to imbri to get herself on her feet she set her good right leg under her and heaved herself up now that she wasnt depending on her left knee it couldnt be tray her she tried her left leg but the numbness remained it was better to hold it clear and hop along on the other three it was possible to walk jerkily slowly this way perhaps we could fashion a splint ichabod said to keep your knee straight so you can at least put weight on it that was an apt notion they scouted around and found a projecting ledge from which several fairly stout poles sprouted ichabod dismounted and took hold of one but though it wiggled crazily under his effort it did not come loose from the ground cut it grundy said chameleon had a good knife where she kept it imbri wasnt sure for it had not been evident before but this suggested the lovely woman was not entirely helpless she stooped beside the pole applied her blade and sawed at the base the ground shook there was a rumble chameleon paused looking askance at the others no meaning in a rumble grundy said except to get out of here before an earthquake decides to visit earthquakes dont decide to visit ichabod protested they are natural inanimate phenomenamerely the re night mare lease of stresses developing within or between layers of rock there was another nimble closer and stronger not in xanth the golem said here the inanimate has an ornery personality as is evident when king dor converses with it everything has its own individuality even a quake the archivist had to step about to keep his feet during the second shaking there is that he agreed nervously chameleon sawed again at the pole her blade was sharp but the pole was tough progress was slow a gash appeared from which thick red fluid welled i wonder what kind of plant that is grundy said he made some noises at it then shook his head it doesnt answer maybe we can break it on now ichabod said becom ing increasingly uneasy he wrenched the pole around more violently than before suddenly the entire horizontal ridge of poles lifted up a slit opened in the ground beneath them revealing a moist glassy surface crossed by bands of white brown and black it was pretty enough for a polished rock formation thats an eye grundy exclaimed ichabod hanging from the pole looked into the mon strous orb aghast whats a hill doing with an eye he demanded and what am i suspended by an eyelash the golem said i should have realized its alive but its not a plant i was trying to talk to the eyelash of an animal naturally it didnt answer eyelashes dont ichabod dropped to the lower eyelid one foot jammed accidentally into the eye the eye blinked the lid smashed down like a portcullis the man wrenched out his foot and scrambled away get on the horse grundy cried get out of here the three of them scrambled aboard the day horse who moved out rapidly imbri hobbled after them suddenly imbri caught on the sphinx she broadcast this is the sphinx we were warned to beware of it grundy agreed as usual we walked right onto the danger without recognizing night mare the ground shook again and buckled the monstrous face of the sphinx was opening its mouth a tremendous bellowing roar came forth in a hurricane blast of air when it pains it roars grundy cried oh for pitys sake ichabod grumbled this is no time for idiotic puns xanth is mostly made of puns the golem told him you have to watch where you put your feet or you end up stepping on puns or something chameleon said noting where some horse clods had fallen meanwhile the day horse was galloping off over the flexing cheek of the monster toward the shoulder the tre mendous sphinx was reclining its face tilted back so that the slope was by no means vertical the pink knoll they had climbed was its sunburned pate every hoofprmt must have aggravated the monster but it had not become truly aroused until its eyelash had been attacked imbri chameleon called from far ahead realizing that the mare was not maintaining the pace keep going imbri projected ill follow but die could not follow well on three legs with the face of the sphinx shaking all over she lost her footing and rolled toward the mouth which was now sucking in a gale of breath she scrambled desperately and managed to avoid itbut then rolled helplessly across the cheek in the wrong direction now the mouth was between her and her friends she fetched up against another projection it was the huge curving outcropping of the ear beyond it the face dropped unkindly far to the cracking and shuddering ground imbri decided to stay where she was at least the ear could not chomp her but what about herfriends they could be caught and tromped they were on the dangerous part of the face then she had a notion she pumped her dream projec tion up to maximum strength and sent the sphinx a vision of absolute peace and contentment imbri wasnt expert at this sort of dream all her experience had been with the other kind but she did have half a soul now and it was a gentle soul and it helped her fashion a gentle dream night mare night mare slowly the irritated sphinx calmed it submitted to the dream of soft sunny pastures with little sphinxes gambol ing on the green cool mists wafted across its burning pate its eyes closed broken eyelash and all and the rumbling diminished carefully imbri left the cavern of the ear and hobbled back along the huge cheek toward real ground but her hooves irritated the sunburned skin resuming the waking process the monster was not nearly as deeply asleep as it had been before any little thing could disturb it now a creature of such mass had considerable inertia whether heading into sleep or out of it and at the moment it was almost in balance she had to retreat to the safe ear unable to depart during daylight imbri settled down for a nap herself she kept the sphinx passive by projecting a nominal sweet dream just enough to lull it back to sleep when it thought about waking fortunately sphinxes liked to sleep that was why they were very seldom seen wander ing around xanth there was a myth about one who had retreated to mundania to find a suitably quiet place and who had found a nice warm desert and hunkered down for a nap of several thousand years the ignorant locals thought it was a statue and knocked off its nose there would be an awful row when it woke and discovered that meanwhile it was easy for this one to doze off when no one was trotting on its face or blasting off its nose this was just as well considering the situation of imbris party when she woke it was dark now she could move freely her bitten leg did not need to support any weight now that she was able to dematerialize she got up and galloped through the sphinxs head where sweet dreams still roamed her hooves got coated with sugar and honey she emerged from the other ear and moved on north to ward the lake soon she found it trotted across it and found the camp of the others chameleon was the first to spy her mare imbri she screamed joyfully you got away she hugged imbri fiercely and the mare remained solid for the occasion it was easy to like chameleon despite her intellectual handi cap especially at a time like this no creature except a basilisk would object to being hugged by a person of cha meleons configuration she wanted to return for you gnmdy said but we told her no all we could have done was get ourselves in trouble and maybe make things worse for you my son the king told me to listen to the golem cha meleon said apologetically her lovely face showing her dis taste it was best imbri agreed in a general dreamlet i hid in the sphinxs ear until night then shifted to immaterial form your leg seems better ichabod observed it isnt but its no worse maybe it will improve by morning they settled down for the remainder of the night cha meleon gnmdy and ichabod slept while the day horse and night mare grazed on the rich pasturage and snoozed imbri had to go solid to crop the grass but she could phase out while chewing it and she moved slowly enough so as not to aggravate her knee and indeed as the pleasant noc turnal hours passed the numbness faded and strength re turned she had at last thrown off the lingering effect of the snakes venom in the morning rested they all were feeling fit chame leon stripped and washed in the shallow edge of the lake ichabod turned his back selfconsciously but grundy openly goggled age sure comes gracefully to some folk he remarked but you should see her in her offphase i have ichabod said stiffly she has the most re markably penetrating mind i have encountered and the aspect of the most horrendous hag the golem said smirking she merely manifests the properties of all women with less ambiguity they all begin lovely and innocent and end ugly and smart i guess thats why you like looking at nymphs grundy retorted they dont have minds so theres nothing to dis tract you from their important points oh i dont lookat the points ichabod protested i look at their legs night mare night mare why dont you look at chameleons legs theyre as good as any and better than most chameleon is a person and a friend the archivist said severely oh she wouldnt mind the golem was enjoying him self needling the man hey doll is it all right if ichabod looks silence ichabod hissed flushing certainly chameleon called back im under water she was under water all the timel ichabod said catch ing on as the golem rolled on the ground with mirth there was nothing to seel something stirred across the lake there seemed to be a cave just below water level now several heads showed tritons grundy said stand back from shore they can be omery indeed the mermen approached with elevated tridents chameleon tried to rise then remembered her nakedness and settled back in the water not smart enough to realize that her modesty could be fatal imbri charged back to guard her and the day horse joined them three tritons drew up just beyond the kicking range of the horses hoi what mischief is this one cried do you come to muddy our waters his threepointed spear was poised menacingly imbri broadcast a pacifying dreamlet she was getting better at this with practice we only pass by meaning no harm her dream figure of a black mermaid said we did not know this lake was occupied by your kind now the triton peered at chameleon whose torso he had briefly glimpsed when she started to stand that one must have nymphly blood he remarked appreciatively but several mermaids had followed the tritons from the cave thats a human woman one said leave her alone the triton grimaced i suppose these people are all right they havent littered the grounds say grundy asked as the tension eased do you folk know the siren she settled in a lake somewhere in this general region several years back the halfmer sure she comes by here sometimes she can split her tail into legs so she can cross between lakes when theres no waterway she married morris and theyve got a halfling boy like her part human but okay nice people i know the siren from way back grundy said and her sister the gorgon who married good magician hum frey he relaxed seeing the tritons relax where is the siren now maybe we can pay her a visit they live by the water wing a mermaid said i dont think your kind could get there safely you have to swim or go through the zone of fire the golem shrugged so we cant get there from here it was a nice thought anyway do you know any special hazards north of here imbri asked in another dreamlet dragons on land river monsters in the water man eating birds in the airthe usual riffraff the triton said carelessly if you got by the sphinx you can probably han dle them thank you well try to avoid them imbri sent and let the dreamlet fade the group organized once chameleon had gotten dressed and trotted north imbri had no further trouble with her knee the toxin had dissipated leaving no perma nent damage and she carried woman and golem as before they kept alert avoiding the dragons river monsters and predator birds and by evening arrived near the mun dane front the invaders had penetrated well into xanth which shortened the trip the fleeing animals gave grundy horrendous reports of their violence it seemed the mun danes were using fire and sword to lay waste to anything they could and were such deadly warriors that even large dragons were getting slam this did not bode well for the defense of xanth i think my turn has come ichabod said i must ac tually see the soldiers to identify them specifically there should be details of armor and emblem that will enable me to place them if not immediately then when i return to my references already i know they are medieval or earlier since they employ no firearms thats fortunate firearms chameleon asked looking at her own slen night more night more der limbs as if afraid they would flame up her gesture was touching in its innocence those are weapons utilizingsomething like magic powder ichabod clarified imagine well cherry bombs shot like arrows from tubes i hope xanth never encounters that sort of thing i wish my world had never encountered it he looked around suppose i ride imbri while cha meleon rides the day horse i dont believe king dor in tended his mother to expose herself to extreme danger im sure he didnt grundy agreed emphatically it was bad enough when she exposed herself to the tritons thats why he sent me along to look at his mother bathing ichabod inquired with a certain faint malice grundy got on everyones nerves go with the day horse chameleon grundy said ig noring the gibe well spy on the mundanes and rejoin you later we ichabod asked frowning and the day horses ears flattened back neither of them was thrilled by the pros pect of the golems company im coming with you i can leam a lot by talking with the plants and animalsmaybe enough to spare you the natural result of you own heroics ichabod smiled with certain scholarly resignation there is indeed that i confess to being somewhat of a don quixote at heart donkey who chameleon asked blinking donkey hotay to you the archivist said smiling ob scurely it is not spelled the way it sounds even here in xanth he was an old don a mundane scholar buried in his books exactly as i was before dor irene grundy the ogre and arnolde the centaur rousted me out of my sine cure and opened a literally fantastic new horizon to my perspective don quixote set himself up as a medieval knight in armor and rode about the iberian countryside having adventures that were far more significant for him than for the spectators just as i am doing now there was an encounter with a windmill a truly classic episode what kind of bird is that chameleon asked oh a windmill is not a bird it is we had better get going grundy interjected impa tiently yes indeed ichabod agreed we shall locate the two of you by asking the plants your location when we return do stay out of danger both of you the day horse neighed you can be sure of that grundy translated for him chapter the next wave bmbri carried the golem and the mundane scholar toward the terrible mundane front xanth had not suffered a wave invasion in a century and a half this was an awe somely significant event i believe i perceive some tension in you imbri icha bod said am i imposing on you i was thinking how long it has been since the last wave imbri sent i was young then only twenty years old but i remember it as if it were last year you were there ichabod asked surprised thats righti forgot that you are one hundred and seventy years old since the lastwave as i reconstruct it was one hundred and fifty years ago he paused i have of course researched this historically but have talked with no eyewitnesses i would dearly love to have your personal im pressions well i only saw bits of it at night on dream duty imbri demurred the big battles were by day and i could not go abroad by day then still i would be fascinated the scholar said your im pressions in the context of historical detail would help complete the picture maybe you had better give that context grundy said night mare getting interested in spite of himself so we all know ex actly what were talking about the golem of course had not been around for the lastwave and hated to admit igno rance on anything certainly ichabod said historical detail was dear to his old heart my friend arnolde centaur provided some considerable information it seems that the firstwave of human colonization occurred over a thousand years ago before that there were only the animals and hybrids such as the centaurs they have a touching story about the ori gin of their species get on with the recent stuff grundy said um yes of course ichabod agreed irritated there were a number of waves perhaps a dozen most of them quite brutal as the mundanes invaded and ravaged xanth after each wave conquered the land and settled down the children would turn up with magic talents becoming true citizens of xanth then in fifty or one hundred years an other wave would come destroying much of what the prior wave had accomplished finally one hundred and fifty years ago the lastwave was so savage that the people of xanth decided to prevent any future invasions once things settled down in about fifteen years a magician king adapted a magic stone of great potency to project a deadly shield that destroyed anything crossing through it and set that shield entirely around xanth the shield kept xanth safe from intrusions for one hundred and ten years until king trent who had spent time in mundania assumed power after the demise of the storm king and abolished the shield it seemed that mankind had been diminishing in the absence of immigration so it was better to risk another invasion than to suffer certain extinction of the human species in xanth by stiflement thus for the past quarter century there has been no shieldand now the conse quence would seem to be upon us king trent refused to reinstate the magic shield preferring to fight off the invaders and perhaps with his power of transformation he could have done it but now now king trent is out of the picture and king dor doesnt know how to set up the shield grundy finished night mare anyway the mundanes are already inside xanth so thats no answer i am not certain it ever was an answer ichabod said i believe king trent was correct there has to be freedom of the border and commerce between xanth and mun dania unfortunately not all mundanes come in peace the lastwavers as i understand it were mongol mun danes of our thirteenth century ad circa if i do not misremember my asiatic history they believed they were invading the peninsula of korea today korea is severed by a line very like the gap chasm with a major city where castle roogna is suggesting a most intriguing parallel ism he noted grundys open yawn and broke off that conjecture but thats irrelevant to the present reprise the mongols were truly savage conquerors and i can well understand the xanthians decision to have no more of that he shook his head but it was imbris impressions i wanted how did the mongols look from this side mare in the bad dreams i had to deliver they were savage flatfaced people imbri projected they killed all who opposed them using arrows and swords they rode horsesall those horses were killed after the wave was stopped because of the terror the people of xanth had for my kind after that that was the equine tragedy horses never intended mischief for xanth i am sure they didnt ichabod said consolingly the innocent often suffer most fromthe rigors of war that is one of the appalling things about violence imbri was getting to like this man some of the dreams i delivered were to the lastwavers we night mares have always been fair and impartial we deliver our service to all in need no matter how undeserving the wavers suffered fears and sorrows too especially when their drive began to falter they killed animals without compunction or com passion yet they cared about their own families left be hind in mundania and about their comradesinarms they saw xanth as a terrible magic land with deadly threats everywhere well of course it is to mundanes ichabod said yet a person of xanth would have similar difficulty going night mare about in my own portion of mundania particularly if he did not know the patterns of highway traffic had i not been protected by my friends when first invited here i would not have survived long my first day in xanth i almost walked into a nickelpede nest i thought the nickelpedes were units of currency xanth natives avoid such things routinely grundy said but i do remember those metal dragons in your land shooting smoke out of their tails and carrying people around inside them for hours before digesting them it was awfull when a person gets into unfamiliar territory hes in much danger we walked right onto that sphinxs head for exampleand we had been warned to beware the sphinx and to beware the horseman ichabod added and to break the chain the trouble with these warnings is that we seldom understand them until it is too late i dont even know where the chain is let alone how to break it grundy said fortunately thats not my worry king dor is no doubt pondering that question now i some how doubt there is any chain in the castle roogna ar mory ichabod returned to the subject are you saying imbri that you found the mundane invadersthe mongolsto be human beings that is to say feeling creatures like the rest of us you know im fascinated to converse with a person who shared as it were the same stage with the mongols who were centuries before my time that was the strangest thing about it imbri admitted in the dream among themselves they were perfectly de cent creatures but in battle they thought of people as they did dragons and basilisks and salamanders they actually liked slaying them it is an unfortunately familiar pattern in mundania ichabod said first one group dehumanizes another then it destroys it in xanth no real line between human and creature exists many animals are better companions than many human folk he patted imbris flank and how are we to define the centaurs who have aspects of both but mundania has no recognized magic so all animals are stu pid unable to speak the language of man this leads to terrible wrongs i much prefer xanths way night more yes it is handy for communication the golem agreed here the animals and plants speak different languages while human folk speak only one vice versa in mundania so animals dont really speak the language of men its just that some have learned it as you have no one has ever figured out what enchantment makes all human folk intel ligible to each other here even invading mundanes it just seems that the moment any human type steps into xanth the language matches there is much remaining to leam about the magic of xanth ichabod said i only hope i live long enough to fathom some significant part of it imbris ears perked forward she sniffed the breeze mundanes she projected instantly the others were alert soon they all perceived the smoke of a burning field why do they destroy so wantonly grundy grumbled they cant use burnedout land any better than we can ichabod sighed im afraid i can answer that the point of such destruction is not to preserve land for ones own use but to deprive the opponent of its produce to diminish his capacity for war starving creatures cant fight effec tively since there is magic everywhere in xanth and the mundanes have none they hurt xanthians much more than themselves by ruining the land for everyone it is an unkind but effective ploy we have to stop them grundy said of course but it will not be easy we must spy out their nature then organize to contain them that is why our mission is so important a side can not prevail militar ily without good information about the enemy imbri continued forward carefully watching for the dread mundanes there was a slight wind from the north whipping the fire south and small creatures were fleeing it but fire was hardly unknown in xanth firebreathing dragons fireflies firebirds and salamanders started blazes all the time so this one would bum out in due course since rivers and dense juicy vegetation were all over xanth and did not ignite well possibly the fire would be put out when it irritated a passing storm cloud and got rain night mare night mare dumped on it the land of xanth put up with many in dignities but once properly aroused it could find ways of dealing with nuisances it seemed to imbri that the mun dane nextwavers had just about worn out their presumed welcome the trouble was to remain downwind of the fire was to suffer the discomfort of heat and smoke to cross to the upwind side was to risk discovery by the enemy this scouting was awkward in practice however necessary it was in theory this will never work ichabod said coughing as a curl of smoke teased him i fear we are in an untenable situa tion i dont like to counsel delay but perhaps we should wait till evening waiti grundy cut in i think i see an errant gust imbri looked terns were wheeling to the west first one and then another taking turns in the manner they were named for from the way they maneuvered and coasted and floated in the sky she could tell the direction of the wind they rode it was bearing north it was indeed an er rant gust going counter to the prevailing wind probably it was a young breeze not yet ready to settle down and pull with its elders while the tem is wheeling ill not dream of squealing the golem said in singsong know what will happen when that gust dusts the fire ichabod who had been wincing at something he must have taken as another pun caught on thick smoke back in their faces blinding themand can you phase through it imbri yes i can phase through smoke when its thick enough imbri projected that was what she had done to escape the centycore at magician humfreys castle but its unreliable when it thins ill turn solid again once we see them clearly we can depart in utter haste ichabod said he was now taut with nervousness well aware of the danger they faced they may have horses can you outrun your own kind imbri considered if theyre like the day horse they can match my pace by day not by night better not risk it ichabod said we are in no condi tion to oppose armed men but with the smoke we wont have to grundy pro tested why dont we find a region where they have been one that has not yet been burned imbri projected grundy can question the grass there and get a description excellent notion ichabod agreed there is that the golem liked a job that made him important the errant gust arrived at the fire the flames swirled gleefully and reversed their angle and the smoke poured north there was dismay among the ranks of the mun danes as it enveloped them they coughed and gagged in a minor cacophony imbri picked her way along the edge of the reversed fire looking for a good route north suddenly men rushed out of the smoke coming south oops grundy said a small miscalculation imbri bolted she ran southbut an arm of the fire had made its way there and its smoke now came back toward her it was not thick enough for concealment or phasing though she veered east not wanting to leap through the flames unless she had toand came up against the mun danes they had quickly taken advantage of the change in the wind to overrun this region they held spears and swords at the ready and some had bows there were too many of them to permit escape the mundanes closed on imbri and her party carefully they were a fairly motley bunch with different types of armor and clothing but they were evidently disciplined this has the aspect of a mercenary force ichabod murmured little better than brigands prechristian era european gaul or iberia i surmise you a roman or a punic a soldier demanded roman or punic ichabod repeated under his breath thats it the romans used citizensoldiers at least at first later they became in fact professional soldiers land holders in name only but the punic forcesthats a con traction of phoenicianwere known to make open and night more extensive use of mercenaries carthagethese would likely be carthaginian mercenaries circa to bc speak up old man the soldier cried making a threat ening gesture with his sword oh i am neither ichabod said hastily quietly to grundy and imbri he murmured they assume im the only intelligent person i think it best to deceive them much as i detest the practice of prevarication yes imbri projected grundy can pretend to be a doll and i will be a stupid animal you dont look like much the mundane said whered you steal the fine horse i did not steal this horse icbabod protested i bor rowed her from a friend well well borrow her from you dismount we shouldnt be separated imbri sent in a worried dreamlet she remembered her prior capture by the horse man and did not relish a repetition of that experience this is not a completely tame animal ichabod said i ride her without saddle or reins but she would not behave for a stranger the soldier pondered evidently he had had experience with halfwild horses he put his hand on imbris shoulder and she squealed wamingly and stomped a forefoot acting like an undisciplined animal all right you ride her for now were taking you to hasbinbad for interrogation hasbinbad was evidently a leader for he had a comfort able tent to the rear he emerged fully armed and armored with a shaped breastplate a large oblong shield and an impressive helmet he was a grumy handsome older man on the stout side his face was clean his beard neatly trimmed my troops inform me you were lurking south of our clearance blaze hasbinbad remarked what were you doing there youre a true carthaginian ichabod exclaimed all my life hasbinbad agreed with an ironic smile are you a native of this region i am prepared to offer a fair reward for good information imbri did not trust this urbane mundane leader but she bad to let ichabod handle the interview night mare i am a visitor to this land but i have traveled a fair amount ichabod replied carefully he seemed more in trigued than concerned now apparently he liked meeting what were to him historical figures i saw your fire and came to investigateand your ruffians quickly made me captive they are instructed to kill all strange animals and take prisoner any men they encounter hasbinbad said strange things have happened since we crossed the alps and entered southern gaul this is much wilder country than hispania it certainly is ichabod agreed emphatically this would be about the year or bc in the po valley and he paused and imbri sent a questioning dream you speak strangely hasbinbad said where did you say you were from horrors ichabod said to imbri in the dream i am speaking nonsense i cant refer to prechristian dates these people of course have no notion of their future and i cant tell him where im from or when im from he would think me a lunatic tell him you are a lunatic from castle roogna yester day imbri suggested not following all of the mans confu sion she had thought it was only chameleon who became convoluted in her thoughts but perhaps it was a general human trait from castle roogna in central xanth ichabod said to the mundane following the suggestion you are roman then ichabod laughed not at au this isnt italy hasbinbad elevated an eyebrow he was fairly good at that it isnt where then do you claim it is oh i see you crossed from spain to france then through the alps to the po valley bringing twelve hundred men and nine elephants to the aid of my leader hannibal who is hardpressed by the ac cursed romans hasbinbad finished but we have not yet located hannibal i should think not ichabod agreed i fear you have lost your way hannibal wasisin italy during the sec night mare ond punic war ravaging the roman empire this is er presentday xanth the land of magic xanth this is xanth ichabod repeated a different sort of land no romans here no hannibal either you are saying we do not know how to navigate not exactly im sure you followed your route exactly you must have encountered a discontinuity it is compli cated to explain sometimes people step through acciden tally and find themselves here its generally sheer fluke it is much easier to leave xanth than to find it unless you have magic guidance the carthaginian leader puffed out his cheeks evi dently humoring the crazy man how should we find rome turn about leave xanth then turn about again but then ichabod reconsidered no perhaps not you would probably be in some other age and place of mundania if you went randomly you have to time it and thats a rather precise matter i suppose if you tried several times until you got it just right ill think about it hasbinbad said this is an interest ing land whatever it is what do you think imbri asked grundy and ichabod in a dreamlet i distrust this persons motive yes hes lying grundy said in the dream in life he was lying on imbris shoulder playing the part of a lifeless doll he knows this isnt rome or wherever he was going hes testing you maybe to see if youre lying to him if you dont find your way to italy ichabod said aloud to the carthaginian hannibal will not have the reinforce ments he needs and will be hardpressed we could help you find the way if as you claim this is not italy hasbinbad rejoined then perhaps it is still ripe for plunder my troops have had a hard journey and need proper reward who governs you king trent ichabod said i mean king dor there has been a recent change the mundane asked alertly night mare uh yes but that is no concern of yours oh i think it is my concern what happened to the old king ichabod obviously was not adept at deception it was part of the foolish yet endearing nature of the man he suffered a mishap perhaps he will recover soon or perhaps king dor if he proves competent will suf fer a similar mishap hasbinbad murmured he definitely knows something imbri sent with an effort she kept her ears from flattening back so that she would not give away the fact that she understood the dia logue what can you know of our kings ichabod demanded though technically he was not a citizen of xanth hasbinbad shrugged only that they are mortal as all men are he looked meaningfully at ichabod now what should i do with you spy i shall retain your horse of course but men are more difficult to manage and you do not appear to be very good for hard labor we must get out of here ichabod said to imbri in the dream the man was getting really worried do you think your king window would pay a decent ransom for you the punic leader inquired thats king dor not window ichabod muttered ransom is a mundane concept he would not pay then i suppose well just have to sacrifice you to baal hammon though he prefers the taste of babies even our gods have to go on less succulent rations in the field ichabod tried to run but hasbinbad snapped his fingers and mundane soldiers charged up they seized ichabod and dragged him away imbri tried to follow but they threw ropes about her tying her resistance was futile the mundanes bristled with weapons imbri was hustled to a pen and left there fortunately the mundanes did not know her nature and did not realize that the golem was a living creature the two remained together but ichabod was imprisoned separately maybe we can rescue him tonight imbri sent in a dream i hope so grundy replied hes a decent old codger even if he is mundane but that mundane chief certainly knows more than hes letting on he knew king trent was night mare out of the picture theres a conspiracy of some nefarious sort here and its not just the nextwave conquest then a man approached the pen why it is the dream horse he exclaimed imbri looked at himand her heart sank down to her hooves it was the dread horseman oh dont pretend you dont know me mare the horseman said i dont know how you managed to escape me beforewell i do know but dont see how you doused the fire i was so angry when in the morning i discovered you were gone that i almost slew my henchmen but then i realized that none of us had really come to terms with the notion of a horse as smart as a person my horse certainly isnt smart the fools probably half starving by this time so i chalked up my experience with you as a lesson in underestimating my opposition and i shall not do that again the horseman grinned with a somewhat feral edge ill make you a deal mare tell me the secret of your escape and i will take you for my own now sparing you the brutality of the punics ill let you go once i recap ture my regular steed the day horse him i can confine once i have possession fair enough i wont deal with you imbri sent tightly you dont believe i have power here i am second in command to hasbinbad and can take what steed i choose i am a good deal more than a spy i believe you imbri sent thats why i will not coop erate with you im really not such a bad fellow the man continued persuasively i treat my steeds well once they know their place all i require is absolute obedience spurs imbri sent in a dream like a blast of dragon fire hotter than the breath of baal your thought but i dont use the spurs once my steed is tame he argued there are no fresh cuts on the hide of the day horse ill warrant unless he got himself caught in one of those pre hensile bramble bushes the ungrateful animal hell per ish in that jungle alone hes not smart enough to survive long so he needs meand i need him the punic horses are lean and tired from their arduous trek over the cold night mare mountains the best food was reserved for the elephants i had to subdue a centaur to make my way up here once the forces of xanth started closing in on me south of thei misremember but i think there was some kind of barrier the gap chasm imbri sent then cursed herself she should have let him forget it entirely yes that you told the king of my presence didnt you of course i did imbri sent viciously with the image of two hind feet kicking him in the face the horseman jerked back involuntarily before control ling his reaction to the dreamlet so you wont tell me how you doused the fire well i can conjecture the guard was nodding and you sent a bad dream at him that he was on fire so he fetched a bucket of watersomething like that i deeply regret underestimating your talent there now why hadnt imbri thought of that she probably could have tricked the guard into something like that meanwhile she refused to implicate the day horse who it seemed was one or two iotas smarter than his master cred ited still i cant really fault you for fighting for your side the horseman continued i am fighting for my side after all so lets call it even i caught you you escaped you betrayed me to the xanth king but now you have been caught again and because i appreciate your full spirit and powers i want you more than ever for my steed you and i could go far together imbri on the other hand my friends the punics would be very interested to know exactly what kind of horse you are and how to prevent you from escaping at night should i tell them imbri stiffened he could make her truly captive that would strand ichabod and grundy too and leave chame leon in a very awkward situation for she was no smarter than the day horse grundy might escape since he contin ued to play the ragdoll role and the horseman did not know about him but what could the tiny man do alone in the jungle of xanth she would have to deal with this horrible man appalling as the very thought was she forced her ears up and for night mare ward instead of plastered against her neck the way they wanted to be i see you understand imbri the horseman said you should as you are the smartest horse i have ever encoun tered but you refuse to cooperate very well i am a rea sonable man i am prepared to compromise i will ex change information for noninformation you tell me exactly how you escaped before so i know who or what betrayed me and i will not provide any part of the infor mation to the punics it will all be privileged communica tion what will happen will happen imbri was in a quandary could she trust the horseman to keep his word was it fair to betray the day horse what should she do you dont trust me i can see the man said indeed you have no reason to but trust must begin somewhere mustnt it try me this time and if i betray you you are no worse off than otherwise all you are really gambling is some information that wont change anything now i simply want to profit from a past mistake i try never to make the same error twice since it profits me nothing if the punics de stroy you and your scholarly friend i am not gambling much either we each stand to lose if we do not cooperate regardless of our opinion of each other id rather have you loose and living so that there is hope to capture you fairly at some future date my education for your freedom no other obligation i dont see how i can proffer a more equi table deal than that what should i do imbri queried grundy in a dream let this is bad the golem replied therein this character is insidious hes trying to get you to trust him thats the first step to making you his steed for real to convert you to his side and betray xanth think of the damage he could do if he could phase through walls at night on your back so you cant afford to trust him but if he tells hasbinbad my nature ill be trapped and ichabod will be sacrificed to baal hammon thats bad all right grundy agreed i guess youll have to go along with him just dont trust him beware the horseman night mare imbri decided she would have to accept the deal she stood to lose too much otherwise and her friends would suffer as well and her mission would be a failure and xanth would pay the consequence the day horse freed me she sent reluctantly to the horseman hating him for what he was making her do hal so he was close by all the time what did he do hedoused the fire but a horse has no hands he cant carry water he the horseman paused then he laughed oh no he didnt he did that animal is smarter than i thought for sure must have been the presence of a fine mare that spurred him to his finest performance he never paid such attention to any ordinary mare im sure so you ran off with himbut i gather you did not stay with him where is he now i dont have to tell you that imbri sent simultane ously angry at the way the horseman had made her reveal a secret and flattered at his assessment of the day horses opinion of her any female was delighted at the notion that an attractive male found her interesting even if she wasnt sure she wanted anything to do with him she still wanted to be considered worthwhile by him it gave her a certain social advantage the horseman frowned no i suppose you dont that wasnt part of our deal this time but im sure that stallion didnt do such a risky favor just from the equine goodness of his heart women make fools of men and mares make fools of stallions he must have been attracted to you even then and surely more so now better and better but imbri was careful not to react so if youre here he cant be far distant you probably see each other often and maybe travel together that way you repay him for helping you and he gets shown where to graze and how to survive on his own in xanth thats why i wasnt able to find him and why he didnt return from sheer hunger and thirst it was probably just chance that the punics caught you instead of him the man was uncomfortably sharp imbri did not re spond night mare very well the horseman said you have answered my question perhaps more completely than you intended and i believe you i will leave you in peace we shall surely meet again he turned and walked away imbri hardly dared relax do you think he will keep his bargain she sent to grundy well find out the golem replied i can see why you fear him hes a keen mean basilisk of a man but in his arrogance he just might be sincere his perverted standard of honor may mean more to him than the opinion of one mare and he does hope to use you to locate the day horse hell probably try to follow you when you escape at least he doesnt know about me i can untie the ropes and scramble out of the pen and probably free you even if they light fires save that for the last resort she suggested if the horseman honors his word for whatever reason i wont need it but i can go scout out where they have ichabod the golem said that will facilitate things so we can act fast when night comes yes she agreed her confidence beginning to recover from the bruising the horseman had given it but we must play dumb until then oh sure but though the golem lay like a limp doll he used his special skill to interrogate the plants and creatures nearby there was a blade of grass growing at the edge of the pen that had somehow escaped the attention of what ever horse had been penned here before grundy told it that he would have his friend the mare chomp it off flat if it didnt answer his question and the grass was intimidated grundy was forcing it to cooperate the same way the horseman had used leverage against her that made her wonder whether there was really any difference between them in ethics and she was distressed but did not protest the blade of grass told grundy all it knew of the mun danes of the nextwavewhich was not very much they had camped here two days ago and called themselves pun ics though they were mostly recruits from iberia and mo rocco wherever those places were many of them had night mare sore feet from their arduous march through the moun tains so were resting now grundy questioned a spider who had a small web against the wall of the pen the spider said the mundanes had carried mundane lice and fleas along with them and that these parasites were fairly fat and sassy and made pretty good eating the spider had made it a point to learn the language of its prey so as to be able to lure the bugs into its web thus it had picked up some of the mundanebug gossip the trek over the mountains had been truly horrendous it seemed the mundane seasons were more rigorous than those of xanth and the high mountain passes were covered with magic masses of ice called glaciers that made the pas sage treacherous they had started with twelve hundred men and nine elephants they had lost a third of the men and twothirds of the elephants hasbinbad for payroll rea sons whatever a payroll might be none of them could guess refused to acknowledge the missing men they had also started with two hundred horses of which only fifty remained and some of those had run away when they came to xanth the day horse imbri projected yes one of a number grundy agreed the spider doesnt know the horses by name of course but that fits the pattern the day horse was smart for a mundane ani mal so must be doing better than the other escapees most of them are probably inside dragons by now that saddened imbri but she knew it was likely what do the soldiers think of xanth grundy questioned the spider they grumble a lot he reported in due course they have not been paid so they must plunder paidhey that must be what the payroll is what hasbinbad owes the soldiers many of them have died as they blundered into tangle trees dragon warrens and monsterinfested waters some have been transformed to fish because they drank from an enchanted river the spider got that from a flea who jumped off a man just in time others pursued nymphs into the jungle and were never seen again perhaps two hundred have been lost to the hazards of xanth so now they are proceeding very night mare carefully and doing better they have slain several dragons and griffins and roasted and eaten them but they are ner vous about what else may lie ahead justifiably imbri sent they have antagonized all creatures of xanth by their carnage they should march back out of xanth before they do any more damage they wont as long as there is plunder to be had grundy said the spider confirms what we have seen our selves these are tough creatures dragons in human guise with a cunning and omery leader only force will stop them thats the way mundanes are except for ichabod imbri qualified hes not a real mundane the golem said irked at hav ing been caught in an unwarranted generalization hes greedy for information and his head always was full of fantasy and he has an eye out for nymphs too a mundane guard came and dumped an armful of freshcut hay into imbris pen hay was best when properly cured but naturally the ignorant mundanes didnt know that and this was better than nothing she munched away like the stupid animal she was supposed to be then she snoozed on her feet patiently awaiting the fall of night at dusk when deepening shadows offered concealment grundy the golem slipped out to scout the region his abil ity to converse with all living things enabled him to get information wherever he went by the time it was dark enough for imbri to phase through her confinement and free herself grundy was back ive found him he whispered ill show you where he jumped onto her backand fell right through her to the ground oops she was insubstantial she phased back to solidity let him mount then phased out again taking him with her then she followed his directions to find ichabod the scholar was in a separate pen guarded by an alert swordsman the area was lighted imbri could not safely go in ill distract the guard grundy said you go in solid pick him up and charge out itll be chancy and theyll be after usbut they cant do a thing when youre phased out night more imbri was not sanguine about this but saw no better course soon they would discover her absence from her own pen and be after her anyway so she had to hurry go ahead she projected the golem jumped down turning solid as he left her ambience and made his way behind the guard hey roachface grundy called from a region not far back his tone was exquisitely insulting the man glanced about but could not spy the hidden golem whos there show yourself go show your own self snakenose grundy replied cheap insults were his forte he was surely enjoying this the soldier put his hand on his sword come out mis creant or bring you out you can hardly bring out your own sloppy dank tongue monstersnoot grundy retorted the man whipped out his sword and stalked the sound he was as vain about his appearance as any true monster with as little justification the moment his back was turned imbri walked quietly into the pen get ready she sent to ichabod in a dream the scholar had been snoozing uncomfortably now in his dream he reacted with startled gladness my hands are tied he said i cant mount imbri applied her teeth to the rope binding his hands and chewed she had good teeth and soon crunched through it but the delay was fatal the guard turned around and spied them ho he bellowed charging forward with sword ele vated prison break ichabod jumped onto imbris back she leaped away avoiding the descending sword but she remained in the lighted enclosure still solid and therefore vulnerable grundy ran up move out mare he cried leaping to her neck and clutching her mane the soldier swung his sword again clipping a few hairs from her tail imbri leaped over the wall of the pen escap ing him but the mundanes cry had roused the camp hundreds of torches were converging lighting the area preventing night more imbri from phasing out she had to gallop in the one direc tion that remained open east shoot them downl a voice commanded it sounded like hasbinbad himself arrows sailed toward them ichabod jumped and groaned im hit keep going grundy cried were doomed if we stop now imbri kept going the torches fell behind those soldiers were afoot not having had time to get to their own horses so they could not keep the pace but the pattern of lights was such that she still could not veer south to rejoin cha meleon and the day horse so she raced on east as she got beyond the torchlight she phased into unsolid form so that the arrows could no longer hurt them and became invisible to the mundanes but they retained a fair notion where she was and the pursuit continued since she was pure black she tended to disappear in darkness anyway and they probably assumed this was why they couldnt actually see her some of them were now on horses and could keep the equine pace but a night mare in dream form could outrun any ordi nary equine imbri left them behind and ran on into the night through trees and small hills getting as far clear as she could how are you doing she sent to ichabod there was no answer she phased back to solid and queried him again in case he hadnt heard her in the phasedout state now she felt the warm blood on her back the man was losing blood and was unconscious only the fact that he had no more mass in the phasedout state than imbri herself did enabled him to remain mounted he had sunk so far he no longer dreamed this was worse than she had feared weve got to get magical help for him the golem said worried fast before he sinks entirely some healing elixir we dont have any imbri sent i know that mareface he snapped well have to take him to a spring or to castle roogna where they have some stored night mare too far he may be dead before we get there find a closer place then maybe the siren has some imbri suggested she lives in the water wing and were not far from it move grundy said get him there before its too late hes no young squirt you know she knew she moved she came to the wall that con fined the water wing and plunged through beyond it was water a sea of it with a storm raining thickly down to add to the total it was one of the seven natural wonders of xanth though creatures could not agree just which the seven were but the water passed through them as imbri galloped along the surface she wished there had been a gourd patch handy so that she could use the gourd network in this emergency but of course there were no gourds in the lake the water wing was all water fortunately she was able to travel at maximum velocity across the sea in a much shorter time than any ordinary horse could manage she reached the home region of the siren it was night but the merfolk colony was awake night fishing several of them had strings of nightflsh already where is the siren imbri sent in a broadband dreamlet a mermaid swam up hello grundy she called why do you seek me the golem jumped off imbris back taming solid and splashing into the water where the buxom creature picked him up my friend ichabod is wounded and dying my friend the night mare brought him here have you any healing elixir we do the siren said carry him to land at the edge of the wing morris will bring the elixir imbri trotted to the shore the siren got the elixir from her husband then emerged from the water her tail split ting into two wellfleshed legs she sprinkled a few drops on ichabod to imbris dismay there was no immediate effect its not working she projected this is a dilute elixir the siren explained we dont have any really potent springs here in the water wing theyre under the water you see so its hard to capture night mare the essence but this will work in a few hoursfaster if he can drink some they set the unconscious man up and poured a few drops in his mouth then ichabod stirred his eyes opened and he groaned he lives grundy exclaimed joyfully i was really worried about the old codger get that arrow out ofhis back morris called from the lake he was a full merman so could not go on land the healing cant be complete with the arrow in him that was obvious they had been so concerned about the bleeding that they had not paid attention to the wound but this remained a problem the arrow was barbed and they could not dislodge it without inflicting terrible new pain and damage that might kill the man despite the elixir magic did have its limits maybe if you phase it out grundy suggested imbri tried this she took the shaft of the arrow in her teeth then phased into insubstantiality and backed away the arrow phased with her and the spacedout head of it moved without resistance through the mans body until it was free she hurled the arrow away gratified she had removed it without hurting ichabod at all now the gaping wound started visibly healing all they had to do was wait in half an hour ichabod was whole once more i hope i never have to go through that particular experience again he said thank you lovely maiden for your timely help the siren smiled pleased she was middleaged and ev idently appreciated being called a maiden shes no maiden grundy said with his customary eti quette shes the siren the siren ichabod asked growing if anything more interested but does she lure sailors to their doom not any more the siren said with a frown a centaur smashed my magic dulcimer and that depleted my power oh ichabod pondered you know if you had your power again you could do a lot of good for xanth you could lure the mundanes i really dont want to harm people not even mun danes she said im a family woman now here is my night more son cyrus she introduced a small boy who smiled shyly then dived into the lake his legs changing in middive to the tail of a triton nobody likes killing of course ichabod said but perhaps you could lure them to some isolated island in wa ters infested by sea monsters so that they could not do any one any harm yes that would be all right she agreed or lure them to my sister the gorgon who could change them to stone such statues can be restored with the right magic or when returned to mundania where the spell would be broken so its not quite the same as death she shrugged but i fear my power is gone forever as only the good magician knows how to restore the instrument and he wouldnt do it even if i were willing to pay his fee of one years service so it really doesnt matter i think im much happier now than i ever was when i had my power frankly but she looked pensive as if aware of the enormous ability she had lost ichabod spread his hands one can never tell i am on good terms with good magician humfrey having provided him with a number of excellent mundane research tomes and perhaps i can broach the matter i suspect you have just saved me at least a year of life by your assistance at any rate i certainly appreciate what you did for me he turned to imbri and you and grundy of course now we really must rejoin chameleon he was right the night was passing entirely too rapidly they bade farewell to the siren and the friendly merfolk and headed southwest they had to get out of the water wing before imbri turned solid again for she could not gal lop across the water by day they made it through the perpetual storm at the edge of the water wing and out into normal xanth terrain before the sun rose imbri invoked her personlocating sense which she had used during her decades of dream duty to find the sleepers on her list and oriented on chameleon the night stallion had always provided the addresses of the sleepers as part of the labeling on their dreams but she could tune in on people she knew well and who were think night mare ing of her at least she hoped so she had not tried it when the location of the person was unknown it worked in this manner they caught up to chameleon and the day horse the woman was sleeping in a cushion bush while the horse grazed nearby apparently they had scouted the area and made sure it was safe chameleon seemed to have a good sense for safety despite her stupid ity of course while no place in xanth was completely safe many were safe enough for those who understood them a mundane in this area would probably have fallen prey to a patch of carnivorous grass or a tangle tree or the small water dragon in the nearby river xanth natives avoided these things without even thinking about them perhaps it was the complex of dangers here that made it safe from mundanes chameleon woke as they approached oh im so glad youre safe she exclaimed i had a night mare visiti thought at first it was you imbri but it wasntwith a horrible dream about ichabod getting badly wounded im so glad to see it wasnt true it was true ichabod said thats why our return was delayed we got caught by the mundanes grundy said oh now i remember that was in the dream too how perfectly awful the day horse approached ears perking up how glad i am to have had this horse near chameleon said patting him on a muscular shoulder and the day horse nickered obviously he liked chameleon as did all people who knew her in her lovely phase we were using the smoke of that brush fire for cover but the wind shifted the golem continued they sur rounded us we talked to their leader hasbinbad the punic then the horseman came the day horse snorted i tell you he was there grundy insisted said he forced a centaur to carry him north since things got hot near castle roogna we dont know what happened to the henchmen imbri told us about maybe a dragon got them good riddance he wanted to know how imbri escaped from him before night mare and i had to tell him imbri sent apologetically he promised to let us go and i think he kept his word if he kept his word it was only because he had no rea son to keep you there the day horse insisted in the dream imbri provided i know that man he never does anything for anyone unless he stands to gain well he did let us go grundy said maybe it was a plot to follow us back to you but we foiled that we went through the water wing to see the siren and get ichabod healed and the mundanes couldnt follow so maybe we outsmarted the horseman after all i doubt it the day horse said in the dream he has levels and levels of cunning he probably wanted to let you go for some devious reason of his own maybe he knew the mundanes wouldnt let him have imbri for himself so he saw to it they couldnt keep her either hes like that he spites people in subtle ways so the mischief cant be traced to him he wants everything his own way but he surely knows just about where we are now we must flee south immediately thats for sure grundy agreed weve got our infor mation we know who the mundanes are now we have to get it to king dor as fast as we can so he can figure out how to break up the wave that made sense imbri was amazed at the expressive ness of the day horse who hardly seemed stupid at all now his points about the horseman were well taken but if the man had wanted them free knowing they would go straight to king dor what was his rationale he was an enemy who would only suffer if the king organized a good defense something important was missing and it made her uneasy they set off south chameleon was satisified to continue riding the day horse so they left it the way it was all day they galloped avoiding the problems of the journey up and made such good progress that by nightfall they had crossed the invisible bridge and were back at castle roogna the day horse wary of populated places begged off en tering the castle itself people tend to want to catch me and pen me he explained in equine language that grundy translated for the nonequines night mare chameleon was sympathetic i understand she said the mundanes penned imbri she dismounted then threw her arms about the horses sweaty neck giving him an affectionate hug thank you so much day horse she kissed his right ear horses did not blush but this one tried he wiggled his ear snorted and scuffled the ground with a forefoot he flicked his tail violently though there were no flies near then he turned on two hooves and trotted away seeking his own place to graze and rest its easy to like a pretty woman grundy remarked somewhat wistfully even if you are a horse and easy for a mare to like such a horse imbri thought to herself he was such a beautiful nice helpful animal if only he were smarteri chapter the first battle ring dor was waiting for them he listened gravely to their report making careful note of the numbers and armament of the enemy as ichabod reported them im bri was amazed to discover how observant the mundane scholar had been he had noted everything relevant and was able to fill in from his wide background information it seemed xanth now knew more about the mundanes than the mundanes knew about xanth the carthaginian mercenaries wereareredoubtable fighters ichabod concluded they had excellent leader ship and were accustomed to carrying on on their own with very little support from the home city they domi nated the western half of the mediterranean sea and even the romans were unable generally to match them in bat tle he broke off but i wander too far afield as is my night mara wont my point is that these are formidable foemen who are prone to feed captives to their bloodthirsty god baal hammon you must not give them any quarter i dislike advocating violence but i see no peaceful way to abate this particular menace fortunately they have no weapons with which you are unfamiliar except perhaps that of treach ery dor shook his head heavily he seemed to have aged in the three days imbris party had been away though he had caught up on his sleep i had hoped it would be otherwise but a wave is a wave we shall fight with what resources we have so there are about six hundred nextwavers re maining armed with swords spears and bows this is too great a number for us to handle by ordinary means i have marshaled the old troops of king trents former army but i am skeptical about their combat readiness what we really need is the help of some of xanths more ferocious animals such as the dragons in xanths past they have been known to help us out of bad situations but so far this time they have rejected my overtures i think they might have been more positive toward king trent as his power is more compelling than mine the dragons seem to feel that if men wish to kill men this will make things easier for dragons wait till the nextwavers ravage dragon land grundy muttered then the beasts will take notice that may be too late for us dor said in any event it is not just the dragons the goblins who really are more manlike than beastlike told our messenger to go soak his snoot the goblins dont want to get drafted for war imbri sent remembering the last bad dream she had processed king dor concentrated on a map of xanth before him we expect the mundanes to drive for castle roogna first that is where the mundane city of rome is in the land they thought they were invading so naturally they see it as the target unfortunately they are correct if they conquer or destroy castle roogna xanth will have no central focus for resistance dragon land and goblin land are in central xanth if the nextwave flows down the west coast it will night mare miss those regions so the dragons and goblins are not worrying since the main human regions are in the west we must bear the brunt he ran a hand over his hair which seemed already to be thinning i wish king trent were well he has the tactical ability to handle this sort of thing there it was again even king dor lacked confidence in his ability the loss of king trent had been a terrible blow to xanthas it seemed the enemy leader hasbinbad was well aware the horseman had done a good reconnais sance the gap chasm will stop them grundy said it may if we take down the magic bridges i dont want to do that except as a last resort those bridges are hard to restore good magician humfrey supervised the installation of the main one and hes not young any more he never was young grundy said i think he was born a wrinkled hairless gnome but you do have a point i think the gorgon pretty well runs his castle now im not sure id trust a bridge whose construction he supervised today so i shall lead king trents old army to intercept the mundanes north of the gap not you dor chameleon exclaimed alarmed but mother im the kingi he protested somewhat querulously its my job to lead the troops its your job to govern xanth grundy said if you go foolishly out to battle and get yourself killed where is xanth then but listen to them your majesty a voice said from the doorway it was queen iris garbed in black i know what it is like to be halfway widowed i dont want my daughter to learn dor smiled wanly ill try to hang on to my life ill stay out of the actual battle but i must be there with the troops i can not do less than that as anticipated the nextwave flowed down the western side of xanth avoiding the deadly central region and the night mare monsteriferous coastal region the horseman obviously had scouted out their best routethe enchanted path that trade parties used to reach the isthmus that was the only access to mundania now that enchantment was helping the enemy force to drive directly for castle roogna most creatures of xanth thought of the historic waves as sheer ravening hordes of mundanes and the current wave resembled that notion closely enough but it was evi dent that this force had considerable expertise supporting its violence the mundanes were quickly learning how to handle the hazards of xanth and how to use beneficial magic the quiet north village had to be evacuated hastily be fore the wave swamped it and the centaur village south of it was similarly abandoned these local centaurs were less prudish about magic talents than were those of distant cen taur isle and were quite helpful to the human villagers carrying the aged and infirm in return the human folk used their magic talents to facilitate the travel of the cen taurs conjuring food and tools as needed it was a fine cooperative effort imbri knew that dors paternal grand parents lived in the north village and the sire and dam of chet and chem centaur lived in the centaur settlement so this effort was important to those who were at castle roogna in a personal as well as a tactical sense faces were turning grim at the notion of handing these areas over to the enemy but it was a necessary evil queen iris was deputized by king dor to supervise the evacuation of those regions she spent day and night in the bedroom with unconscious king trent using her enormous powers of illusion on behalf of the welfare of xanth in the manner king trent would have asked her to she projected her image to every household of the village warning each person of the danger and making sure that person left iris could actually perceive these people and they could per ceive her to that extent her illusory images were real it was indeed difficult to ascertain exactly where illusion left off and reality began she spoke calmly but certainly mak ing sure that important belongings were taken and that noth ing of possible advantage to the mundanes was left behind night mare because she could also perceive the progress of the wave though this was at the fringe of her range the people had the confidence to evacuate in an orderly manner not rush ing wastefully while also not delaying overiong but the queen was working too hard her use of illusion at such range was like a horse galloping crosscountry it required a lot of concentration and energy iris would not rest herself at night insisting on checking and rechecking every detail her illusionfigures were blurring iris was no longer in the flush of youth she was as old as king trent this enormous effort without respite was apt to put her into a state no better than that of trent finally king dor sent imbri in to her carrying a basket of food and drink with instructions to make the queen take a needed break king dor did not feel right about giving orders to his motherinlaw which was why he asked imbri to handle it his reason for choosing her was seemingly superficialher ability to project dreams resem bled the queens ability to project illusions perhaps there would be rapport imbri was glad to try imbri entered the bedroom and set the basket down re leasing the strap she had held in her teeth queen iris i have brought refreshment she sent you must eat and drink iris paused in her labor of illusion dont try to fool me mare she snapped theres sleep potion in that bever age so there is imbri agreed your daughter put it in but she says she will watch her father while you rest if you are willing her place is with her husband the new king iris said softening i know she loves her father she doesnt have to prove it to me pleasetake the rest the villagers can travel now without you and your talent may be needed later there are people in charge like dors grandfather roland of the council of elders and chester andcherie centaur who tutored king dor in literacy and martial art they can handle it now in fact irene loves trent more than she loves me iris grumbled but she ate the cake and drank the coconut milk night mare provided and allowed herself to get sleepy you watch the king she said and dont send me any bad dreams i have more than enough already no bad dreams imbri agreed but she did send the queen a good dream of the villag ers and centaurs arriving safely south of the gap chasm and finding temporary homes in other villages and on other ranges dont try to fool me queen iris said in her sleep catching on i deliver illusions to others i prefer reality for myself you are brave imbri sent ill have none of your false flattery either the queen retorted threatening to wake up i didnt say you were nice imbri said in the dream taking the form of an older woman one with whom the queen might be comfortable i said you were brave it takes no courage to project pictures to others you should know that to seek reality imbri clarified i send my images inside the minds of others rather than outside as you do but i too prefer to know the truth which may not be at all like a dream many people do prefer illusion however i appreciate your effort the queen said youre trying to keep me asleep and i suppose i do need it i cant serve xanth well if i am overtired then she brought her self up short xanth whom am i fooling i said i sought reality but this is illusion i never cared for the welfare of xanth i always wanted to rule it which is an entirely dif ferent matter but no queen is permitted to rule xanth no matter what her talent ichabod says xanth is a medieval kingdom imbris image said he thinks that eventually it will progress to equal rights for women is the king all right was this a deliberate shifting of subject or merely the meandering of an overtired mind imbri checked king trent he is unchanged do you know i only married him so i could be queen if one can not rule the next best thing is to be married to night more night mare the one who does it was a marriage of convenience we never fooled each other that there was love between us he had to marry because the council of elders who made him king required it he married me so as to eliminate magicianlevel dissension but surely imbri started to protest i have my faults and they are gross ones but i was never a hypocrite the queen insisted i craved power more than anything else and trent craved power too but he did not want to remarry and when he saw he had to he refused to marry for love so he made the deal with me as i was unlovable that was perhaps almost as potent an as set as my magic if his dead mundane wife was watching she would have known i was not capable of replacing her in his esteem he was in fact punishing himself i knew itbut the truth is i wasnt looking for love either so i was happy to prostitute myself for the appearance of power and distinctionthough it wasnt prostitution in any literal sense he had no physical desire for me imbri was embarrassed by these revelations but knew the queen was unwinding in her sleep longburied truths were bubbling to the surface it was best not to interfere horses dont look for love either she said just compan ionship and offspring and good pasturage the queen laughed how well you define it night mare that was what i sought in additionto power and king trent gave me all those things in his fashion i can not complain he was known in his youth as theevil magi cian but he was in fact a good man is a good man and a good king imbri agreed i understand this is the best age of xanth since king roognas time true king roogna fought off the fourth or fifth wave i misremember which and ushered in the golden age of xanth he built this fine castle we call the present the silver age but i suspect it is as gold as the other was she paused reflectively it is strange how things work out i married trent from contempt thinking to use him to achieve subtle power for myself but he was stronger and better than i thought and instead of dominating him i was dominated by him and strangest of all i discovered i liked it i could have loved him but the one love of his life died before he returned to xanth he had had a son too some alien disease took them both he never spoke about it he would have felt guilty if he ever loved again so he was true to his design while i was not how i envied that unknown deceased mundane woman but you have a child by him imbri protested that signifies less than it might the queen said xanth needed an heir in case there should be no magi cian when trent died someone to fill in to occupy castle roogna until a magician showed up so trent had to come to me he was so disturbed by it that i had to invoke my illusion to make it appear to be two other people not him and me that was how we conceived irene imbri was shocked a mating of convenience again you phrase it aptly it was real for me but not for him he was only doing his duty but after irene camepot even a sorceress and not male a double fail urei think there was no conflict there he could love another child for it is possible for a man to have several children without denying any of them the girl was no threat to his memory of his son he loved irene and some times i think he almost loved the mother of irene surely so and now he is gone or temporarily incapacitatedthat is one illusion i must cling toand i can play the role i am supposed to that of the grieving loyal wife because it is true a marriage of convenience turned secretly real for me at least and i can do what i can for the good of xanth because that is what he would be doing and now i can only realize myself through him she grimaced i the original feminist how utter was my fall the worse be cause it is unrecognized i dont see that as a fall imbri said you are a mare but the queen smiled accepting the comfort i would give anything to have him back on any basis or to join him in his ensorcellment but it seems that is not my decision to make any more than any of the other crucial decisions of my life have been queen iris sank then into a deeper sleep and imbri let her descend below the threshold of dreams gaining her precious rest imbri had not suspected the depth and nature night mare of iriss feeling and had not sought such knowledge but was glad she had learned of it truly human folk were more complex than equine folkl in the same period of a few days king dors hastily marshaled and outfitted army prepared to meet the enemy onslaught everyone knew that king trent could have or ganized an effective campaignbut king trent was sadly out of it people lacked confidence in dorbut he was the only king xanth had was he enough dor accompanied the army north along with his private bodyguard composed of longterm boyhood friends he rode chet centaur who was armed with a fine bow spear and sword and who could magically convert boulders to pebbles a process he called calculus chefs sister chem was along too for her magic talent of map projection was invaluable for charting the positions of xanth and next wave troops chem carried grundy the golem whose ability to converse with living creatures complemented king dors ability to talk with inanimate things together they could amass a lot of information in a hurry smash the ogre also came he now resembled a large somewhat brutish man for he was half man by birth but when the occasion required he could stffl manifest as the most fear some of ogres since he could not readily keep pace with the centaurs afoot in man form imbri served as his steed she knew smash from the time he had visited the world of the gourd he had terrorized the walking skeletons but had been gentle with her and in a devious manner she owed her half soul to him of course imbri knew chem in an even closer manner it was half of the centaur fillys soul she had this was the first time imbri had encountered her since that exchange they trotted side by side following king dor and chet chem was a pretty brown creature with flowing hair and tail and a slender wellformed human upper torso imbri liked her of course but felt guilty about the soul so as they moved she conversed by dream privately with the filly do you remember me chem i have half your soul i remember you helped us escape the void without night mare you we would have been doomed for nothing except night mares can travel out of that awful hole now you are help ing chameleon arent you she doesnt like battle but wants to safeguard her son dor so she delegated me to carry the ogre i think that makes sense in her fashion yes i know my folks wanted me to stay at castle roogna with the wivesqueen iris queen irene chame leon and smashs wife tandy who is as nice a girl as i know but im not married and i dont feel quite at home with the wifely types they live mostly for their males imbri remembered her conversation with queen iris they seem to like it that way i cant see it so i persuaded king dor he needed me at the front imbris mental image of another female centaur laughed she liked this creature better than ever now that im a day mare i suppose i should return your soul no it was a fair exchange as these things go chem said as i said without your help and the help of those other two night mares crises and vaporswithout them smash tandy and i would not have been able to resume our normal lives my half soul is regenerating nicely now and i hope your half soul is doing the same it may be imbri said i dont know how to judge i was always a soulless creature before some of the best creatures are soulless chem said i dont know why souls should be limited to human and part human creatures some dragons are more worthy than some mundanes her gaze flicked to imbris rider and even some ogres are good people i caught that grundy exclaimed theyre talking about you smash in dreams and why not smash inquired mildly theyre friends of mine aw you dont even think like an ogre any more youre no fun the golem complained the others laughed and there may be some reason for you to have that half soul chem concluded privately in imbris dream often these things turn out to have greater meaning or direction than we at first appreciate i like to think that night mare someday my shared soul will help you as greatly as your assistance helped me obviously it wont rescue you from the void but they spied a harpy sitting on a branch of a pepper tree the marching troops had skirted this tree generously so as not to catch the sneezes the harpy seemed to be immune perhaps because she was already fouled up with dirt hey birdbrain grundy called in his usual winning manner how about doing some aerial reconnaissance for us for you the harpy screeched indignantly she had the head and breasts of a woman and the wings and body of a buzzard this one was fairly young were it not for the caked grime her face and form might have been tolerable why should i do anything for your ilk you blankety blank imbri and chem stiffened the latters delicate shellpink ears reddening and smash turned his head for the blanks had not been exactly blank harpies were as foul of mouth as they were of body and that was about the limit of foul ness in xanth for the greater good of xanth fowlmouth grundy called back being the fastest to recover from the verbal horror that had spewed like festering garbage from the har pys mouth indeed he seemed to be mentally filing the terms for future use though there were few if any occa sions where he might safely do so to help stop the invad ing mundanes from ravaging everything the greater good of xanth can go blank up a blankety blank sidewise the harpy retorted its no blankety doubleblank to me again it took a moment for the terminology to clear even the pepper tree was turning red if there was one thing harpies were good at it was bad language there will also be a lot of carrion after the battle grundy said gooey gooky corpses steaming in the sun swelling and popping open guts strewn about the harpys eyes lighted with dismal fires oh slurp she exclaimed it makes me unbearably hungry i thought it might grundy said smugly strangely enough no one else looked hungry all you have to do is night mare fly by the enemy positions and report where they are and how many thats too much blank blank worki spiked eyeballs chopped livers severed feet ill do it the harpy screeched licking her dirty lips she launched from the tree stirring up a huge cloud of pepper and flapped heavily north but the mundanes may shoot her down with an ar row chem protested without much conviction the smell will keep them beyond arrow range grundy said facetiously it occurred to imbri however that he might be right it took some time to get used to harpy scent now they came to the gap chasm and proceeded across this was the only visible twoway bridge so was the most used it would have to be the first to go if the mun dane wave got this far the gap dragon was present it raged and reached up ward but the gap was too deep to make this a serious threat go choke on your own tail steamsnoot grundy called down to it and dropped a cherry bomb he had plucked carefully from the castle roogna orchard tree the dragon snapped at it and swallowed it whole there was a muffled boom as the bomb detonated and smoke shot out of the dragons ears but it seemed to make no difference the monster still raged and pursued them the gap dragon was tough no doubt about it by the time they were across the harpy was back there are about three hundred of them she reported theyre headed toward the nickelpede crevices i dont like that the nickels dont leave anything behind worth eat ing chem concentrated and her magic map formed it showed the nickelpede crevices a minor network of cracks in the ground where exactly are the mundanes she asked the harpy gave her the specifics and chem plotted them on her map then the harpy flew off explaining that she had trouble with the smell of the human folk now they had a clear notion of the disposition of the enemy troops but there are only three hundred of them here night mare night mare chem remarked that suggests they are holding back half their force perhaps as a reserve they drew abreast of king dor to advise him yes well try to drive them into the nickelpede crevices he agreed if they take cover there theyll regret it but dors troops were out of condition and not young their average age was near fifty progress was slow they would not reach the mundane wave before it cleared the nickelpede region such a fine opportunity lost we shall have to establish our position and wait for them king dor decided as i recall theres a love spring north of the gap there is chem agreed projecting her map right here she pointed to the spot were already past it and the path by it is oneway we cant reach it from here thats fine i dont want to reach it i want to avoid it i dont want my troops drinking from it grundy laughed thats for sure but maybe if we fetched some of that water for the mundanes theyd im mediately breed with any female creature they saw no dor said thats not funny grundy we wont fight that way the golem scowled you can be sure the mundanes would fight that way they have no civilized scruples thats what makes them so tough but we do have civilized scruples king dor said perhaps that is what distinguishes us from the mundanes we shall maintain that distinction yes your majesty the golem agreed with disgust what other difficult aspects are there between us and the nextwave king dor asked chem theres a river that changes anyone who drinks from it into a fish she answered pointing it out on the map from what ichabod said i think theyve encountered an arm of that river farther north but they may not realize its the same and over here is the peace forest where people become so peaceful they simply lie down and sleep for ever that wont give the mundanes any trouble grundy said theyre not peaceful at all but we should keep our troops clear of it king dor said and the river well have to find a safe supply of water anything else just the nickelpedes chem answered but the mun danes will be past that region and the peace pines the river is probably where well meet them king dor sighed so be it i hope we can stop them without too much bloodshed no one replied imbri knew they shared one major con cern did this young untried king have what it took to halt the devastating incursion of a mundane wave of con quest they would know the answer all too soon to the gratified surprise of all king dor did seem to know what he was doing he ranged his troops along the river having them dig trenches and throw up embank ments with brush piled up in front so that the archers could sight on the enemy without exposing themselves he had the spearmen ranged in front of the archers to protect them from charging enemy troops and the swordsmen in front of the spearmen do not break formation until your captains give the order king dor concluded they outnumber us they may try a false retreat to draw us out so they can fall on us in the open beware do not assume that those who lack magic are not dangerous the men chuckled they were all former mundanes and lacked magic themselves the king had paid them a kind of compliment now they just had to wait for the arrival of the enemy the harpy eager for the spoils of battle continued her spy overflights so everyone knew the mundanes were not trying anything fancy they were marching straight down the main path without any attempt at secrecy they had no advance scouts and sent no detachments out to flank a potential enemy force in this respect they were indeed merely a horde charging down the route of least resistance at greatest speed their progress was marked by flame and smoke they left mainly ashes in their path the north vil lage was gone and it would be long before the centaur range was green again imbri hurt thinking of all that wanton destruction of excellent pasture yet she could understand the mundanes night mare rationale the fire destroyed the unknown threats of magic and routed hiding magic creatures making the mundanes feel more secure i dont trust this chet centaur said either theyre criminally careless or they have no respect at all for the opposition or its a ruse of some sort where are the rest of their troops maybe they plan to take castle roogna before we know theyre coming king dor said perplexed mundanes are unsubtle folk but we cant afford to underestimate them all i want is to stop them today if they have to forage in their own burnedout territory theyll soon be hungry and thirsty grundy added eyeing the river i suppose transformation is kinder than slaughter king dor agreed with a sigh certainly king trent be lieved that it was it was late in the afternoon when the nextwave arrived the motley crew forged up to the river not even noticing the embankments beyond it there was no action by dors army his captains would give the attack order only on his signal imbri was much impressed the young king had amazing grasp of the strategy of battle it was almost as if he had fought mundanes beforeand of course that was impossible as there had been no wave in his lifetime or in the lifetimes of his parents or grandparents only imbri herself had ever seen a wave surge into xanth as far as she knew though maybe good magician humfrey was old enough well there were the zombies and ghosts who had existed in their ageless manner for centuries but they didnt really count the first mundanes threw themselves down beside the river and slurped up the sparkling water they converted instantly to fish who leaped and flipped with amazement and discomfort until they splashed into the water and dis appeared the standing wavers stared but they were not com pletely dull very soon they caught on to the nature of the enchantment realizing that this was the same river they had encountered before immediately they cried the alarm to their companions some of these were skeptical they had not seen the night mare transformations of their leading comrades and suspected some crude mundane practical joke was being played to aggravate their thirst so one dropped down to guzzle wa terand turned into another fish while all were watching that did it guards were posted along the river to warn the others and the mundane losses were cut perhaps a dozen had become fish the great majority remained the mundanes pushed on past the river obviously want ing to find a better place to camp for the night then they spied the barricades we should give them fair warning king dor said fair warning grundy expostulated youre crazy then the golem looked abashed remembering to whom he was talking figuratively speaking your majesty opinion noted king dor remarked dryly and in that moment he reminded imbri of king trent imbri can you project a warning dream that far it would have to be very diffuse and weak she sent they would probably shrug it off as of no consequence king dor nodded he spoke to the leader of the xanth army ask for a volunteer to stand up and warn the mun danes not to proceed farther ill do it myself sir the man said saluting he was a balding fattening middleaged man but he had done good work organizing the troops and handling the logistics of feeding and moving so large a forceone hundred men on such short notice the man lumbered down the back slope of the hill on which king dor was situated so as not to give away the kings location he circled to the rear of the barricade and mounted a convenient boulder then he cupped his mouth with his hands and shouted with excellent military volume mundanes halt the leading mundanes looked up then shrugged and marched on ignoring him halt or we attack the xanth leader cried the leading mundane brought his bow about whipped an arrow out of his quiver and shot it at the xanth gen eral the other mundanes charged toward him well we tried king dor said regretfully he signaled night mare the general who had dodged the first arrow and now was taking cover behind the boulder the general gave the order the xanth archers sent their first shafts flying most of them missed either because the archers were long out of practice or because their hearts werent in it for over two decades they had opposed mon sters not men or indulged in elaborate war games whose relation to actual warfare was questionable one arrow did strike a mundane more or less by accident blood the harpy screeched hungrily the mundanes finally realized they were under attack they retreated across the river protecting their bodies with their shields a couple of them tripped as they stepped backward through the water fell gulped and became fish now the mundanes were angry as perhaps they had reason to be they lined up along the river and shot off a volley of arrows but these did not have much effect be cause of the embankments and brush that protected the xanth troops then hasbinbad the carthaginian leader appeared at the front splendidly armed and armored in the grand punic tradition he was a considerable contrast to the mot ley assortment of archers and spearmen he commanded imbri could not overhear his words but the effect on the mundanes was immediate they formed into a phalanx shields overlapping and marched back across the river the xanth defenders were astonished but a few of them knew of this type of formation and word quickly spread the mundanes were now virtually impervious to arrows but the xanth commander knew about this sort of thing at his orders crews of strong men heaved at boulders that had been scouted and loosened earlier starting them rolling grandly down the slope one crunched directly toward the phalanx the mundanes saw it coming and scattered their formation broken that threat had been abated maybe the nextwave would be contained imbri thought they had to pass this spot to get to castle roogna and they werent making headway yet soon night would fall and the nocturnal creatures would emerge forcing the en emy to seek cover but the mundanes who remained beyond the river had night more been busy they had a big fire goingthey certainly liked to burn thingsand now were poking their arrows into it were they destroying their weapons that did not seem to make much sense then they stood and fired their burning arrows at the brush barriers of the defenders trouble chet centaur muttered we should have anticipated this trouble indeed the dry brush blazed up quickly de stroying the cover men ran to push out the burning sec tions but during this distraction the entire mundane army charged in a mass the xanth archers sent their arrows more seriously now bringing down a number of the enemy but this was only a token soon the mundanes were storm ing the barricades brandishing their weapons and the xanth troops were fleeing in terror a rout was in the making i wont put up with this king dor cried take me there chetl but you could be killed the centaur protested i have faced death before the king said seriously if you dont carry me ill go afoot chet grimaced then drew his sword and galloped for ward idiocy chem muttered taking her coil of rope and pacing her brother carrying the golem imbri agreed with herand bore smash right behind them one thing was certain there were no cowards in the kings body guard but plenty of fools they charged to the burning barricades where the mufl danes were making their way through suddenly the flames began talking as the king exerted his talent im going to destroy you mundane one cried as it licked close ill really bum you up a number of mundanes whirled startled yes you ar morface the flame taunted ill scorch the skin off your rear and boil you in your own fat beware my heat some mundanes hastily retreated but others leaped out the near side they closed on the kings party get him one cried thats their king but now smash the ogre went into action he swelled up monstrously bursting out of his human trousers until he was twice the height and six times the mass of a man night mare he no longer sat astride imbri he stood over her he roared and the blast of his breath blew the leaves off the nearest trees and bushes and shook the clouds in their or bits he ripped a small tree from the ground and swung it in a great arc that wiped a swath clear of enemy personnel it seemed the mundanes had not before encountered an angry ogre they would be more careful in the future king dor and chet trotted on and where they went the ground yelled threats at the mundanes and the stones made crunching noises as if a giant were tromping near and dry sticks rattled as if poisonous the mundanes were continuously distracted and more of them retreated in dis array any who sought to attack dor were balked by the sword and rope of the two centaurs and many of the rest were terrified by the charging ogre the punics seemed daunted as much by the strangeness of this new opposition as by its ferocity the xanth troops rallied and came back into the fray blood had been shed now they knew for certain that this was serious business longneglected skills returned in strength soon the mundanes were routed fleeing across the river and north as dusk came king dor called off the chase not wanting to risk combat at night the harpy had her hearts desire there were some fifty mundane corpses left on the battlefield but there were also twenty xanth dead and twice that number wounded the brief action had been mutually devastating this was ev ery bit as bad as the terrible dreams imbri had delivered during the campaign of the lastwave still it was a techni cal victory for the home team and the pain of the losses was overbalanced by the satisfaction of successfully turning back the nextwave this is internecine warfare chet said it does great harm to both sides i wish there were some more amicable way to deal with this problem it isnt ended king dor said theyll return tomor row and they still outnumber us we have barely forty men in fighting condition we must set up new boulders and make a rampart that is impervious to fire well haul up supplies of river water which no one must drink and drill ontargets for bow and arrow accuracy we can hold night mare them if we work at it but it still will not be easy and if we hold them for another day or so chem added they should lose interest in fighting and gain inter est in feeding themselves then it may be possible to nego tiate an end to hostilities and the wave will be over imbri hoped it would be that easy she had a deep dis trust of the mundanes and knew how devious they could be the troops were allowed to eat and sleep in shifts while others labored all night on the defenses the walking wounded were encouraged to walk south back across the bridge over the gap as this was safer than remaining for tomorrows renewed battle if the mundanes were hurting as badly as the xanthians they would not renew the at tack but that was uncertain the two centaurs the golem the ogre and imbri ranged themselves about king dors tent and slept by turns also there was no trouble evidently the mundanes were no more eager to fight by night than were the xanthians did you notice chet said at one point apparently hav ing cogitated on the events of the day there are no mun dane horses here they must all be with their reserves imbri hadnt noticed but realized it was true she should have been the first to make that observation if the punics had wanted to move rapidly why hadnt they used their horses maybe they did not have enough horses for every man she sent and could not take time to let the horses graze so could not use them here an allhorse mounted party would have been too small to capture castle roogna but surely those horses will be used later quite possible chet agreed but i also wonder whether the missing horses and the missing men can be doing an encirclement planning to attack where we least expect while our attention and all our troops are concen trated here we had better tell the king in the morning imbri sent he will want to set a special guard about castle roogna in case the mundanes do try thati fifty horses and riders could take castle roogna if our forces were else where night mare reassured that they had anticipated the mundane ploy they relaxed the mundanes amazingly attacked again at dawn they formed another phalanx this time maneuvering skill fully to avoid the rolling boulders your majestyl grundy called the enemy is attack ing there was no response from the tent chet swept the flap aside and they all peered in king dor lay still his eyes staring upward but he was not awake chet drew the king to a sitting posture dor breathed but did not respond his eyes continued staring imbri nicked a dream at him and encountered only blankness he has gone the way of king trent chem exclaimed horrified after that it was disaster the mundanes rapidly over ran the xanth defenses the surviving home troops fled and this time there was no one to rally them the centaurs tied the king to imbris back then guarded her as she car ried their fallen leader back to castle roogna seeming vic tory had become disaster and what would they tell queen irene dors brandnew wife and widow chapter the zombie master c rfomehow i knew it irene said a night mare told me dor would not come back she was dressed in black i blotted the dream from my mind thinking to escape the prophecy but when i saw your party coming i remembered she looked at king dor suppressing her ex pression of grief for the moment take him to the kings chamber they took king dor up to join king trent and irene remained there there was nothing more to say to her at the moment who is the next king grundy asked it has to be a magician that would be the zombie master chet said magi cian humfrey is too old and he doesnt participate in con temporary politics when king trent was lost in mundania eight years ago and king dor had to go look for him the zombie master reigned for a couple of weeks quite compe tently when there was a quarrel he would send a zombie to break it up pretty soon there were very few quarrels chet smiled knowingly but the zombie master is off in the southern unex plored territory chem protested he likes his privacy i dont even have him on my map and the magic mirrors still out of commission grundy said we cant call him we should have had that mirror fixed long ago chem muttered but it seemed like such a chore when we didnt have any emergency life is ever thus chet said weve got to reach him hes got to be king again at least until king dor gets night mars better and hell have to stop the nextwave from crossing the gap chasm dors not getting better grundy said queen iris tried everything to bring king trent around but the healer says its an ensorcellment not an illness and we dont know the counterspell i can reach the zombie master imbri projected i have been to his castle before delivering dreams to his wife his wife is millie the ghost chet protested surely she doesnt have bad dreams she worries about the mischief her children may get into imbri sent now thats worth worrying about chem agreed they visited castle roogna some years back and im not sure the place has recovered yet those twins must drive even the zombies to distraction we have to get news to the magician that the onus has fallen on him again grundy said he wont believe im bri alone he doesnt know her and will think its just an other bad dream hell believe irene chet said but i dont know whether she shes all broken up right now chem said i dont think she can handle it theres chameleon chet said but shes lost her son chem shook her head theres more to chameleon than shows but shes not yet out of her pretty phase that means we all know what that means grundy cut in but maybe its better for her to be busy while her husband is away in mundania cynically put chem said still we could ask her the need is pressing they asked her chameleon pale from reaction to her sons sudden fate nevertheless did not hesitate ill go just like that imbri and chameleon were traveling again this time without other companions they had de layed three hours until nightfall for that was the night night mare mares best traveling time and with the gourds the dis tance did not matter imbri filled up on hay and oats and chameleon forced herself to eat too preparing herself for the excursion at dusk they went out going to the nearest patch of hypnogourds as darkness thickened imbri phased through the peephole and galloped across another segment of the gourd world she regretted she couldnt stop to check in with the night stallion and report on her recent activi ties but he surely knew and he could send another night mare to contact her any time he needed to the gourds ushered any ordinary peeper into a continu ing tour locked to the particular person if someone broke eye contact he reverted immediately to the world of xanth but if he looked into any gourd again he would find himself exactly where he left off imbri was not bound by that she was passing strictly from one gourd to another and the terrain was incidental but she was carry ing chameleon and this influenced the landscape they were in the region they had left beforethe burning ice berg but the amorphous entities that reached for chameleon no longer frightened her i have lost my son she said simply what worse can the likes of you do to me imbri realized that the woman was smarter than she had been she was also less lovely though still quite good looking for her age every day made a difference with her and several days had passed since their last journey to gether the amorphous shapes gaped and grabbed but were helpless against the womans disdain also imbri and her rider were not completely solid here nothing in the gourd could touch them physically imbri galloped on over the iceberg and down the far slope now they came to the stonemasons region the stone masons were made of stone and worked with wood and metal and flesh as was reasonable some were fashioning a fancy backdrop set painted with horrendous fleshly mon sters the stage scenery for some of the worst dreams there was of course no sense wasting effort bringing in real night mare night mare monsters when they werent going to be used the pictures were just as good in this case chameleon stared at these with dull curiosity why do they work so hard to make dreams people dont like she asked if people didnt suffer bad dreams they would never improve their ways or prepare for emergencies imbri ex plained the dreams scare them into behaving better and warn them about possible calamities theres a lot of evil in people waiting to take over unless they are always on guard against it oh like not fixing the magic mirror well that was close enough probably a warning dream should have been sent about that but of course it was hard for the night stallion to keep up with every minor detail of a crisis people did have to do some things on their own initiative after all they moved on past the stonemasons and into a region of boiling mud green and purple masses of it burst out in messy bubbles and bilious yellow currents flowed between them imbris hooves didnt even splash however she didnt need a mud bath whats this for this is the very best throwingmud imbri explained it is impossible to hurl a glob of it without getting almost as much on yourself as on your target most people after a messy experience with this start to mend their ways most a few are addicted to mud they wallow in it con stantly they cant have many friends thats the funny thing they have almost as many friends as the clean people the trouble is the friends are all the same kind of people but who would want that kind of friend nobody thats the beauty of it chameleon smiled she was definitely getting smarter they raced on through a tangle of carnivorous vines and out another peephole they were back in xanth proper in sight of the zombie masters new castle it looked just about the way an edifice constructed by zombies should look the stones were slimy green and crumbling the wood was wormy and rotten the hinges on the door and the bars on the windows were so badly rusted and corroded they were hardly useful or even recognizable the moat was a putrid pool of gray gunk this is certainly the place chameleon remarked imbri picked her way through the surrounding gravesites and across the bedraggled drawbridge she remained phased out so that she had virtually no weight otherwise it could have been a risky crossing a zombie guard met them at the main entrance halsh it cried losing part of its decayed epiglottis in the effort of breath and speech oh i never liked zombies very well chameleon said but she nerved herself to respond to the thing we came to see the zombie master its urgent thish waa the zombie said it turned dropping a piece of its arm on the ground zombies had the ability to lose material continually without losing mass it was part of their magic they followed it into the castle once they got past the decrepit outer wall an amazing change occurred the stone became firm and clear and the wood solid and pol ished healthy curtains draped the hall there was no fur ther sign of rot millie must have laid down the law chameleon mur mured he has his way outside she has it her way inside a good compromise the kind men and women often arrive at eh something inquired they both looked a huge human ear had sprouted from the wall and a mouth opened to the side chameleon laughed tell your mother she has visitors hi she said imbri remembered now the zombie master had twin children eleven years old named hiatus and lacuna then sign in dummy the lips said there ahead of them was a big guest book chameleon dismounted going to the book oh see who has signed in before she exclaimed satan lucifer gabriel jack the ripper king roogna night mare lackys talent is changing print imbri reminded her in a dreamlet oh of course i remember chameleon said she signed the book watching to make sure her signature didnt change to something awful then imbri set her right fore hoof on the page imprinting her signaturemap of the moon with mare imbrium highlighted chameleon im so glad to see you again it was mil lie no longer a ghost her talent was sex appeal and like chameleon she remained true to her nature as she ma tured she was now about eight hundred and forty years old with only the forty really counting and looked as pretty as her visitor the two women hugged each other its been so long chameleon exclaimed hasnt it been eight years since you visited castle roogna and then only because jonathan had to be king for a while that was simply awful he doesnt like indulging in politics chameleon sobered i have bad news for you millie millie looked at her quickly turnmg serious herself you came on business terrible business i apologize the king is ill too ill to rule your son dor is similarly iu chameleon thats horrible but the zombie master must be king now as he was be fore until the crisis is past millie looked stricken king trenthe was getting oldwe knew that sometime he wouldbut your son is in his prime he was ensorcelled millie stared at her for a long moment then her face began losing its cohesion as if she were becoming a ghost again i was dors governess i always liked himand he rescued jonathan for me he fetched the elixir that made jonathan whole and in doing that he gave me back my happiness i really owe him everything how could some thing like that happen to him night mare he got married then he was king then he won a battle against the nextwave then he oh chameleon millie cried horrorstricken now at last chameleon collapsed her burden shared my son what will i do without my son i was ready to to let him be married but thishes almost dead she was crying openly now millie embraced her again joining her in tears oh i know what it is to be almost dead oh chameleon im so sorry imbri did not wish sorrow on anyone that was part of what had made her lose her effectiveness on dream duty it seemed she had been thrust into a reality with horrors worse than those of dreams she had worried about chame leons lack of reaction to dors loss now she realized that chameleon had come to the right place millie the ghost had known dor almost as closely as his mother had shared grief was easier to bear than isolated grief a man appeared in the far doorway he was of middle age dourly handsome and wearing a black suit he was the zombie master the magician from xanths past you are a night mare the zombie master said to im bri i am familiar with your kind speak to me in your fashion imbri realized that it would be some time before the women were able to communicate intelligibly quickly she sent a dream that summarized the situation showing pic tures of kings trent and dor lying mindlessly on beds in castle roogna with the grieving widows sitting beside them xanth needed a new king i had hoped this type of crisis would not come again the zombie master said gravely i have seen prior waves in life and death this one must be abated i will go with you to castle roogna tonight chameleon can remain here with my family but you must bring your zombies imbri sent i fear there is no time for that at any rate most of them are already at castle roogna they will have to do thejob but how will chameleon get home when we have magician humfreys magic carpet here on s night mare loan but never returned she can use that when she is ready but she will be more comfortable here for the time being i believe i dont know imbri demurred if what you tell me is true i am now king pro tern balk me not mare that was the truth king jonathan the zombie master bade farewell to his wife and children then mounted im bri who trotted out into the night she returned to the gourd patch warned the zombie master not to be alarmed at what he might perceive and dived in this time they entered phantom land the phantoms swooped in howling say havent i seen you before the zombie master asked looking directly at one phantom the thing paused startled they are trying to scare you imbri sent naturally i am in the same business he concentrated on the phantom beside specter lake about seven hundred years ago i was the zombie jonathan keeping company with a ghost you the phantom brightened literally it remembered but that was in xanth the zombie master continued how did you get in here the phantom made a gesture of holding an object and of looking closely at it ohyou peeped into a gourd the zombie master said and got trapped inside the phantom nodded but i suppose one place is as good as another for your kind the zombie master concluded you can operate here as readily as in xanth and you have companions of your own kind and the useful occupation of acting in cau tionary dreams the phantom made a gesture of appreciative agreement someone understood then it moved on evidently having business elsewhere dreams were too important to be de layed by social meetings imbri moved on also she should have known that the magician would not be frightened by routine horrors night mare they passed through a region of spinning nebulae avoiding the brightest and hottest of them then on into a forest so thick with giant spiders that imbri had to weave between their legs to get through then on out the peephole of a gourd near castle roogna and to the castle itself you certainly have an efficient mode of travel the zombie master remarked the two widows were grieving by the two kings dry eyed and sleepless exactly as imbri had shown them in her dream for the new king imbri brought the zombie master right into the bedroom where both kings lay like corpses side by side the zombie master dismounted and approached this ascension is not of my choosing he said to the women allow me to verify their condition perhaps they can be revived he put his hand on dors forehead he does not re spond to my power he is not dead no not dead irene agreed in a whisper ensorcelled of course we shall track down the source of that en sorcellment the zombie master said magician humfrey surely can do that but at the moment we must stop the advance of the nextwave about which the good mare im bri has kindly informed me i have fought a wave before in my prior life my zombies alone are not sufficient but abetted by a formidable natural barrier such aswhat is it something that crosses xanth the gap chasm irene said you moved too far from it so have almost forgotten it because of the forgetspell on it just so the gap chasm my zombies can guard the bridges and destroy them if necessary i shall need a lieu tenant who is familiar with castle roogna and the recent events i can not afford to waste time updating myself about recent changes in the castle grundy the golem irene said and ichabod the mundane he knows all about the enemy and chet and chem centaur and of course mare imbri indeed the magician agreed dourly and left the room imbri followed night mare soon there was another council of war grundy and ich abod reported all relevant details of their spy mission and chet centaur gave the details of the battle with the punics and the manner in which king dor had been enchanted the zombie master pondered there seems to be a pat tern here he remarked in each case the king was alone though seemingly well guarded in each case the enchant ment occurred by night i suspect we have a nocturnal enemy who can strike at a moderate distance or who is able to pass guards unobserved whom do we know who could do that a night mare imbri said in a general dreamlet my kind can become insubstantial and invisible by night and can project dreams from a small distance but we cant ensorcell a night mare the king repeated removing the crown it fitted him well enough but he evidently was not com fortable with such trappings and preferred to dispense with them could there be a renegade one with special pow ers i know of no renegade among residents of the gourd imbri sent the night stallion has special powersbut he is loyal to xanth and never leaves the gourd all other dark horses lack mental powers other than dream projection and regular horses lack even that there are only the mun dane horses anyway completely unmagical theres the day horse grundy said but hes stupid not completely stupid imbri sent he seems smarter as he becomes accustomed to our ways still i dont see how he could be the sorcerer even if he had night power twice he helped us against the mundanes he freed me from the horseman and carried chameleon on the spy mis sion i did not mean to implicate horses the zombie master said could some other creature develop similar powers chet shrugged the gesture started at his human shoul ders and rippled down along his equine forepart any thing is possible perhaps a variant of a basilisk who stuns instead of kills or a groupiefish stealing souls obviously some creature or person can destroy kings night more one smart enough to recognize a king since theyre the only ones taken grundy put in precisely the zombie master said and i am surely the next target there is one thing you should know about me i was a zombie for eight hundred years i was restored to life by a special elixir dor obtained and i owe him an eternal debt of gratitude i retain the power to animate my self as a zombie should i suffer an untimely demise so if the mysterious enemy should strike me down and i die you must locate my zombie and question it perhaps the iden tity of the mysterious enchanter will be revealed they all nodded sober agreement what a grim way to locate an enemy now i must rouse the castle roogna guardian zombies and march them tonight to the chasm it is surely our only chance to get there before the nextwave does tuning is critical the zombies are already mostly roused grundy said dor and irene got married less than a week ago in the zombie graveyard that would rouse them the zombie master agreed with a gaunt smile zombies love weddings and similar morbidities now i must go organize them into an army the rest of you get some sleep report to the chasm at dawn armed i may need some of you living folk to be captains as zombies do not think too well he left the room going to gather his forces captain of a zombie troop grundy said well why not zombies arent bad people once you get used to the smell imbri remembered the brief dream contact she had had with one zombie at the wedding maggoty blood pudding zombies might not be bad people but they were hardly pleasant companions still as warriors against the mun danes the zombies had definite promise at dawn imperfectly rested they reported as directed the king had already ranged his zombies along the chasm and behind trees the mundanes could cross only where the bridges were and since one bridge was oneway from night more south to north and another was invisible the third was the obvious choice it was visible and solid with a wellworn path to it the mundanes had had a full intervening day to regroup and travel and they had not wasted it at midmoming they arrived at the gap chasm following the main path they had evidently learned that straying from the path was to invite assorted and awful hazards the wilderness of xanth had ways to enforce its strictures immediately the zombies closed on them throwing chunks of rotting flesh and fragments of bone in lieu of missiles the nextwavers reacted exactly as they were supposed to they screamed and retreated in confusion mundanes were prejudiced against zombies as they were against ghosts ghouls vampires werewolves and similarly innocent crea tures and tended to avoid physical contact with them then hasbinbad appeared gesticulating again he ral lied his errant army the potency of a good leader was manifest the motley crew became a determined force the mundanes began attacking the zombies shooting ar rows into them naturally the arrows had no effect they could not kill what was already dead other mundanes hacked at the zombies with their swords this was more effective for zombies could not function well without limbs or heads but the mundanes aversion to the zombies handicapped them and many living men were brought down by the walking dead soon the ground was littered with bones and flesh freshdead mixed with undead now hasbinbad led a charge to the main bridge his surviving men followed in a hastily formed phalanx their overlapping shields brushing aside the zombies the mun danes were winning the battle we have to deal with that leader the zombie master muttered without him they are nothing with him they will prevail imbri had to agree leadership made all the difference had king trent remained active the wave would not have gotten this far king dor too had been winning how night mare could xanth defend itself when it kept losing its leaders just as they got the hang of it a picked squad of zombies guarded the bridge these were zombie animals more formidable than zombie people hasbinbad came up against a zombie wyvem the small dragon was in bad condition even for its kind and shed scales and flesh with every motion the mundane chief hacked at its snout with his sword the snout exploded like a rotten log teeth tongue nostrils and eyeballs showered down around the mundanes then the wyvem fought back exhaling a belch of fire the fire was as decrepit as the creature drooling out greenishly and licking at hasbinbads feet it was hot though the mundane danced back out of the way with a green hotfoot when the gasp of fire faded the nextwaver advanced again he lopped off the rest of the wyvems head ears brains and tonsils flew up in slices showering the mun danes again but the bare neck thrust forward jamming into hasbinbads face squirting candystriped pus forcing him to retreat a second time again the man struck vertebrae muscles and stringy nerves flung out festooning the wavers sword arm but still the man pressed forwardand received a faceful of watery blood that pumped out of the truncated torso he shook himself off as if not quite believing this was happen ing wiped the gook out of his eyes with the back of his left fist then slashed some more heedless of the guts and tat ters of skin that burst out and wrapped about his body he now resembled a zombie himself that mundane is determined the zombie master re marked hes the one who brought them through the snow covered mundane mountains of halp grundy said from ghoul to hitaly hes one smart ruthless cuss a zombie ant lion pounced at the mundane leader this was a relatively new zombie not very far decayed the lionhead roared showing excellent teeth and the antbody had six healthy legs and a stinger the creature was alert to the strikes of the sword dodging out of the way few zom bies had any sense of selfpreservation even hasbinbad recognized this as unusual night mare another mundane emerged from the phalanx aiming an arrow at the ant lion but three zombie goblins charged at him grabbing for his legs then the other mundanes got into the action soon they had dispatched the ant lion and goblins together with zom bie frogs rabbits and a wateryeyed hydraulic ram as the ram fell into the gap the gore and rotstrewn men stood at the very edge of the bridge on the bridge however was a zombie python buttressed by zombie roaches a zombie flying fish and a zombie cockatrice the mundanes concentrated on the python ap parently not recognizing the genuinely dangerous monster the cock hasbinbad tackled the snakes head distracting it so that two other mundanes could skirt it and start across the bridge that chiefs valor has just preserved his life the zom bie master murmured the two wavers on the bridge trod diligently on the roaches which popped and squished with assorted ghastly sounds depending on their state of preservation the wav ers swished their swords at the flying fish who darted around their heads squirting mouthfuls of stagnant water then the first mundane came face to snoot with the cocka trice there was a moments pause before the mundane dis solved into green goop and slurped off the bridge a living cockatrice could convert a living creature to a corpse by the mere force of its gaze but a zombie cockatrice lacked full power instead it halfway melted creatures to muscle rot the second mundane charged the little monsterand he too melted into putrescence and plopped into the chasm there was a choking sound from below the gap dragon had arrived on the scene and snapped up the gob now the poor dragon had mild indigestion avert your gaze use your shields hasbinbad bawled so loudly that imbri heard it all the way across the chasm one brave nextwaver obliged the man pulled his hel met over his eyes raised his shield and edged out onto the bridge guided by the guardrails listening to yelled in structions from his leader he oriented on the cockatrice night mare and finally used the bottom edge of his shield to sweep the little monster off the bridge the cockatrice fell and the gap dragon had recovered enough to snap it up there was a gulp then a kind of stifled belch now the dragon had a real pain in the gut i dont like this at all the zombie master muttered those nextwavers are too strong for us we may be forced to destroy the bridge i can bring them down singly as they cross chet said holding his bow ready the zombie master considered it seems worth a try though i am skeptical of its eventual success there are quite a number of mundanes who have not yet seen battle the bridge is too small a compass we have held them so far only because they can not bring their full force to bear but they will surely overwhelm us before long hasbinbad had by now dispatched the zombie serpent now the nextwave started across the bridge single file chet nocked an arrow aimed and let fly the shaft arced across the gulf then thunked into the face of the leading mundane the man collapsed and fell into the chasm the second nextwaver elevated his shield to protect his face the centaurs second arrow struck him on the ex posed thigh the man screamed lost his balance and fell the third nextwaver held his shield low but waited un til the centaur aimed watching closely when the arrow flew at his head he used his shield to intercept itand got caught by chefs second arrow aimed at his leg in this manner chet methodically dispatched six mun danes using as many arrows on each as were necessary to do the job then he ran out of arrows now the mundanes doubletimed across the bridge one after the other they had taken the unavoidable losses and finally were charging to victory their depth of numbers so feared by the zombie master was taking effect the bridge the zombie master snapped chet brought out his sword and hacked at the cables that supported the bridge they severed but the walk held so he chopped into that too hold the first mundane bawled seeing what was hap night mare pening of course chet continued desperately chopping chem swung her rope looping the first mundane just be fore he reached solid ground and yanked him off the walkway still the tough planks of the bridge resisted chefs sword this was a job for an axe and they had none imbri wished that smash the ogre were herebut he had been delegated to defend castle roogna itself in case of complete disaster since the palace guard of zombies was no longer there the zombie master had been warned about the missing reserve force of mundanes which might even now be circling to take castle roogna from the rear the ogre was also on the lookout for who ever or whatever lurked in the vicinity enchanting the kings so it was a necessary post and smash could not be spared for action farther afield the next nextwaver leaped across the opening crevice in the bridgeonly to be met by the zombie masters own sword stabbed neatly through the heart he died falling headlong on the ground the zombie master bent to touch the dead manand this mundane revived he stood up blood dripping from his chest master he rasped guard this bridge the zombie master ordered him let no living creature pass the new zombie faced the chasm sword in hand while chet continued chopping as the next mundane came across the zombie drove fiercely at him with that sword hey the next one cried youre on our side no more the zombie mundane grunted and slashed again the other warrior danced aside startledand stepped off the bridge now at last chet got through the final board the weight of the crossing soldiers snapped the remaining tie the bridge pulled away from its mooring and flopped down into the gap chasm screaming a dozen mundanes fell with it hasbinbad stood at the far side that wont stop me he bawled ill cross anyway and wipe you out youre finished king zombie imbri swished her tail in fury but the zombie master turned away my proper business is reanimating the dead night mare not killing the living he said i have been responsible for destroying more lives this day than ever elsewhere in my life i concede the necessity but detest the reality pray that the chasm holds them back sparing us further malice well have to watch them though grundy said to be sure i dont trust hasbinbad my minions will watch the zombie master walked away from the chasm but we shall be near to reinforce them until we know the nextwavers have given up imbri looked back hasbinbad the carthaginian still stood at the brink of the chasm yelling and shaking his fist take you out too zombie king his voice came faintly just like the transformer and firetalk kings so the attacks on the kings were definitely connected to the mundane invasion but how until they had the an swer they could not even take reasonable precautions against it they found a tent in the forest near the chasm that a large tent caterpillar had left this was the very best natu ral shelter available fashioned of the finest silk tent cater pillars made themselves very comfortable before they magi cally transformed themselves to winged form and took off the king retired for necessary sleep as he had not rested the prior night chet and grundy stood guard by the tent beating a path around it in a circle watching for any possi ble sign of intrusion while chem galloped back toward castle roogna with hews of the battle imbri found a forest glade close by that had good pastur age she grazed and slept for it had been long since she had eaten and rested properly and this constant physical existence was wearing no wonder the material creatures soon aged and died they simply wore out after an hours munching and cogitationgrazing was always the best time to chew on concepts between snoozesimbri became aware of the approach of another animal it was the day horse she nickered to him gladly discovering that she had missed him these past two hectic days where have you been she projected staying well away from the mundanes he replied in night mare the dream they have been coming south frightening me i think they are chasing me down youre beautiful but not bold she informed him we had two battles with them and have halted them only at the gap chasm i know i heard the clamor have you really stopped them i think so we cut the main bridge across the chasm and they dont know about the invisible bridge to the east if they try to climb down through the gap the gap dragon will get them theyve already lost about forty more men today xanth wont be safe until all of them are gone espe cially the horseman imbri remembered the double warning to beware the horseman and understood the horses personal concern she had felt those spurs herself still she wasnt sure he was the worst threat for one thing there had been no sign of him among the mundanes recently he must be with the reserve force way up in northern xanth so was no present threat especially hasbinbad too she amended hes just a brute man he drives straight ahead and hacks away at anything but the horseman is devious and clever he is the true leader and your real enemy the day horse certainly was hung up on that but we havent seen him since we escaped the punics that means hes up to something until you nullify him youll never sleep securely imbri didnt argue further if the night stallion and good magician humfrey both felt the horseman was the real danger he probably was but in what way that wasnt clear at all what could even the smartest least scrupulous mundane do to harm a kingdom of magic they grazed together for an hour then as night came on the day horse departed traveling south away from the mundanes seeking his safe haven imbri snorted indul gently to herself he was excellent company but he had his idiosyncracies the mundanes couldnt get him as long as they were north of the chasm and if they came south of it by some infernal miracle all he had to do was run no man night mare afoot could gain on a healthy horse and the trees of the jungle would block an attack by bows and arrows imbri returned to the zombie masters tent at night phasing through trees and hillocks she found grundy alert he spotted her the moment she returned to material form you dont catch me sleeping on the job mare he said smirking though if you stayed invisible id have a problem ill admit that much perhaps i should maintain invisible guard imbri sent no you have to graze and rest yourself the golem said perhaps not wanting to share the honor of guarding the king i could check invisibly every hour or so well then grundy had a notion could i go with you when you do certainly you would be invisible too goody lets check now imbri let him jump on her back then she phased out of sight and walked through the tent wall the zombie master was sleeping peacefully imbri sent a dream into his mind hello your majesty she said in her dream form this time a reasonably wellpreserved female zombie its only mare imbrium are you comfortable quite comfortable thank you mare the king replied except that i miss my family do you think you could put them in this dream certainly imbri said her zombie image shedding a hank of moldy hair in approved fashion she concentrated and in a moment millie the ghost appeared somewhat faintly but quite beautiful radiating sex appeal oh jonathan millie said i love you so much she opened her arms to him now this is what i call a good dream the zombie master exclaimed encompassing her their love had en dured the eight hundred years while he was a zombie and she a ghost evidently the flesh had not weakened it imbri having recently made the transition to mortality herself could understand this better than she might have before she left dream duty there was a special intensity to physi cal existence that insubstantial creatures could not experi ence night mare then an eye popped open in the nearby wall print ap peared beside it mush mush yuck go to your room children the zombie master snapped go make your own dreams cowed the eye and print faded the zombie master kissed his wife who responded passionately if there was one thing millie was really good at it was passion then the magicians eyes went blank he froze in place jonathan millie asked alarmed whats the matter but the zombie master did not respond he simply stood there staring through her imbri was abruptly out of the dreamfor there was no longer a mind to receive it hes been taken she sent to grundy right while he was dreaming but no ones here but us the golem protested imbri you didnt no i dont do that to people i cant and wouldnt if i could this was not the work of any night mare i would have recognized any who came and none came anyway ill investigate this grundy said make us solid quickly she materialized there in the tent grundy jumped down he made a whispering rustling sound talking to a patch of grass within the tent the grass didnt see any thing he said maybe outside the tent grundy lifted up the flap and scrambled out imbri phased through the wall and trotted to chet the kings been ensorcelled she sent to the centaur just now but grundy was on guard he cried snapping alert so was i but the king went from right under my nosein the middle of a dream i sent hey ive got it grundy cried from the tent area this tree says there was a man here a moment ago he climbed in the tree then jumped down and ran away chet galloped over to the golem who was it anyone we know the tree cant identify him grundy said all men look alike to trees anyway it was dark and he seems to be a stranger to this glade he could be anyone xanthian or mundane night mare he must be xanthian imbri sent obviously he has magic he threw a spell to blank out the king then ran away why didnt it blank us out too grundy asked we werent material the spell must have passed right through us or it was aimed specifically at the king as the other spells were chet said i agree it has to be xanthian someone with the power to cloud mens minds a traitor among us taking out our kings in the midst of a crisis so we cant organize a good defense against the nextwave exactly as hasbinbad threatened imbri sent this is no coincidence this is enemy action grundy was pursuing the trail questioning grass bushes and trees but soon the path crossed a rocky region that led into a river and was lost king dor could have handled this he talks to the inanimate but but king dor has already been taken chet finished oh were in terrible trouble what will we say to the oth ers the truth grundy said we were watching the king instead of the surroundings and we got skunked we need a new kingagain ill go imbri sent i can reach castle roogna quickly the queens must be told take me with you grundy said leaping onto her back chet you notify the zombies theyll have to defend the gap chasm as well as they can without their master yes the centaur agreed i fear the punics will pass the chasm but we should have a few days to prepare for their next onslaught he looked at the fallen king and ill carry him back to castle roogna this was becoming almost commonplace this disposition of the kings of xanth imbri felt the shock but not as hard as it had been when king trent and king dor were taken imbri phased out and charged through the night toward the nearest gourd patch she knew the location of most of the hypnogourds of xanth since the night mares used them for exits brace yourself for a strange environment she warned the golem night more it cant be worse than what we know now in xanth grundy muttered imbri feared he was right the kings were being taken faster now where would it end how could the loyal de fenders of xanth stop it when the sorcery could happen right while they were watching chapter good king humfrey queen iris met them at castle roogna some how i knew it she said every time we get our de fense going well we lose our king i have been mourning for my husband when i should have been protecting his successors you two go directly to good magician hum frey he must be the next king dont let him put you off the old curmudgeon cant refuse this time ill send word to millie the ghost if a regular night mare hasnt beaten me to it and will organize things here at the castle tell hum frey this is preemptive hes the last male magician of xanth and must assume the office immediately and no gnomish grumbling imbri realized that the old queen still had considerable spirit and competence now that the crisis was deepening she was putting aside her personal grief and shock to do what needed to be done she was providing some leader ship during the vacuum grundy had commented with in nocent malice on the uselessness of the queen whom king trent had married mainly out of courtesy now imbri knew directly that there was much more to it than that queen iriss grief was genuine but so was her mettle fortunately imbris century and a half of night labors had inured her somewhat to busy nights the golem re mounted and they galloped for the good magicians castle night mare she used the same gourd patches she had taken with cha meleon but her rider was different and so the gourd ter rain differed this time they charged through a region of carnivorous clouds that reached for them with funnel shaped whirling sucking snouts and turbulent gusts they whistled with rage when unable to consume this seeming prey clouds tended to be vocally expressive then there was a forest of animate trees whose branches clutched at them and whose leaves slurped hungrily but these too failed finally they threaded through a field of striking weaponsswords clubs and spears moving with random viciousness nooses tightening and metallic magic tubes belching fire noise and fragments yet again they passed through safely for imbri was long familiar with this region the world of the gourd had to supply every thing that was required for bad dreams and weapons were prominent this is a fun scene you have in your gourd grundy remarked relaxing once he realized they were safely through they emerged near the good magicians castle and charged through its walls and into its halls humfrey was in his study as usual poring over a huge tome he looked up glumly as imbri and grundy materialized so it has come at last to this he muttered for a century i have avoided the onerous aspect of politics and now you folk have bungled me into a comer yes sir grundy said the golem was halfway respect ful for humfrey had enabled him to become real long ago when he had been unreal also humfrey was about to come into considerably more power you have to bite the bullet and be king xanth has no bullets humfrey grumped thats a mundane anachronism he scowled as his old eyes scanned a shelf on which sat a row of magic bullets giving him the lie im not the last magician of xanth you know amolde centaur doesnt count grundy said his tal ent only works outside xanth and anyway hes not hu man night mare both arguments are specious his turn will come but first must come bink he will be king after me bink the golem cried incredulously dors father he has no magic at alll king trent had to cancel the rule of magic for citizenship just so bink could stay in xanth bink is a magician humfrey insisted possibly the most potent one alive for the first quarter century of his life no one knew it for the second quarter only a select few knew it now all xanth must know it for xanth needs him bear that in your ugly little mind golem for you will have to pass the word perhaps bink will break the chain breaking the chain imbri sent thats your advice for saving xanth from the nextwavel yes indeed humfrey agreed but it is proving hard to do i shall not succeed and i am unable to prophesy beyond my own doom but i think bink is the one most likely to break itor perhaps his wife will golem and mare exchanged a glance had the good magician lost what few wits remained to him the gorgon appeared in the doorway a heavy opaque veil covered her face completely i have packed your spells and your lunch my love she murmured and my socks humfrey snapped what about my spare socks those too she said i might forget a spell but never something as important as your spare socks she smiled wryly under the veil and set a tied bag before him on the desk not on the open tome he exclaimed youll muss the pagesi the gorgon moved the bag to the side of the book then she dropped to her knees before humfrey oh my lord must you go into this thing cant you rule from here whats this my love my lord business grundy de manded the gorgon kneels to no one humfrey picked up the bag what must be must be he said so it is writtenthere he jammed a gnarled finger on the open page of the tome imbri looked the book said it is not for the good magician to break the chain night mare the gorgons veil was darkening as moisture soaked through it imbri was amazed could this fearsome creature be crying my lord i implore youat least let me come with you to petrify your enemies grundy looked at her with sudden horrified understand ing to petrifyand she wears a concealing veil she wouldnt need for an invisible face the gorgons been loosed her power must not be loosed prematurely humfrey said not till the king of xanth so directs or it will be wasted and xanth will fall she must fetch her sister for the time when the two of them are needed but how will we know the gorgon demanded you restored the sirens dulcimer and have it waiting for her here but we may not even have a king of xanth let alone one who knows what to direct someone will know humfrey said mare imbrium i must borrow you until i recover my flying carpet golem you must babysit this castle until the girls return me but or until need calls you elsewhere what need the golem asked baffled you will know when it manifests humfrey cocked a forefinger at the miniature man do not diddle with my books and leave my spells bottled but suppose im thirsty some of those bottled spells would turn you into a giant a giant the golem exclaimed happily purple bugbear the gorgon concluded and the go lems excitement faded the magician climbed onto imbri using a comer of his desk as a stepping block he was small old and infirm and imbri was afraid he would fall then he hauled up the heavy bag of spells and almost did fall as it overbalanced him id better use a fixative spell he muttered he opened the bag and rummaged in it he brought out a bot tle worked out the cork and spilled a plaid drop a plaid banshee formed and sailed out through the ceil ing with a trailing wail night mare no wrong bottle the gorgon said standing here let me get it she reached into the bag and drew forth a white bottle she popped the cork and spilled out a drop immedi ately it expanded into a white bubble that floated toward imbri and the magician overlapped them and shrank sud denly about them cementing humfrey and his bag firmly to the mares back you see you do need me the gorgon said i know where every spell is packed stay humfrey said as if addressing a puppy move out mare imbri moved out phasing through the wall and leaping down to the ground beyond the moat in her insubstantial state such leaps were safe they were on their way to castle roogna but imbri was dissatisfied why didnt you let her be with you she sent reprovingly to the magician the gorgon really seems to care for you of course she cares for me the idiot humfrey snapped shes a better wife than i deserve always was but then because i dont want her to see me wash out he said a man my age has few points of pride and my doom will be ignominious that seemed to cover it humfrey loved the gorgon his way of showing it was subtle still imbri had a question if you know you will fail and are only going to your doom why do you go at all to buy time and allow my successor to return from mundania humfrey replied xanth must have a king a magician king and bink is the next but he is in mun dania without a king xanth will fall to the nextwave but to go to your death it is not death precisely humfrey said but since i can not be sure it will not in due course become death i do not care to temporize my wife will perform better if not handicapped by hope i have locked up hope that is a cruel mechanism imbri sent shuddering as they entered the eye of a gourd no more cruel than the dreams of night mares he retorted night mare the raw material of those bad dreams now surrounded them mirrors loomed before them distorting their reflec tions so that humfrey resembled now a goblin now a squat ghoul now an imp while imbri passed through stages of bovine ursine and caprine resemblances they entered a region of paper where nothing existed that was not formed of painted paper and the birds and animals were folded paper this is fascinating humfrey said but i have more immediate business mare i mean to unriddle the identity of the hidden enemy before he takes me out i will record his name on a magic slate and hide it in a bottle he can not find you must salvage that bottle and recover that answer so that my successor may have it you are the magician of information imbri sent how is it you do not know the answer some knowledge is selfdestructive humfrey replied some answers i could fathom but my fathoming would cause the situation to change perhaps creating uglier ques tions than the ones answered but mainly i can not accu rately foretell a future of which i am an integral part and the discovery of the identity of the ensorceller is in that future answers might seem valid but be false because of my conflict of interest imbri could not quite understand that but decided it probably made humanish sense after all the good magi cian was supposed to know they emerged from the gourd in the patch nearest to castle roogna and trotted toward the castle dawn was threatening for imbris travels did take a certain amount of time but she phased through the stone ramparts and delivered the good magician to the throne room where queen iris awaited him excellent she said the resources of this castle and of xanth are at your disposal good king humfrey naturally humfrey grumped just let me dismount but he was unable to dismount for the adhesion spell held him securely on imbris back he had to fish in his bag for an antidote he did not get it right the first time instead releasing a flock of green doves then a fat book night mare night mare titled mundane fatuities remarking that that had been lost for some years and would now be useful for entertainment reading which was probably why the gorgon had packed it he then brought out a rolled pair of polkadot socks the gorgon had indeed remembered finally he found the anti dote and was free to return to his own two feet now lets review the situation king humfrey said weve lost five kings with five to go what queen iris asked startled five kings he repeated irritated what five bink humfrey jonathan youre counting backward queen iris said and you and bink havent been lost yet she paused bink i just told you iris humfrey snapped it was me you told magician imbri sent hastily bink is to succeed you as king same thing youre both females how can i remember you apart now the essential thing is to beware the horse man and break the chain bink is the one most likely to but bink has no magic queen iris protested stop interrupting woman humfrey snapped the queens notorious ire rose her standard evocation of temper black thunderclouds boiled in the background split by jags of lightning this was impressive since they were inside the castle imbri liked to generate similar storms when she herself was angry but hers remained within the dreamers mind whom do you suppose you are addressing gnome king gnome humfrey corrected reaching into his bag he withdrew a vial removed the cork and shook out a drop that scintillated at the lip of the container as it fell the drop exploded in heat and light the queens storm cloud sizzled and shrank as if being fried in a hot pan and the lightning jags drooped limply the queens display of temper subsided the magician had made his point he had destroyed illusion king gnome she repeated sullenly the nature of binks talent is this humfrey said he can not be harmed by magic since the mundanes represent a nonmagical menace he may not be able to stop them but he may be able to break the chain of lost kings the chain of lost kingsl queen iris exclaimed that was what you meant and thereby provide essential continuity of government for xanth given that the mundane menace can be con tained the good magician paused when queen iris saw that he had finished she ventured another question why wasnt binks magic known before he should have been king by now if it had been generally known that he was secure from the threats of magic his enemies would have turned to nonmagical means to harm him humfrey explained therefore his magic would betray him after all so it pro tected him by protecting itself from revelation making his immunity from magical harm seem coincidental only king trent knew the secret and he protected it rigorously lest binks talent turn against him as a magical enemy for binks magic is powerful indeed however subtle its mani festation in fifty years of his life nothing magical has ever harmed him though often it seemed to or was aborted only by apparent coincidence i myself was unable to fath om his secret but obviously you know it now the queen protested i was able to penetrate it when he went to mundania humfrey said smugly that temporarily nullified his power i knew he had magic all along i simply had not known its nature but even after i ascertained this i couldnt tell anyone until now when he is away again and must be recognized as the legitimate heir to the throne of xanth he shall be recognized queen iris said grimly but how can there be five more kings after him if he is to break the chain of kings that detail is unclear to me the good magician con fessed yet my references suggest it is so how can there be five more kings when there are no more magicians in xanth the queen persisted there is one moremagician arnolde humfrey said but hes a centaur night mare night mare still a magician but his magic operates only beyond xanth inside xanth he has no power the law of xanth does not specify what type of magic a magician must have or where it should operate hum frey reminded her after bink amolde will be king and after arnolde humfrey spread his hands i would like to know that myself but my references were opaque if the full chain of future kings were known our hidden enemy might nullify them in advance paradox preserves the secret queen iris shrugged she evidently suspected humfrey was getting senile but didnt want to say it what can i do to help save xanth your majesty bide your time woman acclaim each king as he comes when the chain is broken you will have your re ward the single thing you most desire ive been biding my time while three kings have been lost she exclaimed then as an afterthought what sin gle thing you dont know i asked didnt i i dont remember whatever it is youll get it maybe before the chain breaks meanwhile these are difficult times humfrey yawned now let me sleep later in the day i must bait my trap he sighed too bad it wont be effective he reached into his bag again brought out a small folded wallet and unfolded it lengthwise and breadthwise again and again until it became a small fold ing cot he lay down on this and commenced snoring queen iris shook her head difficult times indeed she repeated they dont make kings the way they used to humfrey always was the most annoying man there was a noise outside as the sun came up queen iris walked to the largest window and opened it the magic carpet sailed in and landed neatly on the floor chameleon was on it slightly less pretty than before i just had to come she said apologetically my husband is due home from mundania tonight and i have to be here to meet him queen iris greeted her with open arms imbri noted that human women did a lot more hugging than did other crea tures my dear i have a lot to tell you not much of it good they moved into another room imbri went down and out to the deserted zombie grave yard to graze and sleep on her feet the best grazing was always around graves she knew magician king humfrey would summon her when he needed her at noon good king humfrey summoned her back to the castle carry me to the baobab tree he said i shall set my trap there the baobab that was where she had gone to meet the day horse would he be there today chameleon appeared your majestymay i go now to meet my husband i want to be sure he does not blunder into the mundanes who are between him and here hes due in the isthmus tonight humfrey said now that he was king he did not seem at all vague or confused though he remained stooped by age imbri will fetch him then when she can travel swiftly and safely but i want to go with her chameleon said ive lost my king my son and my friend the zombie master i must see to my husband myself humfrey considered perhaps this is wise the night stallion believes you are important in coming events there will be much to prepare bink for in the short time re maining to him but you will need another steed arnolde will be with him but the centaur will be tired he is almost as old as i am you know imbri of course was older than either but night mares were eternal the day horse she sent he helped be fore he meets me at the baobab tree he can be the second steed humfres brow wrinkled even more than normal the day horse i have not researched that one is he magic no hes an escaped mundane horse chameleon ex plained he is very nice he would be an excellent com panion the magician shrugged as you wish he loaded him self and his bag of tricks onto imbri and spelled the works into place night mare well be back for you tonight imbri sent in a dreamlet to chameleon then she headed off carefully using the doors and stairs since this was solid day she trotted out to the baobab she did not see the day horsebut of course he would hide from the magician being very shy of strangers day horse imbri sent it is all right this is good magician king humfrey the day horse came out from behind the upsidedown tree hes not mundane he asked within the dreamlet far from it hes a great magician he knows every thing the day horse stepped back alarmed not everything humfrey grumped only what i choose to researchand i havent researched mundane horses and dont have time now come onwe have to set up my spells the day horse hesitantly followed them inside humfrey spelled himself free of imbris back then began setting out his devices bottles and vials and packages and books emerged from his bag in bewildering number and variety until the volume of them was obviously more than the bag could have enclosed naturally the magician used a magic bag that held an impossible amount what are these things for imbri asked in a dreamlet her equine curiosity getting the better of her she wasnt sure the magician would deign to answer its best that you know he said surprising her first i need to keep informed of the progress of the nextwavers therefore i shall release these spy is he opened a metal lic container by rolling up its top on a kind of key this seemed like an absolutely senseless way to package any thing but of course the good magician had his own ways of doing things inside were packed a score of white eye balls he shook the can and several popped out and hov ered in the air uncertainly go peek at the gap chasm he directed them snoop on the mundanes set up a regular schedule of reports the balls flew off in a line eye spy they whistled as they departed now humfrey brought out a bundle of paperthin doll cutouts i must also lure them to this spot so as not to night mare endanger castle roogna he said he untied the string binding the cutouts and the first ones began peeling off as they did they expanded and filled out hair unstuck itself and billowed about the headsections breasts popped forward from the upper torsoframes and legs rounded from the lower portions the dolls became floating air filled nymphs lovely in the manner of their kind but fun damentally empty they hovered bounced and jiggled ex pectantly follow the spy is humfrey directed them put on your airs on the return trip staying just ahead of those who pursue you any of you who get caught are apt to get punctured he smiled obscurely silently the nymph shapes flew away but if the mundanes come here theyll attack you imbri sent protestingly naturally humfrey agreed and i shall destroy them with my remaining spells he seemed to have forgotten his earlier remark about his plans being doomed to failure he reached in the bag again and drew forth a wetlooking loop of substance now pay attention mare in case i need your help though obviously i wont need it he held up the loop this is the river elba conveniently coiled he hung it on his right arm demonstrating its convenience it says able was i ere i saw elbow close enough if you untie the cord binding it elba will be unbound and will flood out the region do not free the river unless you have the enemy in a floodable region the day horse snorted humfreys nose wrinkled you doubt me horse note this he took hold of a single strand of the loop and broke it where it passed under the binding cord this enabled him to separate the strand from the main loop he tossed it at the day horse the loopstrand expanded in midair becoming a torrent of water the day horse was soaked the water splashed down his legs to his hooves and flowed on out of the baobab tree tapering off as its volume diminished it was indeed part of a fairly substantial river well you did snort imbri sent mirthfully the day horse shook himself not particularly pleased he did not snort again night mare humfrey brought out a box lettering across the top spelled pandora my secret weapon more potent than any other pandora was a charming girl who really didnt want to give this up he said smiling with an ancient memory but i knew shed open it if i didnt get it out of her hands he set the box down imbri wondered what the good magicians relationship with pandora had been and what had happened to the girl probably she had died of old age long ago what was in that box imbri experienced an intense female curiosity but decided not to inquire she would surely find out in due course box of quarterpedes the magician said setting out another item quarterpedes imbri sent inquiringly very rare cousins of the nickelpedes humfrey ex plained they are five times as bad they gouge out two bits at a time imbri had no further curiosity about that nickelpedes were ferocious little creatures five times as fierce as cen tipedes anything worse than that was too dangerous to loose upon xanth it was a doomsday weapon dirty looks humfrey said setting out a biliously swirling bottle jumping beans enormous squash other items appeared isnt a squash something to eatthe day horse ven tured within the dream imbri maintained for him on standby this one is to your mundane vegetables as a hypno gourd is to a pumpkin the good magician said with a certain relish which is not to say that the pumpkin does not have its place i remember a pumpkin carriage a young woman usedor was that a glass slipper at any rate this particular vegetable is not edible it likes to squash things the day horse twitched his white ears obviously im pressed now here is the higher power armament humfrey said bringing out a small book herein are listed selected words of power anyone can use them to excellent effect of course it is necessary to pronounce them correctly he continued setting out items humming to himself night mare what do you think imbri asked the day horse in the dream can magician humfrey stop the mundanes yes the animal answered awed can he stop the horseman she persisted though she was not yet clear what threat the horseman represented aside from his position as second in command to hasbin bad the day horse backed up a few steps skitterishly no i dont think so but the horseman cant put spurs to the good magi cian stay clear of the horseman the day horse insisted breathing harder obviously some element of this puzzle was missing im bri had glimpsed only a part of the good magicians array of spells but was satisfied that they could quickly ruin an army humfrey like the preceding kings was stronger than anticipated yet the day horse thought the horseman could prevail the first spy i returned what have you glimpsed humfrey asked it the seeing eyeball hovered before a wall it projected a beam of light where the light struck the wall a magic picture appeared it showed the mundanes using ropes to lower themselves down the wall of the chasm some men were already down these were using drawn swords and spears to fend off the gap dragon a number of them were lying in blood on the ground of the chasm floor but the dragon was suffering too some of its scales were miss ing and it was limping as more mundanes joined the first ones the dragon would suffer more humfrey imbri and the day horse watched fascinated as the procession of spy i balls constantly updated the newsreel report the tough mundanes drove the gap dragon back until at last the poor thing turned a battered tail and fled imbri had known of the activities of the gap dragon and its predecessors for all her life it was a merci less monster who destroyed all those creatures misfortunate enough to blunder into the chasm but now she felt sorry for the monster the mundanes were worse as the afternoon declined the mundanes crossed the night more bottom of the chasm and set their ropes for climbing the south wall a few zombies remained to guard the chasm they flung down the ropes preventing any anchorage from being achieved mundane archers ranged along the north side to shoot arrows at the zombies these scored but of course did not have any significant effect but the arrows trailed cords that dangled down into the chasm the wav ers below grabbed the ends and yanked the zombies down then they chopped the zombies into pieces too small to continue fighting the punics had certainly gotten over their initial horror of the undeadi now the mundanes flung anchors up and when the ropes were firmly caught hauled themselves up hand over hand the process was timeconsuming but inevitable by nightfall the entire punic army as much as remained of it would be on the south bank of the gap xanths greatest natural barrier had been conquered by the enemy humfrey made a note two hundred and five surviving mundanes he said a number of those are wounded no horses or elephants more than enough to swamp castle roogna but my bag of tricks can accommodate them the problem will be the other band of nextwavers who remain in northern xanththe reserves we have no such re serves the other band remains north imbri asked she had been afraid they were circling south you did not suppose that six hundred troops could dwindle to two hundred merely by marching down the length of xanth the magician inquired curtly missing the point hasbinbad wisely divided his forces the horse man commands the reserve contingent though he seems to have delegated the routine to a lieutenant that is the force we must fear for it is whole and fresh while our defense has been decimated they have been using their horses to carry messengers back and forth so the second force knows what happens to the first and where and of what nature the hazards of xanth are these are experienced troops tough and cunning the good magicians talent for information was mani festing imbri realized humfrey had an excellent grasp of the tactical situation why then was he so certain he night more would not survive the encounter why was he so carefully explaining things to her she knew this was not his nature normally the good magician was very tight with his infor mation it was as if he thought she would have to invoke many of these spells or show someone else how to do it that belief of his if such it was was unnerving the spy i balls showed the nextwavers making camp and foraging for food and drink they were catching on to the bounties of xanth and now instead of burning out the region they were hammering out chocolate chips from an outcropping of chocolithic rock and tapping beerbarrel trees for flagons of foaming natural brew to which they seemed to be quite partial the nymphs travel slower than the i balls humfrey remarked i had thought they would lead the wavers here tonight but it will be noon tomorrow before they arrive my error i misread my prophecy he frowned im not quite as young as i used to be im making foolish mistakes that must be why im doomed to ignoble failure but your majesty imbri protested in a dreamier you have an excellent program of defense when you bring the punics here and loose your spells against them humfrey shook his head dont try to flatter an old curmudgeon mare youre a few years older than i am certainly my program is good i researched it years ago from a tome describing how best to wash out waves but i am about to make a single colossal egregious flagrant and appalling oversight whose disastrousness is exceeded only by its irony what oversight imbri asked concerned i am going to overlook the single most phenomenal flaw in my planthe one that completely nullifies all the rest it is ironic because it is a flaw that i would readily have perceived in my younger years when i was more alert than i am now but surely if you know there is a flaw im too dull and corroded to find it now he said i have cudgeled my ailing brain but i can not detect it the thing is so obvious any fool could see itexcept me that is my undoing that is why i forbade my wife the lovely gorgon to accompany me i am ashamed to have any hu night mare man being witness my final folly and i charge you you animals not to embarrass me after my failure by blabbing the truth in this respect just telf the world that i did my best and it wasnt sufficient but cant see the flaw eitheri imbri protested because you are blinded by your own marish folly he said at least you will have a chance to redeem yours at the cost of great heartbreak what folly is this she asked curiosity warring with distress if i knew that it would provide the key to my own folly he said swear to me now that you will protect my guilty secret when finally you fathom it disturbed imbri yielded to his entreaty i so swear she sent then she put it to the day horse in a separate dreamlet he too swore no one shall know his folly from me humfrey smiled grimly at least i salvage that foolish fragment from the yawning abyss of my indignity he lifted a small bag here is another potent weaponthe bag of wind loose it when only enemy troops are near for it is dangerous to all brace yourself well lest you too be blown away then he looked at the magic sundial on his wrist which showed him the time even when no sun was shining ooopsit is time for you to go pick up chameleon then you will have to teach your stallion friend how to remain in contact with you while you phase through the world of night lest he get lost forever in the gourd go to it hoofmates hoofmates imbri was startled and embarrassed by the appellation but the fact was she did like the day horse and knew that it showed and soon she would be coming into season if she did not wish to mate with him she would have to come to a decision and take action soon human females could be choosy and difficult about mat ing and usually were mares had no such option if she were near the stallion at the key time she would mate the day horse obviously was aware of that which was one reason he was indulging her by assisting in activities of lit tle interest to him such as the good magicians setting up of spells night mare the day horse was looking at her curiously imbri fought back her halfguilty thoughts perked her ears up straight and formed a dream for him to step into one with innocent open pasture for a background and absolutely clear of any suggestion of mating she doubted she was fooling him but had to maintain the pretense but his curiosity was unrelated phase through the night he asked in the dreamlet oh i forgot to ask you she sent relieved will you come with me again to carry ambassador bink home from the isthmus he is to be the next king of xanth so must be brought safely past the mundanes the mundanesi he reacted alarmed they wont see us in the night she sent reassuringly i want to carry his wife chameleon there to meet him so we need another steed chameleon he said gladly she is a nice woman you seem to like her better than mel imbri snorted her dream mare turning green with jealousy well she is human therefore a creature of power he really had an obsession about human beings whether negative or positive in the dream imbri shifted to human formjetblack skin a firm high bosom and with a regal flow of hair from her head how do you like me now she demanded he snorted with mirth i like you better equine i cant touch a dream girl thats what you think she said her dream form strid ing lithely forward youre wasting time humfrey snapped save your flirtations for the journey theres a war on the dreamlet puffed into confused vapor imbri was glad horses couldnt blush otherwise she would now be solid red she had indeed been flirting when she had re solved not to the presence of a handsome male brought out this aspect of her nature she walked somewhat stiffly out of the baobab tree there was a small spring beside it she went to it and drank deeply knowing it might be long before she drank again water was very important to horses especially when they were burning with embarrassment also she night more was giving the day horse time to come join her she was sure he would though his own equine dignity required that he not seem eager after all he was a stallion and stallions did not leap to the bidding of mere mares in a moment to her relief he did emerge he too took a long drink in this subtle way he had committed himself to the journey he had taken the first step she set off for castle roogna and the day horse paced her he was truly magnificent in the lessening light his white coat standing out bravely while her black coat made her almost invisible truly they were like day and night it was as if he epitomized the male of any species bright and bold while she was the essence of the female dark and hidden he glanced sidelong at her perking his ears forward and she knew he was giving her the horselaugh inside she had certainly been making a foolish filly of herself parad ing in the dream as a woman she was indeed somewhat smitten with the stallion the first she had known who was not her sire and knew she would not flee him when the season came upon her and would not retreat to some far inaccessible region before that time to avoid the compulsion of nature far region she had only to step into any gourd but would not he knew it too and knew she knew no artifice for equinesi the world of night he inquired in neightalk for she had shut down the dreams she relented and opened her dream to him i can en able creatures in direct contact with me to phase through objects at night and to use the gourd bypass for rapid travel but it is dangerous for there are spooky things within the world of the gourd you may not want to risk it and if i dont he asked cannily where will you be when you come in season she hadnt thought of it quite that way at least not con sciously of course she had a certain leverage of her own any normal mares in xanth were in the hands of the mun danes so he couldnt chance that and no other night mare was accessible he was the only malebut she was the only female stallions did not govern the times for mating night mare but they were always interested naturally he would seek to please her even at some inconvenience to himself he did not know her cycle for all he knew she might come into season tomorrow he had to stay close to her when opportunity came lest he miss it so she could be difficult and choosy too in the manner of the human women she could turn her favor on and off capriciously driving the male to distraction that promised to be funexcept that she really did have important busi ness to attend to she had to fetch bink to castle roogna before good king humfrey made his abysmal blooper and wiped out so bink could be king and take over the cam paign before the nextwave swamped the last bastion of xanth how important her participation had become my season is not yet she returned of course that did not answer his question she was not about to yield her newfound advantage by committing herself prematurely i must train you in continuous contact now while some light remains then well use the gourds to go to the isthmus with chameleon during darkness i like the sound of this he nickered so did she actually horses were not as free about bodily contact as human beings were but they did indulge in it you must remain touching me continuously for my phasemagic extends only to those in contact with me we must match strides exactly so we can run together without separating like this he asked in the dream and in the flesh he moved over until his side squeezed against her his flesh was soft and warm and firm he had a nice smooth coat and excellent musculature that made contact a pleasure like this she agreed feeling guilty again for enjoying the sensation so much what was there about pleasure that so readily inspired guilt she had associated with human beings so much recently that she was starting to react in the same confused way they did imbri and the day horse walked in contact then shifted together to a trot now the beats of their eight hooves be come two as one front hoof and one rear hoof struck the ground together for each of them beatbeat beat beat there was something very fulfilling about such a night mare cadence and even more pleasant about matching cadences the measured fall of hooves was the very essence of equine nature then all too soon castle roogna hove into view the day horse sheered away breaking contact ill not go there he snorted his abiding fear of human places taking over imbri sighed but understood i will bring her out you wait here it was a good place for a horse to wait for the castle orchards had extremely lush grass she left him grazing and trotted on into the castle cha meleon was waiting eager to join her husband it was a feeling imbri was coming to understand much better now that she had a male interest of her own chameleon seemed to have become less pretty even in the few hours of this day and now was hardly out of the ordinary in appearance but imbri knew she was corre spondingly smarter maybe she wanted to meet bink be fore she lost too much of her charm it was a natural enough concern a human woman without charm was the least fortunate of creatures the woman mounted and they moved out the day horse was waiting grazing dangerously near a pinapple tree that he evidently didnt recognize darkness was clos ing but still his white hide showed up clearly oh im so glad to see you day horse chameleon ex claimed with girlish enthusiasm the horse lifted his head startled he breathed hard half snorting imbri caught on this is chameleon she sent to him she changes each day getting less pretty more intelligent you saw her several days ago in her most beautiful stagebut she really is the same woman of course i am the same woman chameleon said you and i stayed in the forest while imbri and grundy and ichabod encountered the nextwavers and hasbinbad and the horseman we had such a nice time together the day horse softened allowing himself to be per suaded his ears perked forward chameleon stroked his nose now he was sure of her he nickered but i am different in my fashion chameleon ac night more knowledged not as prettyand i will become less pretty yet until you cant stand me at all i also have a sharp tongue when im smart as women do nobody can stand me then the day horse snorted he would not be that fickle surely he thought youll see chameleon said sadly the stupidest thing a woman can do is to be too smart give it another week maybe less if you can tolerate me then ill gladly ride with you again they trotted toward the nearest gourd patch chameleon became nervous will we be passing the place where she trailed off unable to finish we will not pass the place where your son was taken imbri sent in a gentle dream that could not entirely eschew the horror connection chameleon was standing up well perhaps millie the ghost had talked with her and put things in perspective millie had eight hundred years per spective but as chameleon became more intelligent dors loss would strike her more profoundly that was probably another reason she wanted to rejoin her husband especially since he was now in line to become king himself she was not going to be absent when the second of the two men in her life was in peril as if to distract herself from the looming grief chame leon chatted innocently enough to the day horse back when i was young i lived in a village on the north edge of the gap chasm and i had a separate name for each phase of my cycle i was wynn when i was pretty and dee when i was normal and fanchon when i was ugly the villagers knew how it was and treated me like three different peo ple and that made it easier but though they all liked wynnespecially the young menand half of them liked dee nobody could stand fanchon since anyone who mar ried me would get all three i was doomed to spinsterhood then i met bink who seemed like such a nice man though he lacked magic and i thought that if i didnt let him find out my nature i was foolish but i had an excuse as i was stupid at the time wynn was the first me he encountered so i thought maybe i could find a spell to make me normal all the time good magician humfrey night mare night mare told me no spell would do it but that all i had to do was go to mundania and when my magic faded i would be dee permanently so i tried but somehow things got tangled up and in the end bink liked me as i was so he unspinstered me she laughed no spell for chameleon i didnt need magic just the right man and if she lost bink imbri thought gloomily she would be in deep deep trouble they arrived at the gourd patch now get in step and in contact with me imbri sent to the day horse do not heed anything you see within the gourd if you break con tact you are lost the day horse moved close but chameleons right leg got in his way ill ride sidesaddle she said shifting her posture though there was no saddle she was quicker to catch on to both problem and solution than she would have been before and ill hold on to a strand of the day horses mane to be sure theres contact she caught his mane which was conveniently on the left side while imbris was on the right oh its like silk she exclaimed this was a gross exaggeration his mane was more like flexible white wires beautiful but tough the mane and tail of a horse were designed by nature to swing about and slap flies stingingly and were effective in that capac ity but the day horse nickered appreciatively he had liked chameleon in her prettystupid guise he seemed to like her better in her neutral state she was certainly a nice if ordinary woman now they matched step and plunged into the gourd ob viously the day horse was no coward about new experi ences it was only strange people he was wary of the green rind passed by them then they were in a region of massive wooden gears that turned slowly and ground exceeding fine now the day horse snorted with alarm but main tained contact with imbri together they charged between the gears imbri directing their progress through a continu ing dreamlet she showed an image of the gourdscape with a dotted yellow line marking their route she ran just to the left of that line he to the right it worked well enough for she was familiar with this region as she was with all of the gourd what are these wheels for chameleon asked she had visited the gourd before so was no longer frightened they measure out the time for every event in every dream imbri explained there are hundreds of people and creatures having thousands of dreams every night if the length and placement of each dream were not precise there would be overlapping and gaps and fuzziness each night mare has a schedule she must deliver each dream on time these gears measure out those times more accurately than any living creature could do even so there are many small jumps and discontinuities in dreams as the timing and placements get slightly out of synch thousands of dreams each night chameleon breathed awed i never realized there was such precision behind the few little dreams i have you have dreams all night imbri returned but most of them you forget by morning most of them are probably good dreams for you are a good person those ones ema nate from another source the true day mares are invisible horses who carry the daydreams and the pleasant night dreams they dont keep good accounts and dont seem to mind if their dreams are misplaced or forgotten they are happy careless creatures she realized she might be un fairly condemning the day shift perhaps from ignorance the day mares were probably quite decent when one knew them still then time slots have to be allocated and they must be integrated with the serious dreams we working mares deliver the coordination is complex i just never knew there was so much inside the gourd chameleon said few people do imbri sent they assume things just happen coincidentally there is very little coincidence in xanth it is a term used to hide our ignorance of the true causes of things on they went through the labyrinth of grinding gears leaping over small ones skirting big ones and jumping through holes in the hollow ones the gears were all differ ent colors and turned at different rates in a bewildering array at last they came to a new region this was watery and huge fishlike shapes swam through it loan sharks and night mare night mare card sharks and poor fish crowded the channels powering toward the team of horses then banking off with a great threshing of flukes no one in the gourd could touch a night mare or her companions any who did would answer to the night stallion and he was not a forgiving creature these fish were denizens of the gourd and could be dis patched to inclement assignments such as desert duty most unpleasant for a fish all who molested night mares had long since gone to the most hellish spots with the hoofprints of the dark horse branding their posterior re gions forever nevertheless the fish could bluff and this they were doing now the travelers came to a third region here coruscating beams of light sliced crisscross in every direction plus one some were burning red scorching what they touched oth ers were searing white vaporizing their objects black ones turned things frigidly cold green ones made them sprout leaves oh i know what these are for chameleon exclaimed they make things hot or cold or bright or dull or clean or dirty or anything she was certainly getting smarter yes imbri agreed discovering new interest in these things that were long familiar to her if xanth dreams were left to themselves they would be horribly bland they have to be touched up so that there is good contrast a great deal of art goes into dreams to make them properly effective then why do we forget most of them chameleon asked it seems like such a waste you dont really forget them imbri qualified they remain in your experience the same as does every tree you see every day every bug you hear buzzing and every gust of breeze your body feels all of these things influence your character and so do the dreams its amazing chameleon said shaking her head there is so much more to life than i thought i wonder if the mundanes have similar things to influence their char acters i doubt it imbri sent after all look at how brutish and bad they are if they had proper dreams they wouldnt degenerate like that now they reached another rind and burst out of the gourd they were in the isthmus of xanth the narrow cor ridor of land that led to mundania this was where bink and amolde would be arriving having completed another diplomatic mission imbri and the day horse separated it really was easier to run separately you came through that very well imbri complimented him i just concentrated on my running he replied tightly in the dream i knew if i looked about too much id lose my step and get separated they entered a plain where the flat hard ground was illuminated by the faint light of the waning moon and run ning was excellent imbri loved to run and knew the day horse did too horses had been created to do most of the quality running in xanth she tried to imagine the bad dreams being carried by lumbering dragons and suffered a titillation of mirth no it had to be done by true night mares then a shape appeared in the moonlight like a low flying cloud it was flat on the bottom and lumpy on top it swooped toward them imbri phased into intangibility protecting herself and her rider from hostile action hide she sent to the day horse but a voice from the cloud hailed them imbri chame leon its megrundy the golem so it was imbri phased back whatever are you doing here she sent indignantly youre supposed to be watch ing king humfreys castle while the gorgon is away emergency he said coasting down beside them i used one of humfreys bottled spells to summon the magic carpet and buzz right over here you certainly move fast i tore through the night so swiftly that ive got shatters of cloud on me glad i caught you in time in time for what chameleon asked suddenly the golem was oddly diffident well you have to know before whats that imbri projectedand as she touched grundys mind she became aware of a maelstrom within it the golem was generating his own bad images i had to tell youabout the good magician i activated night more a magic mirrorall it took was the right antiglitch spell it could have been done any time before and we could have had good communicationsi got the spell from a book the gorgon left for me in case i needed magic for an emer gencyand tuned him in or tried to have the mundanes attacked already chameleon asked worried no not exactly yes i guess so that is its a matter of definition hes gone what chameleons confusion was imbris too you mean the good magician left the baobab tree no hes there but not there i dont humfreys been taken grundy cried no chameleon protested its too soon hes gone just like the others staring into nothing bink has to be king right now thats why i had to reach you before the mundanes get to the baobab tree and wipe out all the bottled spells or use them against us chameleon put her hand to her eyes stricken already i wont have my husband at all any more than irene had dor bink can take the carpet grundy said hes got to get to castle roogna right away no chameleon demurred bink knows nothing about being king he has to be prepared theres no time the mundanes will be marching in the morning and were halfway through the night now imbri and i will bring him back she said firmly well prepare him on the way well catch him up on all the recent details hes missed by being away by the time he arrives he will be ready i hope grundy shook his little head dolefully youre the queen now you know but if xanth has no king when the mundanes reach castle roogna xanth will have a king chameleon said on your head be it the golem muttered chapter magic tricks i he good magicians prophecy of the moment of binks arrival in xanth was accurate in the early wee hours of the morning bink and amolde walked out of drear mundania chameleon ran to embrace her husband while imbri and the day horse exchanged diffident glances with the centaur grundy performed introductions youre just the way i like you dee bink remarked after their kiss he was a fairly solid graying man who had been physically powerful in his youth imbri remembered him now she had on occasion brought him bad dreams dee grundy asked bink smiled confirming what chameleon had already told the others my changeable wife has a private name for each phase dee is ordinary not too much of anything i dont know why i pay attention to her he kissed her again amolde was an old bespectacled centaur who seemed out of place in the forest he was by training and tempera ment an archivist like his friend ichabod one who filed books and papers in obscure chambers for what purpose no one understood but he was also a magician his talent being the formation of an aisle of magic wherever he went even in the most alien reaches of mundania this greatly facilitated contact and trade with that backward region he had no apparent magic in xanth itself which was why his status had been unknown for most of his life in this re spect he resembled bink and the two males seemed to en joy each others company might i inquire the reason for this welcoming party amolde asked we expected to sleep the rest of the night night mare here at the fringe of xanth then take two more days to travel south to the north village ha grundy said there is no please chameleon said interrupting the golem i must tell him in my own way but humfrey told me to tell himi grundy protested competitively the centaur interceded benignly may i suggest a com promise let the golem make one statement then chame leon can tell the rest in her own manner chameleon smiled fleetingly that seems fair okay grundy grudged bink youre king you have to get back to castle roogna right away you can use the magic carpet it will get you there in an hour king bink exclaimed what happened to king trent im not in line to be king of xanthi king trent is ill chameleon said then our son dor should take over dor is ill too she said very gently bink paused his face freezing how ill too ill to be king she replied it is an enchantment we have not yet found the countercharm surely good magician humfrey can bink saw her grave expression him too the same enchantment and the zombie master but humfrey told us that you are in fact a magician who can not be harmed by magic and that you have the best chance to break the chain of lost kings though he feared you would not you must be king and stop the mundanes the mundanes whats this the nextwave invasion grundy put in bink laughed mirthlessly i see there is indeed much for me to catch up on is the magic carpet big enough for two you and i chameleon could no grundy said it wont support two fullsized peo ple its a singleseater model and you cant take two days riding south youd get there after castle roogna falls to the mundanes and anyway the main bridge across the gap is down and wavers are all over the place and i wont let you go alone chameleon protested show night mare ing some fire she was not nearly as accommodating to the notions of others as she had been in her lovely stage ive lost my son so soon after he was married i wont let it happen to you but xanth must have a king bink said though im incompetent in any such activity i must try to do my duty how else can i get there in time imbri can take you chameleon declared with sudden inspiration shes a night mare she can get you there by morningand she can tell you everything you need to know and help you manage that way youll be properly prepared i find this mostly incomprehensible bink said but im sure you know best dee i had had another kind of meeting with you in mind so did i she said bravely by the time i catch up with you ill be well on toward ugly you are never ugly to me he said with a certain gal lantry but he could not quite conceal his disappointment he had been some time away from her and obviously she was a woman who needed to be appreciated at the right time go with imbri she said the rest of us will follow at our own pace they embraced again can the rest of you travel safely bink asked as he went to imbri oh sure grundy said the day horse knows how to stay clear of mundanes and ive got the flying carpet for emergencies ill ride amolde and keep him out of mis chief indubitably the centaur said smiling wryly ive got to fill you in on everything before i fly back to humfreys castle grundy continued youll be king after bink arnolde chameleon frowned grundy you are a perfect marvel of diplomacy she said with gentle irony i know it the golem agreed smugly bink mounted imbri and waved farewell to his wife imbri could tell by the way he sat that he had had some experience riding animals unlike his wife the centaurs night mare night mare probably accounted for that bink had traveled to mun dania many times and perhaps had encountered mundane horses there too imbri sent a dream of sad parting to the others seeing them as a pretty picturethe old centaur appaloosa carry ing the golem and the magnificent white stallion bearing the sad woman yet it was true that amolde too needed to be updated in detail for when he would be king if noth ing else he would need time to ponder whom to designate as his successor since things tended to move too rapidly for the council of elders to deliberate and decide imbri set off for the nearest gourd patch whats this about my son dor getting married bink asked her imbri sent him a small dream showing the elopement wedding in the zombie graveyardr she followed that with their discovery of the fate of king trent the dream be came a fullfledged narrative so that bink hardly noticed when they plunged into the gourd and charged through the maelstrom of the raw stuff of real dreams by the time they emerged from the gourd near castle roogna bink had become acquainted with everything relevant that imbri knew you are some mare imbri he said as the castle came into sight they were just in time dawn was threatening had it arrived while they were in the gourd they would have been trapped within the world of night for the day imbris night powers existed only at night as always they entered the castle queen iris met them thank fate youre here bink we just discovered king humfrey has been taken you i am king bink said with surprising certainty he had assimilated imbris information readily and now was taking hold in a much firmer fashion than imbri had ex pected bink had been a kind of nonperson in xanth con sidered to be a man without magic and therefore held in a certain veiled contempt that contempt had been unde served imbri suspected that even grundy and chameleon and the day horse expected little of bink already it was evident that he would surprise them xanths recent kings had not lasted long but each had shown competence and courage in the crisis yet how long could this continue in the face of the terrible enchantment that persisted in strik ing each king down they went to the room where the enchanted kings were laid out the zombie master and good magician humfrey had been added to the collection chet and chem centaur had evidently been out to the baobab tree and carried in the latest victim irene remained by her husband she looked up bink she said rising and going to him did you know that he we bink put his arm around her the mare imbri told me everything congratulations im only sorry you did not have more time together we had no time at all she complained making a moue the kingship monopolized him then he was en sorcelled she choked off her eyes flicking toward her supine husband somehow well find the counterspell bink said reas suringly they say youthat it cant happen to you it seems my secret is out at last your father knew it always that is why he sent me on some of the most awk ward magical investigations but i am not invulnerable the mundanes represent as much of a threat to me as to any one else but perhaps i can deal with this mysterious en emy who has enchanted these four kings i shall go imme diately to the baobab tree and try to use humfreys bag of tricks to stop the nextwave you seem remarkably well informed queen iris re marked yes only a man of my talent can safely use humfreys spells only those spells can stop the mundanes at this pointwhich of course is the reason humfrey was ensor celled before he could use them will use them and i want that enchanter to come to me his magic wont workand then ill be able to identify him thats why humfrey thought i might break the chain of enchant mentsif i can prevent the mundanes from taking me out physically night mare night mare then it is victory or real death for you irene said yes of course this is why magician humfrey could not foresee my future my talent prevents him and neither he nor i can handle the mundane element as a matter of divination he paused it is odd however that he the most knowledgeable of men was taken out by enchant ment not by a mundane weapon he knew it was coming imbri sent he said he was overlooking something important perhaps because he couldnt foresee his own future that was as much as she could impart without abridging her promise not to reveal the ignominious nature of the good magicians fall though it did not seem ignominious to her obviously the enemy enchanter had waited till humfrey was alone then struck stealthily the shame should attach to the enchanter not to humfrey take me there bink told her and the rest of you let it be known that i am alone at the baobab tree i want the enemy enchanter to get the news he looked down at his enchanted son i will set things right for you dor i promise and for the others who so bravely served the enchanter shall undo his mischief bmks hand touched the hilt of the sword he wore with a certain ominous signif icance imbri had not thought of him as a man of violence but she realized now that he would not hesitate to do what ever he felt was required to accomplish his purpose imbri took him to the baobab chem centaur was there guarding the good magicians spells everything seemed undisturbed how was he found king bink asked he was sitting on the floor here holding this bottle chem said picking up a small red one he must have been setting it up with the others when thank you bink said taking the bottle you may trot back to castle roognano just one moment he popped the cork red vapor swirled out horseman the good magi cians voice whispered then the vapor dissipated leaving silence he bottled his own voice chem exclaimed now we know who enchanted him bink said the horseman humfrey promised to tell us who and he did just before he was taken himself beware the horseman imbri sent in a nervous dream let that was his earlier warning it suggests the horseman is near bink said that is what i want he will come to me when i am alone he waved chem away humfrey was true to his promise he has produced the key information go inform the others i think we are on the way to breaking the chain at least we now know the meaning of the two prophecies we know whom to stop and why i dont like this chem said but she trotted obediently out of the tree i remember when she was a foal bink remarked cute little thing always making mental maps of the sur roundings shes certainly a finelooking filly now he turned to imbri i said i would be atone but i wasnt thinking of you i hope you dont mind remaining though i know you fear the horseman i dont fear the horseman imbri protested its the day horse who fears him if that horrible man comes near me ill put a hind hoof in his face and leave my signature on the inside of his skull good enough the bang agreed with a grim smile but it may be better to leave him to me as he is obviously no mundane and you may be vulnerable to his magic what does he look like imbri projected a dream picture of the horseman she was shaking with abrupt rage of course the man was no mundane he had deliberately deceived her so she would not know in what manner he was a threat to xanth and she had allowed herself to be fooled this was the sort of indignity humfrey must have felt overlooking the obvious thats very good imbri you have a nice talent there if you werent a night mare it would be a double talent dream projection and the ability to dematerialize at night but i suppose both are really part of your nature not con sidered talents at all he shook his head magic is funny stuff i have never been certain of its ramifications when ever i understand it some new aspect appears and i real ize that i dont understand it at all night mare imbri found herself liking this man in much the way she liked his wife chameleon he was a nice person no snob intelligent and practical with a certain unpretentious hon esty magic seems natural enough to me she ventured what is so hard to understand about it for one thing the distribution and definition of magic talents he said for centuries we men believed that all creatures either had magic talents or were themselves mag ical thus men did magic while dragons were magic then we discovered that some centaurs could do magic too so we have a magical species performing magic fudging the definition now we have you night mares bridging the defi nition also if we assume you are natural horses who pos sess magic talent we run afoul of the doubletalent prob lem for only one talent goes to any one person we had thought every talent was different but then we discovered the curse fiends who all have the same talentbut at least that does not violate the onetalentperperson limit but you i see the problem she agreed all night mares can phase out and project dreams maybe a creature can have two talents or a magical creature who phases through objects at night can have the single talent of sending dreams he said we can make it fit our present definitionsbarely but the suspicion remains that someday we will discover some form of magic that does not consider this horse man hes obviously a man with the ability to ensorcell other men thats not remarkable in itself my father ro land can stun people and of course king trent trans formed them but how does the horseman get around so handily without being observed does he have a second tal ent perhaps similar to yours of the night we dont know but must be prepared for that possibility now i understand your doubt she said magic is more complicated than i thought i would like you to review your knowledge of the where abouts of the horseman each time a king was enchanted bink continued obviously he was there to do his foul deed but he has also been associated with the mun danes when they were far distant the manner of his night mare travel may give us some hint how to balk him he must be a man of xanth helping the mundanes for personal advan tage evidently they made him second in command in ex change for his help but he does not help them too much he let you escape them knowing you were helping xanth and that would have the effect of evening the contest and making his service more valuable the rogue imbri sent emphatically with the image of the moon colliding violently with the sun and showering xanth with fragments of burning cheese if the mundanes and xanthians destroy each other he can take over him self such is the way of rogues king bink agreed his power is to banish the minds of people but it may not be inherent in him perhaps he has a bottle full of minds the same way good magician humfrey has bottles of every thing else maybe it is the bottle that does the magic suck ing in the kings but surely he had to approach his victims to do this we must not assume we know the precise nature of his magic imbri concentrated she had actually met the horseman only twiceonce near castle roogna just before king trent was taken and once in hasbinbads camp in north ern xanth she had not seen him when king dor was taken or when the zombie master went though it was ob vious in retrospect that he had been the man in the tree so he could have been there with the mundane army then bink said the mundanes were not far away just across the river while king dor slept you did not see the horseman because he was hiding skulking around waiting for his chance imbri had to agree in the confused situation of the bat flefield it would have been easy to sneak up close to the kings tent at night and the next time the zombie master was in the field too king bink persisted imbri reviewed the scene for him showing how the zombie master had been sleeping enjoying a dream imbri had brought him how grundy had tracked a man to a river and lost him after the king had been taken so we know he does not have to touch his victim physi night mare night mare cally bink concluded he can be a short distance away perhaps out of sight thats an important pointno direct visual contact needed he could have come here to this tree and hidden in a recess perhaps he was here when you were and simply waited until magician humfrey was alone it could have happened soon after you departed how many more of humfreys spells have been set out since then this was a most methodical approach imbri studied the bottles and boxes trying to remember how many had been out of the bag before not many more she said the horseman wouldnt have had reason to travel far in the night bink continued though i doubt he re mained here in the tree for one thing he did not disturb humfreys spells not even the bottle that named him surely a prime target he must have been nervous about discovery and not delayed one moment after doing his deed that suggests he can not enchant someone who is on guard or perhaps can take only one person at a time so must catch his victim alone and may be vulnerable for a period thereafter so he left quickly lest someone else ar rive on the scene smash the ogres little wife tandy is like that once she stuns someone with a tantrum she can not do so again for some time again imbri had to agree it made her nervous to think that the dread horseman lurked close by by daylight she could not dematerialize and that increased her nervous ness you surely need to rest and graze imbri bink said go out and relax but check on me every hour or so the pseudonymphs arent due to bring the mundanes here until noon i think the horseman will try to strike before then for he surely knows these spells of humfreys are danger ous to his allies the mundanes if i have miscalculated in any way ill need you to carry the message to castle roogna imbri nodded both reassured and worried king bink was several times the man she had first taken him forbut it seemed that the horseman was similarly more devious she went out to graze but the grass didnt taste very good she watched for the possible approach of the horseman fearing that he would somehow sneak past unobserved as it seemed he had done before the horseman had been making fools of them all so far every hour she checked but king bink was all right noon came and all remained well imbri was almost disap pointed she certainly wished no ill to the king but she hated this tension of waiting suppose bink were not invul nerable to the enchantment or suppose the horseman wanted to reduce the force of mundanes some more keep ing the sides even so planned to let king bink fight a while using the spells before taking him out or had the horseman already tried and failed unbeknownst to them where did things really stand right on schedule the first of the floating nymphs ar rived hotly pursued by a slavering mundane imbri had relayed all she had learned about the good magicians spells now bink picked up one of the unidenti fied ones stand well clear imbri he warned this spell will not hurt me but it might hurt you im going to experi ment while im not hardpressed i can still use my sword if a single mundane comes at me when too many come ill draw on the heavy stuff imbri stood back it seemed to her he was taking a con siderable riskbut she realized that he was immune to magical danger and knew it so could afford to gamble in a way no other person dared this was safer for him than trying to take on all the mundanes physically perhaps that was another reason good magician humfrey had publi cized binks secret talent bink was the only one who could safely play with unknown killerspells so had to be the one to succeed humfrey himself and had to use those spells when no friends were close enough to be hurt by them it was amazing how carefully humfrey had planned every detail his own failure included the nymph floated up looking devastatingly winsome by human standards imbri had seen the creatures as they were first inflating dead white and bulging the night air must have done them good for now there was color and bounce to match the buoyancy and intricate little jiggles in private places as they moved no wonder the mundane was in sweaty pursuiti night mare now the mundane spied king bink oh no you dont shes mine he cried drawing his sword i chased that divine dream half the night and day in all fairness i must tell you two things bink said first the nymph is not real she is a shape from a spell with no mind at all i dont care where shes from or how smart she is the mundane said licking his brute lips im going to give her the time of my liferight after i get rid of you he ad vanced sword poised second i am holding the spell of a magician bink continued backing off it may hurt you or even kill you if the mundane leaped his sword swinging viciously bink popped the cork on the vial pointing the opening at him a green fireball shot out expanding as it moved it was headsized as it struck the mundane in the chest the man screamed the fire burned into his chest with terrible ferocity consuming it in a moment the mundane fell his chest mostly missing bink stared looking faint humfrey wasnt playing idle games he whispered he was set to destroy the enemy army imbri agreed that had been one deadly weapon but it was a choice between the enemy or you she sent in a supportive dreamlet glad she had taken the advice to stand well clear he tried to kill you when you tried to be rea sonable with him yes i have steeled myself to that bink said still the stomach is weak i have seldom killed before and most mundanes are not like him they can be quite civilized though i admit this one wasnt already a second pseudonymph was coming leading an other brute mundane bink snatched up another vial halt mundane he cried i have slain your companion then ill slay you the mundane cried he carried a bow now he brought out an arrow and nocked it taking aim bink opened and pointed the vial as he had the first something sailed out of it as the arrow flew toward him the arrow struck the object and went astray missing binks night mare head by the span of a hand and plunking into the wall behind him imbri looked at the thing skewered on the shaft of the arrow it was a bean sandwich the mundane had just shot humfreys lunch the mundane stared for a moment then he emitted a great bellow of a laugh youre fulla beans bink took a third vial as the mundane drew another arrow and aimed bink pointed and opened it this time smoke issued from the container it shaped into a huge face the face laughed ho ho hoi it roared it was laughing gas but the mundanes sense of humor was limited to laugh ter at others not at himself he shot an arrow through the face at bink barely missing he drew a third imbri grew more nervous these spells were not doing the job reliably bink gave up on the spells for the moment he ducked through the smoke drawing his sword and charged at the mundane the mundane realizing that his bow was useless at close quarters hastily drew his own sword the two met in per sonal combatbut the mundane was much younger and faster imbri stepped forward knowing she could not stand by and let the king be killed but as the laughing gas dissi pated a third mundane appeared carrying a spear he closed on the other two people seeking an opening to dis patch the king imbri charged across spun about and flung out a kick with her two hind legs this caught the spearman in the chest and smashed him back imbri knew she had either killed the man or hurt him so badly he would not fight again for a long time she now had blood on her hooves she turned again to help bink but he had dispatched his opponent it seemed he knew how to handle a sword his skill had bested the mundane speed but already three more mundanes were entering the tree weapons drawn now the punic army was arriving in force pseudonymphs floated all about dancing just out of the grasp of the men jiggling remarkably causing the pun ics to become more aggressive than ever night mare i have to return to magic king bink said i cant take on the whole nextwave with my lone sword he glanced at the one imbri had dispatched and i cant ask you to risk your hide either but its no longer safe for you to stand away from me soon therell be many more mun danes so you had better stay close to me that way the magic is less likely to backlash against you and may pro tect you exactly as it protects me imbri did not see that the magic had helped the king much protection against being harmed by magic was not the same as being protected by magic but she agreed she would be better able to help him if she were close she could carry him out of the tree if the mundanes became overwhelming bink picked up a package and tore it open a score of large rubber bands fell out now at last he showed some ire what good are these imbri touched one with her hoof instantly it climbed up her foot and tightened about her ankle it hurt she had to lift her foot to her teeth to rip it off then it tried to clasp her nose oho bink exclaimed he stooped to pick one up it writhed in his hand but could not manage to close on his wrist he nipped it at the nearest mundane the band slid over the mans head and constricted about his neck suddenly he was choking turning purple in the face a weapon indeed bink said he flipped two more chokers at the other mundanes one looped about a mans arms binding him awkwardly the other caught its man around the waist squeezing his gut the bands might be small and harmless when bink handled them but were savage when they touched any other flesh more mundanes appeared bink tossed the rest of the chokers then picked up another vial a knife flew from it transfixing the punic but more was needed so bink opened a large widemouthed bottle the bottle did not eject anything instead it expanded rapidly until it was big enough to admit a man standing upright on its side were printed the mystic words cave night mare canem imbri wasnt sure what that signified but it seemed vaguely threatening so its a cave bink said maybe it will serve hey nymphsfly in here he pointed to the opaque glass cave obligingly the buoyant nymphs flew inside the mun danes who were able charged in after them six men disap peared into the cave there was a horrendous growling deep inside and a medley of screams imbri startled projected in an inquir ing dreamletand discovered that the minds of the mun danes had become truly animalistic like those of vicious dogs the cave of canines bink said remarkable device beware of the cave imbri agreed she didnt like ca nines they tended to nip at equine heels and were difficult to tag with swift kicks before long the glass cave overflowed mundanes spilled back out doggedly running on four feet yelping their faces looked more canine than human though imbri wasnt sure this was very much of a change the dogfaces scrambled out of the tree tails between their legs tails imbri looked againbut too late the creatures were gone still the mundane menace grew the rest of their army seemed to have arrived in more or less of a mass and indi vidual vials were not enough some men were distracted by the fleeing canines and some appeared to have been bitten by those but there were too many intact mundanes to stop time for the ultimate measures king bink said stand by to carry me to safety imbri this may be worse than we anticipated imbri stood by bink lifted the bag of winds and started to untie it a huge mundane charged at the king slashing down ward with his sword he missed bink who had alertly dodged but scored on the bound river the tie was severed cleanly instantly the coil sprang outward as the water was re leased the floor flooded the liquid getting deeper mo ment by moment there was a lot of fluid in a river the night mare mundanes cursed as their feet were washed out from under them the one trying to attack the king was dumped and carried away by the torrent then the string tying the mouth of the windbag came loose the winds roared out of confinement they swirled around the chamber of the baobab tree and whipped the surface of the rising water into froth it became hard to stand and not much fun to breathe imbri tried to find king bink but he had been swept by the swirl along with the mundanes apparently the river once released had become a nonmagical force so could act on him perhaps it was merely moving him without hurting him no twofooted creature could keep on his feet in this that was yet another inherent human liabilitylack of a sufficient number of feet on the ground imbri did not care to gamble that bink would not drown noas she reviewed what she had been told of his tal ent she decided he would not drown because that fate would have been set up by magicafter all the river had been magically boundand therefore his drowning forbid den but there were mundanes mixed in that soup with him and one of them certainly might hurt him since they had been trying to do that regardless of magic so her help was definitely needed she forged through the frothing water squinting her eyes against the whirling wind she did not know in what direction the wind wanted to go because here in the tree it was still looking for the exit she found the king he was holding on to the edge of the canem cave she nudged him and he shifted his grip to her he was carrying some thing that hampered him but imbri floated up under him and got him halfway clear of the violent torrent now she half swam half drifted with the current mov ing out of the tree mundanes were also being carried along burdened by their weapons and armor gasping and drowning in the river elba humfrey had prophesied cor rectly able were they ere they saw elba she wasnt sure she had the phrasing quite right but certainly the elements from coil and bag were devastating an army outside the tree the tide diminished imbri found her footing and forged toward higher ground a few mundanes night mare were doing likewise at last imbri stood on an elevated ridge overgrown with quaking aspen the timid trees were fluttering with apprehension as the water surged toward their roots are you all right she sent to king bink tired and waterlogged he replied but whole how ever the battle is not yet over for more mundanes were straggling up to the ridge we can outrun them imbri sent no they would only reorganize and march on castle roogna where the women are it has neither human nor zombie defenses any more the ogre is there but he can not be in all places at once i dont want our loved ones subject to the will of the punics treated like pseudo nymphs i must deal with the enemy here now i shall not return to castle roogna until the threat has been entirely abated imbri could appreciate his sentiment and admire his courage but bink was only one man against what ap peared to be about twenty surviving mundanes he was fifty years old which was getting along physically for a male of his species he was likely to get himself killed and his prospective successor amolde centaur was still far away yet bink was the king and his decision counted i see you have doubts he said smiling grimly you are a sensible mare but i am not yet entirely dependent on my own resources i salvaged the good magicians book of words of power i hope they are good ones she sent here come two mundanes king bink opened the book as the mundanes ap proached him spears poised he fixed on the first one oopsi dont know how to pronounce it he said try several ways imbri sent for behind the two spearmen other mundanes were coming just as ugly and determined one thing about these punic mercenaries they never gave up if the king didnt use magic to protect himself the nonmagical assault of the enemy would quickly finish him schnezl bink read aloud with a short e nothing happened the mundanes drew nigh schnezl he repeated this time using a long e night more night mare the two mundanes broke into uncontrollable sneezing their eyes watered their breath got short and they dou bled over in nasal convulsions trying vainly to blow their lungs out through their noses their buttons popped off their belts snapped and their eyes bugged in and out they dropped their spears and staggered into the murky water still firing out achoos the other mundanes paused in won der and admiration at the cannonade it seemed the king had pronounced the word correctly the second time even imbri felt an urge to sneeze but she hastily suppressed it and stood closer to bink that helped he did seem to have an ambience of immunity odd bink remarked the print has faded from the page that word is no longer written there it must be a oneshot spell imbri sent how many more do you have bink flipped through the pages of the book there must be hundreds here that should be enough she was relieved another waver was charging up sword swinging bink read the next word amnsha he cried accenting the second syllable the mundane did not sneeze he continued charging amnsha bink repeated this time accenting the first syllable still the mundane came seemingly unaffected amnsha bink cried with no accenting and hardly more than one syllable and ducked as the mans sword whistled at his head the blow missed the mundane stopped and turned he looked perplexed what am i doing here he asked who are you who am i the word made him lose his memory imbri sent in a pleased dreamlet too bad all the remaining mundanes werent within range of it good thing you were in contact with me so it didnt catch you king bink responded humfrey would have made better use of it and harmlessly abated the entire mundane threat my son dor reported a similar use of a forgetspell eight hundred years ago at the gap chasm that was another mystic reference to something dor ob viously could not have been involved in maybe it was a memory of a dream we had better deal with the mun dane imbri reminded him in a dreamlet king bink addressed the soldier you are an immigrant to the land of xanth you will find a good homestead and a willing nymph and will settle down to be a productive citizen congratulations yeah sure the man said dazed he lumbered off in search of his homestead but three more mundanes were coming and these did not look at all forgetful the last word had faded from the page bink turned the leaf and read the next one skonk there was a sudden terrible odor the stench spread out from the sound of the word forming a bilious cloud that drifted in the path of the enemy soldiers unheeding they charged into it they had learned to be concerned about tangible magic but to ignore mists and apparitions immediately they scattered coughing and holding their noses they had received the brunt of the stench though the peripheral wash was enough to make imbri gag that was bad because horses were unable to regurgitate a coin cidental drift of wind had carried the mist away from the king so he did not suffer coincidental the three mundanes plunged into the water trying to wash away the smell a murk of pollution spread out from them and small fish fled the region it seemed it would take a long time for the men to cleanse themselves yet another mundane was attacking as the fog dissi pated this one paused just beyond it fitting an arrow to his bow the king consulted the book krokk he yelled at the bowman the mundane changed form his jaw extended into a greenish snout bulging with teeth his limbs shrank into squat clawed extremities his torso sprouted scales unable to hold on to his bow or maintain his balance he fell for ward bellyflopping on the ground with a loud whomp he scrambled to the water and paddled away propelling him self with increasing efficiency by means of a massive green tail that sprouted from his hind part night mare night mare he turned into a gator bink remarked impressed i didnt know the good magician had any transformation spells he collected all kinds of information imbri sent many people owed him favors for his services and he knew exactly where to find useful bits of magic hes been accumulating things for over a century once i brought him a bad dream about a box of quarterpedes and he promptly woke and fetched it from the place the dream identified it i didnt even know what they were and had forgotten the matter until hat box turned up in his collec tion of spells in the baobab tree he never missed a trick i should have rescued that box bink said regretfully maybe when the water subsides another mundane charged he swung a battleaxe with hideous intent bink quickly glanced at the book again bansh he cried the mundane disappeared axe and all these were cer tainly useful spells when they worked but about a dozen punics remained on the ridge they now formed into an organized company and advanced slowly on the king this was a more serious threat bink leafed through the book looking for a suitable word if only there were definitions giveni he com plained a spear sailed at the king dodge imbri sent bink dodged but the spear caught the open book and knocked it out of his hand he regained his balance and dived for it but the volume fell in the water the crocka gator forged up and snapped the book into its big mouth with an evil chuckle carrying it away the king had been abruptly deprived of his magic defense by nonmagical means true the crock had been magically transformed but an untransformed mundane could have done the same thing but see he cried stooping to pick up a floating bottle it was yellow and warty and somewhat misshapen isnt this the one containing the enormous squash i believe it is imbri agreed it seemed binks talent was helping him compensate for the loss of the remaining words maybe he wasnt being harmed but just shifted to a more profitable mode as the words were highly variable in effect ill use this you check the water for any other bottles king bink popped the cork then hurled the bottle at the mundane formation the thing grew enormously as was its nature until it popped down on top of several mundanes and squashed them flat imbri found another bottle and fished it out with her teeth she got some water in her mouth and it still reeked ofskonk but that was a necessary penalty she brought the bottle to the king as the remaining mundanes skirted the squash and advanced he opened the bottle immediately and pointed it at the enemy a series of specks floated out from it these expanded becoming balls on each ball a face formed scowling aw fully one directed its glare at imbriand suddenly she was coated with grime oh i see the king said this is a bottle of dirty looks lets get them aimed properly he reached out and turned each ball so that it faced the mundanes the results were less than devastating but more than inconvenient the punics tamed dirty their clothing badly soiled their faces and arms gunked with grease and mud and sand but they had been pretty dirty to begin with so this was only an acceleration of a natural trend they hacked and spit trying to clear filth from their mouths one aimed an arrow at king bink but the slime on his bow was such that the weapon twisted in his hand fouling his shot another tried to draw a knife but it was stuck in its holster fastened by dirt and corrosion imbri found two more bottles one turned out to contain jumping beans they bounded all over peppering the mun danes annoyingly one man was blinded as the beans hap pened to score on his eyes while another got one up his nose that put him in immediate difficulty since his nose hobbled about in response to the beans continued jumping but six determined punics remained closing in on the king the odds were still moderately prohibitive bink opened the last bottle a host of spooks sailed out go get em the king ordered and the spooks went after the punics night mare there ensued a fierce little battle the spooks were su pernatural creatures with vaporously trailing nether sec tions but strong clawed hands and grotesque faces they pounced on the mundanes biting off noses gouging for livers and wringing necks this was a reasonably pointless exercise as spooks could not digest these tidbits but old instincts died hard and the mundanes did find the ap proach somewhat disquieting they fought back with swords and spears lopping off limbs and transfixing faces blood flowed ichor oozed and bodies soon littered the ground as the sun dippecfclow getting clear of the sky before night caught it the melee subsided all the spooks were gone one mundane remained standing it was hasbinbad the punic leader the toughest cus tomer of them all so you are me king of xanth hasbinbad said youre a better magician than i took you for i knew the transformer king was deadly dangerous and i discovered the thingtalking king was tough too i certainly wanted no further part of the zombie king who turned my own dead against me and the information king knew entirely too much but you had the reputation of possessing no magic so i figured youd be safe he shrugged with grim good nature we all do make mistakes i should have taken you out too to promote the centaur king who i know has no magic power in xanth you appear to know a great deal about xanth and the nature of our government king bink said and you know a great deal about mundania as you term the real world hasbinbad rejoined men of age and experience do master the essentials rapidly it is essential to survival in this business when we first entered xanth i thought it was italy but when a rocbird carried away one of my precious remaining elephants i realized that some thing unusual was afoot so i sent out my spies and in due course learned much of what i needed i realized very soon that we would have to have magic to fight magic so the deal we made with the horseman was fortuitous this is a better empire than rome and i intend to conquer it and become the eleventh king of this siege night mare you will have to deal with the fifth king first bink said i intend to all my committed army is gone but so is all your magic now you must meet me my way man to man mundane fashion after i dispatch you i shall return to my reserve force and conquer xanth without further sig nificant resistance he advanced sword ready imbri moved to intercept the mundane one swift kick would no king bink said this is my responsibility i have borrowed humfreys bag of tricks now it is time i do my own work you stand clear he drew his sword well spoken hasbinbad said unimpressed he held his own sword casually obviously not unduly alarmed by the caliber of the opposition he was after all well ar mored while king bink was not and the punic was sure of his own skill with the weapon he was a man of war while the man of xanth was a recently drafted king no warrior there remains one detail you may have overlooked bink said and now his expression was anything but amia ble one of those kings you had eliminated by the horse man was my son the sword glinted as he stalked the mundane ah your son the punic said taken aback then you have a blood motive he scowled yet it remains to be seen how much that counts against skill the two came together hasbinbad swung his blade bink countered expertly ah i see you have learned your craft after all the mundane said becoming impressed he made a feint but failed to draw the king out of position then bink attacked slicing at the punics left arm where the armor did not cover it hasbinbad countered but still got nicked first blood he exclaimed and parried with a vicious stroke of his own that did not score binks lack of armor now showed as an advantage for there was no extra weight on him to tire him and his skill was great enough to make armor unnecessary he pressed hasbinbad methodically forcing the man to take defensive measures then the mundane drew back it grows dark he night mare night mare panted i do not like to fight at night i call for tmce till dawn imbri was alarmed the mundane was trying to gain time to recover his strength bink shrugged he had been among mundanes so was familiar with their odd customs truce till dawn he agreed imbri swished her tail in frustration this was surely follyl hasbinbad sheathed his sword and looked about im hungry he said want to trade some mundane travel ra tions for some good grog you natives know how to find freegrowing juice without getting zapped by a tree dont you yes bink agreed i dont like this imbri sent in a dreamlet that man is not to be trusted the tide is receding you can get away from him for the night and risk losing track of him king bink asked in the dream he still has half an army up north and we have no means to stop it if it is competently led i must deal with the leader now and not let him get away you are honest he is not you must not trust him imbri urged i know his nature bink returned gently are you conversing with the dream mare hasbinbad inquired td like to have a steed like that myself when we captured her up north i did not know her nature ill not make that error again this man knows entirely too much imbri sent ur gently your majesty he is dangerous i will keep an eye on him bink promised you can travel readily at night go inform the ladies at castle roogna of the developments of this day this war is not over we must raise new forces to deal with the second mundane army he was the king she had to obey with severe misgiv ings imbri phased into nonmateriality and trotted across the ebbing water toward castle roogna as she left she heard hasbinbad inquire just who is to be king after the centaur i thought you were out of magicians i inquire purely as a matter of professional curiosity i am not in a position to know bink replied if i live there will be no other kings if i die i will not find out how is it you know as much as we do about these mat ters hasbinbad laughed if he answered the words were lost in the distance as imbri moved away but both questions bothered her how did the punic know and after arnolde who would be king it seemed that both xanth and mun dane forces accepted the prophecy that there would be ten kings before the siege ended but as was often the case the specific unfolding of that prophecy was shrouded in alarming mystery chapter centaur input imbri reached castle roogna quickly for the baobab tree was not far from it she could readily have brought the king back here had he been willing to come but he was determined to finish the action his way and maybe he was right hasbinbad would be much more dan gerous at the head of his second army than he was alone the women were alert and worried tandy the ogres wife had moved into the castle as it seemed she did not like being left alone while smash guarded it now that im bri had seen first handtechnically it was first hoof but the human folk would not understand thatthe determina tion and savagery of the mundanes she was sure that one ogre was not enough to stop a siege of the castle quickly imbri projected a broad dream that summarized the events of the day so that they all understood it irene shook her head with sad resignation like her night mare night mare mother she had recovered equilibrium after initial grief this did not mean that she missed her husband and father less but that she realized she had to do what she could to prevent the kingdom of xanth from being entirely de stroyed her grief would keep now was the time to fight bink will not come back she said he is too good a man thats his fatal fault i love him as i love my father but i know him he has never yielded to reasonable odds he always follows his course no matter what it costs there is something of that quality in dor too and a great deal of it in smash tandy added she was a girlishly small young woman darkhaired and cute hardly the type imbri would have thought would be at tracted to an ogre but imbri had interacted with her pass ingly before and knew that she needed a really strong hus band to protect her from the attentions of a demon certainly smash was strong do you think we should prepare for the next king queen iris asked gently imbri did not answer i think so queen irene agreed then we must impose on imbri yet again to contact the centaurs iris said she turned back to the mare bink should have come back to organize things since he did not we women are forced to do what we can if a centaur is to be our next king the folk of centaur isle must be advised they have resisted active participation in this campaign foolishly i think maybe theyll support one of their own in a way they declined to do for a human king she sounded bitter not necessarily irene said they frown on magic tal ents in sapient species they exiled arnolde when his talent became known they might treat him worse than a man they exiled a centaur with magic a centaur king of xanth could be another matter if we make the situation quite clear they should come around we know they are organized and ready all they have to do is march make it clear imbri sent in a query that if they do not support us now with all our faults as they perceive them they will have to deal with our suc cessors the punics they have run afoul of mundanes be fore historically i doubt they will relish the prospect ill go imbri sent ill tell them tonight she set off galloping south she worried about king bink but knew he did not want her to return till morning his peculiar sense of honor required him to win or lose his battle alone so the best thing she could do was this to help prepare xanth for the next king this was the stuff of which bad dreams were made her duties had not changed as much as she had supposed the southern wilds of xanth raced by replete with gardenvariety monsters and monstrous gardens she had seldom been here because it was thinly populated and thus few people needed dreams delivered now she was passing near the castle of the zombie master on an impulse she swerved millie the ghost and her two children would be there alone perhaps not even know ing the zombie master was ensorcelled she had to stop by and say something though there was little she could do she reached the castle hurdled the gooky moat pene trated the decrepit wall and trotted into the clean main hall where millie was reading from a book titled weird mundane tales to the children by the eerie glow of a magic lantern all looked up as she entered imbril millie exclaimed gladly i just wanted to be sure you knew imbri projected but could not continue we know millie said no one told us but we knew when chameleon left that it would soon be our turn the chain has not yet been broken you are taking it very well imbri sent i was a ghost and jonathan a zombie for eight hundred years millie said we have had a lot of experience with death and have learned to be patient jonathan has not re turned as a zombie so i know he isnt really dead when the chain is broken he will return she had excellent per spective bink is king now and after him will come arnolde centaur then there may be four more kings before the chain is finally brokenbut we dont know who they may be for xanth is out of magicians night mare night mare who enchanted the kings millie asked do you know yet the horseman king humfrey named him before he the punic hasbinbad pretty much confirmed it is the horseman a magician that made imbri pause horrified if hes a magician he might claim the throne of xanth that was my thought millie said he helps the mun danes conquer xanth then assumes the throne as the last magician ending the chain by xanth law we would have to accept him this is terrible imbri projected he may be encour aging us to fight the mundanes then if he becomes king hell start ensorcelling the mundane leaders so they cant fight any more he is playing both sides against each other so that he can take over in the end beware the horse manthe chain leads to him unless we somehow break it before then millie said she hugged her two children close to her preventing them from becoming too frightened i am going to centaur isle to ask them to support ar nolde when he is king imbri sent maybe this will help convince them lets hope so millie said dont let me detain you imbri this is too important but i do thank you for stop ping by imbri turned to goand discovered an eye in the floor looking up at her and a print where her hind feet had been reading this is a horses rear the children were up to their usual tricks she stepped over the eye and print and walked on through the wall she raced on south glad she had made the side trip as it happened she had gained a valuable if horrible new in sight in the process she had known before that the horse man was playing bis own game but had not thought of the consequence of his being recognized as xanths only sur viving magician he could accomplish his fell purposeif they didnt break that chain first reality was becoming even more like a bad dream it was a long way to the southern tip of xanth she had forgotten how much time it would take it was midnight by the time she arrived then she remembered she should have used the gourds her distraction had been such that she had never thought of the obviousl that reminded her of good king humfreys shame what obvious thing had he overlooked that should so mor tify him before the fact the horseman had sneaked up on him truebut that had happened to every king of xanth so far the centaurs of the isle were mostly asleep imbri had to locate their leader quickly she projected a dream to the mind of the first sleeper she encountered a middleaged female who is your leader why everyone knows that the centauress said ge rcime elder of the isle thank you since when does a dream thank a person anything can happen in a dream now imbri used her night mare personlocating sense and homed in on gerome this centaur was old his hair and coat beginning to turn gray she shaped her dream carefully and sent it in to him in this dream she was a female centaur of middle age and dark of hide elder gerome i bring important news she began ah you would be the night mare from castle roogna he said unsurprised we have been expecting you obviously the centaur community had its own sources of information centaurs did employ magic they just didnt like to recognize it in themselves those centaurs who de veloped magic talents were exiled thus all the ones around castle roogna were not welcome here at the isle yet this was the principal bastion of the species and this was where the real help had to come from do you know then that xanth is under attack by the nextwave of mundanes of course and that one of the human folk called the horseman has been taking the minds of our kingstrent dor the zombie master humfrey and maybe bink imbri didnt really believe that last but preferred to think of it that way rather than of death at the foul hands of hasbinbad night mare bink he is a human magician whose talent has been con cealed until recently that is in order then but after him the king of xanth will have to be ar nolde centaur now that is problematical gerome said we do not accept if we do not stop the nextwave it will conquer us as have waves of the past you centaurs know what it is like when a new wave rules xanth gerome sighed we do indeed better the obscenity we know than the one we may experience very well we shall treat amolde as we might a human king and answer his call if it comes the mundanes could overwhelm castle roogna before your force arrives imbri pointed out it would be better to march to castle roogna now to be there at need gerome shook his head we dislike this but acknowl edge the merit of the notion we shall dispatch a contin gent by raft in the morning it will take two days for us to make port near castle roogna and half a day to march inland will your forces be able to fend off the wave until then probably imbri replied in the dream half the mun dane army has been destroyed the other half should take two or three days to reach castle roogna very well you have our guarantee but there is a price a price we have de facto local autonomy we want it to be come openly recognized by the government of xanth henceforth and for all time if amolde becomes king im sure he will grant you that see that he does gerome said sternly that was that centaurs were creatures of honor so she knew they would act as promised imbri withdrew from the centaur elders dream and let him sleep in peace but she set a hoofprint in the dirt of his doorway so that he would remember her when he woke night mare she trotted out looking for a gourd patch but there turned out to be none on the isle it seemed the centaurs had methodically stamped them out because of their devas tating hypnotic magic that was understandable but incon venient she would have known about this had this been her beat for dream duty now she had either to spend time looking for a gourd on the wild mainland or to race for home directly she decided on the latter course it took more time but was less frustrating she raced straight north through trees and mountains over lakes and bogs under lowhanging clouds and the nose of a sleeping dragon and up to cas tle roogna just as dawn sleepily cracked open an eye it was good to race flatout for this distance it made her feel young again inside the castle she gave her report they are sending a detachment but they want autonomy we cant make that decision queen irene said she was on duty while her mother slept awaiting chameleons return only the king can do that its time for me to rejoin king bink anyway imbri sent if he still lives she thought nervously yes he is my husbands father irene said bring him back here however you find him she had aged rap idly in the past few days and looked more like her mother her eyes were deeply shadowed and there were lines form ing about her face she had the reputation of being a beau tiful and welldeveloped girl both qualities were waning now continued crisis was not being kind to her imbri was tired but she couldnt take time to rest she trotted on out toward the baobab tree king bink was not there of course he had left when the river flooded it out now there were only scattered mun dane bodies forest debris drying layers of mud and occa sional bottles imbri checked one of these but found it was open the cork lost whatever had resided in it wasted the penalty of the flood the water was gone but it would be long before the region recovered she made her way to the ridge that had been an island yesterday evening she found the remnants of a camfire night mare with two empty tcups from a ttree and pots from a pot pie bink and hasbinbad had eaten together then what imbri checked for footprints she sniffed the ground she listened she had acute equine senses she picked up a trail of sorts king bink had located a pillow bush and slept there but hasbinbads traces came there too they were fresher he had come later the footprints were not straightforward not those of one who came openly they were depressed too much on the toes scuffling too little sand a sneak ap proach a sneak attack at night before dawn both men gone imbri did not like this had the punic leader treacher ously but there was no blood no sign of violence hasbinbad had sneaked upbut bink had not been caught he had moved away from his bed before that time perhaps leaving a mockup of himself behind hasbinbad it seemed had attempted treachery but bink had anticipated him the king had indeed been alert and understood the nature of his opponent imbri working it out was relieved but what had happened then she quested and found two trails in the night bink fol lowing hasbinbad the wronged pursuing the guilty the truce had been violated relieving the king of any further need to be trusting and now the fight had resumed in ear nest bink had shown himself to be stronger in direct com bat yet had held back for what he deemed to be ethical reasons without being naive hasbinbad had blundered tactically as well as ethically and sacrificed any respite he might otherwise have claimed imbri followed the trail with difficulty knowing that she was losing headway bink and hasbinbad had evidently moved rapidly in the predawn hour imbri was moving slowly lest she lose the subtle traces this was not ideal tracking terrain there were rocky patches and boggy patches and the crisscrossing tracks of foraging animals obscuring the human prints her eye caught something in a hollow to the side imbri detoured briefly to investigate it was a corked vial con night mare taining yellowish vapor or fluid another of magician humfreys spells borne here by the transient tide unbro ken what should she do with it she did not want to leave it but would have to carry it in her mouth that would be awkward especially if she happened to chew on it and break the glass suppose it was an ifrit still there were many dangers in xanth and she might need the help of a spell so she picked it up and carried it carefully with her lips the trail seemed interminable hours passed as the two mens traces bore north imbri was sure now hasbinbad wanted to get away having found king bink too much for him the punic was trying to rejoin his other army the one nominally commanded by the horseman so he could lead another and more devastating thrust at castle roogna the first army had eliminated the opposition the second would complete the conquest there was a hiss a flying snake was orienting on imbri feeling that its territory had been invaded this was one of the wingless kind that levitated by pure magic wriggling through the invisible columns of the air it was a large one twice imbris own length and poisonous saliva glistened on its fangs probably hasbinbads passage had roused it but binks presence had balked it if magic could not harm the king how could a magical creature bink could go any where in xanth with perfect safety as long as he remained careful about nonmagical hazards perhaps ironically has binbad had been protected by binks ambience as imbri herself had been protected when she stood close to him now it was her misfortune to encounter the serpent fully roused and by day when she was vulnerable yet she could not detour around its territory she would never be able to locate the fading trail again in time to do any good she hesitated but the snake did not it hissed and launched itself at her jaws gaping involuntarily imbri bared her teeth bracing for battleand cracked the vial she had forgotten she held immediately she spit it out but a trickle of fluid fell on her tongue it was not yel lowthat turned out to be the color of the glassbut col orless and also tasteless plain water night mare the snake struck burying its fangs in her neck disas ter imbri felt the poison numbing her spreading outward much faster than had been the case when she had been bitten on the knee before this was a larger more deadly snake how she hated snakes imbri flung her head and lifted a forehoof lashing at the snakes body knocking it to the ground the reptile hissed and struck at her again but she stomped its head into the ground killing it the thing had been foolish to attack a fighting mare horses knew how to deal with ser pents but imbri herself had been critically slow owing to fatigue and the distraction of the breaking bottle otherwise the fangs would not have scored now she assessed her situation she had been bitten but she was massive enough so that the poison might dilute to a nonfatal level by the time it spread through her body if it happened to be a poor bite and if this happened to be a mildly toxic variety of snake instead of a supertoxic one she would survive but she would certainly suffer and would probably lose the trail yet she didnt feel too bad the numbness was constrict ing retreating back around the puncture was her body fighting it off how was that possible she had no special immunity in fact her condition should have been aggra vated by the weapon released from the vial too bad it hadnt destroyed the snakel weapon imbri licked her lips detecting a faint after taste that was no weapon that was healing elixir no wonder she was not suffering she had blundered into the universal restorative the one thing that could counter the snakes bite and restore her waning energy she had had the luck of king bink luck in binks case it wasnt luck it was his magic talent she knew now that it had operated in some ex tremely devious ways to protect both his health and his an onymity all the prior years of his life it could not be lim ited to his direct personal experiences it had to extend back to affect whatever magic threatened him indirectly suppose he was in trouble and magic was responsible how would his talent counter the danger by seeming coinci dence night mare it could arrange to have the vial of elixir float conve niently near for him to discover when the snake attacked but the snake had not attacked him it couldnt because his magic prevented it more directly so why the elixir unused this could be operating on a more subtle level bink was threatened by a mundane personyet in the ambience of magic that was xanth hasbinbad almost had to have had the benefit of some magic because no one could avoid it here so in a devious fashion the threat against bink was also magical and therefore his talent would act to protect him against it but extremely subtly for this was a border line case his talent just might arrange to have magical help come to him to protect him from the mundane maybe he would need healing elixir to abate a wound inflicted by hasbin bad so here it was imbri herself had become a tool of the kings magic and was being deviously protected by that magic so she could fulfill her mission she checked the ground by an amazing chance the bot tom section of the vial bad dropped upright and nestled in the grass containing some fluid chance imbri found the loose cork picked it up delicately with her teeth and set it in the ragged new neck of the vial she tamped it carefully with her nose it just fit sealing in the precious fluid there was no room remaining inside the truncated container for more than a few drops but that didnt matter the amount would be sufficient for its pur pose whatever and whenever that was she had what king bink would need she moved on carrying the vial again feeling more con fident she made better progress and the trail began to warm still she had a fair amount of time to make up it was midaftemoon by the time she followed the trail to the gap chasm here there was a change there were signs of a scuffle and some blood soaked the ground but there were no people she sniffed explored and formulated a scenario has binbad had naturally enough forgotten the gap chasm most people did he had been suddenly balked and king night mare bink had caught up there had been a desperate fight with one of them woundedand one of them had fallen into the chasm anxiously she sniffed in widening halfspirals since the chasm was too deep at this point to show any sign of the victim within it assuming the gap dragon had not already cleaned up the mess which man had survived it should be the king according to her revised theory of his magic but she was not sure her theory was correct she found a trail leading away joy it had the smell of bink there was blood on it and the prints dragged but the king had won the final contest he was the lone survi vor of this encounter with the wave she followed it on to the west bink must be going to intersect the path to the invisible bridge across the chasm so he could follow it safely back the other way to castle roogna the path was charmed against monsters bink might not need that protection but still a path was easier to follow than the untracked wilderness especially when a person was tired and hurt imbri speeded up no longer sniffing out the specific traces now she knew where he was going she would catch up administer the healing elixir and give him a swift ride home maybe there had been yet another level to his power it had preserved her from the flying snake so she could come and help him now apart from the elixir by becoming his steed all would be well king bink had sur vived his campaign and should have centaur support for the next one the centaurs were excellent archers if they lined up on the south edge of the gap the mundanes would never get across as she neared the invisible bridge in the last hour of the day she spied a figure it was the king resting on the ground she neighed a greeting but as she came to him her joy turned to horror bint was sitting unmoving staring at the ground in a puddle of blood from a wound in his chest was he dead quickly she crunched through the piece of vial and smeared the dripping elixir across his wound with her nose instantly the gash healed and turned healthy and the kings color improved but still he did not respond to her night mar presence and when she sent him a dreamlet she found his mind blank but it cant happen to you she wailed protestingly in the dream assuming the image of a weeping willow tree in deep distress you are the one person who can not be harmed by magic yet the fact belied the logic king bink had defeated one enemy physically only to fall prey to the other magi cally he had after all been taken by the horseman it was night by the time she got him to castle roogna draped across her back a man might mount an uncon scious horse but it was another matter for a horse to cause an unconscious man to mount amolde and chameleon had arrived fortuitously within the hour the centaur had given her a ride after the day horse had tired from the nights hard travel day horses were not night mares they had to proceed carefully through darkness instead of phasing through the vagaries of the terrain the stallion had stopped at the brink of the gap chasm too nervous to trust the oneway bridge the oneway bridge imbri sent perplexed it is one way north how could you use it south we had to amolde explained we knew the main bridge was out the answer was simple queen iris had seen them com ing using an illusory magic mirror and had sent old crombie the soldier and his visiting daughter tandy out to meet them tandys husband the ogre had offered to go and hurl the folk across the chasm but they declined his helpful notion by pointing out that he was needed to guard castle roogna from surprise attack tandy had crossed first making the bridge real before her stopping just shy of the north anchor crombie bad stopped just off the south end keeping the bridge real between himself and his daughter arnolde and chameleon had crossed safely while it was thus anchored had grundy remained with them they could have used the magic carpet to ferry across one by one but the golem had long since flown back to the good magicians castle to keep watch until the gorgon re turned with her sister the siren actually arnolde con night mare fessed he would hardly have trusted his mass to a carpet designed for human weight once the travelers had crossed crombie and tandy had jumped to land at either end let ting the bridge fade tandy would walk around to the in visible bridge and return to castle roogna later in the night the day horse professing to be too tired to go far ther had settled in place to graze and sleep they had not argued with him mundane creatures did tend to be ner vous about things they could not see and he had not wanted to admit his fear of the bridge but xanth isnt safe at night imbri protested she was displeased at the day horses recalcitrance he was a big strong animal who should have been able to carry tandy to the other bridge before retiring he would have done so for chameleon or if imbri herself had been along but of course mundane animals were neither the magical nor the social equals of xanth animals this was a reminder of that fact it was useless to be angry at a mundane creature for not being xanthian she is the wife of an ogre and the path is enchanted even a tangle tree would hesitate to bother her queen iris said a trine grimly imbri remembered how smash the ogre had torn up the mundanes in combat no one with any sense would antago nize an ogre the mundanes who had penetrated to this region had all been dispatched so it was true tandy should be safe enough but that was the only light note king bink had been taken and xanth had a new king chameleon now had both a son and a husband to mourn the grief that the horseman had brought to xanth in the name of his ambi tion for poweri this development was not unfortunately unantici pated amolde centaur said in his didactic way as queen iris broached the matter of the crown as an archivist i am conversant with the protocols xanth must have a ma gician king it is not specified that the king must be a man he can be a centaur queen iris agreed the rramers of xanth law did not anticipate a centaur magician perhaps not king amolde agreed they may also night mare have overlooked the mischief wrought by the horseman that was not precisely my meaning however where is the council of elders of human xanth roland is here queen iris said binks father dors grandfather he is old and failing but retains his mind he was rousted from us home at the north village when the mundanes pillaged it he can speak for the elders im sure i must talk to him immediately they brought roland for the king had spoken roland was king trents age still sturdy and erect but he moved slowly and his sight was fading in the years of relative calm during king trents rule the council of elders had had little to do and had become pretty much ceremonial roland retained his magic however he could freeze a per son in place roland i have in mind a certain interpretation or series of interpretations of xanth law amolde said i would like your endorsement of these interpretations of lawl queen iris protested why waste your time on such nonsense when there is a crisis that may topple xanth amolde merely gazed at her flicking his tail tolerantly your majesty she amended embarrassed i apol ogize for my intemperate outburst you shall have an answer in due course the centaur king said gently roland the old mans eyes brightened this sounded like a chal lenge what is your interpretation king amolde imbri noted how careful these people were being with titles in this way affirming the strength and continuity of the kingship so vital to the preservation of xanth xanth must have a king who is a magician the cen taur said the definition of the term magician is ob scure i interpret it to mean a person whose magic talent is more potent by an order of magnitude than that of most people this is of course a relative matter in the absence of the strongest talents the most potent of the remaining talents must assume the mantle agreed roland said night more thus in the present circumstance your own talent be comes oh no you dont roland protested vigorously i see the need to promote new talents to magician status for the sake of the continuing succession of kings and i endorse that solution but i am too old to assume the rigors of the crownl how very clever imbri thought of course xanth would find its remaining kings by this simple device what a fine perception amolde had and how well he was applying it to the solution of the crisis it was certainly important that a person be designated to follow amolde as king since humfreys prophecy indicated four kings would follow the centaur if amolde lost his position before attending to that matter there would be chaos well then the talents of younger people irene for ex ample should now be ranked a sorceress since her magic is certainly beyond the average and our top talents are gone true roland said i have privately felt she should have been diagnosed a sorceress before certainly her rela tive talent qualifies her now but this will not profit the kingdom since she is a woman queen irene was upstairs with chameleon and their un fortunate husbands otherwise imbri knew she would have been quite interested in the turn this dialogue had taken queen iris however was reacting with amazed pleasure in what way is the power of a sorceress inferior to that of a magician amolde inquired rhetorically no way queen iris put in this had been a peeve of hers for decades no way roland echoed with a smile then we agree that the distinction is merely cosmetic amolde said a sorceress is in fact a female magician true roland acknowledged a magician the termi nology is inconsequential a lingering prejudice carrying across from prior times prejudice amolde said now there is a problematical concept my kind is prejudiced against certain forms of magic i have experienced that onus myself your kind is prejudiced against women night mare by no means roland objected we value and respect and protect our women yet you systematically discriminate against them we do not certainly you do iris put in vehemently under her breath i stand corrected the centaur said with an obscure smile there is no legal distinction between the human sexes in xanth well roland said he seemed to have caught on to something that imbri and the queen had not then you see no reason amolde continued why a woman could not were she in other necessary respects qualified assume the throne of xanth queen iris stopped breathing imbri now discovering the thrust of the centaur kings progression suffered a dreamlet of a cherry bomb exploding in realization what an audacious attack on the problem roland squinted at the centaur obliquely he half chuck led you are surely aware that the throne of xanth is by ancient custom reserved for kings i am aware yet does that custom anywhere define the term king as necessarily male i have no specific recollection of such a definition roland replied i presume custom utilizes the masculine definition or designation for convenience carrying no fur ther onus i suppose technically an otherwise qualified female could become king i am so glad your perception concurs with mine ar nolde said both men understood that they had just played out a charade of convenience knowing the crisis of xanth then with the presumed approval of the elders i hereby in my capacity and authority as king of xanth designate the line of succession to this office to include henceforth male and female magicians the centaur swung to focus through his spectacles on queen iris specifically the ma gician iris to follow me and her daughter the magician irene to follow her should new kings of xanth be required before this present crisis is resolved again roland smiled i concur i believe i speak for the council of elders night mare queen iris breathed again her face was flushed a small array of fireworks exploded soundlessly in the air around them her illusion giving vent to her suppressed emotion she together with all her sex had just been at one stroke enfranchised one could get to like you cen taur king amolde shrugged your husband has always been kind to me he provided me with a gratifying position when my own species cast me out you yourself have always treated me with courtesy but it is logic that dictates my decision rather than gratitude an imbalance has been corrected yes your majesty she breathed her eyes shining in that moment queen iris resembled a beautiful young woman like her daughter and imbri was not certain this was entirely illusion arnolde turned to imbri now i must have a confer ence with you good mare i realize you are tired so are you your majesty imbri sent then let us handle this expeditiously so we both can rest before my brethren arrive of course imbri agreed wondering what he had in mind the play of his intellect had already dazzled her and she knew he would be an excellent king even though he could perform no magic in xanth they retired to a separate chamber for a private conver sation imbri wondered why amolde should wish to ex clude the others such as queen iris who surely needed to be kept advised of official business does it strike you as odd that king bink who was im mune to harm by magic should nevertheless fall prey to the spell of the horseman yes imbri agreed he should have been invulnera ble he believed he was his talent was working with mar velous subtlety and precision he wanted the horseman to approach him believing that yet he evidently was not immune amolde said why should this be he was very tired after fighting hasbinbad and getting wounded and dragging himself almost to the bridge path maybe his talent had been weakened night mare i question that his talent was one of the strongest known in xanth though it wasnt known yet it failed to protect him from magical harm there is my point could it be that bink was not ac tually harmed imbri glanced toward the room where the kings were lyng i dont understand he was ensorcelled you assume the enchantment was harmful suppose it was not in that event bink would not be proof against it but imbri could not continue the thought let me approach the matter from another perspective amolde said it strikes me that the symptoms of these ensorcelled kings are very like the trance inspired by the hypnogourd yes imbri agreed surprised but there is no gourd now suppose the horseman has the talent to form a lineofsight connection magically between any two places the centaur said such as the eye of a king and the peep hole of a gourd would that account for the observed ef fect imbri was astonished yes i think it would then i suspect we know where to look for the missing kings amolde concluded would you be willing to do that of course imbri sent chagrined that she had not seen this obvious connection before rest then when you are ready you may return to the gourd and investigate only you can do this i must do it now imbri sent if the kings are there we still would not know how to get them out the cen taur king finished we must be wary of exaggerating the importance of this notion which perhaps is fallacious this is why i have not mentioned it to the grieving relatives i do not wish to deceive them with false expectations imbri understood i shall say nothing to them until we know still i must find out i can rest after i know and after i report to you she started out using the door so as not to appear too excited to the others that is very nice of you arnolde said imbri almost bumped into the mundane archivist icha bod who was on his way in he had evidently been sum night mare moned to the kings presence for another conference im bri understood why ichabod was amoldes closest friend in xanth possessing similar qualities of intellect and per sonality together with his comprehensive knowledge of mundanes he would be an excellent person to discuss prospects with since he could be far more objective about xanth matters than the regular citizens of xanth could she sent him a dreamlet of friendly greeting and ichabod patted her on the flank in passing imbri found the nearest gourd patch and dived into the world of night because she was alone there were no spe cial effects she trotted directly to the pasture of the night stallion he was waiting for her its high time you checked in you idiotic mare he snorted in an irate dream the breeze of his breath causing the lush grass to curl and shrivel you were supposed to serve as liaison king arnolde sent me she replied intimidated a lot has happened recently and he out with it mare ask have the lost kings of xanth right this way the stallion walked through a wall that abruptly appeared in the pasture and she followed they came into a palatial humanstyle chamber there were all the kings king trent was playing poker with good magician humfrey and the zombie master king dor was chatting with the furniture and king bink a re cent arrival was asleep on a couch theyre all right imbri projected gratified right here in the gourd why didnt you send another night mare out to advise us it is not permitted the stallion replied to tell the future is apt to negate it likewise to divulge what can not be known through natural channels you were the desig nated channel it had to flow through you there was no other way to handle this situation without supernatural in terference so i had to stand aside and let it proceed undis turbed all i could safely do was try to warn xanth about the horseman imbri snorted that didnt make much difference night mare precisely the future was not spoiled because people seldom believe the truth about it it shall not be spoiled though critical revelations remain to be unveiled now that a king of xanth has figured out the riddle of the kings that information is no longer privileged perhaps he will figure out the rest in time to save xanth i leave you to it he paused giving imbri a meaningful stare still beware the horseman i am wary of him imbri protested but the night stallion walked back through the wall and was gone leav ing her with the uncomfortable feeling that she was missing something vital as she had done before yet what more could she do except watch out for the horseman and not trust him at all the three kings quickly concluded their poker game the magician of information naturally seemed to be well ahead and had a pile of oysters bucksaws and wilting lettuce to show for itand turned to imbri how goes it xanthside king trent inquired politely as if this were a routine social call your majesty imbri sent still halfway overwhelmed by this discovery of the lost kings do you want the whole story no only since bink was taken we know it to that point imbri sent out a dream that showed her search for king bink their return to castle roogna the ascension of ar nolde centaur and his solution of the riddle of kings and designation of queen iris and queen irene as the next kings marvelous the zombie master exclaimed that is one sensible centaur that accounts for two kings to follow him humfrey said but there is supposed to be a line of ten who are the other two king dor joined them the dark horse knows he said but he wont tell he is right not to tell the zombie master said we must figure it out for ourselves only then can we break the chain and finally save xanth night mare night mare is there no way to get you back to xanth imbri asked not while the horseman is free humfrey answered i believe the only way to stop him from enchanting people is to end his lifebut even he may not be able to reverse a line of sight he has made it seems to be a limited talent oneway like the oneway bridge across the chasm he is not magician caliber yet what mischief he causes the zombie master ex claimed as long as a single gourd exists his power re mains perhaps we are lucky he did not strike years ago he probably did not know about the gourds humfrey said many people dont the gourds imbri sent appalled told him about the gourds or at least about the world of night he thought the gourd was merely an oddity but after he knew its naturei showed him how to imprison the kings this is the nature of prophecy king trent said philo sophically you carried the message but did not under stand the nature of the threat none of us did you are no more culpable than the rest of us you have certainly done good work since and your night stallion seems to feel that you hold the key to the final salvation of xanth me imbri sent astonished but we do not know in what way good magician humfrey said this is an aspect of information that has been denied to me along with the specific nature of my own colossal folly perhaps it is simply in your position as liaison i dare say the wives will be pleased to know we remember them dor laughed mine may say good riddance i certainly didnt pay her much attention after we married she wont sulk long king trent said my daughter is a creature of femalishly mercurial temperament like my wife then he did a double take my wife i referred to queen iris humfrey elevated an eyebrow after a quarter century its about time trent you cant live in the past forever imbri remembered how king trent had loved his mun dane wife not the queen and the sorrow this had brought to iris it may be a bit late for such a revelation but yes it is true it is time to relate to the present without renouncing the past iris has been worthy king trent returned his attention to imbri please convey that message mare im bri imbri was happy to agree then she turned to humfrey how did the horseman get you and bink she asked the good magician you recognized him so should have known how to stop him and bink is supposed to be im mune from hostile magic that was perhaps part of my blunder humfrey said i paid so much attention to setting up my spells that i did not see him enter the tree suddenly he was standing there i only had time to whisper his identity before he zapped me had i been alert as i should have been i could have had a word of power ready he shook his head ashamed when did he come imbri asked as i said i was not paying attention but i would guess very soon after you and the day horse left he must have been lurking in hiding waiting his chance to catch me alone the cunning knave and binkhow did he bink was not harmed by the magic humfrey replied confirming the centaurs diagnosis he was only sent to a new awareness as were the rest of us we find our present company quite compatible therefore his talent was not op erative except to the extent of preserving her to rescue binks body imbri realized the protective talent had a narrow definition of binks welfare he was in actual physical dan ger while he was king and in none thereafter so it did make sense though xanth itself suffered at least his ban ishment to the gourd had enabled his successor amolde to solve the riddle how can i help imbri asked just what you plan the zombie master told her liai son bear news to the wives perhaps we shall have useful advice on the conduct of the war tell whatever king is current to request our input if he desires it or she imbri sent queen iris will be the next king night mare night more the kings exchanged glances we are no longer in di rect touch with the situation humfrey said perhaps it is best to leave the matter of governance to the centaur he seems remarkably competent send my love to my mother and my wife dor said sadly he formed a wan smile ill convey the message to my father myself he added glancing at the sleeping bink imbri bade farewell to the five kings and set off again for the real world she arrived at castle roogna near midnight some of the people were awake some asleep it made no practical dif ference she broadcast her glad dream to all the kings are all in the gourd they are welll they send their lovel those who were awake crowded close those who were asleep woke abruptly in a moment imbri was the center of attention she dispensed all the messages including king trents to the queen iris seemed stricken he said that she asked unbe lieving that it is time to live in the present and you are his wife imbri repeated oh mother irene cried going to queen iris and em bracing her you have become part of the family it seemed a strange comment but imbri understood its mean ing the tragedy of xanth was bringing its incidental bene fits imbri retreated to the castle gardens where she re laxed grazed and slept catching up on about two days activity tandy returned safely in the night and was reunited with her ogre husband who had been pacing the grounds worriedly idly tearing weedtrees out of the ground and squeezing them into balls of pressed wood it was a nervous mannerism of his but all seemed reasonably well for the moment in due course the centaur contingent landed having made excellent time and imbri went to lead them in to castle roogna she had thought chem or chet would pre fer to do it since they were centaurs but this was not the case chet and chem were magictalented centaurs and the conventional centaurs would not associate voluntarily with their ilk chet had actually visited centaur isle once but though he had been treated with courtesy he had soon gotten the underlying message and had never visited again in certain respects the separation between magic and non magic centaurs was greater than that between xanth hu man beings and mundanes thus imbri no centaur at all was a better choice she could keep the pace she knew the way and they didnt care if she had magic in fact they held her kind in a certain muted awe since a mare had been the dam of their species they revered true horses while not being unrealistic about their properties she met them at the beach the centaurs used magic propelled rafts that were seaworthy and quite stout they certainly werent shy about the use of magic in its proper place there were exactly fifty of them all fine healthy warriors with shining weapons and armor imbri wondered whether fifty were enough to handle three hundred mun danes however we are centaurs their leader said proudly as if that made the question irrelevant he did not deign to introduce himself the arrogance of these warriors was unconscious and she did not allow it to disturb her she led the contin gent to castle roogna by nightfall thanks to the very kind and competent assistance of ichabod and queen iris amolde reported we have lo cated the second mundane army he analyzed their likely course and her illusion can project her image briefly to almost any region of xanth so that she can see the en emy it seemed that queen iris was going allout to help the centaur king being quite grateful to him on more than one count the horseman is with them south of the ogre f enogre fen we do not know how he reached them so rapidly he did have two days to travel which would be enough for a healthy and able man who knew the route but he must have crossed some of the wildest terrain of xanth to get there i checked it on chems map there are flies dragons goblins griffins and ogres as well as vir tually impassable natural regions i must confess i am at a loss even to conjecture how he managed it imbri shared his confusion she had been to those re night mare gions of xanth and knew how difficult they were the lord of the flies took his office seriously and was apt to have intruders stung to death and the other creatures were no less militant he must have used his talent to stop any hostile creatures and maybe to cow a griffin into trans porting him he is a very efficient rider he can tame any thing with his reins and spurs oh yes she knewl that must be it at least he is no present threat to us here amolde did not comment on the implication that the horseman believed the centaur king would be ineffec tive therefore was not worth sending to the gourd imbri suspected the horseman had made a bad mistake there the centaurs of the isle contingent declined to enter castle roogna they camped in the gardens foraging for fruit from the orchard and pitching small tents they did not need these for themselves so much as for their supplies tell us where the mundanes are their leader said coldly we shall march there in the morning and dispatch them imbri showed him the enemy location in a dreamlet map since chem was not encouraged to approach with her more detailed magic map the prejudice of the centaur isle centaurs against their talented brethren was implaca ble they are in ogre territory he asked surprised the ogres of the fen are wild and hostile how could mere mun danes have bested them these are very tough mundanes imbri explained they beat back the gap dragon in the chasm the what in the where it was that forgetspell operating again a ferocious monster in a crevice she sent the centaur was unimpressed any of us could do that more likely the mundanes made a deal with the ogres promising them plunder if they joined the invasion such deals occur imbri agreed determined not to be antagonized such as the promise of autonomy are you attempting humor mare he demanded coldly it seemed the centaurs reverence for horses had limits king amolde had immediately granted the isle cen taurs local autonomy remarking that it made no practical night mare difference but they did not express overt appreciation certainly this particular centaur remained prickly of course not imbri demurred keeping her ears for ward and her tail still she was getting better at such dis cipline social politics made her master new things i merely fear that we may be up against more than mun danes when the human king of xanth sought help from the other creatures most expressed indifference feeling that it was a humanfolk war not theirs so there could be a tacit understanding with the mundanes in which the punic army is allowed to pass through monster territory without impediment provided no damage is done in pass ing it is also possible that some animals chose to ally them selves with the mundanes in fact their current leader the horseman did that he is a xanthian turncoat the centaur spat to the side contemptuous of any kind of turncoat well handle it he decided with what she hoped was not an unwarranted confidence now leave us we shall march at dawn imbri retreated to the castle chameleon was up and alert now less pretty and more potent mentally restored from her grief by the news that her husband and son were well if enchanted imbrido you think you could carry a person into the gourd to visit the kings imbri paused considering i suppose i could i hadnt thought of it mostly it is only the spirit of a person that goes into the gourd but i have been carrying people through on the way to far places i could take you to see your family oh i dont mean me though i certainly would have been tempted in my other phase i mean irene irene she and dor were married just before he became king and had to master the rigors of kingship and take over the campaign against the mundanes and go to battle he never had a moment to himself unless he was sleeping so she was widowed as it were almost before she was married oh imbri had a little trouble getting adapted to the womans more intelligent thought processes for she had been acclimated to the slow pretty version but it was true there had been no wedding night imbri knew that sort of night mare night mare thing was important to human people it was like coming into season and being walled off from the stallion i will take her to him imbri agreed tonight before anything else happens chameleon fetched irene dear imbri has somewhere to take you the girl shook her head i cant leave dor you know that if anything happened to his body he would never be able to return she didnt know it was to be a surprise i really think you should go irene chameleon said it will do you good to leave the castle for a while things may get harder later i will watch dor for you irene sighed she could not refuse dors mother the chance to sit by his body youre probably right very well ill take a ride this time she mounted imbri and they set off it was not yet dark so imbri took her time circling the centaur camp and going to the gourd patch indirectly she could not safely enter the gourd until night do you know it is good to get out irene confessed looking about i havent ridden a night mare before do you really phase through trees and boulders i really do at night imbri sent but did not amplify ive been meaning to thank you for all you have done irene continued brightening as the mood of the evening infused her you have taken chameleon everywhere and made things so much easier for dor we all must do what we can this reminded imbri that she was supposed in some way to hold the key to the salvation of xanth if only her role were clearer all she could do now was continue from hour to hour trying to improve things in little ways was that enough she doubted it yes the girl agreed all ive been able to do is sit and wait i curse myself for a fool i had so many years i could have married dor and i just waited thinking it was a sort of game now that its too late i realize she stopped and imbri knew she was stifling tears there was no point in deception i am taking you to him now imbri sent now but inside the gourd with your father and the other kings a visit but you must return with me before dawn or you too will be trapped in the world of the gourd i can go there for a few hours comprehension was coming for a few hours imbri agreed and i will be real i mean ill seem solid or the kings will not just diffuse spirits yes some creatures are there in spirit some in body when i enter the gourd my magic accommodates it is all right no one except a night mare can travel physically in and out of the gourdexcept those in contact with a phasedout night mare then by all means lets go irene exclaimed gladden ing now it was dark imbri came to the gourd patch and plunged into the nearest ripe peephole the rind passed be hind them they then phased through another wall and into the graveyard where skeletons roamed one skeleton waved to imbri in greeting then she trotted on into the chamber the night stallion had reserved for the visiting kings the kings were alert and waiting having somehow an ticipated this visit irene king dor cried happily irene greeted her father and dors father then turned to dor she frowned attractively you cant skip out this time she said we started our marriage in a graveyard and well consummate it in a graveyard the skeletons wouldnt like that he murmured the skeletons dont have to participate but she yielded to the extent of allowing imbri to show them to a private chamber filled with pillows as imbri left they had a fullscale pillow fight going imbri now retired to the graveyard for some good graz ing one of the graves began to shake and settle but she squealed wamingly at it and it desisted imbri did not take any guff from graves just grass well before dawn xanthsidedawn never came to the world of night naturallyshe returned to the chamber of kings dor and irene were there talking with the others night mare night mare looking happy a number of pillows were scattered about it seemed the pillow fight had spread as conflicts tended to everyone appeared satisfied irene looked up and saw the mare oh its time to go or mother will know what mischief i was up to she ex claimed she brushed a pillow feather from her hair gave king dor a final kiss and went to imbri they moved on out emerging from the gourd before the sun climbed from its own nocturnal hiding place the sun was afraid of the dark so never appeared before day came oh imbri irene exclaimed youve made it so nice considering considering that the kings were still prisoners and xanth was still under siege by the mundanes imbri under stood this had been no more than an interlude we must rescue the kings soon imbri sent before their bodies suffer too much from hunger yes irene agreed we have to capture the horse mansoon they returned to castle roogna king amolde was alert are you rested imbri he inquired imbri replied that she was the cemetery verdure was marvelously rich and her hours of quiet grazing and sleep within the familiar gourd had restored her to full vitality perhaps too her part in facilitating irenes reunion with her father and husband had buoyed her half spirit she was only sorry she had missed the pillow fight then i must ask you to lead the centaurs to the mun danes the king said they are not conversant with the specific route and we dont want them to fall prey to avoidable hazards i would do it myself or have chet or chem do it but imbri understood the centaur isle troops still refused to deal directly with the obscenely talented centaurs she couldnt approve of their attitude but knew that there were few creatures as stubborn as centaurs it was best to accom modate them without raising the issue they were after all here to save xanth from the ravage of the nextwave i will take them there she agreed where exactly are the mundanes now they are proceeding south skirting the regions of fire and earth passing the land of the goblins we sent news to the goblins of the mundane threat and they promised to organize for defense but were not sure theyve gotten be yond the draftnotice stage we dont even know whether we can trust them it is difficult to intimidate goblins but the mundanes are extremely tough in past centuries gob lins were a worse menace than mundanes but they were more numerous and violent then chem says she knows one of them a female named goldy who possesses a magic wandbut i prefer caution imbri went to join the centaurs who were organizing ef ficiently for the march at dawn their tent stables were folded and packed away imbri led them north along the path to the invisible bridge across the gap they were amazed they had no prior knowledge of this immense chasm thanks to the forgetspell on it they trotted in single file across the bridge and soon were able to regroup on the north side guided by her memory of the map chem had formed for her before she left imbri led the centaurs through the land of the flies they had suitable insect repellent and knew how to cut through the flypaper that marked the bor der the flies buzzed angrily but could not get close the repellent caused them to bounce away no matter how de terminedly they charged the centaurs were able travelers and progress was swift imbri led them to the fringe of the dragons territory do not menace the dragons she sent in a general dreamlet i will explain to them and when the first dragon came she sent it an explanatory dream showing brute human folk fighting halfhuman folk both of whom might turn against reptile folk at the slightest pretext the dragon retreated dragons were cautious about armed manlike creatures es pecially in this number they had experienced the deprada tions of magictalented men and knew how well centaurs could fight it was better to be patriotic and let the war party cross in peace still there were pauses along the way for centaurs had to eat and lacked the ability to graze more and more it was apparent to imbri that any deviation from the straight equine form was a liability the centaurs had to consume night mare night mare huge amounts of food to maintain their equine bodies but it all had to be tunneled through their inadequate human mouths fortunately they had brought concentrated sup plies along but it remained inefficient business the route was not straightforward between the dragon country and the goblin country there was a jagged moun tain range projecting west into the region of earthquakes they had to skirt the mountains closely to avoid getting shaken up it was there in tfae late afternoon that the mundanes ambushed them imbri cursed herself for not anticipating thisbut of course she was not a mind reader so could not discover their nefarious plots she only projected dreams and communicated with people by putting herself into those dreams had she known the mundanes were close but she had not known she should have known though she realized this now for the mundanes had been march ing south naturally the centaur contingent would encoun ter them south of the location king amolde had described the centaurs fought back bravely but were caught the mundanes rolled boulders down the near slope of the mountain forcing the centaurs to retreat into the region of earthquakes that was disaster for the ground cracked open with demoniac vigor and swaflowed a number of them whole the carnage was awful in moments only ten centaurs remained charging back out of the trap most of them had been wiped out before they could even organize for defense but as soon as the centaurs were clear they halted con sulted and moved slowly back toward the mundanes what are you doing imbri demanded in a dreamlet now we have sprung the trap we shall destroy the en emy a centaur replied but there are several hundred mundanes protected by the terrain youll be slaughtered exactly as your compan ions werel the stubborn creatures ignored her weapons ready they advanced to battle this is folly imbri projected sending a background image of an army of centaurs being washed away by the tide of a mighty ocean at least wait until darkness then you can set an ambush of your own at night i will be able to scout out the enemy positions they walked on stiffbacked refusing to be dissuaded from their set course by marish logic centaurs were sup posed to be very intelligent but they simply did not readily take advice from lesser creatures imbri hung back knowing she could not afford to throw away her life with theirs she had to admire the centaurs courage in adversity but also had to disassociate herself from it she had to return to castle roogna to report on the disaster in case queen iris had not picked it up by means of her illusion yet imbri remained for a while hoping the centaurs would become sensible they did not as the mundanes gathered and charged to attack the centaur remnant the ten stalwart creatures exchanged terse commands and brought their bows to bear there were now twenty times as many enemy warriors on the field as centaurs and more men in reserve obviously the punics believed this was a simple mopup operation it was not for all their folly the centaurs were well trained fighting creatures with excellent armor and weap ons who now knew exactly what they faced their unex celled archery counted heavily in a moment ten arrows were launched together and ten mundanes were skewered by shafts through their eyes even as they fell another vol ley of arrows was aloft and ten more went down every single centaur arrow counted no target was missed or struck by more than a single arrow and no mundane armor was touched in the face of marksmanship like this armor was useless imbri was amazed the mundanes belatedly realizing that they faced real opposition hastily formed into a phalanx their shields ov erlapping protectively still they had to peek between the shields to see their wayand through these crevices passed the uncannily accurate arrows the leading mundanes con tinued to fall and none who fell rose again now imbri realized that chet a young centaur had not yet fully mas tered his marksmanship otherwise he would have needed no more than a single arrow per mundane when he had night mare night mare opposed them on the chasm bridge what an exhibition this was but once committed to this course of battle on the field the punics were as stubborn as the centaurs they main tained their phalanx stepping over their fallen comrades and closed on the centaurs more of them fell of course but the rest pressed on by this time the centaurs arrows were running out it was coming to sword conflictand the mundanes still outnumbered the centaurs ten to one had all fifty centaurs avoided the ambush imbri real ized they could have destroyed the entire mundane army without a loss their confidence had not been misplaced of course the mundanes would not have met them on the open field if they had been aware of the marksmanship they faced so it might have been more even as it was the centaur disaster had been followed by the punic disaster forty centaurs and a hundred mundanes were dead and there might still be a good fightbut the centaurs would surely lose for swords were not as distant and clean as arrows imbri turned and galloped away feeling like a coward but knowing this was what she had to do a goblin stepped out before her waving his stubby arms imbri screeched to a halt who are you she sent i am stunk he said you brought me a bad dream onceand then it came true i got drafted i should have fled goblin land when i had the chance after a moment imbri remembered her last delivery the one that had shown her inadequacy for the job but the goblins didnt fight all we did was guard our mountain holes he agreed but goldy girlfriend of a chief sent me to intercept you she says some of her friends are on the human side so she wants to helpbut shes the only one who will so if the folk at castle roogna need her come and get her she does have the magic wand and a lot of courage i will relay the message imbri sent stunk saluted and imbri flicked her tail in response the goblin turned north while she continued south appar ently getting drafted was not nearly as bad in life as in a dream of course it was stunks fortune that the goblins had avoided actual combat with the mundanes night closed she located a gourd patch and plunged into a peephole it was too bad she couldnt use this avenue by day she might conceivably have been able to fetch help for the centaurs in time to do them some good but if she could not use the hypnogourds by day at least they could not harm her as they did other creatures she was a deni zen of the gourd world immune to its effect but it was pointless to approach a gourd when she couldnt use it the horseman she rememberedhe had actually used the gourd to eliminate the kings so if he tried to wield his talent on her he would fail and she could destroy him that too was good to know because she did want to de stroy him she galloped through the familiar reaches of the dream world it occurred to her that she could report to the five prisoned kings on the way and perhaps receive their ad vice to relay to king arnolde she was supposed to serve as liaison after all so she detoured toward that section she wondered briefly whether it would be possible for her to carry one or more of the kings out to rejoin his natural body she had done that for smash the ogre once but she realized immediately that she could not because she did not know the specific channel that had brought each king into the gourd any king she brought out would continue to exist as a phantom his body would remain inert there was nothing but frustration to be gained by that she had to locate the particular channel that connected the kings to a particular gourd only the horseman knew that key natu rally he would not give that information simply for the ask ing she entered the chamber of the kingsand skidded to a halt appalled yes it is i amolde said i too have now been taken imbri projected a flickering dreamlet stammering out her news of the fate of the centaurs this was worse even than that since the horseman was still taking out the kings as fast as they could be replaced she had thought the horseman was with the mundane army but evidently he hadnt stayed there long it seems that every time a king shows competence ni mare night mare king trent said the horseman takes him out at such time as xanth enthrones an incompetent king he will surely be allowed to remain until the enemy is victorious meanwhile imbri kindly do us the favor of informing my wife the sorceress iris that she is now king queen imbri sent numbed king he repeated firmly xanth has no ruling queens with my apologies for misjudging the location of the horseman amolde added i told iris to sleep since there was no present menace to me evidently i was mis taken evidently so imbri had to agree she nodded and trotted on out feeling heavyhoofed when would it end chapter king queen she reached castle roogna unconscious of the interveningjourney the palace staff was sleeping mcludmg imbtapproached queen iris and sent her a fica dream king arnolde has been taken you must assume the kingship your majesty what arnolde was quite alert a moment agol ins protested herself awashtlurched to her feet and stumbled he kmg s apartment king centaur i just had a bad dream she stopped arnolde stood there staring blankly ss iris whispered appalled oh we should s mtrto mbri sent he agreed you must be king now king trent said it too and i have bad news to report to the king iris leaned against the wall as if feeling faint she was no young woman and recent events had not improved her health only her iron will to carry on as a queen should had kept her going all my life i have longed to rule xanth now that it is upon me i dread it always before i had the security of knowing that no matter how strong my desire it would never be fulfilled women dont really want all the things they long for au they really want is to long and be longed for oh whatever will i do imbri im too old and set in my ways to handle a dream turned so horribly real you will fight the mundanes king iris imbri sent feeling sympathy for the womans predicament the kings feminine visage hardened how right you are mare if theres one thing i am good at it is torment ing men those mundanes will rue the day they invaded xanth and the horsemanwhen i find him stay away from him your majesty imbri pleaded until we unriddle the secret avenue of his power no king dare approach him but i dont need to do it physicallyl i can use my illu sion on him imbri was doubtful but let that aspect rest he may be close to castle roogna she sent we thought he was up in goblin land he was in goblin land king iris cried i saw him myself only yesterday but he must have been here to take out king amolde then he found a way to travel quickly hes probably back with his army by now i can verify that soon enough she took a deep breath meanwhile lets have your full report on the war situation if i am to do this job ill do it properly after it is over i shall be womanishly weak my foolish hunger for power having been expiated but i cant afford that at the moment imbri gave the report to her men retired to the garden pasture on the kings order and grazed and rested she liked running all over xanth but it did fatigue her and she wished it wasnt always because of a new crisis night mare night mare in the morning king iris had her program ready she had devised a very large array of illusory monsters which she set in ambush within the dragons terrain awaiting the mundanes southward progress the real dragons took one look at the vla and retreated to then burrows wanting none of it in midmoming the punic army appeared still two hundred strong marching in disciplined formations imbri saw that a number of the soldiers were ones who had not participated in the battle with the centaurs apparently about fifty had held back or been on boulderrolling duty these had filled in for the additional fifty the centaurs had wiped out in the final handtohand struggle an army of three hundred fiftyslightly larger than the xantb intelli gence estimate had thoughthad been reduced to some what better than half its original size in the course of that single encounter if only she imbri had been alert to the ambush so that all fifty centaurs could have fought effec tively but major errors were the basic stuff of war king iris had somehow gotten the magic mirror to work again perhaps by enhancing its illusion with her own and focused it on the mundane army so imbri and the others were able to watch the next engagement an audience was very important for iris her sorcery of illusion operated only for the perceiver first to pounce were two braces of sphinxes each had the head and breast of a man or woman the body and tail of a lion and the wings of a giant bird the females were five times the height of a normal man the males larger all four monsters spread their wings as they leaped into the air and uttered harsh screams of aggression the mundanes scattered understandably a number of them charged into the bordering zone of air and were blown away by the perpetual winds there some took ref uge in the burrow of a local dragon there was a loud gulping sound followed by the smacking of lips and a satis fied plume of smoke then there was a windy burp and pieces of mundane armor flew out of the burrow most of the remaining soldiers simply backed up shields elevated awaiting the onslaught they certainly werent cowards the sphinxes sheered off as if deciding the odds were not proper of course the real reason was that the illusion would lose effect if the mundanes ascertained its nature no illusion could harm a person directly he had to hurt himself by his reaction to it if the sphinxes charged through the soldiers and revealed themselves as nothing the game would be over after the sphinxes came the big birds the rocs the sky darkened as six of these monsters glided down casting monstrous shadows the two remaining mundane ele phants spooked and fled headlong back north trumpeting in terror they knew the sort of prey rocs liked to carry off that set off most of the remaining horses who stampeded north too it would be long before many of these were re covered if any could be rounded up unscathed now thats the way illusion should operate queen irene murmured appreciatively theyll make slower prog ress with most of then animals gone each roc held a big bag and as they passed over the mundanes they dropped these bags the bags burst as they struck the ground releasing yellow vapor that looked poi sonous bushes and trees within its ambience seemed to shrivel and wilt and turn black and phantom figures in the likeness of mundanes gagged and staggered and fell in twisted fashion to the ground imbri made a whinny of admiration for the sheer versa tility of the kings performance she would have been terri fied if she faced that apparent threat she heard someone cough as if breathing the awful gas if the illusion had that effect on these viewers who knew it for what it was and who were not even in it how much worse it must be for the superstitious mundanes in the thick of it maybe it was possible after all to wipe out the enemy without touching it physically the punics reeled back afraid to let the yellow vapor overtake them their leader came forwardthe horseman riding a fine brown horse naturally that man had pre vented his steed from spooking imbri was startled this meant he was with this army and not lurking around castle roogna how had he traveled so fast he had to have mag night mare ical meansa carpet perhaps or some renegade person of xanth who enabled him to do it someone who could make him flybut that did not seem likely the mystery deep ened unpleasantly the horseman yelled at the troops then strode forward into the fog it did not hurt him they rallied and stood up to itand of course it did not hurt them either the bluff had been called after that the mundanes ignored the splendid illusions king iris threw at them they marched south toward the gap chasm and if seemed nothing she could do would stop them but imbri knew the king wasnt finished theres more than one type of illusion iris said grimly by late afternoon the punic army was approaching the gap it was making excellent time because no creature of xanth opposed it and the horseman obviously had mapped out a good route but king iris made the chasm appear to be farther south than it was then she sent a herd of rain deer trotting across the spot where the real chasm had been blocked out bringing a small rainstorm with them illusion worked both ways to make something nonexistent take form and to make something that was there disap pear this combination was marvelously effective little bolts of lightning speared out from the rainstorm and there were boomlets of thunder iris was a real artist in her fash ion one might disbelieve the stormbut overlook the non existence of the ground it rained on water from that storm was coursing over that ground beginning to flood it there were even reflections in that water the mundanes jaded by the displays of the day charged past the nonexistent deer right on into the nonex istent storm across the nonexistent groundand fell screaming into the very real gap chasm the horseman had forgotten about it naturally enough and the mun danes had never known of it the horseman quickly called a halt and regrouped the mundanesbut he had lost another thirty men he was down to a hundred and fifty now and obviously not at all pleased he reined his horse before the illusion and shook his braceleted fist night more imbri was privately glad to see the man had not caught the day horse he must have preempted this one from a lesser officer could he have ridden the brown horse to castle roogna and back in the night it seemed unlikely the horse was too fresh but since the mundanes had re tained a number of horses before the queen spooked them away he certainly might have used one of those for his purpose though the best routes for hoofed creatures were not necessarily the shortest ones and certainly not the saf est the best shortcuts were ones only something like a man could take so there still seemed to be no perfect an swer yet the major mystery was not how he traveled but how to abate the enchantment on the six kings is that so you mundane oaf king iris demanded in response to the horsemans fistshaking gesture you cant threaten me horsehead ill use my illusion to chip away your entire army before it reaches castle roogna and she formed the image of a raspberry bush which made a rude noise at him contemptuously the horseman guided his horse right through the illusionand smacked into the ironwood tree that iris had covered up by the raspberry his horse stum bled and the horseman was thrown headlong he took a rolling breakfall in the dirt and came to rest unhurt but disheveled and furious oh mother that wasnt nice irene chortled king iris formed the image of her own face there before the fallen man smirking at him she could see him through the eyes of her illusion the horseman saw her he made a swooping gesture with his two handsand suddenly the illusion vanished queen irene glanced at her mother alarmed whats the then she screamed now it was evident to them all king iris had taunted the dread enemyand had been taken by his magic after a shocked pause imbri sent a dreamlet to the girl what is your program king irene irene spluttered im noti cant king amolde decreed you a sorceress therefore a ma gician therefore in the line of succession and he named night mare night mare you to be the eighth king of xanth you must now assume the office and carry on during this crisis xanth needs you your majesty at least we know your mother is safe in the gourd the girls wavering chin firmed yes she is with my father now perhaps for the first time as long as we pro tect her body but the moment those mundanes get inside this castle all is lost they will slay the bodies of our kings and then our people will be forever in the gourd or worse our situation is desperate for we no longer have magic that can strike down the enemy from a distance she paused glancing around the room who will be king after me humfrey said there would be ten kings during this siege imbri reminded her but you are the last magi dan we cant let the horseman claim the throne by de fault i think youll have to designate your successor from among the lesser talents just in case king irene nodded she turned herself about surveying the people in the room a second time chameleon was help ing crombie the old soldier move king iris to the chamber where the six previous kings were kept she would be the seventh chameleon irene said the woman paused imbri had to do another mental ad justment for chameleon was now far removed from her prettiness of the past it would have been unkind to call her ugly but that was the direction in which she was going yes your majesty even her words had harshened you will be king number nine irene said clearly what chameleon used her free hand to brush a strag gle of hair back from an ear that should have remained covered you are the mother of a king and the wife of a king and youre just coming into your smart phase we are out of magicians now we have to go with intelligence king amolde showed what could be done with intelligence he clarified the line of succession and located the lost kings he did more to help xanth than any magic could have done you will be smarter yet maybe you will be able to solve the riddle of the horseman before she shrugged before he becomes the tenth king chameleon said she was much faster to pick up on other peoples thoughts now after her initial surprise at being designated a pros pective king imbri found this steady progression a remarkable thing she knew chameleon was the same woman but most of the identifying traits of the one she had carried north to spy on the mundanes were now gone she liked the other chameleon better tandy went to take chameleons place helping crombie conduct the former female king to the resting chamber chameleon returned to talk with irene i see your logic chameleon said i am no sorceress and there are many people in xanth with stronger magic than mine but i be lieve you are correct what we most require is not magic but intelligenceand that for a time i can provide she smiled lopsidedly knowing better than anyone that if she retained the office of king too long xanth would be in an extremely sad state she would have to wrap up the job during the nadir of her appearance for there was no intel lect to match hers then i shall see that the horseman is not the tenth king whatever else i do or do not accom plish she did not bother to argue the unlikelihood of irenes getting taken they both knew that this was inevitable as the prophesied chain continued to its end but in case you face the horseman directly king irene irenes brow furrowed im not sure i follow your impli cation you are a lovely young woman he might attempt to legitimize his takeover by taking you in another fashion irene flushed id kill him then she tilted her head reconsidering slightly ill kill him anyway if i get the chance i owe him for my father my mother my hus band again chameleon smiled how different this expression was from the one her lovely version had shown this was a cold calculating awful thing i am not questioning your personal loyalty to xanth i am merely suggesting that it might occur to him to try it is the kind of thing that oc curs to men when they encounter young women of your night mare night mare description if you could discipline yourself enough to seem to accept his interest at least until you fathomed his se cret slowly irenes smile matched that of the older woman the strangest thing was that it was no prettier on irenes face than on chameleons imbri saw and understood and was repelled human women well knew the advantage they bad over human men and used it ruthlessly what an ugly way to try to save xanth yet if it came to that extreme was there any better way what was justified in war im bri wasnt sure maybe there was no proper answer to this type of question now king irene went to work organizing her campaign the magic mirror showed the mundanes camping for the night at least there were several campfires the rest was darkness if the punics resumed their march at dawn it would take them at least two hours to reach the invisible bridgeobviously the horseman knew about itand longer to get to castle roogna irene turned to imbri the bridgecould you kick that out tonight i could try imbri sent but i would run the risk of falling into the gap since i cant use a lever or an axe and would have to stand on the bridge in material form to kick at its supports this sort of work really requires human bands and tools it galled her to admit that there was something a human folk person was better at than an equine person but in this very limited respect it was so i will go with you chameleon said im not strong but im good at that sort of challenge i have a sharp knife that should cut through the strands but king irene protested there is no danger from the mundanes by night cha meleon reminded her and none from xanth monsters when im on the enchanted path or on the night mare if we can take down that bridge quickly the nextwave will be stalled at least another day navigating the chasm and we shall be much better able to defend castle roogna but if i should be taken during your absence ill return promptly i promise the girl spread her hands you are correct of course im afraid to be alone with this responsibility but thats a luxury i cant afford unlike my mother i never even imagined being king i shall set up a collection of plants to defend this castle but i wont make them grow until you are safely back inside chameleon mounted imbri and they took off through the wall and headed for the local gourd patch i have another task for you chameleon said when they were alone i do not believe that either the gap or irenes plants can stop the mundanes for long and well never eliminate the horseman unless we first trap him and prevent his escape this will require a lure he cant resist and some desperate measures on our part i want to kill the horseman if i find him imbri sent im not sure hell tell us how to nullify his enchantment he deceived me once but he will never trick me like that again she swished her tail smashing imaginary flies he is extremely elusive and i think i know why cha meleon said it would be quite unfortunate if i am wrongand im not yet at my peak of intelligence so i may betherefore i will not voice my suspicion but if i am right he will take king irene and he will also take me immediately following he will suppose that will make him the tenth king the chain complete but we can prevent that by acting first there must be one more king of xanth designated one he cant send to the gourd that is the king who can finally break the chain yes magician humfreys prophecy makes the tenth monarch vital imbri agreed diving into a gourd neither of them paid attention to the gourd world which now seemed commonplace being absorbed in their conversation but who is it to be anyone you select can be enchanted anyone but one chameleon said who you imbri veered into the wall of the city of brass one of the subdivisions of the gourd where the brassies labored on metallic aspects of bad dreams of course the brass wall didnt hurt her as it was insubstantial in her present state night mare night mare but by the time she straightened out she had startled sev eral of the laboring brass folk who who are you looking for a brassie man inquired thinking she was addressing him embarrassed imbri covered by naming the one brassie she knew of who had seen the real world biythe youre in the wrong building the brassie man said shes in bfour tell her i may need her help soon imbri sent realiz ing that she might turn this blunder to advantage biythe brassie just might be able to help in the crisis of xanth right now im on my way elsewhere yes carrying garbage to the dump another brassie re marked eying chameleon imbri hastily trotted on throughanother wall feeling an unequine burning in her ears the brass folk are very in sensitive she sent to chameleon they have no souls and no soft tissues i am used to this sort of thing chameleon said peo ple assume that because i am ugly i must be bad and they treat me that way then find confirmation when i do not react with delight if they approached me in my offphase the way they do when im pretty they would find me easy enough to get along with there was much truth in that imbri was sure she re membered how smash the ogre had been considered bru tish and violent because of his size and appearance when in fact he was a most decent creature people tended to become what others deemed them to be perhaps that was another aspect of the magic of xanth chameleon resumed her discussion i am designating you to be the final king of xanth imbri if i am correct and i hope i am you are the only one who can do it this is the real reason the night stallion sent you out into the day he knew what he was not permitted to tell so he did what he could to save xanth by making it possible it was a course requiring much grief including good magician humfreys shame but the only likely way to save xanth you are the key you must be the tenth king but im a horse yes i had noticed are you any less a creature of xanth imbri snorted i think i liked you better when you were beautiful and not just because of your appearance everyone does but on certain rare occasions intelli gence is more valuable to a woman than beauty oh of course i didnt mean i will be beautiful again imbri i can not afford to remain king then i would defeat xanth through sheer stu pidity if the horseman had the intelligence to banish irene and keep me in power he could certainly work his will during my other phase i must provoke the crisis now while i have the wit to handle it things may move quite rapidly once i return to castle roogna just you be ready to do your part mare i dont understand this at all imbri sent in a dreamlet of darkly roiling nebulosities you arent even king yet but you talk of getting banished to me gourd if you desig nate me king no citizen of xanth would accept it they wont need to chameleon said i would explain more thoroughly but i fear that would disrupt the proph ecy you must tell no one of thisuntil the time mean while after we take down the bridge you must go and fetch help for irenes plants the throne of xanth has come at last to women it behooves the women to defend it with greater efficacy than the men did go fetch the siren and the gorgon from magician humfreys castle and locate goldy goblin well need their talents for the final con frontation but if i go there how will you get back to castle roogna imbri had never dreamed such an office would come to her and as a night mare she had dreamed a great deal but did belatedly see the logic of it she was immune to the horsemans power so could stop him in a way no other creature could but practical details of organization remained at least i must take you back there before we shall see what works out chameleon said enigmat ically that was another annoying aspect of her intelli gence obviously there was a lot imbri was missing they plunged out of the gourd near the bridge and gal night mare night mare loped to the brink of the chasm but there was a problem the mundanes had set guards there imbri faded back into the dark forest before the enemy spied her and halted what now i could approach invisibly but would have to materialize to attack the bridge chameleon considered tapping her fingers idly against imbris mane well have to get rid of them ill devise a slingshot and you can power it make sure i dont grab the wrong kind of vine they quested quickly through the jungle locating sev eral large elastic bands which they harvested and tied to firm ironwood trunks making a huge sling chameleon set a big stone in the net and imbri drew it back with all the weight of her body chameleon had fixed a temporary kind of harness from vines to make this possible following chameleons directions imbri adjusted her position until the slingshot was aimed right at the mun danes at chameleons command she phased out releasing the bands and the rock hurtled up and across it scored a perfect hit on the near side of the bridge sweeping the two mundane guards into the chasm cha meleon knew exactly what she was doing in this phase the two of them hurried across and discovered that the stone had also ripped away the bridge the job was done alreadyl two more mundanes stood across the chasm they nocked arrows to stringsbut chameleon jumped on im bri and imbri phased out again and the arrows passed harmlessly through them nevertheless they retreated from the chasm so that there would be no threat they heard a noise from the west a centaurs coming imbri sent no i suspect its a horse indeed in a moment the white day horse appeared im bri projected a dreamlet of greeting to his mind is the bridge still there he asked worriedly i heard a crash so came running the best grazing is south but i have a good hiding place on the other side and its getting late no bridge imbri sent we just took it out you couldnt have used it anyway the mundanes had set guards on it the mundanes his dream figure cried i understood they were way up north that was yesterday now they are here tomorrow theyll be crossing the chasm and the day after that theyll be at castle roogna i must flee if i understand his reactions correctly chameleon said you have informed him of the proximity of the punic army and he wants to get away from here yes imbri agreed he is very nervous about mun danes i can expand the dream to include you so you can talk to him directly no dont bother when i was fair and stupid i felt at home with the normal equine intellect now that palls but i do need transportation tell him i shall be the next king of xanth the ninth and ask him if he would like to carry me back to castle roogna thats on his way south away from the enemy imbri did as she was bidden thats chameleon the day horse asked amazed the night was dark since it was no longer a good phase of the moon but his excellent equine night vision showed him her appearance well enough i know she changes but this creature is ugly even for the human kind but shes the same inside imbri sent to both the hell i am chameleon snapped and shes going to be queen of xanth the day horse asked daunted king of xanth imbri did not have the nerve to say who would follow chameleon in that office the day horse shrugged shes ugly but i liked her once and can carry her if there are no mundanes there there are none imbri reassured him even ichabod retired to a human village after amolde the centaur king got taken out there are only women inside castle roogna bow with king irene the day horse snorted acquiescently women were no threat to him chameleon mounted and they set off at a gallop for castle roogna imbri headed for magician humfreys castle via the gourd as she traversed a fraction of the night world she night mare wondered idly how chameleon had guessed she would find convenient transportation back the woman was hideously smart in her proper phase but this smacked of prophecy soon she reached the magicians castle and trotted across its moat and through its wall grundy she sent in a general dreamlet is the gorgon back yet tell her not to look at mel i am back the gorgon replied in the dream the go lem returned not long ago to castle roogna to help fight the final battle i am thoroughly veiled just let me wake up and i will introduce you to my sister the siren and goldy goblin who also returned with me so the goblin girl had been serious about helping dont wake up imbri sent you surely need your sleep and i already know the siren i will talk to you all in one dream she expanded the dream to include the others now that she knew their identity oh you are the night mare smash the ogre knew goldy exclaimed as she saw imbri the siren told me about you you carried smash from the void well not exactly imbri demurred somehow flattered but i did help and i received half of chem centaurs soul for the service that enabled me to go dayside i know how that is the goblin girl said the ogre arranged for me to have this magic wand and that gave me great power among my kind soon i will marry a goblin chief i was down in the mines picking out a trousseau of precious metals or i would have come to help the centaurs fight the mundanes i didnt know until too late so i sent a messenger who may not have reached you he reached me imbri sent then the gorgon picked me up before i heard from him now im ready she waved her wand in the dream and objects flew about touched by its power of levitation magician humfrey told me to fetch my sister the gorgon explained and she told me that we should gather some of her other friends so we tried but fireoak the hamadryad cant leave her tree for such a risky venture and john the fairy is expecting offspringi dont think you know these people anywayand we couldnt reach night more biythe brassie and have still to get the word to others like chem and tandy chem and tandy are already at castle roogna imbri sent flashing an image of the castle in the background and i can fetch biythe any time if she wants to come she expressed interest before and i left a message at the city of brass for her to be ready it would be so nice to get together again the siren said and to see the ogre again too he made it all possi ble chameleon asked me to fetch help to defend castle roogna imbri sent i can take you there one at a time no well use the magic carpet the gorgon said we used a bottled conjurespell to send the golem back so we saved the carpet we can start in the morning and keep whistling it back until all three of us are there will that be time enough it should be imbri agreed we expect the mundanes there in two days king irene will grow plants to stop them king irene the gorgon exclaimed what happened to the centaur king imbri quickly updated them on recent developments so chameleon will be the next king she concluded this is moving almost too swiftly for me the siren said weve got to stop losing our kings and stop the nextwave army the gorgon added i believe i can do much of that myself if i can get a good look at them yes imbri agreed take care that no xanth defend ers are near the gorgon nodded we certainly shall you go fetch biythe well meet you at castle roogna imbri let them lapse back into dreamless sleep she trot ted out and to the gourd patch and soon was back at the city of brass all the brassies of biythes block were frozen into statue form which was normal for them when at rest imbri pressed the activation button with her nose and they came to life will you come with me to the real world biythe night mare night mare imbri asked the pretty brassie girl your friends have asked for you and you did mention to me id love to biythe exclaimed its a strange place out there with all its living things but i liked the ogre and the girls ill have to clear it with the night stallion imbri sent but i think it will be all right biythe mounted her and they made an arrangement to have the brassie building turned off again after they de parted it then went on to check on the seven kings imbri received a shock now there were nine kings both irene and chameleon had been taken now it is up to you king mare chameleon said only you can stop the horseman but how did he get to you imbri asked flustered chameleon had warned that things might proceed rapidly but this was hardly to be assimilated chameleon smiled unpleasantly i brought him inside castle roogna my plan worked perfectly you what i confirmed my suspicion and lured him into the trap using myself as bait the moment he was inside we sent all other living occupants of the castle outside and king irene grew the plants she had set out and they quietly con fined him to the castle while he was occupied with us she made that nasty smile again for a while he somehow thought irene found him handsome but when he realized she was only stalling for time for her plants to complete their growth he banished her to the gourd then i assumed the crown and told him we knew his secret and would never let him escape the castle and of course he banished me too so my tenure as king was very brief no more than two minutes he was very angry about being outwit ted particularly by one he had regarded as stupid but he never met you before imbri protested you were in the forest with the day horse when grundy and ichabod and i met him not precisely now you must go and dispatch him and that will not be easy chameleon concluded it will be easy imbri sent i will gladly kick that monster to death chameleon shook her head no not easy at all you cant kill him certainly i can king chameleon imbri sent hotly because it may be that only he can abate the enchant ment he has put all of us under you must first make him free usand he wont do that voluntarily of course that was true they had been over it before imbri was letting her equine temper run away with her but i can still kick him into submission before i finish hell be glad to tell me all but uncertainty was gnawing at her not so good magician king humfrey said there is an aspect we may have neglected to clarify you see chameleon continued he is the offspring of a stallion and a human woman the result of a liaison at a love spring thats why he calls himself the horseman he is a crossbreed like the centaurs like the centaurs imbri asked confused but hes a man he is a werehorse slowly the terrible realization came across imbri the day horse the same his mind could occupy two forms each one quite natural to him no one suspected because no such creature has manifested in recent times why didnt you tell me imbri sent appalled all this time ihe i realize that was cruel chameleon said but i was sot quite sure if i were wrong i would have maligned a good and innocent animal if i were right it would have been dangerous to inform you because your reaction could have alerted him and made him avoid our trap so i had to deceive you and i regret that all the time with usthe horseman whose magic talent is to connect a line of sight between any two placessuch as a human eye and the peephole of a gourd as we surmised that is how he enchanted all of us but if you try to kick him he will change into his horse formand he is more powerful than you not by night imbri protested but she remained ap palled she had thought the day horse was her friend now night mare she remembered how the animal had always been in the general vicinity of the horseman certainly this had been so when she had first encountered both of them the one purporting to be fleeing the other what a cunning camou flageand she had been completely deceived the horse had even freed her from captivity by the manhow could she suspect they were the same then when she grundy and ichabod had spied on the mundane army while cha meleon slept the horseman had appeared in the mundane camp and the horsemans uncanny ability to travel naturally he had used his stallion form to gallop in hours what might have taken his human form days while the man form could navigate the special passes and shortcuts that might have balked the animal form the best of both forms as the day horse pretending to be stupid he had learned the secrets of xanththe invisible bridge the pro jected lines of kingsand they had thought him their ally and had told hirri everything now too she understood the shame of the good magi cian the day horse had been there when humfrey had set out his spells and explained them to her humfrey could have enchanted the horseman at any time had he realized what was in retrospect so obvious instead he had allowed himself to be caught in that moment when imbri had been outside waiting for the day horse to follow the stallion had changed to the horseman ensorcelled the magician changed back and run with imbri if humfrey was morti fied what then of imbri herself she had indeed been marishly stupid it all fitted so neatly together now she was sickened it had taken chameleon in her nasty smart phase to put all the clues together and arrive at the proper conclusion the horseman perhaps becoming contemptuous of his opposi tion had been fooled himself naturally he had gone with her into castle roogna there was his chance to eliminate the last two kings expeditiously and take over they were all standing there waiting for imbri to come to terms with it king dor had his arm around king irene and both looked pretty well satisfied to be together again king trent had taken the hand of king iris a seemingly night mare minor gesture of quartercentury significance all nine kings appeared to be well enough off here for the time beingbut their bodies were in castle roogna at the mercy of their enemy the horseman they had figured out the truth and that was essential but the end of this crisis was hardly certain yet best of fortune king imbri king trent said sol emnly xanth is depending on you now imbri appreciated the full magnitude of the chal lenge the tenth king had to break the chainand she was that king chapter breaking the chain here was no trouble about getting biythe brassie released for realworld duty the night stallion had been waiting for the request imbri and the brassie girl arrived at castle roogna before dawn the gorgon the siren and goldy goblin were already there so were chem centaur and tandy and her ogre hus band smash who had been faithfully guarding the castle throughout other people and creatures had been sent to neighboring villages for their own safety since it was now known this would be a battle site the old soldier crombie had been persuaded by his daughter to march with the oth ers to protect them on the journey and point the way if any got lost the truth was he was no longer in condition to fight mundanes but he had indomitable pride the si ren had organized these things with the tact and sensitivity she possessed biythe was joyed to meet the others old friends greeted one another enthusiastically then they sobered knowing that the difficult time was soon to come marching from night mare night mare the gap was one enemy within the castle was another both had to be dealt withby this pitifully frailseeming group of females and a single ogre and one golem grundy pointed out with grim pride obviously he had not departed with the others though he should have what he could do to help wasnt clear at the moment but he was ready to do it they looked at imbri who suddenly realized it was now her place to give directives for she was king rest eat she sent in a slightly shaky dreamlet we dont expect the mundanes until another day youll know what to do imbri faced the castle a dark silhouette against a sky thinking about brightening and i know what i must do first the castle was imposing in a strange new way as she gradually made out the details it was almost entirely over grown by vegetation tangle trees braced against its walls and carnivorous grass sprouted from the crannies animate vines dangled from the parapets kraken weeds sprouted from the moat making the normal moat monsters uneasy king irene was gone but her magic remained and it did indeed seem to be of magician caliber there was no easy way any person could pass in or out of that place the horseman certainly was trapped for a tangler would as quickly gobble a horse as a man the plants could not invade the interior of the castle for that was protected by assorted spells that had been in place for centuries but they certainly lurked for anything outside imbri had to enter the castle now before dawn or she would not be able to do so until nightfall only her imma terial state could pass those savage plants chameleon and irene had certainly set their trap well and done as much for xanth in their brief tenures as kings as any of the prior kings had there was a sound from the north chet centaur came galloping his fine body sweating from the effort imbri marveled at how different the results of crossbreeding could bea fine centaur on one hoof the awful horseman on the other the mundanes are coming the mundanes are com ing chet exclaimed breathlessly but we took down the bridge imbri protested i know it i checked as well as i could without being seen by them apparently they sent a man across right after you left it happened so fast the gap dragon didnt have time to get therethough im not sure that poor monster is eager to encounter mundanes again the man hauled the invisible bridge back upits netlike you knowand tied it in place and they marched across it at night now their vanguard is upon us i would have discov ered it earlier but i was checking other trails you were on routine night patrol not expecting any thing grundy said we all knew the one place they would not cross was at the broken bridge or thought we knew we have all underestimated the mundanes the siren said thats why the war has gone so badly for us we keep thinking that people without magic cant be much of a threat thats not true at all in fact such people are the most ruthless and depraved perhaps because of that lack so are doubly dangerous imbri realized that the siren who had been deprived of her own magic talent for more than twenty years was in a position to appreciate the deleterious social effects of loss of magic she was a good woman and had survived and perhaps even improved herself during that hiatus but lesser people could readily do worse imbri like the others had made another serious miscal culation she had assumed that the mundanes would re main camped for the night then forge across the gap chasm by day in the manner the other army had crossed a few days before and camp again on the south side they had outsmarted her advancing cleverly and rapidly to re join their trapped leader now the consequence of this mis judgment was apparent the siege was on before the de fense was ready the horseman would have to wait imbri had a battle to organize the nextwave could not be allowed to capture castle roogna the last solid symbol of xanth indepen dence or to rescue the horseman if she went inside to deal with him she would be trapped there by daylight unable night mare night mare to phase through walls and plants and thus be unable to deal with the army outside she might kill the horseman but lose the battle so that xanth would have nothing at all except barbarians overrunning it even a bad leader was probably better than none at all if she dealt first with the mundanes the horseman would remain trapped and she could deal with him at her leisure but that wasnt a perfect answer suppose the horseman got angry and started killing the bodies of the kings could she afford to risk that imbri wavered again the burden of decision making was heavy for a mistake affected the welfare of many other creatures and perhaps the entire kingdom dont worry the siren said divining her thought the horseman wont hurt the kings he is holding them hostage he knows we could send in a flight of harpies or other deadly creatures to wipe him out if we werent con cerned about our own people in there meanwhile the kings are no threat to him he has everything to gain by taking good care of themuntil the mundanes win this battle and free him if the mundanes lose hell try to use the kings as bargaining chips to win his own freedom that made sense imbri hoped we must organize quickly she sent the gorgon must be where only the enemy can see her but not where they can shoot arrows at her fear not the gorgon said i will remove my veil only in the presence of a mundane i can hide behind a tree and peek out but the others will see what happens to the first the siren said the mundanes are very quick to perceive and act against threats to their welfare but i can help magi cian humfrey restored my magic dulcimer before he be came king i have it now and my power has returned let me lure them first we must get all xanth males clear of the area imbri sent aw we know about the gorgon grundy protested we wont look her in the puss all males must be clear imbri insisted beyond hear ing so you wont be lured in by the siren you go out and warn them in the name of the king get far away and dont return until one of us finds you and tells you its safe oopssmash went on another patrol through the jun gle tandy said to make sure no mundanes were sneak ing in from any other directions we have to do it golem chet said shes the king mare and shes right we must warn everyone as fast as we can catching any stragglers and getting well away from here ourselves we can intercept smash and warn him off well give you as much time as possible imbri sent this is a battle only females can fight because they are immune to the sirens song she turned quickly to the si ren thats right isnt it thats right the siren agreed my power is related to that of millie the ghostprojected sex appeal i suppose a male siren could summon females that would serve them right grundy exclaimed the gorgon turned toward him lifting one hand to her veil hastily he mounted chet and they galloped off while the siren chuckled the gorgon would not really have lifted that veill imbri remained uneasy they certainly had an excellent weapon or combination of weapons in these two sisters since the mundane army was all male if only they had had more time to work out a really solid defensel in hurried moments they set up a crude arrangement the best they could manage with the disadvantage of their situation as the sun hauled itself up out of the forest to the east singeing the leaves of the adjacent trees the head of the mundane column marched upon the castle light glinted from the punic shields and helmets as the dread wave crested a ridge chem centaur concealed herself in a hollow old beer barrel tree and projected a large map of what she saw this identified the position of all the mundanes in the area in a way that every defender could see the punics could see it toobut no xanth positions were marked on it so it didnt night mare night mare help the enemy the mundanes peered about trying to spot the origin of the map but there were a hundred fat old trees in the vicinity none ofwhom cared to help the enemy and many other features of the terrain to baffle the intruders so the mundanes spread out poking their spears at each tree and getting peppered by supposedly accidental falls of deadwood soon they would discover the right one but goldy goblin using the projected map for orienta tion waved her magic wand a mundane flew up in the air involuntarily with a startled cry he sailed in a high arc over the jungle then plunged screaming out of sight the mundanes oriented on this new menace for the mo ment forgetting the map they located goldy perched high in a youcallyptus tree they shot arrows at her but the tree called out a warning as was its nature and moved its branches to intercept them the mundanes stared thinking this another coincidence blaming the movement on the wind but as the breeze died and the tree kept balking their shots they realized that it too was a combatant all the trees around castle roogna could move within reasonable limits and they were guard ians of the castle but they could not do much unless the mundanes came within reach and the enemy soldiers were careful to stay clear the mundanes charged the yptus tree goldy used her wand to loft another and another over the jungle and in to the nearest lake where hungry goozlegizzard monsters lurked but there were too many for her to stop they reached the base of the tree and started climbing then biythe brassie went into action she was perched on a lower branch and had a basket of cherry bombs har vested from the local cherry tree she dropped these singly on each ascending helmet the bombs detonated as they struck splattering cherry juice in the enemy faces and making the helmets clang the climbing mundanes fell out of the tree and out of the fight the other mundanes shot arrows at biythe they were so close that the trees branches were unable to react fast enough to protect her but the arrows clanged off her brass body harmlessly well almost harmlessly each one left a dent and she was very sensitive about dents furious she hurled more cherries at the archers blasting them out angered in turn the punies formed a kind of phalanx overlapping their shields above their heads so the cherry bombs had little effect and marching to the base of the tree then they used their swords to hack at the trunk oooooool the tree groaned with a sound like that of wind sighing through its branches it certainly was hurting biythe dropped down on the top of the phalanx and knelt to locate crevices through these she squeezed more cherry bombs the explosions in the confined space of the formation caused the overlapping shields to jump and fall apart smoke poured out assisted by the coughing and hacking of the people inside the enclosure biythe lost her perch and fell down into the phalanx now the punies whose bodies remained intact grabbed the brassie girl biythe struggled but they were too many and too strong for her look what weve got herel one gloated a golden nymph we know what to do with that kind another ex claimed hold her arms and legs imbri seeing this from deeper in the jungle galloped across to where the siren hid theyve got biythel she sent the moment she came within range theyre chopping goldys tree now its time for youl the siren nodded she put her hands to her dulcimer and began to play music sprang out magically filling the air then she sang her voice merged oddly with the notes of the instrument forming an unusual but compelling mel ody the magic was not entirely in the dulcimer and not entirely in her voice but together the two formed a power ful enchantment the sound floated out over the battle field suffusing the environment the mundane men reacted in quite a different manner than the xanth females the soldiers straightened up lis tening pausing in whatever they were doing some had ar rows nocked to strings some were chopping at the youcall tree some were advancing on the castle and some were holding biythe brassie spreadeagled preparing for some heinous male act all froze a moment then turned and night more faced the music biythe battered and dented but otherwise undaunted dropped to the ground the men had no further interest in her there was no formation now only a somnambulistic shuffling toward the unseen siren for almost twentyfive years the merwomans power had been blunted by the loss of her magic instrument now it burst forth again in its fantastic compulsion the mundane men crowded toward the source of the sound jostling one another discourteously they clogged like drifting garbage at the narrow entrance to the glade where the siren sang and shoved blindly to enterand of course got shoved back everything about the mundanes was brutish but slowly the clog cleared and they tunneled in beside the siren stood the gorgon as each man ap proached she lifted aside her veil and looked him in the face he turned instantly to stone a statue in place the man following him was not concerned he simply went around and was in turn converted to stone imbri watched from behind the gorgon which was the safest place to be the sirens power operated only on men but the gorgons worked on anyone or any creature the combination of siren and gorgon was deadly potent at this rate the entire mundane army would soon be stoned then imbris acute equine ears heard a distant call im bri trouble it was from one of the girls what was the matter imbri left the garden of statues careful never to face the gorgon though she knew the gorgon would cover her face the moment any friendly party turned toward her a night mare might be immune to the horsemans enchantment but not to the gorgons which was of a different nature imbri galloped on past the heedless punics it was tandy who was calling she had been on pe ripheral duty watching out for unexpected developments and she had found one to her horror its my own hus band she exclaimed as imbri joined her smash he must have missed chet and grundy and not gotten the warning to flee so he came in to report now hes caught by the sirens song and i cant stop him indeed the ogre was tromping along behind the mun night more danes orienting on the hidden glade captive to the melody smash stood twice the height of any of the men and weighed about six times as much no ordinary person could stop him physically in addition he had his magic ogre strength making him much more dangerous than his size suggested he could crush rock with his bare hands and squeeze juice from trees a giant could hardly have stopped him certainly it was beyond the power of a person tandys size imbri tried smash she sent in an urgent daydream you are caught by the song of the siren block it out or you will face the gorgon me know me go the ogre agreed reverting to his dull ogrish manner though his human ancestry gave him intelli gence he tromped on a couple of objects were clutched in his hamhands the lure certainly was powerful imbri realized she could not stop smash she galloped back to the glade send ing a dream to the gorgon do not petrify me friend im coming into sight the gorgon veiled her face and imbri approached her safely albeit feeling shaky in all four knees she stopped behind the devastating woman and the gorgon resumed flashing at mundanes petrifying each in place the glade was now crowded with statues and the siren and the gor gon had to keep backing away to make room for more these two were destroying an army that had marched the length of the wilderness of xanth cowed griffins and gob lins and dragons and made refugees of whole xanthian communities it was surely ironic that the end of the next wave should be brought about by two middleaged and fairly gentle married women the ogre is approaching and i can not dissuade him imbri sent siren you will have to cease singing for long enough to free him ill send him far away then you can resume but that will also free the mundanes the siren pro tested in the dream i know but the gorgon can continue petrifying them they wont know they should flee the ogre can move very fast it wont be long night mare night mare as you wish the siren stopped singing and playing actually my fingers are getting tired i havent done this in a long time she flexed them working the fatigue out getting limber for the next siege of playing smashi imbri sent to the ogre in a strong longrange dream flee to the jungle as fast as you can get out of range of the sirens voice so you wont get stoned she accompanied her words with a picture of the gorgon petri fying men including one ogre who was converting slowly to an ugly statue me flee the ogre agreed me leave spells she use well he set something on the ground turned about picked up tandy and charged away shaking the earth with his tread you too chem imbri sent realizing that the cen taurs map was no longer necessary get away from here and see if you can find other help in case we should need it maybe some of the monsters of the jungle theyre staying out of it chem replied dodging a spear they dont want to mix in human business they dont care who rules xanth well go anyway i dont want you getting hurt here chem nodded she was sensible enough to grasp the reality of the situation it was best to keep all expendable personnel well clear of the moving gorgon so that no acci dents could happen the mundanes meanwhile were shaking their heads reorienting some tried to attack the running ogre thinking he was fleeing them that foolishness was rewarded imme diately smash swung his free fist in a surprisingly wide arc knocking them away it was an almost idle gesture for him akin to the swatting of flies but the mundanes flew through the air and did not move again after they plowed into the earth other mundanes returned to their original mission ad vancing on the castle their numbers had been depleted there were fewer than a hundred remaining some contin ued on into the glade trying to ascertain what was happen ing there and these the gorgon quickly dispatched several soldiers stopped to pick up the items the ogre had set down imbri had forgotten about those smash had called them spells so he must have believed they were magic that would help in the war effort she galloped over but was too late the mundanes were already opening one box whatever the magic was the enemy had it as king she was not handling such details very well there was a scream followed by frantic activity the mundanes started desperately swatting at something stomping their feet and fleeing the region they ignored imbri in a moment she realized what it was smash had picked up the box of quarterpedes left by good magician hum frey it must have washed into the jungle undamaged the terrible little monsters naturally attacked anything they could reach they were all over the mundanes gouging out two bits of flesh with every pinch a scourge not even brute soldiers could ignore in a moment the area was clear clear of quarterpedes too for they were all on the mun danes screams and curses in the distance bespoke the loca tion of the affected individuals what lucky mischief for the castle roogna defenders the second box remained imbri remembered this one it was lettered pandora she wondered what was inside but knew better than to open it herself she picked it up with her teeth and carried it with her maybe the gorgon could identify its contents since she had packed it for the good magician soon imbri judged the ogre to be far enough away the sounds of boulders cracking and trees being knocked over had faded in the distance she wondered idly whether the quarterpedes would have dared to gouge at the ogre had he opened their box she trotted back toward the gorgons glade circuitously avoiding mundanes start again siren she sent there was no response hey siren imbri sent again in a stronger dream still there was nothing gorgon tell your sister to re sume singing imbri sent after a moment the gorgon responded in the dream my sister has been taken by the horseman imbris confidence collapsed like a wall struck by the ogre too late she realized what had happened the night mare night mare horseman confined to castle roogna had heard the si rens song faintly and felt its compulsion since he could not reach her he had remained partially transfixed per haps walking in place against the wall perhaps in immi nent danger of stepping out to be gobbled by a carnivorous plant the moment the song stopped he had been freed so he had acted to eliminate the danger he must have been able to see the siren from an embrasure and could work his magic on whomever he could see or perhaps her song had enabled him to focus sufficiently on her he had connected her to the gourd she now had joined the kings well have to fight without her imbri sent do not be alarmed gorgon she is well enough off in the gourd just protect her body from the mundanes and we shall rescue her when we rescue the kings ill do more than protect her body the gorgon said grimly ill petrify every last ilk of a mundane she walked purposefully around the statues holding her veil away from her face looking for enemy men imbri was glad she had cleared the area of friends this was certainly dangerous territory now but it wasnt the same without the sirens summoning the mundanes were becoming aware of the danger some formed a phalanx not looking out others located the gor gon by looking at her in the reflections of their shields they blindfolded some of their archers and gave them in structions on aiming their bows by using the shield reflection technique the first arrows missed but the mun danes aim was improving they might not be in the centaurs class as archers but they were good enough the gorgon had to keep moving to avoid getting struck we need to reorganize imbri sent you must back up against goldys tree gorgon then goldy can protect you biythe can help a lot too i dont believe your power af fects her since she is already made of metal my sister mentioned that biythe was immune to the glare of a basilisk the gorgon said mine is no worse than that get on my back we must hurry carefully the gorgon mounted then imbri galloped on while the gorgon glared about leaving a trail of statues in their wake many mundanes had not yet gotten the word they soon got the look and that finished them a centaur galloped back it was chem why isnt the siren singing she called is something wrong imbri quickly sent her a dream of explanation get away from the mundanes she concluded they remain dangerous so i see chem agreed one thing i can do i can circle around and carry my friend the siren away to safety an excellent notion imbri said and the centaur gal loped away they set up by the yptus tree with biythe brassie pro tecting the gorgon from hurled spears and close arrows while goldy goblin used her wand to remove any archers whose blindfolded aim became too good they settled into a war of attrition with the numbers of the enemy steadily decreasing but then alertness increas ing the punics tried to swamp the gorgon with another phalanx goldy and biythe disrupted it loosening it so that some mundanes inadvertently looked outand turned to stone that messed things up for the others who found themselves in a pileup of mixed living and stone bodies they tried to charge with a huge tree trunk as a battering ram but imbri sent a dream picture of a tree to one side of the real one and they oriented on that and charged harm lessly by when they ground to a halt realizing that some thing was wrong and looked back the gorgon got them all stoned with a single glance others tried to use the stoned bodies of their companions as weapons picking them up and shoving them toward the tree but the statues were too clumsy and too easy for goldys wand to move away it seemed the girls were doing all right despite their re verses the mundanes were down to about fifty and were fazed by the number of their companions who were statues soon they would not have enough of a force left to storm the plantdefended castle and rescue their leader the day was passing when night fell imbris power would be mag nified for she would be invulnerable to strikes against her self as it was only constant vigilance the proximity of the gorgon and the fact that many mundanes did not know night mare what office imbri held prevented her from getting wounded had the punics been able to face her and attack they would soon have prevailed then imbri realized that she hadnt seen any mundanes lofted out of the battle for a while are you all right goldy she sent in a dreamlet to the high branches of the tree she encountered only blankness with a tired and famil iar wash of horror she knew that the goblin girl had been taken the horseman had evidently spotted her concen trated longdistance and finally managed to reach her it surely wasnt easy for him to score at this range but he had nothing to do except try perhaps he had missed a hundred chances then eventually scored when conditions were just right maybe imbri had erred again by not going in to deal with him at the outset he certainly was causing mischief now whom would he reach next i think you should get out of the line of sight of the castle imbri said to the gorgon biythe and i are from the world of night so cant be enchanted that way look ing into a gourds peephole does not hypnotize us but you hastily the gorgon edged around the tree until she could no longer see castle roogna but without goldys help their situation was critical now the mundanes could or ganize a phalanx without having individual members fly out from it they had shields angled like mirrors in several places so that they could orient specifically on the tree there would be no stopping this onel we have to move imbri sent they are too much for us they moved imbri carrying both biythe and the gor gon the double load was awkward especially since the brassie girl was heavier than flesh but the phalanx was not able to pursue efficiently so imbri did a lumbering gallop and made it to the protection of the main jungle then she felt the gorgon sliding off biythe grabbed the woman to prevent her from falling but that was only a minor problem they had appeared in sight of the horseman and he had been ready and had taken the gorgon maybe it had night mare been a lucky score for him but the damage was critical now they had no really good weapon against the mun danes all they could do was hide until nightfall hoping the plants around castle roogna would confine the horse man until then imbri was not especially proud of the way she had managed things she should have realized that the horseman would strike again the moment he got the chance the mundanes did not pursue them far perhaps fearing some new trap they might be satisfied to have routed the defenders not knowing that the gorgon could not turn and strike again imbri soon was clear of the enemy moving through the quiet jungle she and biythe set the gorgon in a pillow bush covered her over with a blanket from a blan ket tree and left her there she should be safe for a few hours most of the predatory creatures of this region had departed when the mundanes came as the reputation of the invaders as hunters of monsters had preceded them imbri and biythe went to the edge of the jungle to watch the mundanes irenes plants remained formidable the first mundanes who ventured close to the front gate got snatched and con sumed by the vines and tangle trees guarding it pieces of mundane fell to the grass and it gobbled these just as av idly some plopped into the moat where the moat monsters fought with the kraken weeds to snap them up that taught the men caution the punics tried another battering ram charging up to the moat and hurling it across at the wall but the tentacles snatched it out of the air and dumped it back on the mens heads a real battering ram which was a horned and hoofed animal who liked to charge things headfirst would never have made the mistake of charging a tangler the mundanes consulted then scattered what are they doing biythe asked it soon became apparent they were gathering dry wood theyre going to use fire imbri sent oh the plants wont like that the brassie girl said worriedly she had learned about plants during her prior visit to the real world when she had traveled with the ogre but doesnt water stop fire night more it does imbri agreed but the mundanes have proved to be resourceful before they must have some way in mind to get around that imbri looked at the sky the sun was now descending as it did every day about this time when it got too tired to maintain its elevation soon night would come she doubted the mundanes could free their leader before the friendly darkness closed when night arrives i will enter castle roogna and confront the horseman imbri sent you must go then to rescue goldy goblin from the yptus tree and bring her to where we have hidden the gorgon yes i will keep them safe the brassie girl promised the mundanes rolled small boulders into the moat slowly filling it in at one place and forming a crude cause way they shoveled dirt and sand into the interstices the plants and moat monsters were not smart enough to realize what the men were doing so did not oppose it directly they tried to grab the men as morsels but left the boulders alone in due course the causeway reached the castle wall so that the mundanes were able to march up to it while fighting off attacking tentacles now the punics brought their collected wood and piled it against the wall where the causeway touched but the vines grabbed the sticks and hurled them back perceiving them as useful missiles i could get to like such plants imbri sent apprecia tively this did not balk the nextwavers for long they started their fire away from the wall then drew burning brands from it and threw them at the plants the plants threw them back but received a number of scorches in the process it was evident that before long the mundanes would be able to clear a section of the wall they werent approaching the front gate for that was guarded by two omery tangle trees but here at the ramp the wall was less heavily defended of course the wall itself remained behind the plants and that was excellently solid they would have to batter a hole in it which would take time imbri judged she would have about an hour to deal with the horseman after night fell but she wasnt sure for the punics had surprised her before with their savage cunning still these ones must night mare have been active for a day and a night and another day without rest they were bound to give out eventually darkness closed go about your business biythe im bri sent and phased out good luck the brassie called after her imbri started to neigh a responseand discovered that she still held the pandora box in her mouth she had been so caught up in events that she had never noticed the way it propped her mouth open well she would simply have to hold on to it a little longer since she didnt know what it contained it was bound to be important though hadnt humfrey said his secret weapon more potent than any other was locked up in this box he had been afraid the girl pandora would take it out prematurely so had kept the box if she opened it herself something horrible might emerge to destroy her as the quarterpedes had done to the mundanes who opened the other box if she let this item fall into the hands of the mundanes some fearsome thing might come forth to aid them what should she do it was a problem imbri suspected she would need the luck biythe wished her everything depended on her if she found herself in real trouble she would open the box and hope it helped her but she wouldnt touch it before then only when she had nothing to lose the castle loomed closer she had not been able to con centrate on this aspect of her challenge now as she gal loped invisibly toward the final encounter seeing the grim wall illuminated on one side by the smoldering blaze of the mundanes fire she realized why it was because of the day horse she had thought the day horse was her friend now she knew he was not he had deceived her from the outset running from her because he feared she could read his mind then meeting her in the form of the horseman and learning more about her then returning in horse form to ingratiate himself with her by freeing her what a cynical mechanism to make her feel positive toward him there after he had used her to find his way conveniently all around xanth learning about the enchanted paths the in night mare visible bridge and the nature of the xanth defenses thus she had been responsible for the ultimate betrayal of xanth setting up a series of kings for confinement in the gourd all that the day horse had told her about the selfish motives of the horseman such as why he had allowed her to escape hasbinbads camp were true he had been in a position to know of course that creature in either form had enabled her to remain free she was far more useful to the enemy than were any of the mundane spies beware the horseman indeed if she had known now she did know now she was the tenth king of xanth and she had to atone for her colossal error in judg ment she had to destroy the monster she had so innocently facilitated but that wasnt all of the point now there was some thing else something more fundamental what was it she couldnt kill the horseman because of his magic which would probably continue after him leaving the kings in dire circumstances she had to make him tell his secret which meant she would have to converse with him and she couldnt do that because because why somehow her mind sheered away as if at the brink of the gap chasm but she had to face the truth for this was the critical encounter what was that truth she snorted hot little snorts and swished her tail violently from side to side venting her private rage at the cynical way the day horse had maneuvered her reviewing it once more in order to evoke the elusive thought she knew was so important the day horse had played the innocent pretend ing to be almost stupid almost cowardly when he was in fact none of these things he had given rides or aid to fu ture kings of xanth facilitating their advance not from any good will to them but because he judged them to be potentially ineffective rulers against whom the mundanes could make easy progress when each new king disap pointed him by demonstrating surprising determination and capability he took out that king to make way for another weaker one ironically even the less promising of these the women became towers of strength for xanth until at last the least impressive of all chameleon fathomed his secret and trapped him night more least impressive no that doubtful honor belonged to imbri herselfnot human not male and no magician xanth had at last been brought to the indignity of being governed by a night mare a creature whose life cycles were equine suddenly as she encountered the dark moat she suf fered her final horrible realizationthe one that had eluded her before she was coming into season it had been developing all along of course in the nor mal equine cycle as a full night mare she had never been tied to it for she had been mostly immaterial but once she became a day mare the things of solid existence had loomed larger and nature had proceeded inexorably now nature said it was time for her to mate her mind had been distracted by the crisis of the kings but her body had never changed its course the enemy she faced was in his fashion a stallion she veered away from the castle she could not face him now she could not even go near him her equine nature would betray her it would not permit her to attack him it would require her to mate with him yet she could not stay away either for soon the mun danes would break open an aperture in the wall and free their leader then xanth would be finished the horse man would kill the hostage bodies of the kings and pro claim himself king and there would be none but a discred ited mare to deny him if she were going to stop him at all she had to do it now imbri wavered indecisively if she went inside castle roogna she would surely betray xanth to the enemy if she avoided confrontation she would let xanth fall by de fault which way was she to go she turned again better at least to try she charged toward the castle determined to do what she had to do she might be in season but she had a mind equivalent to that of a human being and a human woman could pretty well control her mating urges such as they were imbri had to determine once and forever whether she was a civilized kingor a simple animal she phased across the moat through the vegetation and the stone of the wall and into the deep gray matter of the night mare castle a ghost spied her waved and vanished then all was still she made her way to the throne roomand there was the horseman her foe sitting slumped on the throne a golden crown on his head a scepter in his hand sleeping such ambition she materialized and stood looking at him he was a fairly handsome figure of a man with curly light hair good musculature and that thin brass band on his left wrist the only jewelry he wore yet even though he was in repose there was a cruel hook to his upper lip he was not a nice person it would be easy to kill him now this was the enemy who had plagued xanth generally and her personally for he had ridden her and dug his cruel spurs into her flanks she could dispatch him with perfect joy and justice but first she had to force from him his secret so she could free the nine other kings of xanth if she failed they would all perish as their physical bodies starved even if the horseman died first if the horseman won xanth would be ruled by the tyrant imposter and his mundane henchmen she had to succeedbut still did not know how to proceed as she stood there in unkingly uncertainty the horse man woke his eyes opened and he spied her well he said seemingly unperturbed so you have arrived at last king mare he seemed so confident imbri knew that there was no way this horrible man could get on her back since she was fully on guard even if by some trick he managed to get on her he could not remain since she would simply demate rialize he would have to get off in a hurry or she would carry him into the gourd and turn him over to the kings he would never get to rule xanth then she could attack him while he could not attack her not even with his spe cial magic talent she was one of the few creatures natu rally immune to his power that was why she was here now he had to know that why then should he appear unconcerned what no dreams imbri he asked brightly all this trouble to come see me and no dialogue im here to break the chain she sent trying to rid night more herself of the unreasonable awe of him she felt how do i free the kings from your spell you dont imbri those kings are past i am the next and final king of xanth as you can plainly see not so i am the present king of xanth she sent her equine ire rising i will kick you to death before i let you usurp the throne she took a step forward the horseman waved a hand in a gesture of negligence so the issue is which of us is the true tenth king of xanth you are bluffing mare i know you are immune to my power and i know i can not ride you or strike you while it is dark i have seen the night world from which you hail nevertheless you are not about to attack me because all your prior kings will die if i do there will be no one to unriddle the enchantment i made then you can free them if you choose imbri sent i did not say that the horseman replied as if playing a game either you can free them or you cant if you cant then they are doomed anyway and you have nothing to bar gain with if you can free them you had better do so or you will lose your life i shall not permit you to gain the throne of xanth by your mischief either king trent re turns to power or i shall remain king in neither case will you assume the office the question is whether you will free the kings and live or fail to free them and die the horseman clapped his hands together in mock ap plause oh pretty speech nocturnal mare but what if i live and you die and i am accepted as the final king of the chain she saw that he had no intention of yielding he was stalling until his mundane allies rescued him she would have to kick him perhaps when he was suitably battered and knew she was serious his nerve would crack she braced herself for a charge suddenly the horseman hurled a spell enclosed in an opaque globe it bounced against the wall behind imbri and burst from it a bright light emerged illuminating the whole chamber as if it were day it was a sunspot one of the spells in the royal arsenal the horseman had spent part of his confinement exploring the castle and had of night mare course raided its store of artifacts he was after all far from helplessand she should have anticipated this imbri wrenched her eyes away from the blinding sun spotbut too late to prevent damage her vision adapted to night was temporarily stunned fool she had allowed herself to be completely vulnerable to surprise whatdid that sudden blaze hurt your sensitive eve ning eyes mare the horseman inquired with false con cern do you have difficulty seeing me king equine perhaps i can alleviate your indisposition imbri whirled to the side avoiding his approachbut soon crashed into a wall the forgotten object in her mouth flung out and clattered across the floor she could not seeand not only that she could not phase out because of the daylight the sunspot generated the scheming horse man had hit her with a double penalty how cunningly he had laid his countertrap knowing she was coming i dislike this imbri the horseman said stalking her youre such a beautiful animal and i really do appreciate fine horseflesh i am i think uniquely qualified to judge the best but you have placed yourself between me and the throne of xanth and have cost my ad hoc allies an extraor dinary amount so i must congratulate you on the way you organized those females and dispatch you imbri lurched away again caroming off a wall her vi sion was beginning to return but slowly things were still mostly blurry marehes got a magic sword a voice warned in her ear who are you imbri sent to the unknown person how could there be anyone else in the castle i am jordan the ghost the person whispered again in her ear we ghosts have been watching for the rescue at tempt and i was notified the moment you phased in i know what you are doing and the great effort you must make i have friends within the gourd i will help you if you trust me i bear a message of greeting to you from them she sent as she continued to move i forgot to seek you out before when i had the opportunity of course i trust you now she deeply regretted her neglect there were half a night mare dozen ghosts in castle roogna and millie the zombie masters wife had been one of their number for eight hundred years naturally the ghosts supported the legiti mate kings of xanth help me get on my back and guide me till my sight returns im on jordan said imbri felt nothing but that was normal for a ghost one body length ahead turn right theres a door hurry hes about to strike at your flank imbri leaped forward and veered right she misjudged slightly and banged her shoulder but got through the door way two body lengths the ghost said turn left she obeyed and found another opening it is dark here jordan advised her glory be imbri phased into immateriality and walked through a wall she was safe now thanks to the ghost thank you jordan she sent are you still with me i mean now that im oh yes im still riding you he said the state of your materiality makes no difference to me now imbris sight was firming did the horseman fol low he did not he remains in the light sword ready he is eyeing the box you brought but not touching it he doesnt know whats in it imbri sent neither do i its a complete gamble which i plan to open only when there is no hope that way it will be unable to hurt me if it is bad and may help me if it is good that makes sense but he has control of the box right now and doesnt dare open it then we are at an impasse imbri sent he cant hurt me in the dark and i doubt i can hurt him in the light if thats a typical magic sword it will skewer me before i can hurt him it is the ghost confirmed of course you could bor row some other weapon from the arsenal that sounded good imbri knew she had little time to dispatch the horseman for she could hear the mundanes pounding at the outer wall what is there oh lots of things jordan said magic bulletsonly we dont know what they are or how they are used night mare night mare whether they are for biting or for making people feel good vanishing cream which we cant see at all let alone drink healing elixir fantasy fans whats a fantasy fan imbri asked a bamboo fan that has a magic picture on it when spread open jordan explained it also makes you think youre cooler than you are especially when the picture is of a snowscape periodically these fans gather together from all over xanth for some big convention where they shoot the breeze and blow a lot of hot air and decide who is the secret master of random oh imbri didnt need any fantasy fans in fact none of the items seemed useful for her present situation is there anything to nullify his sword oh yes magic shields armor gauntlets i cant use those things i have no hands oh yes i see xanth hasnt had a handless king before let me consider its the sword you must be wary of you cant avoid it the moment he gets within range it will strike for the kill i presume that if it werent for that you could dispatch him in the light yes imbri knew that even if the horseman got on her back and used his spurs he could not control her now she would ignore the pain and launch into darkness where she would be in control in either phase no the horseman would not dare try to ride her this time ive got it jordan cried snapping his ghostly fingers without effect the meltspell will that melt metal indubitably that is what this one is for the mundane scholar ichabod was cataloguing the spells of the armory for king amolde and that was an old one he discovered before the men were sent away from this region too bad he didnt have the chance to finish the job theres a lot of good stuff here that even we ghosts dont understand they trotted down to the armory the spell was in a small globe as many were imbri wondered what magician had packaged such spells for they seemed to keep forever she picked the globe up in her mouth carefully for the ghost could not carry anything physical she phased back phasing the spell with her and trotted off to the main floor she heard the crashing of the mundanes attacking the wall by the sound of it they were making progress their ramp and fire had nullified the moat and plants in that vicinity so they were free to batter the stones as much as they craved in just a few more minutes they would break in she had to finish with the horseman before then for otherwise the mundanes could go on the rampage and kill the ensorcelled kings regardless of the outcome of her con flict imbri hurried in fact she thought now she had better make sure that if it seemed she would beat the horseman she finished him off quickly so that he would have no chance to take the true kings with him she came in to the lighted room where the horseman awaited her sword ready he looked even more arrogant now his thin lip curling up from halfbared teeth his brass bracelet gleaming with seeming malevolence in the light of the sunspot she was prepared for the light and the sunspot was no longer as brilliant so this time she had no trouble with vision she turned solid in the room however any light stronger than moonlight did that to her ah i thought i might see you again king mare the horseman said with a supercilious sneer you must meet meor forfeit your cause he strode forward the sword moving with an expertise that was inherent in it not in him imbri spit out the spell it flipped through the air toward the horseman the sword alertly intercepted it slicing it in twoand therein lay the swords demise it wasnt intelli gent it didnt know when to desist had the spell been al lowed to pass unmolested or had the horseman simply caught it in his left hand preventing it from breaking he would have been all right but as the globe separated into halves the vapor of the spell puffed out clouding about the blade of the sword the blade melted first it sagged then it drooped like soft rubber at last it dripped on the floor it was useless night more night mare now imbri leaped for the horseman with a squeal of combat her forehooves striking forward the man dodged aside throwing away the useless weapon he tried to jump on her back but imbri whirled bringing her head around teeth bared most human beings did not think of equine beings as teeth fighters but they were however all she caught was his sleeve he was mov ing too fast for her he was scrambling onto her ready to use his awful spurs she lunged to the side slamming into the wall trying to pin tiim against it to crush him and stun him again he was too fast he certainly understood horsesi he rolled over her back and off the other side landing neatly on his feet imbri swung about and lashed out with her hind hooves the double blow would have knocked his bones from his body had it scored but he had thrown himself to the side anticipating her attack with uncanny accuracy but she was a night mare with a century more experi ence than he had in life she knew far more about this sort of thing than had any horse he had dealt with before she spun on her hind feet as they touched the floor and leaped for him again she knew she had him now he could not safely leave the lighted chamber for in the darkness the advantage would be entirely hers in moments she would catch him in this confined space with hoof or teeth or the mass of her body and he would be done for the horseman had fallen to the floor getting out of her way sure enough she had surprised him with her speed and ferocity he had misjudged her exactly as she had mis judged the day horse assuming that the personality that showed was the only one inhabiting that body he was ac customed to tame mundane horses who tolerated riders be cause they knew no better now he scrambled on hands and knees as she reoriented for the kill he was too slow this way she knew she had him then he transformed into his other form suddenly the day horse stood before her massive white beautifuland male she had in a pocket of her mind doubted that her horse friend and her man enemy could really be the same now that doubt had been banished imbri hesitated the masculinity of this magnificent creature struck her like a physical blow she was in season ready to mate and this was the only stallion she knew if she destroyed him she might never again have the chance to breed he was the enemy she knew that had she retained any doubt the presence of tile brass band on his left foreleg just above the foot would have removed it she had be lieved that that band was the token of his slavery to the horseman now she was aware that it was much more than that the form of the creature had changed the form of the inanimate band had not how ready she had been to believe whatever he told her she had gone more than half way to delude herself wanting to believe that no horse could be evil she knew his nature nowbut all her being protested against violence in this case no mare opposed a stallion not when she was in season it was as contrary to her na ture as it was for a human man to strike a lovely woman it simply wasnt done this was no decision of intellect it was a physiological chemical thing with equines intellect was not allowed to interfere with the propagation of the species she had always before considered this an advantage but advantage or disaster it was so the day horse turned toward her lifting his handsome head high he snorted a snort of dominance he recognized his power over her it did not matter that they both knew him to be her enemy her deadly rival for the kingship or that he was only stalling for time until the mundanes com pleted their breakin the horseman had occupied her as long as he could using up precious time now the day horse was doing the rest of the job nature held her as powerless as she had been when blinded imbri dont let him dazzle you jordan the ghost cried in her ear he was still with her she had forgotten him during the intense action no male is worth it i know for i am a worthless male who ruined a good girl and now suffer centuries of futile remorse dont let it happen to you xanth depends on you still she stood virtually rooted smelling the compelling scent of the stallion she knew she was being totally foolish as females had always been in the presence of virile males night mare she knew the consequence of her inaction yet she could not act the mating urge was too strong the day horse nipped her on the neck imbri stood still there was pain but it was exquisite equine pain the kind a mare not only accepted from a stallion but welcomed he was dominant as he had to be to be a worthy stud he marched around her taking his time this too was part of the ritual he sniffed her here and there and snorted with affected indifference oh he certainly had her under control the ghost had given up knowing imbri was lost her glazing eyes were fixed on the box on the floor the one that had the word pandora printed on it all it would take would be three steps to reach it and strike it with a forehoof opening it releasing whatever it con tamedbut she could not force herself to take those steps there was a loud crash from the distant outer wall the mundanes had broken in at last imbri quivered trying to break free of her paralysis but the stallion snorted quiet ing her she simply could not oppose him though all her reason protested her folly she had fatally underestimated the compulsion of her own marish nature hey generalwhere are you a mundane called the day horse shifted momentarily into his human form here in the throne room he called back that broke the spell imbri jumped moving like the re leased mechanism of a catapult turning on him but as she faced him poised for the strike he converted back to stal lion form he arched his neck eyeing her with assurance completely handsome and potent he tapped the floor with his left forehoof imbri in the process of freezing again despite her best resolution saw the brass band on that leg the band that advertised exactly who and what he was she struck out with a forefoot catching him on that front leg attacking the band the blow was not crippling or even very effective its significance lay in the fact that she was opposing him his shift of form and his direct recog nition of alliance with the mundane enemy had disrupted the equine mood he was not a horse in the guise of a man but a man in the guise of a horse imbri did not breed with a man in any guise now she knew subjectively as well as night mare objectively that he was no friend of hers all she had to do was look at that band to see him as he was the day horse squealed more in anger than in pain he stomped his forefoot again he was as handsome in his ire as in his dominance imbri refused to be captured again the brass band re mained fixed in her mind her head swung about her teeth biting into his neck just behind the furry white ear she tore out part of his splendid silver mane red blood welled up staining the shining hide now the day horse fought he squealed and reared his forehooves striking outbut she reared too she was not as large and powerful as he so was at a disadvantage but she was driven by pure outrage and the knowledge that she was fighting not only for her pride her freedom and her life but for the welfare of the nine other kings and for the land of xanth itself she was the king mare she had to prevail she whirled her lesser mass giving her greater maneu yerability and launched a rearfoot kick she scored on his shoulder and felt the bone crumbling under the force of her blow the day horse stumbled limping then righted him self and came at her again he was indeed a fighting crea ture and quite unafraid instead of turning about to orient his powerful hind hooves on her he used his head this was the contemptuous nipping approach of the dominant animal this time imbri kicked him in the head he collapsed blood pouring from his nostrils imbri looked at him now she was sorry for what she had done though she knew it was necessary he had made a fatal tactical error coming at her in the mode of disci plining rather than in the mode of fighting and had paid the consequence yet the blood on his pretty white coat gushing over the floor horrified her she knew there was healing elixir in the armory she could fetch some of that and in an instant this most beauti ful creature could be restored no stallion should suffer so ignominious a demise where are you general the mundane called ap proaching the throne room night mare imbri charged for the door whirled and caught the man with a hard kick in the chest as he entered he went down with a broken groan unconscious or worse jordan she sent will you ghosts help the mun danes are said to be superstitious theyre actually afraid of the supernatural if you show yourselves to them and make threatening gestures it may scare them away ive got to protect the dormant kings while i try to reverse the horse mans enchantment on them well do our best jordan said and floated swiftly and purposefully away imbri returned to the day horse determined to force him to divulge the secret she hated all of this but if she had to she would taunt him with the healing elixir holding it back until he acquiesced but she discovered that he had changed again he had reverted to his human form in a pool of bloodand the horseman wasnt breathing the terrible force of her kick had smashed the bones of his head she knew at a glance that he was dead there was now no way to make him talk she had in her desperation hit him too hard she had murdered him she stared at the awful sight her agony for the death of the day horse merging with her grieffor the coming loss of the kings of xanth what could she do now she had squandered xanths last chance bleak despair overwhelmed her she and the ghosts might fight off the mundanes but what use was that now the king mare had brought doom exactly as should have been anticipated the box jordan prompted returning maybe it has a counterspell listlessly imbri put her hoof on the box and crushed it thin translucently pink vapor puffed out expanding into a rather pretty cloud it encompassed her for she made no effort to avoid it for good or evil she accepted it it certainly wasnt evil she felt invigorated and positive somehow she generated confidence that things would work out after all hope jordan exclaimed in her ear it was hope night more locked in that box i feel it too now i believe that my own long morbidity will eventually terminate hope good magician humfrey had mentioned that he had locked up hope she hadnt realized that it was in the pandora box she understood objectively that nothing had changed yet the positive feeling remained there had to be some way imbris eye caught the brass circlet on the horsemans wrist something turned over in her mind why had he never removed it though it was an obvious hint of his identity surely it had considerable value for him could that thing be a magic amulet something to enable him to convert from man to horse nothat conversion was in herent in his nature just as the sirens ability to change from legs to tail sprang from her manmermaid parentage the siren needed the dulcimer to do her separate magic the bandcould it be something like the dulcimer to amplify or focus his power if the example of the siren was valid these crossbred people did need something extra to bring out their full talents part of their magic was their dual natureso the rest was weaker than it should be a dulcimera thin brass band the magic of the horseman could have resided not wholly in him but partly in the amulet it was her only remaining chance she had hope this could solve the problem of the kings she took the brass ring in her teeth and tugged it it would not pass over his hand so she used a forehoof to crush the bones of his dead extremity together pulping the appendage until there was room for the circlet to pass then she took it in her teeth and itrotted out of the chamber to darkness well protect the kings jordan called after her as long as we can scare the mundanes she sent a neigh of thanks and phased through the walls and out of the castle she saw in passing that the ghosts were indeed doing a good job of holding the remaining mundanes back with the horseman and one of their own number dead and with the ghosts menacing the rest these troops would be quite wary of penetrating deeper into the castle by night they would not realize for some time that the ghosts had no physical power she hopedthe mundanes night mare night mare would be balked long enough the horseman had lost but xanth would not win until the kings had been saved she shot out into the night the brass band still firmly in her teeth she knew one person who was knowledgeable about brass biythe she broadcast as powerfully as she could biythe brassie as she neared the place where she had left the gorgon she heard the brassie girls dream response here king imbri in a moment they were together biythe i have a ring of brass i took from the horseman i think it connects to his power but i dont know how it works can you tell biythe took the band and examined it closely yes i believe i have encountered something like this before note how short it is very little depth compared with its mass it is what we call a short circuit a short circuit what does it do its supposed to make a wrong connection to divert power from its proper avenueor something im really not clear about the details could it divert light imbri asked her new hope flaring again yes i think so it might make a lightbeam go the wrong way like from a persons eye to the peephole of a gourd biythe brightened the missing kings imbri looked through the loop all she saw was biythe on the other side but of course it required magic to imple ment the effectand that was the horsemans talent he had somehow used the short circuit to connect the gaze of each king to a gourds peephole causing the king to be confined to the gourd the ring could be a short circuit to the gourd on one side and to the kings eye on the other but how could the connection be broken imbri asked you have to shield the circlet biythe said ordinary matter wont do it though it has to be magic i dont have any such magicand very little time im bri sent desperately how can i abate its power quicldy should i just break it im sure i could crush it under my hoof with just a stomp or two or have the ogre chew it to pieces oh no dont do that biythe said alarmed that could seriously hurt the kings sending them back to the wrong bodies or permanently marooning them in the night world she paused smiling fleetingly isnt it funny to speak of anyone being marooned in our world but of course since they dont have their bodies with them she shrugged her metal shoulders you must interrupt its power without damaging the brass thats the way such things work that will have the effect of cutting off the kings view through the peephole harmlessly she ought to know imbri realized since she was of the magic brass region desperately imbri cudgeled her mind what would do it then she had a notion the void she sent that nul lifies anything yes thats where we send hazardous wastes to be dis posed of biythe agreed things like used brass spittoons that should work nothing ever returns from there imbri took back the band and launched herself north toward the void then she remembered to veer to the near est gourd patch obviously it did not affect the band to be within the gourd since the day horse had been there while wearing it and no prisoned king had been released but the void was different even the creatures of the gourd world had to be careful of it she plunged madly through tfae night world heedless of all its familiar scenes and out of the gourd within the dread void she suppressed her growing nervousness after all xanth depended on her performance now she ran straight into the most feared region of xanththe center of the void the land curved down here like the surface of a buge funnel descending to its dread central point for the void was a black hole from which nothing escaped not even light only imbris kind could safely pass the outer fringe of itand she had to dematerialize for the inner fringe lest her physical body be sucked in never to emerge she was terrified of this depth for it was beyond where she had ever gone beforebut she had to make sure the brass ring was properly placed that its effect was absolutely shielded if she set it rolling or sliding down toward the hole and if it snagged on the way night more night mare the kings could remain captive for an indefinite future time until the ring completed its journey she wasnt even sure a direct placement in the hole would break the spell but it did seem likely and it was all she had left to try it was her only hope if this did not break the chain then xanth was doomed to anarchy for there would be no way to rescue the kings and the mun danes would ravage xanth unchallenged the horseman was gone but his mischief would remain after him causing xanth to suffer grievously she came to the bottom of the funnel she saw the deep est blackness of the black hole she was immaterial yet it seemed to suck her in it had a somber awesome latent power she was extremely afraid of it she opened her mouth and dropped the brass band it plummeted as if gaining weight in an instant it disap peared into nothingness there was not even a splash just a silent engulfment the deed was done imbri tried to turn and depart the funnel her feet moved but her body made no progress she had ap proached too dose to the dread maw of the void even dematerialized she could not escape it she scrambled desperately up the side of the funnel but slowly inevitably she slid back her hooves had no pur chase nothing had purchase here she had penetrated the region of no return her fall accelerated with a neigh of purest terror and despair mare imbri fell into the black hole of the void chameleon seemed to float up her face and body amaz ingly ugly but her spirit beautiful chem chem she called out over the jungle of xanth chem centaur where are you here i am chem cried here with the gorgon dont worry shes thoroughly veiled we need your soul chameleon said drifting down to join them i have only half my soul the centaur said imbri the night mare has the other half no you have all of it now dont you feel it chem was surprised why yes i do i feel buoyant but how is this possible i never begrudged imbri her half and my half was regenerating now i have more than a full soul its too muchi imbri feh into the black hole of the void chameleon explained she killed the horseman and carried his magic talisman to the void to free the rest of us from the en chantment but she couldnt escape it herself the voidi oh this is terrible you mean shes dead after all she did for xanth no we believe one essential part of her survived she lost her body in the sacrifice she made to break the chain fulfilling the prophecy but her soul remained no soul is subject to the void its the only thing in xanth that is not vulnerable to the black hole but it reverted to me it wasnt her own soul because the creatures of the gourd dont grow their own souls they have to borrow from those of us who do i dont want her half soul i want imbri to live after what she did for xanth and the kind of person she was the centaur filly was crying human tears of frustration and grief so do we all chameleon agreed thats why good magician humfrey and i anticipating this made plans for such a contingency we could not act while we were con fined within the gourd but the moment imbri freed us humfrey uttered a spell he knew a word of power an enchantment to keep a special soul discrete despite its ori gin discreet discrete separate so imbri could live on after her body was lost but how thenif her soul came back to me she came too free her chem the good magicians spell enables you to do that because you have the first claim on that soul the centaur concentrated immediately imbri i love you i free you take your half soul be yourself something intangible snapped imbri floated free is it true she sent am i really alive yes lovely night mare chameleon said you are alive in the purest sense but you have lost your body you night mare night mare can never again materialize you are now of the spirit world like the ghosts but what can i do without my body imbri asked dis mayed she remembered her awful fall into the voidand the arrival of chameleon nothing in between thats part of what we arranged chameleon said humfreys spell took care of the paper work or whatever so its all right we all love you imbri and we all thank you and we owe our lives and our hopes to you and we want to be with you often so you will be a true day mare carrying daydreams and pleasant evening dreams much as you have been doing only now it is official and forever whenever we daydream you will be there with your new associates making sure each dream is properly delivered and enjoyed imbri liked the concept she no longer liked bad dreams still she was perplexed my associates now several other mares appeared trotting prettily through the air they were of pleasant colorsred blue green and orange welcome black mare one sent perk ing her ears forward in a friendly fashion oh the day stallion will like you you have such an individual color the day stallion imbri sent an unpleasant associa tion forming a male horse appeared flying winglessly through the air bright golden as the sun i assign the daydreams he sent he swished his tail negligently he was the hand somest stallion imbri had ever seen but you may choose any you like to deliver we are very informal here and seldom take things very seriously this present daydream is an example were all linked together in it and were all helping with it so as to introduce you to the nature of your new work gently all the recent kings of xanth and their friends are sharing it soon they must revert to normal con sciousness to transform the mundane wavers back into men one at a timeking trent transformed them all to stinkweeds and the castle smells awfulto see if theyre ready to swear allegiance to the present order and to see about king trents retirement so he can spend more time with his wife and about king dors permanent assumption of the throne of xanththese things must after all be accomplished with the appropriate ceremonybut first they wanted to see you properly established in your own new employment we have never had a king among our number before but im not king any more imbri protested now mat the real kings have been freed you will retain the honorary title king mare im brium king trent said with a smile you are the one who saved xanth we shall fashion a statue in your like ness and never forget you there was a murmur of agreement from all the others in the collective daydreamher friends suddenly imbri knew she was going to like this duty with that realization she looked up and saw that it was day time had passed between her descent into the void the final breaking of the chain of kings and her reanima tion as a soulhorse now the sun was up but there was a light shower as if the clouds were shedding tears of joy at the salvation of xanth perhaps it was some weather over lapping from her region of the moon the sea of rains there in the bright misty sky was the manycolored rainbow she had always longed to see spanning her hori zon
